00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:15.166
We live in a world
where the collection of data

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.738
is happening 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:20.055
365 days a year.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.053
This data is usually collected by
what we call a front-desk specialist now.

00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:28.197
These are the retail clerks
at your favorite department stores,

00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:30.664
the cashiers at the grocery stores,

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:33.293
the registration specialists
at the hospital

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:36.431
and even the person that sold you
your last movie ticket.

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:40.783
They ask discreet questions, like:
"May I please have your zip code?"

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.918
Or, "Would you like to use
your savings card today?"

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:46.678
All of which gives us data.

00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:51.289
However, the conversation
becomes a little bit more complex

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:54.631
when the more difficult questions
need to be asked.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.448
Let me tell you a story, see.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.768
Once upon a time, there was
a woman named Miss Margaret.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.943
Miss Margaret had been
a front-desk specialist

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:03.427
for almost 20 years.

00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.268
And in all that time, she has never,
and I do mean never,

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:10.812
had to ask a patient their gender,
race or ethnicity.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:14.059
Because, see, now Miss Margaret
has the ability to just look at you.

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:15.241
Uh-huh.

00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:18.042
And she can tell
if you are a boy or a girl,

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.303
black or white, American or non-American.

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:24.565
And in her mind,
those were the only categories.

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:26.605
So imagine that grave day,

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:31.522
when her sassy supervisor invited her
to this "change everything" meeting

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:35.180
and told her that would have to ask
each and every last one of her patients

00:01:35.204 --> 00:01:36.609
to self-identify.

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:41.403
She gave her six genders,
eight races and over 100 ethnicities.

00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:44.015
Well, now, Miss Margaret was appalled.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.436
I mean, highly offended.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.791
So much so that she marched down
to that human-resource department

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.339
to see if she was eligible
for an early retirement.

00:01:51.363 --> 00:01:53.323
And she ended her rant by saying

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:58.217
that her sassy supervisor invited her
to this "change everything" meeting

00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:00.265
and didn't, didn't, even, even

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.317
bring, bring food, food, food, food.

00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:04.495
(Laughter)

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:09.586
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.115
You know you've got to bring food
to these meetings.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.482
(Laughter)

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:16.665
Anyway.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.197
(Laughter)

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.990
Now, that was an example
of a healthcare setting,

00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:24.347
but of course, all businesses
collect some form of data.

00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:27.513
True story: I was going
to wire some money.

00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:30.720
And the customer service
representative asked me

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:33.078
if I was born in the United States.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.800
Now, I hesitated to answer her question,

00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:38.954
and before she even realized
why I hesitated,

00:02:38.978 --> 00:02:41.993
she began to throw the company
she worked for under the bus.

00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:47.089
She said, "Girl, I know it's stupid,
but they makin' us ask this question."

00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:48.264
(Laughter)

00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:50.361
Because of the way she presented it to me,

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:51.985
I was like, "Girl, why?

00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.791
Why they makin' you ask this question?

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:56.617
Is they deportin' people?"

00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:58.783
(Laughter)

00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:01.029
But then I had to turn on
the other side of me,

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:03.621
the more professional
speaker-poet side of me.

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:08.314
The one that understood that there were
little Miss Margarets all over the place.

00:03:08.871 --> 00:03:11.839
People who were good people,
maybe even good employees,

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:14.415
but lacked the ability
to ask their questions properly

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.974
and unfortunately, that made her look bad,

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:20.244
but the worst, that made
the business look even worse

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:21.934
than how she was looking.

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:24.003
Because she had no idea who I was.

00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:27.712
I mean, I literally could have been
a woman who was scheduled to do a TED Talk

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:29.514
and would use her as an example.

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:30.838
Imagine that.

00:03:30.862 --> 00:03:35.124
(Applause)

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.331
And unfortunately,

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:39.250
what happens is people would decline
to answer the questions,

00:03:39.274 --> 00:03:41.783
because they feel like
you would use the information

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:43.232
to discriminate against them,

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.647
all because of how you presented
the information.

00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.449
And at that point, we get bad data.

00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:49.584
And everybody knows what bad data does.

00:03:49.608 --> 00:03:52.401
Bad data costs you time,
it costs you money

00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:54.371
and it costs you resources.

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:56.958
Unfortunately, when you have bad data,

00:03:56.982 --> 00:04:00.061
it also costs you a lot more,

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:02.480
because we have health disparities,

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.718
and we have social determinants of health,

00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:06.400
and we have the infant mortality,

00:04:06.424 --> 00:04:09.067
all of which depends
on the data that we collect,

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.339
and if we have bad data,
than we have those issues still.

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:14.262
And we have underprivileged populations

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:17.077
that remain unfortunate
and underprivileged,

00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:21.027
because the data that we're using
is either outdated,

00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:24.344
or is not good at all
or we don't have anything at all.

00:04:24.987 --> 00:04:27.623
Now, wouldn't it be amazing
if people like Miss Margaret

00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:30.797
and the customer-service
representative at the wiring place

00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:35.195
were graced to collect data
with compassionate care?

00:04:35.562 --> 00:04:37.879
Can I explain to you
what I mean by "graced?"

00:04:38.324 --> 00:04:39.990
I wrote an acrostic poem.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.073
G: Getting the front desk specialist
involved and letting them know

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:49.050
R: the Relevance of their role
as they become

00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:52.605
A: Accountable for the accuracy
of data while implementing

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.673
C: Compassionate care within
all encounters by becoming

00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:59.998
E: Equipped with the education
needed to inform people

00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:03.315
of why data collection is so important.

00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:07.264
(Applause)

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:09.384
Now, I'm an artist.

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:11.082
And so what happens with me

00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:13.280
is that when I create
something artistically,

00:05:13.304 --> 00:05:15.227
the trainer in me is awakened as well.

00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:19.323
So what I did was, I began to develop
that acrostic poem into a full training

00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:20.895
entitled "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D."

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.760
Because I remember,
being the front-desk specialist,

00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:26.458
and when I went to the office
of equity to start working,

00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:30.037
I was like, "Is that why they asked us
to ask that question?"

00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:31.829
It all became a bright light to me,

00:05:31.853 --> 00:05:35.490
and I realized that I asked people
and I told people about --

00:05:35.514 --> 00:05:38.798
I called them by the wrong gender,
I called them by the wrong race,

00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:40.625
I called them by the wrong ethnicity,

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:42.656
and the environment became hostile,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.964
people was offended and I was frustrated
because I was not graced.

00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:49.575
I remember my computerized training,

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:55.225
and unfortunately, that training did not
prepare me to deescalate a situation.

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.625
It did not prepare me to have
teachable moments when I had questions

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:00.307
about asking the questions.

00:06:00.331 --> 00:06:03.895
I would look at the computer and say,
"So, what do I do when this happens?"

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.777
And the computer would say ...

00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:09.069
nothing, because a computer
cannot talk back to you.

00:06:09.093 --> 00:06:12.300
(Laughter)

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:14.895
So that's the importance
of having someone there

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.696
who was trained to teach you
and tell you what you do

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.410
in situations like that.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.656
So, when I created
the "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D" training,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.674
I created it with that experience
that I had in mind,

00:06:25.698 --> 00:06:28.214
but also that conviction
that I had in mind.

00:06:28.238 --> 00:06:30.491
Because I wanted
the instructional design of it

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.293
to be a safe space
for open dialogue for people.

00:06:33.317 --> 00:06:35.212
I wanted to talk about biases,

00:06:35.236 --> 00:06:37.633
the unconscious ones
and the conscious ones,

00:06:37.657 --> 00:06:38.823
and what we do.

00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:42.791
Because now I know
that when you engage people in the why,

00:06:42.815 --> 00:06:46.291
it challenges their perspective,
and it changes their attitudes.

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:49.474
Now I know that data
that we have at the front desk

00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:54.311
translates into research that eliminates
disparities and finds cures.

00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:58.041
Now I know that teaching people
transitional change

00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:00.911
instead of shocking them into change

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:04.190
is always a better way
of implementing change.

00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:07.260
See, now I know people are more likely
to share information

00:07:07.284 --> 00:07:11.143
when they are treated with respect
by knowledgeable staff members.

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:14.188
Now I know that you
don't have to be a statistician

00:07:14.212 --> 00:07:17.213
to understand the power
and the purpose of data,

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:21.601
but you do have to treat people
with respect and have compassionate care.

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.450
Now I know that when you've been graced,

00:07:24.474 --> 00:07:27.850
it is your responsibility
to empower somebody else.

00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:30.299
But most importantly, now I know

00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:32.736
that when teaching human beings

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.839
to communicate with other human beings,

00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:39.648
it should be delivered by a human being.

00:07:40.117 --> 00:07:46.909
(Applause)

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:48.782
So when y'all go to work

00:07:48.806 --> 00:07:52.141
and y'all schedule that
"change everything" meeting --

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:53.815
(Laughter)

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:55.354
remember Miss Margaret.

00:07:55.792 --> 00:07:59.611
And don't forget the food, the food,
the food, the food.

00:08:00.103 --> 00:08:01.254
Thank you.

00:08:01.278 --> 00:08:06.753
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:07.952
Thank you.

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:09.571
(Applause)
