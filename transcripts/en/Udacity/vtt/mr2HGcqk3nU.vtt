00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.995
In this example, we're looking at the spread of Syrian refugees to

00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:07.486
neighboring countries during the Syrian uprising in 2011.

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:10.364
There isn't much we can do here other than press play and

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:12.456
watch the story unfold before our eyes.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.185
So let's press.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:18.478
We can scrub through time on the bottom here, and mouse over the line plots to

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:22.706
get more exact numbers, but largely, the author has predetermined how we

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:26.690
view this data set, as a particular narrative that is to be conveyed.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.550
Remembering back to our spectrum,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.907
we see here this is an appropriate use of a author-driven visualization.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.705
The author is trying to impose a strict ordering, the ordering being time,

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.340
and wants us to see how the refugees have

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.410
spread out between the years of 2012 and 2014.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.040
Let's look at a second example.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.680
In this example from the New York Times, we're looking at the Facebook IPO and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.920
how it compares with other IPOs in the last 30 years.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.070
We saw this in lesson one when talking about double encodings.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.010
But now, let's take a look at its narrative structure.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.380
Like the last example, a strict ordering is imposed as we're

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.600
walked through a specific narrative with the above text.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.799
We see here that there are five stages that we're supposed to click through.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.600
As we move through the stages, we see the data stretch and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.860
transform, allowing us to dig deeper into each data point.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.930
Annotations also appear,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.480
drawing our attention to specific data points of interest.
