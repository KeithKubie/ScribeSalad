00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.160
We're asked to multiply
and to simplify.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.790
And we have x squared minus
the principal square root

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.420
of 6 times x squared plus the
principal square root of 2.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.430
And so we really just
have two binomials,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.630
two two-term expressions
that we want to multiply,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.290
and there's multiple
ways to do this.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.100
I'll show you the
more intuitive way,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.990
and then I'll show
you the way it's

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.420
taught in some
algebra classes, which

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.070
might be a little bit
faster, but requires

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.278
a little bit of memorization.

00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:26.320
So I'll show you the
intuitive way first.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.520
So if you have
anything-- so let's say

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.400
I have a times x
plus y-- we know

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.960
from the distributive
property that this

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.230
is the same thing as ax plus ay.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.980
And so we can do the
same thing over here.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.810
If you view a as x squared--
as this whole expression

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.400
over here-- x squared minus
the principal square root of 6,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.219
and you view x plus y
as this thing over here,

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.010
you can distribute.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.580
We can distribute all
of this onto-- let

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.880
me do it this way-- distribute
this entire term onto this term

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.580
and onto that term.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.670
So let's do that.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.470
So we get x squared minus
the principal square root

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.690
of 6 times this term-- I'll do
it in yellow-- times x squared.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.515
And then we have plus
this thing again.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:18.640
We're just distributing it.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.590
It's just like they say.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.964
It's sometimes
not that intuitive

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:22.550
because this is
a big expression,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.300
but you can treat it just like
you would treat a variable over

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.800
here.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.840
You're distributing it over
this expression over here.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.730
And so then we have x squared
minus the principal square root

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.225
of 6 times the principal
square root of 2.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.290
And now we can do the
distributive property again,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.760
but what we'll do is we'll
distribute this x squared

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.810
onto each of these terms and
distribute the square root of 2

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.360
onto each of these terms.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.960
It's the exact
same thing as here,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.230
it's just you could imagine
writing it like this.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.770
x plus y times a is still
going to be ax plus ay.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.598
And just to see the pattern, how
this is really the same thing

00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:09.139
as this up here,
we're just switching

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.620
the order of the multiplication.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.350
You can kind of view it as we're
distributing from the right.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.590
And so if you do this, you
get x squared times x squared,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.060
which is x to the fourth,
that's that times that, and then

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.355
minus x squared times the
principal square root of 6.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.980
And then over here you
have square root of 2 times

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.570
x squared, so plus x squared
times the square root of 2.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.360
And then you have square root
of 2 times the square root of 6.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.440
And we have a negative
sign out here.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.106
Now if you take the
square root of 2--

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:44.980
let me do this on the
side-- square root of 2

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.680
times the square root of 6, we
know from simplifying radicals

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.780
that this is the exact same
thing as the square root of 2

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.502
times 6, or the principal
square root of 12.

00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:57.460
So the square root of 2
times square root of 6,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.835
we have a negative
sign out here,

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:02.290
it becomes minus the
square root of 12.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.171
And let's see if we can
simplify this at all.

00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:05.670
Let's see.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.320
You have an x to
the fourth term.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.731
And then here you
have-- well depending

00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:12.730
on how you want to view
it, you could say, look,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.160
we have to second degree terms.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.860
We have something
times x squared,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.970
and we have something
else times x squared.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.970
So if you want,
you could simplify

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.820
these two terms over here.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.436
So I have square
root of 2 x squareds

00:03:25.436 --> 00:03:27.810
and then I'm going to subtract
from that square root of 6

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.960
x squareds.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.490
So you could view this
as square root of 2

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.510
minus the square root of 6, or
the principal square root of 2

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.260
minus the principal square
root of 6, x squared.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.010
And then, if you want,
square root of 12,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.560
you might be able
to simplify that.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.500
12 is the same
thing as 3 times 4.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.050
So the square root of 12
is equal to square root

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.712
of 3 times square root of 4.

00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:57.170
And the square root of 4, or
the principal square root of 4

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.761
I should say, is 2.

00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:00.510
So the square root of
12 is the same thing

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.620
as 2 square roots of 3.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.900
So instead of writing the
principal square root of 12,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.900
we could write minus 2 times
the principal square root of 3.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.910
And then out here you have
an x to the fourth plus this.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.950
And you see, if you
distributed this out,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.240
if you distribute this x
squared, you get this term,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.997
negative x squared,
square root of 6,

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:22.330
and if you distribute it onto
this, you'd get that term.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.310
So you could debate which
of these two is more simple.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.080
Now I mentioned
that this way I just

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.580
did the distributive
property twice.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.820
Nothing new, nothing fancy.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.380
But in some classes, you will
see something called FOIL.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.040
And I think we've done
this in previous videos.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.540
FOIL.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.500
I'm not a big fan of
it because it's really

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.002
a way to memorize a process
as opposed to understanding

00:04:44.002 --> 00:04:46.460
that this is really just from
the common-sense distributive

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.269
property.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:48.810
But all this is is
a way to make sure

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.476
that you're multiplying
everything times

00:04:50.476 --> 00:04:52.570
everything when
you're multiplying

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.290
two binomials times
each other like this.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.370
And FOIL just says, look,
first multiply the first term.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.160
So x squared times x
squared is x to the fourth.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.670
Then multiply the outside.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.100
So then multiply--
I'll do this in green--

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.360
then multiply the outside.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.302
So the outside terms are x
squared and square root of 2.

00:05:14.302 --> 00:05:16.010
And so x squared times
square root of 2--

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.210
and they are positive-- so
plus square root of 2 times x

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.040
squared.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.702
And then multiply the inside.

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:25.160
And you can see
why I don't like it

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.730
that much is because you
really don't know you're doing.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.710
You're just applying
an algorithm.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.809
Then you'll multiply the inside.

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:32.850
And so negative square
root of 6 times x squared.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.304
And then you multiply
the last terms.

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:42.470
So negative square root of
6 times square root of 2,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.490
that is-- and we
already know that-- that

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.020
is negative square root of
12, which you can also then

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.920
simplify to that expression
right over there.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.910
So it's fine to use
this, although it's good,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.930
even if you do use this, to
know where FOIL comes from.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.640
It really just comes from
using the distributive property

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.190
twice.
