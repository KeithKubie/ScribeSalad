In many cases, we ask users to
type out the same information,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.960
even when the website
has their information.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.220
For example, think about name, address,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.260
telephone number, email,
credit card, etc.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.730
Would it be cool to offer a shortcut
that saves time, typing, and money?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.220
You know, retailers often use past
orders to suggest future inputs.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.800
Because once they've
already collected and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.400
saved your address why ask for it again?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it makes life less
frustrating for your users.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.420
It also a good idea to ask permission.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.830
For example Amazon ask
which saves address to use.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.060
But be careful.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.860
If your application fills in too much,
users might get the wrong information.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.320
For example, shipping your
package to the wrong address.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.640
Remember, reusing information
will make your forms faster.
