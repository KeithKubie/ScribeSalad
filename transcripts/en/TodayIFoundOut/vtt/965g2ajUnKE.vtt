00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:12.499
Due to the fact that they can’t move and
as such can’t sneak up on you, many people

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.129
never really think of trees as being dangerous.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.600
As it turns out though, beyond the occasional
tree that kills a person by falling on them,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.870
there’s also a tree out there so deadly
it has been dubbed “The Suicide Tree”.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.140
But as you’ll soon see, “The Murder Tree”,
is just as apt a name.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.140
Cerbera odollam is a small hardwood tree (see,
How Do They Differentiate Between Hardwood

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.140
and Softwood Trees?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.360
really, that title sounds boring and obvious
but it’s actually not what you think and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.770
is super fascinating; I promise…) that can,
under favourable conditions grow to around

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.350
10 metres in height and is endemic to India
and south-east Asia.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.640
Despite its unassuming appearance, the tree
hides a deadly secret inside of the husk that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.940
contains its seeds.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.400
These seeds contain a cardiac glycoside called,
cerberin.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.710
Cerberin is incredibly toxic in relatively
low dosages, often killing its victims within

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.860
a few hours, during which time they may suffer
crippling stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.670
heart rhythm, vomiting and sometimes a splitting
headache.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.990
Eventually, once enough of it accumulates
in your system, the cerberin will succeed

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.680
in completely inhibiting the cellular “sodium/potassium
pump” enzyme (Na+/K+-ATPase), screwing with

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.930
the heart’s electrical system and ultimately
stopping it dead, very similar to how lethal

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.060
injections in the United States work.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.060
(See: How the Heart Works and Why Proper Sterilization
Procedures are Used During Lethal Injections)

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.830
And for reference, a single cerbera odollam
seed contains a lethal dose of cerberin for

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.640
a typical adult human.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.590
Cerbera-OddloamWhile accidental ingestion
of the inner seed is not completely unheard

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.780
of, due to the fruit produced by the cerbera
odollam being edible, if a little bitter,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.799
it is commonly used for murder and suicide
in Indian coastal towns which border the sort

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.240
of marshy swampland the tree likes to grow
in.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.480
Exactly how many people are killed each year
due to someone having their food intentionally

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.340
spiked with cerbera odollam seeds isn’t
clear because the poison produced by it doesn’t

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.570
show up on normal toxicology reports, and
is relatively unknown in many regions of the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.570
world.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.509
This has led some experts, such as French
Toxicologist Yvan Gaillard, who published

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.250
the results of a decade long study on this
very topic in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.280
to describe the plant as being “perfect”
for murder.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.370
You see, most toxicologists, even if they’ve
heard of the plant, will only test for cerberin

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.590
poisoning if there’s a strong suspicion
the victim consumed something containing it

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.050
prior to their death, because testing for
cerberin poisoning is rather costly and requires

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.860
the use of “high-performance liquid chromatography
coupled with mass spectrometry” to detect

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.030
with any degree of certainty- something that
is not an option in many regions anyway.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.950
Of course, those toxicologists who haven’t
heard of it would never know to check.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.660
Because of this, the amount of deaths caused
by cerbera odollam poisoning is uncertain.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.150
That said, based on the documented instances
that are known (which likely make up a small

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.370
percentage of the actual total), the plant
is responsible for at least a death per week

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.380
in the South Indian state of Kerala alone,
where the plant grows wild and in abundance

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.690
and is responsible for an estimated 50% of
plant poisoning cases annually in the region.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.640
You might wonder why a person being poisoned
with such a seed wouldn’t taste it, given

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.190
its bitter flavour, but the seeds can easily
be masked by putting them into a dish containing

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.180
something like chilies that are prevalent
in Indian cuisine.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.040
The taste can also be masked with sugar, and
the vast majority of suicides committed via

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.710
ingestion of the seeds is done by removing
the seed from the outer husk, then crushing

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.430
and mixing it with raw cane sugar.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.849
“Just a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine
go down” and all that.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.743
Not the most pleasant way to die, but given
it’s freely available in places like Kerala,

00:03:36.743 --> 00:03:40.530
and has a relatively certain outcome, it remains
extremely popular.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.830
Interestingly, with the limited data we do
have (including suicides and murders), it’s

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.349
noted that 75% of people who die via ingesting
the cerbera odollam seeds are women.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.170
Researchers at the Laboratory of Analytical
Toxicology in La Voulte-sur-Rhône speculate

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.170
that this massive gender discrepancy is because
the plant is being used to poison newly married

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.610
wives “who do not meet the exacting standards
of some Indian families“.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.980
However, beyond the murders, young women are
also statistically much more likely to use

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.170
the cerbera odollam seeds to commit suicide;
such was the case in May of 2015 when four

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.900
young girls consumed cerbera odollam seeds
as part of a suicide pact after being abused

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.979
at an athletic training camp.

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.360
That said, it should be noted that in the
Western world, while about four men will commit

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.319
suicide for every one woman, nearly three
times as many women as men will attempt to

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.699
kill themselves.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.469
If the popular method of suicide in the Western
world was using something like cerbera odollam

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:39.789
seeds where death is almost certain, it could
potentially skew those tragic numbers significantly

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.400
to be somewhat more inline with the Laboratory
of Analytical Toxicologies data for Kerala,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400
India.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.289
Whatever the case, the prominent use of this
plant in suicides and murders has led to local

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.889
governments trying to find new uses for this
natural resource.

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.460
Particularly in impoverished areas, if the
seeds have marketable uses, it’s literally

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.220
money growing on trees for any of the populace
who wants it, making the seeds less readily

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.339
available as they’re harvested en masse-
so less death and more money in the local

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:10.339
economy.

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:15.300
Towards this end, in recent years the seeds
have begun being harvested for use in various

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.439
products like bio-insecticides and rat poison,
among other things.

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.819
In Kerala, where the plant is responsible
for more deaths than anywhere else on Earth,

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.119
locals can earn a decent living dehusking
the plant with their bare hands in various

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:30.729
processing yards across the state.

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.930
We bet lunch hour at those places is really
tense…

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.759
You’ll note that we said that ingesting
the seeds is a “relatively” certain way

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.759
to die.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.160
Modern medical science being pretty amazing,
there are methods to counteract the poison’s

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160
effects.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.569
For instance, a 51 year old woman in Maryland
decided ingesting the seeds of the cerbera

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:53.319
odollam would be a good way to shuffle off
this mortal coil, so she ordered some on eBay,

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.580
ground them up and ate them.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.020
However, she must have changed her mind after
the fact, because when the effects of the

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.340
poison started kicking in and it got real,
she rushed herself to the emergency room,

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.349
at which point her heart rate was a scant
30 beats per minute.

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.440
The medical staff were stumped.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.340
They at first thought she’d been the victim
of digoxin poisoning, which has similar effects,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.819
but the labs said no.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.971
With death looming, she finally admitted what
she’d done and the doctors decided to try

00:06:15.971 --> 00:06:22.330
administering twenty vials of digoxin immune
FAB at a whopping $500-$700 per vial.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.949
It worked and she later walked out of the
hospital with a clean bill of health, hopefully

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.659
receiving some counseling or other help to
go along with what the miracle workers in

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:31.659
the hospital did.

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.481
(Note: The suicide hotline number in the United
States is: 1-800-273-8255, and in the UK it’s

00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:35.481
+44 (0) 8457 90 90 90.)

00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.050
In the 19th century, the fruit of the cerbera
odollam was used in Madagascar (a place it

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.749
is also known to grow) to test a person’s
innocence.

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:44.619
Those committed of a crime were sometimes
required to eat the fruit to prove their innocence

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:47.389
and if they survived they were free to go.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:57.039
Because a single seed of the fruit is enough
to kill, this invariably led to a lot 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:13.769
of “guilty” individuals.
