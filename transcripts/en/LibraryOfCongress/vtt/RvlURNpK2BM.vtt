00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.170
From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.710
Docent: Welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.200
Dr. Hayden: We are opening
up the Library of Congress,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.250
our treasure chest, to everyone.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.420
Opening up means we are
making it accessible.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.080
Travis Painter: At the
Library, we offer tactile tours

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.380
and visually-described tours.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.290 position:56%
So walking over where we see Thomas
Jefferson's bust standing three feet

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.600 position:56%
high, we're able to describe
that-watching people put their hands

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.020
on the bust and connect
with a piece that otherwise

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900
that they would not
have the opportunity to.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.770 position:56%
Vicki Radcliffe: When you are blind,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.490
being able to touch some
things makes a real difference

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.560
in how you are able to perceive it.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.170
And the descriptions are very
good that the docents are giving.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.470
Docent: This is the pedestal.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.920
Dr. Hayden: The Library of Congress
is the world's largest library,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.680
and as a result, should be a
leader and a model for everyone.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.240
Access to the Library's collections
is one of our primary goals.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.000
And access means accessibility.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.610
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
