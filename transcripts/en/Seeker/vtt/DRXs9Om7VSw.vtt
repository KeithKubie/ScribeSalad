00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.380
As the definition of marriage changes, so
do people’s thoughts on whether or not it’s

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.820
something they actually want for their future.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.760
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it should
be obvious by now, that gender roles have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.640
been drastically changing the past few decades.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.109
We have more working mothers, more stay-at-home
dads, and according to a new study - people

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.330
are getting married later and later.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.949
Since 1970, every new generation of young
adults has become less and less likely to

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:31.949
get married.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.520
In 1960, only 8% of women and 10% of men over
the age of 25, had never been married.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.180
But in 2012, those numbers rose to 17% of
women and 23% of men.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.180
So what’s going on here?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.780
Are people just get married later?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.320
Well, that’s definitely part of it.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.760
But it’s not the entire reason.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.930
The Pew Research Center, which published this
report last week, projects that a quarter

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.600
of today’s young adults still won’t be
married by the year 2030 - making it the highest

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.039
number in modern history.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.340
A lot of the blame seems to fall on the socioeconomic
gap that’s widening here in America.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.939
According to Pew’s research, educated, high-income
people are still marrying at high rates and

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.549
continuing to stay married.

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.029
For the most part, it’s the low-income people,
as well as blacks and the young - that are

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:19.289
actively choosing to forgo marriage.

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.409
At least part of that, can be attributed to
unemployment rates.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.499
The number of unemployed men ages 24-54 has
been steadily increasing over the past 50

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:29.499
years.

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:34.429
And yet 78% of unmarried women, still say
that a steady job is the single most important

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.240
quality a spouse can have.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.169
Black women in particular, place an even higher
importance on marrying someone employed.

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:45.700
But as I said before, economic differences
aside - gender roles do still have a lot to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.700
do with it.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.489
In his 1974 piece “A Theory of Marriage,”
Nobel-winning economist Gary Becker explains

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:55.529
how up until the 1970s, marriage was mostly
an economic equation.

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.469
Men went to work to earn money, so they could
support a family, while their wife ran the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.469
household.

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.009
But as author and historian Stephanie Coontz
points out, in the modern era - with the rise

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.629
of technology, birth control, and higher numbers
of women entering the workforce - marriage

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.629
has transitioned.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.849
It’s less about economics now, and more
about actual love.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.489
Of course, nowadays even the definition of
love can be nebulous.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.849
So as people continue to place less of an
emphasis on marriage, maybe it’s time our

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.610
nation’s policies thought about changing,
too.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.760
What do you guys think?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.730
Especially you young folk out there - do you
see marriage as a necessary part of your future?

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.659

always, thank you guys for watching!
