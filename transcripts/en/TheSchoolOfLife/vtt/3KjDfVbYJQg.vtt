00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.260
One of the things that makes human beings great

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.280
is our astonishing capacity to learn

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.280
we are always picking up new things

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.360
and correcting earlier errors

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.160
but there is one area where it seems so hard

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.560
to acquire new knowledge and change

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.600
emotional life

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.840
It's one with very small children

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.720
between our first day and around our 8th year

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.460
that our emotional hard drives are encoded

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.840
and it's in this period that we learn

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
whether we can trust

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.420
whether we like ourselves

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.120
whether we can be open

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.420
where blame belongs

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.360
what to do when the world hurts us

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.120
how much we can tell others of what distresses us

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.820
what degree of directness can be tolerated

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.440
and how much of our naughtiness

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.480
and excitement

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.560
can be witnessed and forgiven

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920
unfortunately for human kind

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.300
a catastrophic amount can go wrong here

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.260
despite all the improvements in early infant care

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.380
that has taken place in last century

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.820
without anyone really meaning for this to happen

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.800
it remains pretty easy

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.380
to pick up some really unhealthful lessons

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.680
in this early years

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.520
way before we really understand

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.640
what's going on

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.920
we may acquire a lack of trust

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.300
an excesive fear of humilation

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.380
a deep shame about our bodies

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.280
there are indirect patterns of communicating

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.860
and an inability

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.380
either to be close to someone

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.220
or tolerate a measure of distance from them

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.640
we might assume that this failures can simply get corrected

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.800
just like an early error when doing quadratic equations

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.780
and yet we're likely to realise

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.440
especially the older we get

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.940
how stubbornly encoded the faults in the hard drive really are

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.680
this can feel absurd and humilating

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.620
there is an understandbly impatient view

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.960
that one should've caused

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.780
get over one's childhood

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.620
we're liable to get impatient

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480
with people who may be close to fifty

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.440
and still talking in wounded terms about their parents

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.480
now long dead

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.880
who said something a little humilating to them decades ago

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.220
but this impatient brusqueness

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.060
with the patterns lay down in childhood is no good

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.860
it may simply be wisest to accept that

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.860
there will at points be a furious

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.060
unhinged inner five year old

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.800
who's gonna take charge of us

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.440
refuse to seed the controls

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.560
in an attempt to cause mayhem

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.520
we should know that we can be enduringly

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.480
and deeply wounded by the past

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.060
and should therefore when we can manage it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.400
fine words to wound those we care about

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.040
what living with us is actually going to mean

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.500
The great learning in 20th century psychology

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.260
which is still being only patchily assimilated

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.860
is that those early years are emotionally speaking simply everything

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.240
it would be so much easier if it weren't like this

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.340
but the die is cast then that can almost never be reshaped

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.800
we are more or less the life-long prisoners of dinamics

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.940
that may've been set in motion half of century ago

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.220
by parents who weren't even mean just under in a pressure

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.760
it's a sobering situation that cause for humility

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.780
forgiveness, constant vigilence over one's own conduct

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.860
polite warnings to others and a very black sense of humor
