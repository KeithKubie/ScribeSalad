 - Ugh, straight white
 men, am I right?

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:04.070
 - But you're--

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:04.737
 - Your sista.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.605 line:0%
 - No.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.773 line:0%
- Stop!

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.674
 You've participated
 in a trolling cliche.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:10.476 size:84% position:42%
  One degree of separation.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.178
 You're a straight white woman,

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.113 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and that makes
 you uncomfortable,
 because you're just

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.216
 a woe away from being
 a straight white man.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.452 size:84% position:42%
  You're only one rung down
  on the privilege pyramid,

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:20.653 size:88% position:44%
  so what do you do?

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.622 align:start size:88% position:13%
Do you go to Bangladesh
to help orphans?

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.058
 Do you give all your
 money to the NAACP?

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.526 size:88% position:44%
  No, of course not.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.695
 You log on and start talking
 shit about straight white men

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.831 align:start position:0%
  hoping that all the people
  of color in the world

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.667 size:88% position:44%
 will scream, "We knew you
 were one of the good ones,"

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.269
but you're not.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.271 size:88% position:44%
 You're one of the annoying
 ones, and I'm the right guy

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.842 size:84% position:42%
  to tell you that, 'cause
  I'm a straight white man.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.612
