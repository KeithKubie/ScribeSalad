00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And you put the point to say that is this last one, all the way at the end.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This corresponds to the mass having fully compressed the spring and again

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's stopping with 0 velocity for just that instant.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These other three points don't really make sense because they correspond to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
since they're on this horizontal line here--this is the line of 0 velocity.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Anytime the mass is in between these extreme points of Xmax and -Xmax,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
well it's going to be moving--so this doesn't make sense.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will also tell you that when the object is swinging through so let's say

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
it's coming from this end and swinging through equilibrium.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When it goes through the equilibrium point, its velocity is maximized.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's going very fast, as fast as it'll ever will go but will in this case it's going to the left.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Leftwards means negative, so that will correspond to this point.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We've already talked about what happens--it's going to compress the spring,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
stop for a second, and then swing back through.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
When it get through equilibrium on the swing through, well then it's going to the right

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
with maximum speed again corresponds to this point.
