SPEAKER 1: If you're
an AdMob publisher,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.100
you're probably aware
that AdMob reporting just

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.170
got a lot smarter thanks
to its integration

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.250
with Google Analytics
for Firebase.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.910
But one thing you
might not know is

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.510
that AdMob's reports
have stable URLs, which

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.260
means they can be bookmarked.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.532
So if you find yourself
reading the same four or five

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:24.990
clicks every day just to get
back to that one report that's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.160
set up just the way you like,
slap a bookmark on that sucker

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.540
and you can save a little time.
