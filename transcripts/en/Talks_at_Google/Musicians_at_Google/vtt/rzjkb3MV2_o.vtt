NEIL GAIMAN: Thank you
so much for having us.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.170
It's always fun to do
these Google things.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.380
It's always
particular fun for me

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.455
when I'm out at Mountain View
because my little boy-- who

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:37.161
is not actually a little
boy, he's 6 foot 2 and 30,

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:38.880
but in my head,
he's my little boy--

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.400
is actually one of you,
which is terrifying.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.940
So, right.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.740
We figured out
the running order,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.130
and tossed dice to see who
goes first, and it's me.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.650
So I'm going to
begin with a poem,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.040
and it's about an
awful lot of things.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.740
I love the fact that
this poem is now--

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.160
people send me messages on
Twitter saying that they read

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.280
it at weddings, and
other people seem

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.550
to regard it as a poem
about upset and ignorance.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.840
And I think, probably,
it's about a lot of things,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.826
including getting off
your phone some time.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:45.330
But it's called "The
Day The Saucers Came."

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.890
That day the saucers
landed, hundreds of them,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.720
golden, silent, coming down from
the sky like great snowflakes.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.380
And the people of Earth stood
and stared as they descended,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.190
waiting, dry-mouthed to find
what waited inside for us,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.410
and none of us knowing if
we would be here tomorrow.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.010
But you didn't notice
it because that day,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.080
the day the saucers came, by
some coincidence was the day

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.720
that the graves
gave up their dead

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.140
and the zombies pushed up
through soft earth, or erupted,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.740
shambling and
dull-eyed, unstoppable,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.200
came towards us, the living,
and we screamed and ran.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.250
But you did not notice
this, because, on the saucer

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.810
day, which was the zombie
day, it was Ragnarok also.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.403
And the television
screens showed us

00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:42.390
a ship built of dead men's
nails, a serpent, a wolf,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.280
all bigger than the
mind could hold,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.560
and the cameraman could
not get far enough away.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.410
And then the gods came out.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.720
But you did not see them
coming because, on the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.190
saucer-zombie-battling-gods day,
the floodgates broke and each

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.890
of us was engulfed by genies
and sprites offering us wishes

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.690
and wonders and eternities and
charm and cleverness and true,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.540
brave hearts and pots of gold,
while giants feefofummed across

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.890
the land, and killer bees.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.120
But you had no idea
of any of this,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.140
because that day, the
saucer day, the zombie day,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.540
the Ragnarok and fairies
day, the day the great winds

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.150
came, and snows, and the
cities turned to crystal,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.420
the day all plants died,
plastics dissolved,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.340
the day the computers turned,
the screens telling us we

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.080
would obey, the day
angels, drunk and muddled,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.515
stumbled from the bars and
all the bells of London

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.950
were sounded, the day animals
spoke to us in Assyrian,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.250
the Yeti day, the
fluttering capes and arrival

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.510
of the time machine day.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.930
You didn't notice any
of this because you

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.580
were sitting in your room
not doing anything, not

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.240
even reading, not really, just
looking at your telephone,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.760
wondering if I
was going to call.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.470
So, the next thing
that's going to happen

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.980
is Amanda is going
to play a song.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.960
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah,
and you should intro it,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.550
but we should tell them
about the recording

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.550
and why this all
happened, maybe.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.070
Or should we just
not bother with that?

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.690
We made a record,
kind of by accident.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.440
We went on a tour and
decided to record it

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.470
and that's what this record is.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.970
And--

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.650
NEIL GAIMAN: Yeah,
there is a record

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.983
called, "An Evening With Neil
Gaiman and Amanda Palmer."

00:04:31.983 --> 00:04:36.340
Three discs-- one of me,
one of her, one of us.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.890
And this is a song
that's actually

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.980
on the "us" one, because
on the record I sing it,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.530
but Amanda's going to be
singing it now because--

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.870
AMANDA PALMER: He's nervous!

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.960
NEIL GAIMAN: She has a much,
much prettier voice than I do.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.918
AMANDA PALMER: I think
your voice is beautiful.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.740
NEIL GAIMAN: And it was
a song that, actually,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.300
is kind of relevant
to everybody here.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.890
And it began when I started
thinking about torch songs,

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.450
because classic torch songs
are, basically, conversations

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.000
that you have with a bartender
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.940
smoking a cigarette,
not wanting to go home

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.980
with your heart broken.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.870
And I thought-- that
doesn't happen anymore.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.875
You can't smoke in bars.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.615
And if your heart
is broken, you're

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.890
not going to be in a bar at
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.931
You're going to be doing
something else entirely.

PALMER, "I GOOGLE YOU"]

00:09:02.095 --> 00:09:03.136
AMANDA PALMER: Thank you.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.110
So that song was
actually written by Neil,

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.590
and I heard it in the best way.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.380
It was the first week that
we actually met and hung out.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.960
We weren't dating yet, this
was, like, five years ago.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.170
And he came to stay
at my house for a week

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.850
while we were working on
this book project together.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.350
And I don't remember how it
came up, but we started chatting

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.000
and he mentioned
that he'd written

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.830
a song for a cabaret
singer to sing,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.770
and I said, well,
just sing it for me.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.170
And he went, I
can't, I can't sing.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:46.720
And then he opened his mouth
and just sang it a cappella,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.470
and I couldn't believe what
a beautiful voice he had.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.768
And he's a pretty
clever writer, too.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.100
Anyway, so I put
some chords under it

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.390
and that was sort of like
our first weird little thing

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.000
that we did together.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.230
And I'm going to play
you one of mine now,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.506
and then Neil's going to read.

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:12.880
I was thinking about maybe
taking requests from you guys,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.310
but I thought that that
might just get really weird.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.504
Because, also, I'm only
going to play one song.

00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:18.920
So I was just
standing back there,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.687
wondering what
would actually work.

00:10:24.687 --> 00:10:26.520
There's a song I was
practicing for the show

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.350
tonight that I
think would be good.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.460
It might be a little sloppy,
but it's on the record

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.050
so-- I thought that
would be relevant.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.060
And it's a song that
I wrote a couple years

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:49.750
ago about all these
journalists asking me

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.510
who my influences are.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.980
And especially-- I
get asked a lot, who

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.580
are your female influences.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.580
And I realized I'd been
thinking about it really

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.905
narrowly, and
especially the more you

00:10:59.905 --> 00:11:01.780
give the answer to the
question, you're like,

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.934
OK-- Laurie Anderson,
and Madonna,

00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:05.350
and la di di di
di-- all this shit

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.580
that I listened to
when I was a kid.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.530
And you start just having a
fucking laundry list of people.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.900
And it occurred to me, actually,
in the middle of the night

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.160
one night, that I was
leaving out this giant one,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.440
and it struck me as
actually so important

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.210
I decided to write
a song about it.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.216
So this is it.

00:17:56.344 --> 00:17:58.260
NEIL GAIMAN: So at the
beginning of this year,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:05.500
I tried an experiment, with
BlackBerry sponsoring me.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.840
I went to Twitter, threw
out 12 questions on Twitter,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:16.060
and got hundreds and
thousands of replies back.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:21.240
And then picked the replies--
picked 12 replies pretty much

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.940
at random, and used
them as yogurt starter

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.300
for 12 short stories, one
for each month of the year.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.210
And I made a calendar of tales.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.420
And this is last month's tale.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.390
"That feels good," I said,
and I stretched my neck

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.010
to get out the
last of the cramp.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.120
It didn't just feel good,
it felt great, actually.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.230
I'd been squashed up inside
that lamp for so long.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.760
Tea?"

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760
"Uh..."

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.420
Actually, now she came to
mention it, I was thirsty.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.230
"Do you have any mint tea?"

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.120
She made me some mint
tea in a teapot that

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.760
was almost a twin to the lamp
in which I'd spent the greater

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.450
part of the last thousand years.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.750
"Thank you for the tea." "No
problem." "But I don't get it.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.270
Everyone I've ever met, they
start asking for things.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.230
A fancy house.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.580
A harem of gorgeous
women-- not that you'd

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.280
want that, of course.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.780
"I might," she said.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.715
"You can't just make
assumptions about people.

00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:48.960
Oh, and don't call
me toots, or sweetie,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.190
or any of those things.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.904
My name's Hazel."

00:20:51.904 --> 00:20:53.110
"Ah!"

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.060
I understood.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.640
"You want a
beautiful woman then?

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.390
My apologies.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.790
You have but to wish."

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.510
I folded my arms.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.110
"No," she said. "I'm good.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.620
No wishes.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.260
How's the tea?"

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.720
I told her that the mint tea was
the finest I had ever tasted.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.030
She asked me when I'd
started feeling a need

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.977
to grant people's
wishes, and whether I

00:21:12.977 --> 00:21:14.310
felt a desperate need to please.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.760
She asked about my
mother, and I told her

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.190
that she could not judge me
as you would judge mortals,

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.180
for I was a djinn, powerful and
wise, magical and mysterious.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.550
She asked me if I liked hummus,
and when I said that I did,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.410
she toasted a pita
bread and sliced it up

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.010
for me to dip into the hummus.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.750
I dipped my bread
slices into the hummus

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.910
and ate it with delight.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.870
The hummus gave me an idea.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.770
"Just make a wish,"
I said helpfully,

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.460
"And I could have a meal fit
for a sultan brought in to you.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.500
Each dish would be finer
than the one before,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.310
and all served
upon golden plates.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:57.660
And you could keep the
plates afterwards."

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.200
"It's good," she
said, with a smile.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.630
"Would you like
to go for a walk?"

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.450
We walked together
through the town.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.110
It felt good to stretch my
legs after so many years

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.410
in the lamp.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:11.010
We wound up in a public park,
sitting on a bench by a lake.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.680
It was warm, but gusty, and the
autumn leaves fell in flurries

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.030
each time the wind blew.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.580
I told Hazel about
my youth as a djinn,

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.719
of how we used to
eavesdrop on the angels

00:22:21.719 --> 00:22:23.260
and how they would
throw comets at as

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.740
if they spied us listening.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.050
I told her of the bad
days of the djinn wars,

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.170
and how King Suleiman
had imprisoned us

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.430
inside hollow objects--
bottles, lamps,

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.090
clay pots, that kind of thing.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.690
She told me of her parents,
who were both killed

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.350
in the same plane crash, and
who'd left her the house.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.360
She told me of the job,
illustrating children's books,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.220
a job she'd backed into
accidentally, at the point

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.900
she realized she would
never be a really

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.800
competent medical Illustrator.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.620
And of how happy
she became whenever

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.032
she was sent a new
book to illustrate.

00:22:53.032 --> 00:22:54.490
She told me she
taught life drawing

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.420
to adults at the local community
college one evening a week.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.440
I saw no obvious
flaw in her life,

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.565
no hole she could fill
by wishing, save one.

00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:05.440
"Your life is good,"
I told her. "But you

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.130
have no one to share it with.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.370
Wish, and I will bring
you the perfect man.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.900
Or woman.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.010
A film star.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.310
A rich-- person--" "No need.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.660
I'm good," she said.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.690
We walked back to her
house, past houses

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.140
dressed for Halloween.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.190
"This is not right," I told her.
"People always want things."

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.960
"Not me.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.510
I've got everything I
need." "Then what do I do?"

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.090
She thought for a moment.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.520
Then she pointed
at her front yard.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.400
"Can you rake the leaves?"

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.859
"Is that your wish?" "No.

00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:43.400
Just something you
could do while I'm

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.520
getting our dinner ready."

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.020
I raked the leaves into
a heap by the hedge,

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.100
to stop the wind from
blowing it apart.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.090
After dinner, I
washed up the dishes.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.780
I spent the night in
Hazel's spare bedroom.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.630
It wasn't that she
didn't want help.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.940
She let me help.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.227
I ran errands for her, picked
up art supplies and groceries.

00:24:02.227 --> 00:24:04.060
On days she'd been
painting for a long time,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.230
she let me rub her
neck and shoulders.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.900
I have good, firm hands.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.170
Shortly before Thanksgiving, I
moved out of the spare bedroom,

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:17.210
across the hall, into the
main bedroom, and Hazel's bed.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.780
I watched her face this
morning as she slept.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.300
I stared at the shapes her
lips make when she sleeps.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.050
The creeping sunlight
touched her face,

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:29.070
and she opened her eyes and
stared at me, and she smiled.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:33.660
"You know what I never asked,
she said, "is what about you?"

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.700
"What would you
wish for if I asked

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.430
what your three wishes were?"

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.090
I thought for moment.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.730
I put my arm around her,
and she snuggled her head

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.990
into my shoulder.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.350
"It's OK," I told her.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:25:02.280
"I'm good."

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:07.100
AMANDA PALMER: So, one last
tune for you guys, and then

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.920
and then we'll do questions
and talking and stuff.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.080
And this is also-- all the
stuff we've done here today

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.210
is actually on the record.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.940
Isn't it?

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.920
Or no, except for the
Calendar of Tales.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.770
Yeah, but everything else is.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.650
And so, as you can see, I play
the piano and the ukulele--

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.260
the ukulele not really
as good as the piano.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:37.087
I'm a real fan recently of--
well, it's not a new idea,

00:25:37.087 --> 00:25:39.420
but I think it's great to
play an instrument that you're

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.690
shitty at.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.377
It's very liberating.

00:25:43.377 --> 00:25:44.793
This is sort of a
song about that,

00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:46.844
and it's called "The
Ukulele Anthem."

00:25:46.844 --> 00:25:48.719
[MUSIC - AMANDA PALMER,
"THE UKULELE ANTHEM"]

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:26.040
AMANDA PALMER: Thank you.

00:31:34.775 --> 00:31:37.150
ALAN LIGHT: So let's talk a
little bit about these shows,

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.650
these shows you're
playing and these

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:44.240
shows that you've recorded onto
this "Evening With" record.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.410
Is it more interesting for
you guys to combine your work

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.320
or to combine your audiences?

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.770
NEIL GAIMAN:
Actually, the reason

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:56.330
why we did them was
a little bit of both.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.750
We never get free time.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.770
We're both strangely
busy people.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:09.380
But, in 2011, we suddenly
found ourselves with 11 days

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.810
where we had to start
out in LA, and we

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:17.600
had to finish in Seattle, and
we didn't have anything to do.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.040
And it was amazing.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:25.730
And so, immediately we decided
to fill it by hiring a car

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.710
and just driving
up the west coast.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.649
And we thought, well
we'll have a vacation.

00:32:29.649 --> 00:32:32.190
And then we thought, well, if
we're going to have a vacation,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.390
we'll get on each other's
nerves by day two,

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.220
so we need something to do.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.810
And so that was the idea of
taking little theaters as we

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:44.370
went and just doing
"An Evening With."

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:48.930
And that, of course,
embiggened ridiculously very,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:49.880
very quickly.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.770
But what became fun was
the mingling the audiences.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:56.937
It was like a wedding.

00:32:56.937 --> 00:32:59.270
It was like that sort of --
"are you on the bride's side

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.240
or the groom's side" thing.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.790
And we'd meet people
afterwards at the signings,

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.600
and we'd hang around
and say hello.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.810
And there would be people
who would just ignore me

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:13.892
completely, head over to Amanda
with their Dresden Dolls CDs.

00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:16.100
Then there'd be people who'd
ignore her and come over

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.180
to me with their Sandmans.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.555
And then there'd be the people
who'd just come up and go,

00:33:19.555 --> 00:33:22.320
can't believe you two--
my favorite writer.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.040
Like, aw, this is just the best.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.780
ALAN LIGHT: Given
that you've both

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.619
constructed these lives
that sort of enable

00:33:33.619 --> 00:33:35.160
you to do whatever
you want, whenever

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.850
you want-- it's the remarkable
thing about it-- what is it

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.220
that these shows have
enabled you to do,

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:48.125
have brought out that's
different than any other forum?

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:50.806
AMANDA PALMER: That's
a good question.

00:33:50.806 --> 00:33:52.180
It's fresh in my
mind right now--

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.220
we did a Reddit-- was
that two days ago?

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.860
Yeah, two days ago, thanks.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.110
We did a Reddit two days ago--

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:02.180
NEIL GAIMAN: Several years ago
in out of internet time, but--

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.950
AMANDA PALMER: And
someone asked--

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.500
I've been talking a lot
publicly, nowadays, and writing

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.810
a lot, about internet nastiness.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.360
And it's actually a
hot topic in general.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.366
Not because I think
there's necessarily,

00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:17.199
particularly any more
of it today than there

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.429
was last week or last year.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:23.159
But it's so
pervasive that people

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.615
seem to be trying to figure
out, OK, well, clearly it's

00:34:25.615 --> 00:34:26.239
not going away.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.572
How the fuck do we deal with it?

00:34:27.572 --> 00:34:31.889
Especially as artists,
and as women or whatever.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:35.480
And we talked on
Reddit about how

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.030
Neil and I had our own
particular relationship

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.300
with our fans and
with our haters

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.760
before we met each other.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.328
And then, we sort of inherited
new forms of hate when--

00:34:47.328 --> 00:34:49.453
ALAN LIGHT: They're still
making new forms of hate.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.639
AMANDA PALMER: I think,
maybe, subconsciously, it

00:34:55.639 --> 00:35:00.296
was also a way of going
out in public and saying,

00:35:00.296 --> 00:35:02.985
we're two people who are
going to do things together.

00:35:02.985 --> 00:35:05.364
And, in a way, kind of like
the wedding, it was like,

00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:07.280
you guys are going to
have to meet my husband.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.900
He's a really, really nice guy.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:10.900
And vice versa.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.560
And I wanted them to see him.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.305
I wanted them to know him.

00:35:15.305 --> 00:35:16.930
NEIL GAIMAN: It was
really interesting,

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:23.740
I think, for us also because
we have both been getting up

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.170
on stage is in front
of audiences doing

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.680
the thing that we do for
years and years and years.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.510
And if there's one thing that we
are both completely certain of,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:38.120
it is that the buck stops
with us, with each individual.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.420
You know, if it's my
reading or whatever,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.140
anyone else can
have input, but I'm

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.050
the one that gets to decide
what I read, what happens.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.780
And Amanda, gigging, it
all ends up with her.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.530
And so, you suddenly
had these two people

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:58.810
who are completely used to being
the last authority-- questions

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.380
could be raised,
ideas could be had,

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.055
but, finally, it would
get to me or get to Amanda

00:36:04.055 --> 00:36:06.180
and we'd say, well, actually
we'll do it like this.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.110
And suddenly, we'd
get to the point

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.651
where Amanda would say, well,
we're going to do it like this.

00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:13.040
And I'd say, no, we're not.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.930
Or vice versa.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:14.430
And--

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.910
AMANDA PALMER: Oh my god,
it's like being married.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:17.900
NEIL GAIMAN: It was.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.310
It was the most,
sort of, married,

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.870
bumping into each
other, and I think

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:26.520
it taught both of us
humility, especially me.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.770
AMANDA PALMER: Oh, both of us.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.230
NEIL GAIMAN: And
actually taught us

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.470
to cooperate in ways that,
I think-- it was nice,

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:38.410
it was like a pressure
cooker, because it was the one

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.200
area of our lives in which
we both reigned supreme,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.330
and suddenly we had
to give that up.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.100
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah, and also
I had a chip on my shoulder,

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.650
maybe, about, well,
I'm the stage person.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.394
So I even thought
that, maybe, when

00:36:51.394 --> 00:36:53.310
we would get into these
arguments about, like,

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:55.630
the chair should go here or
the chair should go there--

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.740
NEIL GAIMAN: We had
those arguments.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.698
AMANDA PALMER: And we
did have those arguments.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.270
That's one of the weird
things about being married

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:07.580
to an artist, or a person who is
used to doing big public events

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.655
or whatever, is that I
felt like the expert,

00:37:09.655 --> 00:37:11.780
and Neil felt like the
expert, and we would sort of

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.196
be there going
like, but, but but,

00:37:13.196 --> 00:37:17.940
but but-- You could look at
so many parts of the tour

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.030
and the recording
and the decisions

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.710
as a total marriage
metaphor, because a lot of it

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.080
was actually-- not the
arguments we would get into,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.170
but just how we would actually
smooth things out and not

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.560
actually get angry at each
other and kind of learn

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.704
how to do the dance.

00:37:32.704 --> 00:37:34.620
NEIL GAIMAN: Even doing
the Kickstarter video.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.078
When we decided we were actually
going to do this properly,

00:37:37.078 --> 00:37:40.492
we suddenly went, we
might as well record it.

00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:41.950
And if we're going
to record it, we

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.642
may as well record it properly,
and why not go to Kickstarter?

00:37:45.642 --> 00:37:47.850
This was in the relatively
early days of Kickstarter.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:54.799
So we tried recording a serious
video in which we explained

00:37:54.799 --> 00:37:56.340
what we were doing,
and why we needed

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.710
the money, and stuff like that.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.120
And we did that about
three or four times,

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.870
and all we knew is
that, by the end of it,

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.500
we hated it and each other.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.810
AMANDA PALMER: And Neil
had a terrible cold.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:08.680
NEIL GAIMAN: But then,
time was running out,

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.530
and then we had to
do one suddenly.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.220
We'd realized it was our
only chance together,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:18.590
and I'd lost my voice, and
had this horrible cold,

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:19.950
and was sick.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.780
And we were in Brighton, where
Amanda was about to do a gig,

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.120
so I grabbed a banana
from the dressing room,

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.172
we walked down onto
the beach, and Amanda

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.630
explained to the
world what we were

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.838
going to do in this Kickstarter
while I ate a banana.

00:38:31.838 --> 00:38:33.142
AMANDA PALMER: It was perfect.

00:38:33.142 --> 00:38:33.820
NEIL GAIMAN: And I think--

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.944
AMANDA PALMER: It was a
performance art Kickstarter

00:38:35.944 --> 00:38:36.600
video.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.450
NEIL GAIMAN: As Kickstarter
videos, it was the best.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.676
AMANDA PALMER:
And also very much

00:38:42.676 --> 00:38:44.800
in keeping with our stage
personas, which is-- he's

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.860
really good at being
the straight guy,

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.720
and I'm the obnoxious,
ridiculous one.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.830
And we sort of
balance each other.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.288
NEIL GAIMAN: I like to think
of it as English and American.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.028
AMANDA PALMER: Ow.

00:38:57.028 --> 00:38:57.528
Ow!

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.380
ALAN LIGHT: All right.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.370
Well, coming off the
ropes from that one--

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:10.090
I inevitably will want to come
back to the Kickstarter stuff,

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.670
but I want to ask
you a little bit

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:18.470
about these modes of creativity.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:22.120
And, I guess, Neil, even
within recent months

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.420
there's been the
novel, the comic book,

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:31.460
the Twitter stories-- all of
these different mechanisms

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.530
or constructions that you
use to get these stories out

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.570
in the world.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.580
How do you determine,
and when do you

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:43.120
determine, what goes
where, what idea is then

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.490
going to manifest in which way?

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:50.170
NEIL GAIMAN: A
lot of the times I

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.050
have a vague idea going into it.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:58.830
The medium actually defines what
goes into it a lot of the time.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.280
A lot of the time I'm wrong.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.590
I had two actual books come
out this year-- "The Ocean

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.570
at the End of the Lane" and
"Fortunately, the Milk,"

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.240
my children's book.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.960
And both of them started
off as something else.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.750
"Ocean at the End of the
Lane" was a short story

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.670
that I was writing to send
Amanda when she was recording

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.205
"Theater Is Evil," because
I missed her, and I thought,

00:40:23.205 --> 00:40:24.750
I'll send her a short story.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.490
It'll show her I love her.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.480
She'll be impressed.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.420
Better than flowers.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.420
Except that it just kept
going, and by the time

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.610
I finished it, she'd
returned from Australia,

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.510
was mixing the album in
Dallas, and I did a word count

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:43.614
and discovered I'd written
a novel, accidentally.

00:40:43.614 --> 00:40:45.530
"Fortunately, the Milk"
started out in my head

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.090
as a picture book.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.110
And I just started writing it.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.630
And I was writing
it in a notebook.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:56.620
And whenever I felt like
I needed cheering up I'd

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.920
go to the notebook and I'd
write about 1,000 words

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.420
of "Fortunately,
the Milk," it would

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:04.670
make me smile, and then I'd put
it away and forget about it.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.060
And when I got to
the end, again,

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.579
I typed it up,
looked at it, went--

00:41:07.579 --> 00:41:10.120
this is much, much, much, too
long to ever be a picture book.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.840
It's actually a book.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.010
So in those cases
I was just wrong.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.260
Sometimes there are things
where you sort of go, well,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.910
look, if it's in your head
and it's got pictures in,

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.580
it's probably not a novel.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.360
If the pictures
actually move and make

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.390
sounds, then maybe it's
television or a movie.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.860
If you can keep
them kind of static,

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.340
then maybe it's
going to be a comic.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.050
And sometimes I'll try something
in several different ways.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.440
I'll have an idea
that I know works,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.385
and I'll try it as a poem
and watch it fail as a poem

00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:48.010
and go, OK, well, if
you're not a poem,

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.919
then maybe you're a
short story-- maybe

00:41:49.919 --> 00:41:50.960
you're a comic, whatever.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.190
I'll come back
and sometimes play

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:55.000
with things in two or
three different times

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.499
until I feel like
I've got it right.

00:41:59.224 --> 00:42:01.140
ALAN LIGHT: I don't know
if this is the Amanda

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.870
version of that question,
but it seems related.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:09.220
You've told the story
onstage and offstage

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:18.070
about writing "The Bed Song" and
the process and transformation

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.790
that came at the end of
making that song happen.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:25.220
Can you tell that story and
talk about that a little bit,

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.050
which seems to me
also about, where

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:30.347
does the creativity take you?

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.180
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.940
"The Bed Song" is
interesting for me.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.356
I wish I'd played
it for you guys,

00:42:34.356 --> 00:42:37.570
because you'd have
some context, but it's

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.600
a solo piano song
on the new record.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.170
And it's pretty simple
to explain, actually.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:49.560
It's almost like a fictional
narrative of a couple

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.260
told in the first
person, basically,

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.930
starting at the beginning
of the relationship.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.970
And it chronicles,
with each verse,

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.865
the way the beds change
in the relationship.

00:42:58.865 --> 00:43:03.099
And it starts out, and
it's this crazy couple

00:43:03.099 --> 00:43:05.390
at a party sleeping in a
sleeping bag at their friends'

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:08.160
house, and through the
shitty futon at college,

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.510
and through getting
married and getting

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.552
a proper bed in a condo.

00:43:14.552 --> 00:43:16.760
And while this is all
happening, the relationship's--

00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:20.570
NEIL GAIMAN:Dying.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:21.445
AMANDA PALMER: Dying.

00:43:21.445 --> 00:43:22.420
Encoldening.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.420
I don't know,
becoming more distant.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.620
And the bed just becomes
this metaphor of space.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.370
And I don't usually
write songs like that.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.460
But I'm so impressed
by Neil because he's

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.130
such a great fiction thinker.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.910
And usually when I think
about ideas and songs,

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.270
it's always so personal.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:49.670
And even my sort of
fictional work in the past

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:54.040
has always been like some
very, very close reflection

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.830
of myself.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.714
But very close, so close
that you look at it,

00:43:57.714 --> 00:44:00.380
and you see the ingredients, and
you see that it's not quite me,

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.580
but it might as well be.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.121
NEIL GAIMAN: Close enough that
your mother can get irritated.

00:44:04.121 --> 00:44:05.456
AMANDA PALMER: Exactly.

00:44:05.456 --> 00:44:08.909
But "The Bed Song," actually,
I haven't experienced all of

00:44:08.909 --> 00:44:09.450
those stages.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.200
I've definitely been
in relationships

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.690
where distance
happened, but this

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:21.274
was like writing an epic poem of
all painful relationships ever.

00:44:21.274 --> 00:44:23.940
And I was really proud of having
written it, because I was like,

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.990
actually I'm proud
that it's a good song,

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.190
but I'm actually
proud that I managed

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.180
to write a good work of fiction.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.460
ALAN LIGHT: Which you
also sort of webcast,

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.680
Twitter-cast, the
writing of, right?

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.712
AMANDA PALMER:
Yeah, and so that's

00:44:38.712 --> 00:44:39.920
another thing about the song.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.780
So, another thing that happened
while writing the song.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:49.340
And I got the idea for the song
probably a week or so before I

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:49.840
wrote it.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.630
The idea popped in and the idea
of using the bed as a metaphor.

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:54.421
And I thought, aw,
that'll be a great song.

00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:56.600
If I get that right,
that'll be a great song.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.720
And I sat myself down at the
piano one day to write it.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.590
And up until that point,
I had had a real hangup

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:10.250
about what it meant to be a
good, disciplined creator.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.784
Which is, at the moment of
creation, and at the moment

00:45:12.784 --> 00:45:14.950
where I'm really going to
sit down and write a song,

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.700
I need to turn my phone off, not
be distracted, shut my computer

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.950
down, put all the
shit away, and write,

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:22.490
which is what real writers do.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.170
And I have a huge
Twitter following

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.350
that I have a constant,
ongoing communication

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.640
relationship with.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.520
And just this time,
I decided, you know,

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.236
fuck it, I'm going to actually,
instead of closing down,

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:40.110
I'm going to open up.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.590
And I'm going to announce
to my Twitter feed

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:42.640
that I'm writing a song.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.666
And actually, by
doing that, I feel

00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:46.040
like I'm going to
have to be more

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.373
disciplined because they're
all going to kind of keep me

00:45:48.373 --> 00:45:50.190
on task.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.500
And they did.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.100
And it's not like I set
up a webcasting station

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.040
at the piano.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.200
They didn't watch my process.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.990
But they knew, and
they were there.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.092
And every 20 minutes
or so-- probably

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:04.550
took me three hours to write
the song, and every 20 minutes

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.720
or so I'd take a picture
of all my scratched

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.290
out words and the piano and
my fan base is great that way.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.590
They were like a
bunch of cheerleaders

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:16.547
who were just sitting
there on Twitter saying,

00:46:16.547 --> 00:46:17.380
this sounds amazing.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.980
We're so glad you're writing.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.890
We can't wait to hear the song.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:23.800
And I realized I could do both.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.830
And I could tap into the
enthusiasm of the internet

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:30.560
without letting it destroy
my creative process,

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.669
and that was a huge revelation.

00:46:34.669 --> 00:46:37.210
And the song wound up being one
of the best I'd ever written,

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:43.080
I thought, and so I didn't
take that lesson lightly.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.562
ALAN LIGHT: So one
more for each and then

00:46:45.562 --> 00:46:47.020
we'll go to questions
for you guys,

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.830
so start organizing
your thoughts.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:57.160
Inevitably, I must ask about the
famous, infamous, celebrated,

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.360
Earth-shattering
Kickstarter campaign,

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.660
and all of the attention
that it received,

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.640
more so than anything else.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.760
That there was so much
talk and so many responses,

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.020
from-- we have seen the
future of the industry,

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:22.120
to she's a total hustler, to
every response you could have.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.110
From this vantage
point now, what

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:31.028
do you take as the biggest
lessons from the $1 million

00:47:31.028 --> 00:47:31.986
Kickstarter experience?

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.550
NEIL GAIMAN: Don't
give them free postage.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:40.070
AMANDA PALMER:Yeah, don't
do free internet postage,

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:40.900
that's the big one.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.590
I learned so many things
in so many departments,

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:50.770
and I could talk about it
for half an hour, so I won't.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.330
And actually, my brain is
sort of prepped on this.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:57.390
I was in Vienna last week
and doing a panel like this

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:01.670
on crowd funding and we got into
really dark, interesting talks

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.320
about social capital.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.180
And a lot of the
conversation, lately,

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.212
that I've been involved
in and wondering about,

00:48:10.212 --> 00:48:11.670
and what everyone's
wondering about

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.730
is-- what if you're not like me?

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:19.600
And I can say it's the future
of music, but it's my future.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.125
I'm good at this, and I'm
good at communicating,

00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:24.110
and I like hanging
out with my fans,

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.110
and I love tweeting all
day and I love blogging,

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.284
and I love using platforms
like Kickstarter.

00:48:28.284 --> 00:48:29.700
That doesn't
necessarily mean it's

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.430
for everyone or
for every project.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:43.440
And I think one of the
biggest-- not mistakes,

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.270
but sort of misguided things,
maybe, about the Kickstarter,

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:52.570
was that I drank the
Kool-Aid that my Kickstarter

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:57.850
success would translate
into commercial success.

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:05.090
And so I found myself
thinking that, in a weird way,

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:09.010
I wish I had just taken my fan
base for granted and done it

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:12.570
with them, instead of thinking
that I could use them as a step

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:17.676
to get to whatever that
next magical place was.

00:49:17.676 --> 00:49:19.050
I had already
learned that lesson

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.171
six times over with
the record label,

00:49:21.171 --> 00:49:23.670
and I thought it was going to
be different with Kickstarter,

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.000
that every time I would walk
into the office at Roadrunner

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.200
Records-- not very far from
here, and now nonexistent.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.200
But they would say, this
is going to be the one,

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.085
this is the moment.

00:49:34.085 --> 00:49:36.710
This is going to be the project
that is going to actually bring

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:39.480
you to the next place, which
is the place you want to be.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.200
And I would go, oh, wow, great,
and an office of 30 people

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.400
seem to believe it, and seem
to believe that we should

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.070
be putting our energy not
into where we feel safe

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.240
and into those we love but
into foreign structures

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.100
so that we can go out
and conquer and be

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.520
an imperial band.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.490
And actually, if I've
learned any lesson

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:03.200
it's that even those
closely around me,

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.640
very well-intentioned,
shouldn't be telling me

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.110
what my instincts are.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.160
And I am very gullible.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.130
So that was the biggest
one, because if I

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.660
had just done the Kickstarter
and delivered the record,

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.870
and not also paid
for giant videos

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:23.200
and not paid for huge
marketing campaigns

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.920
and not tried to reach
for the mainstream success

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.100
that my team all just flat
assumed that the record would

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.601
have, I think I would
have been happier.

00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:36.600
NEIL GAIMAN: And richer.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.125
AMANDA PALMER: And richer.

00:50:37.125 --> 00:50:39.572
Yeah, but richer-- I don't
really care about richer,

00:50:39.572 --> 00:50:40.530
but happier I do care--

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:40.830
NEIL GAIMAN: I
know, but there was

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:43.190
all of those people seem
to be assuming that you,

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.850
having had the Kickstarter,
you were now Uncle Scrooge-ing.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:47.510
You had a swimming pool.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.865
It was filled with dollars.

00:50:48.865 --> 00:50:50.490
And you would take
off all your clothes

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:53.500
and plunge into
it like a dolphin.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.430
AMANDA PALMER: That's a
wonderful image, Neil.

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.970
ALAN LIGHT: Maybe a song.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:59.880
AMANDA PALMER: But yeah,
and if nothing else,

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:05.420
it also lifted the
rug up on how amazed I

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.970
was that really intelligent
people didn't understand

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:10.060
how business worked.

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.119
Like, it really amazed
me that smart journalists

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:14.910
at smart magazines
would be like, well, now

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.237
that you have $1.2
million in the bank, what

00:51:17.237 --> 00:51:18.070
are you going to do?

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.528
And I'd be like, have you seen
the Kickstarter and the fact

00:51:20.528 --> 00:51:24.110
that I have to manufacture
$800,000 worth of shit

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:27.500
and mail it to people--
and that it's a business?

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.715
And that has brought--

00:51:28.715 --> 00:51:32.230
NEIL GAIMAN: I love the
guy on Reddit who asked,

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:37.860
you say you spent over
$100,000 manufacturing CDs,

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:42.660
yet you only asked for
$100,000 to start out with.

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.580
How can you explain that?

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.760
And I'm going, well if only
3,000 people had signed up,

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.710
and she'd only
had $100,000, then

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.750
she wouldn't have
had to manufacture--

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:56.762
it was a sort of strange thing.

00:51:56.762 --> 00:51:58.470
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah,
and I fielded a lot.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.900
And so the bigger question--
and I'm about to write a book,

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.650
and the book is
going to be centered

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.700
around these weird
new questions that

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.980
have come flooding into my life,
which is-- why do people think

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.250
art is so much different
from running a business?

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:19.250
And why is making a vinyl album,
in people's heads, so much

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.070
different than making an iPhone?

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:24.370
And why do artists get shit
for things that business people

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:25.230
don't?

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.680
And I can understand why.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.930
And artists are weird.

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:31.640
And the way we feel
about commerce over here,

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.500
and just like, I will make you
this thing and it costs $19.95.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.240
And the way people feel
about paintings or music

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.290
is definitely different.

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:42.560
But watching them
collide is fascinating.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.000
ALAN LIGHT: And is
where the action is.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.240
I mean that's where
we're living right now,

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.210
is in those questions.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.800
Which brings me beautifully
to the final question

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.390
I was going to ask Neil
and not hog the microphone.

00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:59.050
The other thing that
came out this year

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:02.462
was the publication of
the "Make Great Art"--

00:53:02.462 --> 00:53:03.420
NEIL GAIMAN: My speech.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.640
ALAN LIGHT: Commencement
lecture, yes.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.570
So I'm curious.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:12.090
We have a roomful here,
maybe of artists, but maybe

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:17.410
technology visionaries
and wizards and whatever

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:20.920
it is that they do
within these walls.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:25.440
And I'm curious, without asking
you to deliver a speech that

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.100
will go viral around the world
and cause people to quote

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:36.790
from at numerous occasions--
would you modify,

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.000
or how would you
modify the ideas

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.470
that you spoke about in
that celebrated speech

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.740
for a room that's like this one?

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.940
NEIL GAIMAN: You
know, I wouldn't.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.650
What was fascinating for
me about that speech was,

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:53.572
I gave a commencement
speech because I

00:53:53.572 --> 00:53:55.280
was asked to give a
commencement speech--

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.976
I'd never given one before.

00:53:56.976 --> 00:53:58.886
And I'd write it and
I'd show it to Amanda,

00:53:58.886 --> 00:54:01.385
and she'd read it through and
she'd say, you can't say that.

00:54:01.385 --> 00:54:02.080
And I'd say why not?

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.932
And she'd well that's
the kind of thing

00:54:02.932 --> 00:54:04.348
they say in
commencement speeches.

00:54:04.348 --> 00:54:06.760
And I wouldn't know.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.650
So what I did was
simply take everything

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.550
I've learned in 30
years of being a writer

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:16.100
and stick it into a speech,
like-- that was easy.

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.180
And there is a bit
at the end where

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.540
I started explaining
that what you

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:24.260
do as an artist-- because it was
to the University of the Arts

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.080
and a graduating
class of artists-- is,

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.430
you make good art.

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:32.710
And that actually
should be your response

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:35.820
to all of the shit
you're going to run into.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:40.230
You know-- husband leaves
you, make good art.

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:41.710
House burns down--
make good art.

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.180
Something wonderful
happens-- make good art.

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.880
That's what you do.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.130
And what I loved,
once it went out there

00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:54.550
and went viral, which is the
kind of unpredictable thing

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.430
that sometimes happens,
and happens in this case.

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:00.830
I'd see people on
Twitter, and on the web,

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:04.550
and on comments saying,
well I'm an architect.

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:07.430
Actually, it works if
you just cross out "art"

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.140
and make "architecture."

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.640
And someone else
is going, physics--

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.460
you can make good physics.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:19.150
So, speaking as the proud parent
of somebody at Google who,

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:22.850
when I say to him, so, Mike,
explain to me what it is you're

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:24.080
doing again?

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.360
And he'll say,
well leaving aside

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.320
all of the secrecy
agreements, there

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.870
are a few things I can tell you.

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:31.725
And I say, OK, so tell me.

00:55:31.725 --> 00:55:35.900
And he'll go, right, so-- waa
waa waa waa waa waa waa waa

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.400
waa.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.490
It's like the adults
in Charlie Brown.

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:41.582
And after a while
he will realize

00:55:41.582 --> 00:55:43.290
that my eyes have
completely glazed over,

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:45.070
and I'll say, well, could
you just give that to me

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:46.195
in terms that I understand.

00:55:46.195 --> 00:55:47.194
He'll say, oh, Dad.

00:55:47.194 --> 00:55:49.110
Well, you know what a
programming language is.

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.651
And I'll say well yeah, I know
what a programing language is.

00:55:51.651 --> 00:55:53.395
He says, well,waa
waa waa waa waa waa--

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:01.780
So, I would, for this
gathered audience,

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:04.822
I would say make good waa
waa waa waa waa waa waa waa.

00:56:12.067 --> 00:56:14.150
ALAN LIGHT: So if you guys
have questions and want

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:15.920
to go to the microphones,
that's why they're there.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.836
In the meantime, just
quickly because somebody

00:56:17.836 --> 00:56:19.920
will ask from the
fans for the news

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.790
hook is what's latest on
"American Gods'" progress

00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:27.280
with HBO, and in
the last few hours

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.360
there's been lots of
Sandman movie talk, so--

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.360
NEIL GAIMAN: So,
"American Gods" is not

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.580
going to be-- there is
going to be a TV series.

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.270
It's not going to be with HBO.

00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:39.880
I'm not yet at liberty to
say where it is going to be,

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.480
but it's awesome.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.570
I can say that.

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:49.860
The "Sandman" movie rumors
are "Sandman" movie rumors.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:55.480
And there was a saying when
I grew up in Sussex which

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.057
you would occasionally
hear old men say--

00:56:58.057 --> 00:57:00.015
theoretically old women
could have said it too,

00:57:00.015 --> 00:57:01.850
but I never heard them
But I did actually

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:03.010
hear our gardener say it.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:05.950
He said, I've lived too
near the woods too long

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:08.010
to be frightened by an owl.

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:14.470
And "Sandman" and is now
in its 25th year and rounds

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.184
of internet rumors
every couple of years.

00:57:18.184 --> 00:57:20.600
People say, what do you think
of the new "Sandman" rumors?

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.430
And I say, yeah, they're
"Sandman" rumors.

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.424
But haven't you seen
them, they're on the web.

00:57:25.424 --> 00:57:27.840
And it's like, yes I've seen
them, and they're on the web.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.624
And you know, 18 months ago
it was definite that Eric

00:57:31.624 --> 00:57:33.790
Kripke's people were making
the "Sandman" TV series,

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:36.081
and it was definitely happening,
except that it wasn't.

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:41.600
As far as I can tell,
watching this-- loving

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:46.270
the mechanics of
an internet rumor--

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:52.250
The incredibly tentative rumor
that somebody nervously put up,

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:56.260
saying that they thought that
maybe David Goyer was thinking

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:01.200
about pitching a
"Sandman" take to Warners

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.130
and had possibly spoken
to or thought about Joseph

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:09.940
Gordon-Levitt being in some way
connected, which as far as I

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.770
can tell is the one-- is
actually what went up--

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:17.320
has transmuted like this
cosmic game of telephone

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.840
into people on
Twitter saying, well,

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.798
what are you doing about
the David Goyer Joseph

00:58:20.798 --> 00:58:21.860
Gordon-Levitt movie?

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:27.274
And I'm going, nothing,
because it's all in your head.

00:58:27.274 --> 00:58:29.440
I will believe the "Sandman"
movie when I'm actually

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.500
sitting in the audience
eating popcorn.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.860
People saying things on
the internet is lovely,

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.187
but it's what they
do on the internet.

00:58:38.187 --> 00:58:39.270
ALAN LIGHT: Lovely or not.

00:58:42.449 --> 00:58:42.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:45.289
I loved the Judy Blume
song, that was awesome.

00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:46.330
AMANDA PALMER: Thank you.

00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:47.705
AUDIENCE: And I
know there's lots

00:58:47.705 --> 00:58:50.540
of tired questions you guys
get from doing interviews--

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.670
certainly none of
them were today.

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:54.280
Thank you for the
awesome interview.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.060
Are there any
subjects that you guys

00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.301
wish that people
would ask you about?

00:58:59.301 --> 00:59:00.800
NEIL GAIMAN: I
sometimes wish they'd

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.050
ask more about the actual
mechanics of writing,

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:09.370
because there's all this
stuff that I know and love.

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:11.250
And most people don't
come up and say,

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:12.980
so let's talk about adverbs.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.890
Stephen King says you
don't use adverbs,

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:17.380
but I've read your stuff and
you use adverbs all the time.

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.070
What do you-- what's with that?

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:21.195
You know that kind of thing,
where you sort of feel

00:59:21.195 --> 00:59:24.530
like, oh, I can get into
the mechanics of my craft.

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:27.051
And nobody ever
wants to know that.

00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:29.050
They just want to know
who was the forgotten god

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:30.080
in "American Gods,"
or whatever. which

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.800
is a different kind of thing.

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.540
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah,
mine's similar.

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:37.500
Especially given this
last year, even when

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:42.330
I would try to nudge journalists
or interviewers towards the,

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:43.600
you do know I made a record?

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.010
And we've spent 45 minutes
talking about Kickstarter,

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:48.300
and I know you think
it's fascinating,

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:55.240
and I find it
fascinating, but I really,

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.820
especially in this day and
age and being who I am,

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:01.160
it does get painful to
see the point-- which

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.290
is the music-- getting obscured
by the tech and the tools

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:10.920
and the house around it.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.470
Because I'm really much
more proud of the record

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:16.480
I made than I am
of the Kickstarter.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.820
But people forget that,
because the Kickstarter

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.190
is really big and shiny.

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:27.670
And sometimes I wish that people
would talk to me about actually

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:33.710
what it's like to do this
weird job, that doesn't really

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:38.640
have a name, that's like part
artist, part traveling person,

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.730
part talker to other people,
part Twitter curator, part

01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:43.750
blogger.

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:48.650
And the only person I actually
get to talk about those details

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:50.090
to is him.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:53.670
And I'm really lucky, because,
even though he's a writer

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:57.220
and I'm a musician, if you look
at hours clocked and the stuff

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:03.350
we do, the Venn diagram's
pretty-- we're very similar.

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:08.870
But it's funny, some of
my favorite conversations

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:11.760
lately have been with other
artists-- or reading articles.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.960
I read an article
in The Guardian

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.690
by a young British
musician who's

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:17.475
in a band called
Chvrches, and she

01:01:17.475 --> 01:01:20.920
was talking about how
it feels to be backstage

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.180
before a show on the
toilet with your phone,

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.050
crying, reading the
comments under some article

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:29.840
that she just wrote
about how people

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.770
are being sexist
towards her band.

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.880
And I was like, that's a very
real moment that I recognize,

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.620
which is that artists
are now having

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.410
to do jobs and communicate
in ways and deal

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:41.790
with stuff they didn't used to.

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:46.050
And that, in itself,
isn't really discussed,

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.420
how we juggle that.

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.270
And I think that's interesting
stuff to talk about.

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:52.060
And usually it
doesn't get that deep.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.560
ALAN LIGHT: It's a
remarkable piece.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.868
ALAN LIGHT: The
Chvrches piece, yeah.

01:01:55.868 --> 01:01:56.701
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah.

01:01:56.701 --> 01:01:58.134
Let's go to this side.

01:01:58.134 --> 01:01:59.300
AUDIENCE: Question for both.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.610
Actually, first a comment.

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:04.370
With the "Sandman" movie, I
remember a number of years

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:06.375
ago you actually--

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:07.666
AMANDA PALMER: And they're off.

01:02:07.666 --> 01:02:09.260
AUDIENCE: Oh, no no no no.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.015
You actually made
the comment onstage

01:02:11.015 --> 01:02:12.940
when someone asked you about it.

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.360
You used the words,
you don't want

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.650
to be the one boiling
your own baby.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:18.650
NEIL GAIMAN: Barbecuing.

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.780
AUDIENCE: Barbecuing.

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.154
NEIL GAIMAN: I said I don't
want to barbecue my own baby.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.340
I remember that, yes.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.865
AUDIENCE: So, I
just want to say,

01:02:24.865 --> 01:02:26.990
I've been reading your work
for, like, 20 years now

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:29.760
and it's still wonderful
and amazing and-- even

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.750
when I go back.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:34.500
That said, I try to
sell a book to everybody

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.240
who reads your work
and I was wondering

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.310
if you might be able
to pitch it as well.

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:43.645
Why should people read
Gene Wolfe's "Peace"?

01:02:43.645 --> 01:02:46.020
NEIL GAIMAN: Why should people
read Gene Wolfe's "Peace"?

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.770
Because it is smarter and
trickier than they are.

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.660
"Peace" is a beautiful
novel by Gene Wolfe, who

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:56.980
I think is one of the greatest
living American novelists.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:01.460
Probably one of the greatest
living human novelists.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.880
And "Peace" is an
early book of his,

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.820
and it's a book which,
the first time I read it,

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:11.630
I read as a beautiful,
bucolic set of memoirs,

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.880
heartwarming and sweet.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.970
And then I went back to a few
years later and suddenly went,

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.470
this is not that book.

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:22.630
I completely misread it.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:26.780
There is a dark, evil,
very, very nasty book hiding

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.090
inside this book.

01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.300
That is so cool.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.140
And the trouble
is, you don't want

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.440
to say any more than
that, because you

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.550
don't want to give
too much away.

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.008
You just want to
say like, read it.

01:03:34.008 --> 01:03:35.527
And trust me.

01:03:35.527 --> 01:03:36.110
AUDIENCE:Yeah.

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:38.109
NEIL GAIMAN: And it's
tricky and it's nasty.

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:40.400
AUDIENCE: I don't think
there's any book that I've ever

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.750
read and then
immediately reread,

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.334
because there's
just like-- oh wait.

01:03:45.334 --> 01:03:46.240
NEIL GAIMAN:Yes.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.800
AUDIENCE: And then for Amanda--
my wife, who also attended

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.850
Wesleyan, is an
artist and does kind

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:59.860
of a lot of design
and art-related stuff

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.410
to pay the bills.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:06.430
But she feels weird about
that, especially since it's

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:08.650
hard to tell people
what she does.

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:10.230
Anyway, but she
specifically wanted

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:13.335
me to ask you when she
should be expecting the fraud

01:04:13.335 --> 01:04:17.500
police to show up, because she's
been expecting them for a while

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.290
now.

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:20.820
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah, so
he's referencing something

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.000
that I actually-- I
gave a commencement

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.510
speech the graduation
year before Neil did,

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:29.490
and I talked about the
fraud police, which

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:34.600
is this phenomenon that--
I think it was actually

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.680
a friend of mine and I
came up with the term,

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.610
but it was that idea
that there really

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.175
are people who are going to
come knocking on your door

01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:43.550
in the middle of the night
saying like, we know you don't

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.883
know what the fuck you're doing.

01:04:44.883 --> 01:04:47.280
We're here to take you away.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.575
That job

01:04:48.575 --> 01:04:50.866
NEIL GAIMAN:In my head, they
were always going to knock

01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:55.650
on my door and say, you're going
to have to get a real job now.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:56.150
And I would.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.120
I would go quietly
and get a real job.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.770
AMANDA PALMER:Yeah, I mean,
it's funny in talking about all

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:10.970
of this stuff, about
art and business,

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:16.180
the idea that artists have of
themselves is usually so fucked

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:22.610
up, because of the main
cultural idea that everyone has

01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:23.520
of artists.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.150
And also in a weird--
not to get to meta,

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:30.020
but-- the way that everyone
thinks that artists have

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.270
this passionate
relationship with their art,

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:42.100
or this total purity, or
this-- pick an adjective.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:49.590
And it's been great for me, now,
as an artist-- I'm going on 40.

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:56.410
And there are as many kinds of
artists as there are people.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.010
They're just as insecure,
they're just as good

01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:02.690
at, or bad at, business, good
at, or bad at, communicating.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:04.760
And sure, there's some
things about artists

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.580
that you can see
that are similar,

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:10.740
but it was incredibly
liberating for me in my late 20s

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:14.160
to go like, oh I don't have to
act like this just because I'm

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.197
an artist.

01:06:15.197 --> 01:06:17.030
I don't have to think
about myself this way,

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.488
or about my work,
or about my life.

01:06:18.488 --> 01:06:21.950
And that "Bed Song" thing
is a perfect example.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:25.600
I realized I had kind of
been buying into the idea

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:32.060
that artists do this and I'm
up in the garret with my wine

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:35.497
and my cigarettes creating
my-- and actually, it's

01:06:35.497 --> 01:06:36.080
not like that.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.415
It's work like anything
else-- you sit your ass down

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:39.220
and you do it.

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.905
And it's not romantic, and
it's not necessarily fun,

01:06:41.905 --> 01:06:44.610
and you might not even
feel passionate about it.

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:50.580
And so once you can do enough
work on yourself as a human,

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:54.140
in the forgiveness department,
that you're not fitting

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.240
the picture that
you had, the fraud

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.169
police just-- You
still always fear

01:07:01.169 --> 01:07:02.460
that, I think, in a little way.

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.793
But the more you work and the
more other people take you

01:07:04.793 --> 01:07:07.030
seriously, the easier it gets.

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.150
NEIL GAIMAN: I was
actually in the audience

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.245
at her commencement
speech, and I misheard her.

01:07:11.245 --> 01:07:13.400
And I went through the
entirety of her speech

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.204
thinking she was talking
about the "frog police."

01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:19.370
Which were still doing the
same thing that the fraud

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:22.702
police did, they were just
these 6 foot high frogs who--

01:07:22.702 --> 01:07:24.160
AMANDA PALMER:
Knocked on your door

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.096
in the middle of the
night telling you

01:07:25.096 --> 01:07:26.930
that you had to get
a real fucking job.

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:30.606
ALAN LIGHT: You
would listen to them.

01:07:30.606 --> 01:07:31.730
All right, I hate to do it.

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:34.490
I got the signal saying I
can take one more question,

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:36.060
so that would come
back to this side,

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.360
so, sorry to the other guys.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.757
AUDIENCE: So, let's
talk about adverbs.

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:41.590
AMANDA PALMER: Shit.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:42.923
AUDIENCE: Seriously, no, really.

01:07:42.923 --> 01:07:47.810
So Neil, you write a lot of
imaginative, really interesting

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:50.620
worlds and settings,
but you rarely

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.520
reuse them, or
come back to them.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.689
Do you ever miss the worlds
that you created and wish

01:07:57.689 --> 01:07:59.230
you could come back
to them, and what

01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:01.760
specific settings do
you miss the most?

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.730
NEIL GAIMAN: Absolutely, I do.

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:05.360
People think that
I have some kind

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.260
of weird moral high
ground, and that I'm not

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.067
the kind of writer
who does sequels,

01:08:10.067 --> 01:08:12.150
and the truth is I'm always
the kind of writer who

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:14.840
plans to do sequels, and
would love to go back.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.689
I just get sort of--
if, on the one hand

01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:20.870
I have the choice between
something that I've done,

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:23.859
and I know how to do it,
and I can do it well,

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:27.920
and it now has an audience
who are waiting for more,

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.974
and a publisher who will
give me more money to do it--

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:32.640
and, on the other
hand, I have something

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.740
that I have no idea
if anybody wants,

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.875
that I don't know how to do,
I will always go, oh, shiny.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.000
That's what I do.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.390
Recently BBC Radio did an audio
adaptation of "Neverwhere"--

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:52.840
BBC Radio 4.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.479
And I got to act in
it, which was amazing.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:09:01.029
Much more amazing than that
was that James McAvoy, Natalie

01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:04.060
Dormer, Sir Christopher Lee,
Bernard Cribbins, Anthony

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.500
Stewart Head.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.100
The cast list is just a
who's who of amazing actors.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:12.210
And it goes on and on and on.

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:15.270
And all of these
people were in it.

01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:18.819
And I got to listen to it
when they'd finished it.

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:23.990
And I listened to the whole
six hours of BBC "Neverwhere."

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:25.770
And I went, this is great!

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:27.870
Why isn't there
any more of this?

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:31.080
And then I thought, oh, it's
because I never did any more.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:36.420
So I went and dug out the first
page of a short story called

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:42.180
"Hoe the Marquis Got His Coat
Back" that I started in 2002

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.560
and abandoned, not
because it was bad,

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.779
but because I was
writing it in a notebook

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:50.020
that a fan had
given me with rose

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.465
petals bound into the paper.

01:09:51.465 --> 01:09:52.840
And I discovered
that if you have

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.600
rose petals bound into the
paper, they clog your pen.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.910
So I'd written a page and
a half and put it away.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:01.140
It's true.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:08.480
And so I finished that story and
it's 10,000, 11,000 words long.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.780
And I gave it to George R.R.
Martin and Gardner Dozois

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.780
for an anthology called
"Rogues," which'll

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.770
be coming out next September.

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:21.060
And having done that,
I went, hang on,

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:24.520
I have an entire other
"Neverwhere" novel plotted,

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.992
I just never quite
got round to it.

01:10:26.992 --> 01:10:28.680
I should definitely do that.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:34.910
So, I really should
It's honestly

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:36.260
not because I don't mean to.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.269
It's just, I get distracted.

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:41.060
ALAN LIGHT: Ladies and
gentleman of Google,

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.140
thank you for your time.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.640
Everybody have a lovely weekend.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.931
NEIL GAIMAN: Thank you so much.

01:10:44.931 --> 01:10:46.681
ALAN LIGHT: Neil Gaiman
and Amanda Palmer.

01:10:46.681 --> 01:10:48.055
NEIL GAIMAN: Thank
you very much.

01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:49.690
AMANDA PALMER: Thanks, Alan.
