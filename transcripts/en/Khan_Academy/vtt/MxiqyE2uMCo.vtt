00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.840
A line has a slope of 7
and goes through the point

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.410
negative 4, negative 11.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.860
What is the equation of this
line in slope-intercept form?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.570
So the equation of any line
in slope-intercept form

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:21.330
is y is equal to mx plus
b, where m is the slope

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.740
and b is the y-intercept.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.600
Now, in this problem right
here, they tell us the slope.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.140
They tell us that a
line has a slope of 7.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.360
So we know right from the
get go that m is equal to 7.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.510
So we know the equation of this
line in slope-intercept form

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.457
is going to look like y is
equal to, we know m is 7,

00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:49.200
so 7x plus-- let me
make that x a little bit

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.960
neater-- 7x plus b.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.420
And now what we need to do,
we need to figure out b,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.860
and they give us one more
piece of information.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.210
They say that the line goes
through the point negative 4

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.560
comma negative 11.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.110
So that tells us that when
x is equal to negative 4,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.010
then y is equal to negative 11.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.110
So we can use this
information in what we have

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.750
or the part of our
equation that we've

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.450
been able to figure out so far.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.990
We know that when x is
equal to negative 4,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.520
y is going to be
equal to negative 11.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.000
So what b do we need
to make that happen?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.830
Let's try it out.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.080
So y is negative 11 when
x is equal to negative 4.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.650
So negative 11 is equal to
7 times x-- and in this case

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.420
x is negative 4-- plus b.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.580
And now we can just solve for b.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.010
A b that makes this
equation, or that

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.030
satisfies the constraint that
when x is equal to negative 4,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.790
y is equal to negative 11.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.890
So let's see, we get negative 11
is equal to 7 times negative 4

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.340
is negative 28
plus b, and now we

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.550
can add a 28 to both
sides of this equation.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.800
So let's add a 28.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm just trying to isolate
the b on the right-hand side.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.530
And so on the left-hand
side, negative 11 plus 28,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.090
that is just positive 17.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.250
These guys cancel
out on purpose.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.320
And I just have a b on
the right-hand side.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.070
So I get b is equal to 17.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.020
Let me write it in green.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.690
That's not green.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.110
We get b is equal to 17.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.890
So we know m is 7, they told
us that right at the beginning.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.460
And now we know b is 17.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.500
So the equation of
our line is y is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.850
equal to 7x, that's our slope.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:57.304
7 times x plus b,
and b here is 17.

00:02:57.304 --> 00:02:59.970
And if we wanted to graph it, it
would look something like this.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.020
I'll just do a real rough graph.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.830
So if we wanted to graph
this line, that's my x-axis,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.030
and this is my y-axis.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.690
The y-intercept is 17.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.230
So that means that the
point 0, 17 is on this line.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.690
So this point right over
here is going to be 0, 17.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.550
And our slope is 7.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.725
So that means if we move to the
right one, we move up t seven.

00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:28.600
So it's a high slope.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.580
So if we move to the right
one, we move up seven.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.540
Or if we move back one,
will move down seven.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.380
So we'll move down
seven, so the line

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.680
will look roughly like this.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.202
Obviously, haven't
done it very exactly,

00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:41.660
but our line is
going to look like.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.090
That's going to be a pretty
steep upward-sloping line.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.902
It has a very high
slope, slope of seven.

00:03:46.902 --> 00:03:48.360
If you move one in
the x direction,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.920
you have to move up seven.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.410
And its y-intercept
is at y is 17.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.203
When x is 0, y is 17.
