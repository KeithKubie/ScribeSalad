CHRIS DIBONA: Hi, everyone,
welcome to the auction of the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.365
Kennedy Space Center assets.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:06.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.220
We'll be starting with the
Vehicular Assembly Building,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.020
and then we'll be moving
on to the launch pads.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.620
So I'll keep my introduction
short.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.820
My name is Chris DiBona.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.530
I look after open source
for Google, as

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.860
much as anyone does.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.320
And I also try to help out with
the NASA relationship.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.680
So sometimes--

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.000
about once a month, it's looking
like-- we have over

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.920
folks from NASA, and we
try to introduce them.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.860
And say, hey, a month from
now, maybe we'll

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.560
have another person.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.050
Maybe three weeks,
maybe five weeks.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.260
But if you're interested in
space and this country's

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.220
activities therein, as well
as the world's activities

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.060
therein, just keep an eye on the
space alias, and I try to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.720
get the word out.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.420
So look into Talks at Google.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.660
You do this as well, right?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.950
So we have a lot
of folks who--

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.350
if you're a space enthusiast,
this is a good place to work,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.440
is the long and short of it.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.520
Today, we have Ross Beyer.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.880
Beyer?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.209
Bay-er?

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.459
Beyer?

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.900
ROSS A. BEYER: Beyer.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.519
CHRIS DIBONA: Beyer.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:05.970
That's what I thought.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.900
And he works at the Carl Sagan
Center of the SETI Institute.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.770
But he also does really exciting
things for the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.380
intelligent robotics group.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.010
And he's going to go over
some stuff today.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.710
He's also, it's worth pointing
out-- he ruined-- not ruined.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.210
Made his vacation awesomer
by planning out some--

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.480
while we were all relaxing and
skiing and drinking egg nog,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.860
he was planning photography for
the Mars Reconnaissance

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.710
Orbiter, among other things.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.080
And the HiRISE project, right?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.390
ROSS A. BEYER: Mm-hm.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.830
CHRIS DIBONA: So he's more
productive than any of you.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.690
And I hope you'll welcome
him to Google.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.618
So Ross.

00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:45.866
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.730
ROSS A. BEYER: Thank
you, Chris.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.340
I will turn this microphone
off, so I don't get

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.670
interference.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.420
So I'm going to talk to
you today about maps.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.500
And although that may seem like
a facetious thing to talk

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.210
about to a Google audience,
maybe some people

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.930
here aren't from Geo.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.400
But what we're going to talk
about is not just maps.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.610
When we talk about maps, a lot
of people just think of them

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.690
as utilitarian things.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.680
Things like this, that just
show you information.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.009
People have an atlas.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.300
They get that information.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.160
It's utilitarian for them.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.100
Some of the maps, of course,
that you create, certainly

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.340
Google Maps allow people to
do some analysis with the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.860
information presented
to them in the map.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.480
So they can say, I'm here, and
I want to go there, and the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.020
tool will provide them a couple
different routes.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.980
And so they can decide, right?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.560
It gives them the ability to
choose by picking amongst

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.540
those options.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.040
So utilitarian maps totally
have their place.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.580
But there are other kinds of
maps, ways that we can put the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.210
data together in a way that
will help people, either

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.110
scientists or engineers, really
step forward and really

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.620
learn things or do analysis,
either to land spacecraft on

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.840
other planets, or to explore
those other planets, or to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.620
learn more about them.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.530
Other kinds of maps are
more interesting.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.810
Here's a map you may have seen,
put together by Mark

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.390
Newman, of counties in
the 2012 election.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.730
This is how they voted.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.300
There's not just red and blue,
but also purple, in between.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.960
And this is really cool.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.060
If you want to where you
are, you can see

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.270
how that county voted.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.160
And it's interesting for that,
but it doesn't really tell you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.510
other things, right?

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.670
Because your eye does a very
good job of doing kind of an

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.860
area-based matching, saying,
well, shouldn't that all be

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.550
blue, or at least mostly purple,
if the president that

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.360
we have actually won?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.110
But that's, of course, because
there aren't the same number

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.270
of people in every county.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.180
So if you change that to this
map, which is where all of the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.260
counties are, modified by the
number of voters within them,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.170
then you can see the--

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.680
you can almost see
Treasure Island.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.430
You can certainly
see LA County.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.140
Manhattan becomes gigantic,
and Chicago as well.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.350
And so this is another way of
presenting that information.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.170
You wouldn't want to plan your
route to your vacation with

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.570
this map, but this map,
information displayed in this

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.690
way, really helps you learn
something about this data in a

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.660
way that the other map
maybe doesn't.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.250
There are other kinds of maps
that we make, too, that aren't

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.860
necessary geographical
in nature.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.940
You've seen, perhaps, maps
like this, maps of the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.200
internet or maps of this
sci-fi TV show.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.230
This is a map of physics,
which is fun.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.870
My favorite is astronomy here.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.010
In parentheses, you may not be
able to see, it says "early

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.089
physics." Which is fun.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.110
And this isn't something
that we do kind of

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.001
in the modern day.

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:22.170
You've seen, maybe,
a lot of these.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.850
This was done in the 1930s.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.303
So geeks and maps that are not
necessarily about places have

00:04:27.303 --> 00:04:29.460
been around for a long time.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.290
But as we step off into the
solar system and we try and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.300
decide, what kind of maps do
we need to make to help

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.390
scientists learn things about
planets-- either how they were

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.586
formed, or things about their
environment, so that we can

00:04:43.586 --> 00:04:45.520
land safely and operate
there--

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.130
we have to think about what kind
of data we can acquire

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.820
and, once we get that data, how
we put it all together.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.990
So before we step off to the
planets, I'm going to talk a

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.270
little bit about this
scene on the Earth.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.390
So this is a view of
the Grand Canyon.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.370
This is not typical of how we
have planetary data, because

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.920
this data was probably taken
from a rim, based on

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.130
it's kind of view.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.160
But it shows you some things
that I want to talk about here

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.170
for a few minutes.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.220
When we go to a new planet, we
don't have the luxury of being

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.280
able to scurry around on it.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.900
The first thing we send
are orbital probes.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.040
And sometimes we get lucky and
send rovers or landers.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.770
But perhaps any good geologist
could take a photograph and

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.920
start telling you the story of
probably approximately what

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.880
happened here, in a
geologic sense.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.220
They can probably tell you
something about how these

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.260
layers were built up in a
constructional sense, over the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.000
millennia, and also how the
erosion processes then cut

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.090
this river through
these layers.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.170
But there's a point at which a
geologist, just from looking

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.540
at that picture, will stop,
because they will have to say,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.950
well, we have to start
measuring this.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.620
I can spin you a good story, but
we can't really go forward

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.430
and do hypothesis-testing and
really kind of understand what

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.475
happened here until we can
measure it and map

00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:58.060
it, they will say.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.400
And so certainly 100 years ago,
the solution was to send

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.340
people down and measure
things.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.900
The modern solution may
even still be that.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.640
You might say, well, we could
have aerial surveys, or maybe

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.500
a satellite that we
can send over.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.160
But it may still even be cheaper
to hire a couple of

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.740
grad students with GPS units to
scurry around these slopes

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.250
and take measurements and
actually take a photograph of

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.450
this contact right here, and
say, what is different between

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.890
the rock here and there?

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.120
And how does that inform what
happened, in a geologic sense,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.380
in this place?

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.870
Now the other thing you
might want to do--

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.160
again, if you can't do that,
because of course, we really

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.630
can't do that on other
planets right now.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.360
We only sent six guys to the
nearest globe 40 years ago,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.230
and we haven't really done that
since, which is too bad.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.180
We have sent a lot of
robots, of course.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.800
But what you want to do, when
you get those first

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.990
photographs of another planet,
and you see something like

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.890
this, you want to say,
well, how big is it?

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.600
How deep is it?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.420
What is its shape?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.580
What can we use that information
for, to advance

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.933
our knowledge of what
we're looking at and

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:58.340
why it got that way?

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.640
So when we go forward into the
solar system, overhead

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.610
photographs are great.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.310
They're important.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.040
They're the essential
first step.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.170
But we also need to know
something about the depth.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.360
That really, really helps
us out, to give us a 3D

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.650
sense of the place.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.530
And so one of the tools that we
have at Ames is this tool

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.120
that we've developed.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.900
This is my kind of "ad" slide
with the URL on it.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.160
It's the Ames Stereo Pipeline.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.290
This is a piece of software
that we've

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.710
developed over the years.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.430
It's Apache 2.0-licensed.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.825
It used to be NOSA, and
it was terrible,

00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:29.750
and we got it changed.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.490
So this tool takes data,
stereo photographs, and

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.990
creates depth maps or terrain
models out of it.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.960
10 years ago, it started as
software on our robots.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.960
We had a little robot camera,
and we wanted to

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.840
build terrain models.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.200
That's what this first model on
the left is, is a couple of

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.500
fake rocks put in front
of our rover.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.900
And you can see that we're
accurately detecting that this

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.680
rock is closer to us than
the one behind it.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.590
Over the years it's evolved so
that we could take data from

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.340
orbital satellites.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.490
This one is of the moon.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.240
And also, I'll talk later, at
the end of this talk, about

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.770
how we can apply these
algorithms and this software

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.250
to terrestrial data as well.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.590
Because the Earth's a planet
too, as people always tell me.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.280
But first, let's talk
about the moon.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.270
So what if you want to
land on the moon?

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.990
You need to know something
about its shape.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.500
Because if you want to land
something very precisely, near

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.010
something very dangerous, you
want to be careful about

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.720
what's there and where it is.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.070
And this, perhaps, busy slide
talks about how you would want

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.650
to precisely land something
in rough terrain.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.539
We landed these rovers on Mars
in big fat parking lots, for

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:43.539
the most part.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.970
Now that's not to diminish
their danger.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.180
They were certainly challenging
in their own ways.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.660
But for the most part, we
targeted big, flat areas where

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.390
there wasn't very
much topography.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:56.180
If we want to go to someplace
really interesting, like here,

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.150
we can't just close our eyes
and hope for the best.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.140
We need to know a lot more about
the terrain, and we have

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.480
to have smart systems on those
spacecraft so that they can

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.250
compare a map, perhaps that we
made ahead of time, to what

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.540
they're seeing out of their
LIDAR eyes and out of their

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.610
visual cameras, so they can
match that up and say, oh,

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.520
maybe I'm up here.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.340
I'm on the top.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.460
But there's a canyon
ahead of me.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.210
I have to prepare for that.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.100
So that's what this is about.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.560
It has different kind of
algorithms that happen.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.930
But as you get closer and closer
to your target, if you

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.270
want to land very precisely,
close to something, you have

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.570
to be very smart about not only
the map that you preload

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.430
into the spacecraft, so that it
has a sense of where it is,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.830
but also as those algorithms
work, what

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.300
they're looking for.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.060
So to do those things, we have
to talk about what data we

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.740
have for the moon,
for example.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.380
And one of the kinds of data
we have are laser altimeter

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.790
data from the LRO spacecraft
that's in orbit right now.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.230
There's something called this
Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.580
And as it flies on its
north-to-south orbit, it puts

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.870
down this stitching
of laser shots.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.050
Very highly accurate to
within a centimeter.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.690
Great data, but sparse.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.050
If you zoom all the way out, as
we've gone around the moon

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.860
over the last four or five
years, we've gotten this very

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.460
good coverage.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.530
But even at the equator, there
are kilometers between these

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.320
kind of individual stripes.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.330
But this is an essential piece
for building kind of a

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.090
framework of the moon
in its shape.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.820
The next piece that we have
are very high-resolution

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.570
imagery that we get from
the LRO camera.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.570
Here are some examples of its
scene at 50 centimeters and a

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.550
meter per pixel.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.510
Great images of the moon.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.720
You can see individual house-
and car-size boulders.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.620
You can see artifacts on the
surface of the moon.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.620
That's the "Apollo
15" landing site.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.690
And we can take that data with
the stereo pipeline and build

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.120
terrain models like this
scene in the middle.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.370
And you can see that we're
resolving some of those big

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.490
boulders in the terrain
model that we built.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.030
And those are great,
high-resolution, dense terrain

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.130
maps that we have, that we can
have for that final bit.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.950
But somewhere in between the
global but sparse data and the

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:05.020
very local and high-res but
dense data, we need something

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.380
else to kind of bridge the gap
for landing site simulation

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.360
and for spacecraft.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.660
And so I'm going to talk about
a project that we worked on a

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.280
couple of years ago that
actually used data from the

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.260
"Apollo" command modules.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.350
So as you know, every time we
send people to the moon, we

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.390
send three people.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.990
Two guys went down, one guy
stayed up in that thing.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.480
And on the command module was
a suite of cameras and

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.820
instruments.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.800
One of them is something
called the

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.110
"Apollo" metric camera.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.610
And what it did is, as this
command module made orbits

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.960
around the equator of the moon,
it just kind of took

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.410
these rapid-fire photos.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.800
And this is an example
of them.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.730
And they had 75% overlap, so
great stereo overlap, taken

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.600
within a short period of
time of one another.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.105
And they allowed us to build a
great terrain data set at 10

00:11:53.105 --> 00:11:54.850
to 40 meters per pixel.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:00.410
One of the challenges was that
the data taken by the "Apollo"

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.920
metric camera were on film
that was then returned to

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.600
Earth and lived in a vault at
JSC for about 40 years.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.390
And a couple of years ago, it
was pulled out and scanned

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.560
with a very high-resolution
scanner.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.810
But there are certainly
blemishes.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.610
The scanner got down
to the photo grain.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.220
I don't know if you can see
that here or not, but it

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.360
certainly did.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.450
But we could also see lots of
interesting dust that we

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.360
weren't sure if it was on the
bed of the scanner or part of

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.930
the original negative
development.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.030
So we had issues that we had
to work around with film.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.640
Different kinds of problems than
we do with the CCD data

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.840
that we work with now.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.512
So that was fun.

00:12:32.512 --> 00:12:34.960
But ultimately, what it allowed
us to do is to build

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.870
this map of the moon, which
covers this kind of belt

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.460
around the equator
of the moon.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:45.860
It's this very dense,
40-meter-per-pixel posting,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.490
and over a wide region to fill
the gap between the very

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.430
high-resolution terrain
and the very

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.010
sparse laser altimetry.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.860
And what it allows us to do is
to do things like this, which

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.450
is to create that terrain, put
the image down on top of it,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.840
and provide you a view of the
"Apollo 15" landing site at

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.840
Hadley Rill that no spacecraft
ever took.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.930
But one of the problems with
images like this is that it's

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.480
not actually a dynamic thing.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.910
So this image, as you see it,
the photograph is actually

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.860
placed down on top of
the topography.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.810
We can't arbitrarily change
the sun or change the day.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.790
And that's maybe not so
important at the equator.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.860
But a lot of the things that
NASA's talking about doing on

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.120
the moon are at the poles.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.080
And at the poles, the lighting
really changes from day to

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.520
day, depending on when you're
going to run your mission.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.020
And so if your goal is to build
a map that is lit the

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.440
same way that your robot is
going encounter it when it

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.250
comes down to land, you want
to be able to control the

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.970
scene and move the sun around
and modify those lighting

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.740
conditions.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.440
And you can't do that
with just this.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.170
Now, you can.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.020
Having a terrain model is
an important first step.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.280
But it's not the only step.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.440
So now I'm going to
talk about albedo.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.900
But first, I'm going to diverge
and talk about Jayne.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.540
So one of the things that I
wanted to ask you is, in my

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.820
attempt to talk about
albedo, is what

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.790
color is Jayne's shirt?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.960
Is it black?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.750
Is it purple?

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.410
Maybe it's a mauve.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.240
Hard to tell, really.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.330
But if your goal is, from this
photograph of Jayne, to

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.530
determine what the RGB triplet,
if you will, of the

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.650
color of his shirt is, you've
got a lot of work to do from

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.820
this one photograph, right?

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.540
So what are the things that
you might need to do?

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.470
Well, you need a very complete
understanding of all the

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.000
wrinkles in his shirt.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.530
You would need to know where
the camera was in space,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.790
relative to your very
high-definition

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.730
model of his shirt.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.280
You need to know where the
light is coming from.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.450
If you had all of those things,
you could do the math

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.280
and find out what the color
of his shirt was, or

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.320
possibly his hat.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.645
And maybe you would
discover that his

00:14:48.645 --> 00:14:49.300
hat is actually two-tone.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.130
It's orange on the bottom
and yellow on the top.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.380
But it's hard to see, because
it's kind of washed

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.300
out from the light.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.320
This is kind of the inverse
problem that

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.930
game developers have.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.290
When they have a video game,
they already know where the

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.950
stuff is, and they light it
and they show it to you.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.030
This is the inverse problem.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.190
You see the scene.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.250
Maybe you know where everything
is, and you want to

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.460
try and find out what the shape
of that thing is and

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.500
what the inherent properties
of the shirt,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.298
in this case, are.

00:15:14.298 --> 00:15:16.610
The other thing that you need,
of course, is not just the

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.620
color of his shirt--

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.730
because if you did that, and
then maybe you simulated that

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.370
in your little video game model
that we were talking

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.840
about, you'd get a very
plasticky-looking shirt and a

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.930
very plasticky-looking hat.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.100
So in addition to just kind of
the raw color of the thing,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.270
the other thing that you need
is a good mathematical model

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.250
for how light interacts
with the thing.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.780
Which is why even if his shirt
and his hat were the

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.560
same-color thing, they would
look different, because his

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.790
hat is kind of fuzzy wool, and
the shirt is something else.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.470
Video game designers skip
this and use textures to

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.950
kind of fake that.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.650
But people like Pixar and ILM,
that do high-quality digital

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.710
movies, they have that
down really well.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.400
They have the equations that
describe how light interacts

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.200
with various surfaces.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.810
And so that's what we're trying
to do on the moon.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.750
And the way that we do that, of
course, is by knowing where

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.150
our spacecraft was, knowing
where the sun was,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.430
understanding that terrain--

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.420
that was the step that
I just showed you.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.110
And we can back out what the
actual albedo, or inherent

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.840
brightness, of the
surface was.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.660
So what we would do is we would
take images that look

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.660
like this, on the left, which
is an actual scene, and you

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.830
can see the seam go down the
middle, and convert it into

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.315
this image on the right, which
is kind of, if you will, a

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:22.930
flattened view.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.720
Not perfect.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.580
Nothing is perfect.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.580
But an idea of, if you could
take a shovelful from any one

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.040
of these pixels and take it back
to your lab and measure

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.410
it, this is what its brightness
would be.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.190
This, along with kind of that
model of how light interacts

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.810
with the surface, allows you
to go back and light your

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.910
scene any way you want, and
have a pretty good feeling

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.440
that when your spacecraft comes
and compares what it's

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.820
actually seeing out of its
camera with the map that

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.340
you've preloaded and lit for the
right way, that they'll be

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.400
able to tell the difference
between a giant pit that will

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.310
kill it and just a shadow that's
in the right place.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.410
And that's an engineering
example.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.360
But also, you could look at
this from a scientific

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.810
perspective, and say, are
these places, are

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.030
those really brighter?

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.010
Is there a different
material there?

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.859
And you can go back and use
that to follow up with

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.990
spectrometers and other
kinds of data.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.640
So that's the kind of work we
do with albedo and the moon.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.950
So now I'm going to
jump to Mars.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.359
And I love Mars.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.950
As Chris just indicated, I was
working on Mars over the

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.410
winter break.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.160
And these are examples of
terrain models made with the

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
HiRISE camera.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.390
The HiRISE camera
takes beautiful

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.090
50-centimeter-per-pixel images
or 25-centimeter-per-pixel

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.590
images of Mars.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.640
We can take stereo images.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.690
These are all terrain models
that we've built in their kind

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.430
of false color map glory.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.805
You can do fantastic
science with these.

00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:50.010
You can learn things about
polar deposits

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.670
and craters and layers.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.700
I could spend a whole hour
talking about every one of

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.780
these little subframes, and I
put them all up here so that I

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.355
would only spend one
slide on it.

00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:05.320
But understanding 3D is great
and very useful for

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.030
scientists, but I can't spend
any time on it, because there

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.510
are other things
to talk about.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.540
So one of the other things
that we do, actually in

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:17.090
conjunction with some of you
guys, are mappy things.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.330
And we help the science
community use them in

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.900
hopefully smart ways.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.560
So this is the HiRISE, that
image camera that I just

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.570
talked about that's orbiting
Mars right now.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.125
We have a way you can
visit this website.

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:34.380
You can sign up, and you can
say, I want a picture right

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.420
there, where the blue dot is.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.700
Take me a picture right there.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.805
And this is why-- you have to
say your science rationale.

00:18:38.805 --> 00:18:40.810
And you can give us notes.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.940
But the way that we enable
people to do that is by

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.350
showing them a Google Maps.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.380
This is a Maps API with the
Mars map loaded in.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.790
The red dots are where we've
already taken photos.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.280
The white areas are where other
people have suggested

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.700
places to us.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.800
And this is a mechanism for
people to talk to us via this

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.040
map, if you will, and show us
where they want to take data,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.230
and why it's important.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.740
And then after we gather this
information into our database

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.530
and we do a science-planning
cycle, we go into a more

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.590
complicated tool like this one,
that some people in the

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.730
audience used to work on, before
they came to Google.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.120
And it loads up--

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.210
again, on a map--

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.825
information of where we're
going to take an image.

00:19:21.825 --> 00:19:25.980
And when we're doing a
spacecraft-planning cycle, it

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.060
shows us-- our observation is
that Christmas-colored little

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.350
spot in there.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.620
Other instruments have these
other yellow outlined boxes.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.660
That's where they're
going to take data.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.790
This is the zoomed-in view.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.320
There's a kind of a
more larger view.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.490
This is tilted on its side.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:40.340
North is that way.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.690
Because that allows this to not
just be a spatial map, but

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.830
also a map in time.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.040
Our spacecraft flies from south
pole to north pole on

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.060
the day side.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.080
And so these are other things
about what the spacecraft is

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.290
doing, what its roll angle
is, other things.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.890
And so this is a time-based
plot, but if syncs up with

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.530
this as well.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.570
So that's kind of a neat thing,
to marry space and time

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.380
in this graph.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.090
Super useful.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:08.860
We use it day in and day out to
plan observations on Mars.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.060
The other thing that we've done
is working with Google to

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.430
provide more of NASA's
data to the public.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.040
We take a ton of data of great
places in the solar system.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.930
But kind of aside from the
Astronomy Picture of the Day

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.190
and other kind of enthusiast
sites, not many people can

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.920
really see all of that
data or explore it in

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.610
a really good way.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.090
And so we're very fortunate to
be working with elements of

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.500
the Geo team to build Mars mode
in Google Earth and Moon

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.730
mode in Google Earth, and get
not just maps, but also the

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.860
things that go along
with the maps.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:47.750
Videos from the "Apollo"
landers, waypoints, all kinds

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.860
of information for the rovers,
for the "Apollo" missions,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.310
everything.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.015
It's great.

00:20:52.015 --> 00:20:54.100
We're really happy about it.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.470
And it's super fun.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.950
And the great thing about this
is that the idea was to

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.550
provide this Maps interface
for the public.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.980
Our target audience
was the public.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.210
The overriding thing in
our discussion-- our

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.250
end user was Grandma.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.290
Can Grandma use this
interface?

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.820
But the other thing that I
wanted to make sure that we

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.360
did was also to provide
something that was useful for

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.590
scientists, as well.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.620
Even though that wasn't
the primary target.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.330
Scientists, this isn't--
as you well know.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.190
Google Earth is not a GIS.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.090
But it comes really close
in a lot of cool ways.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.700
And so our ability to put things
in and make sure that

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.970
when we show data, that you
could also drill down and find

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.630
the raw information, so that a
scientist could say, oh, I'm

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.380
interested in where the rover
was on its track right here.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.500
You can bring up a rover, the
waypoints for each of the

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.180
rovers, and you can
bring them up.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.450
And you can go off to the other
NASA sites that have the

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:48.510
raw data for the rover at
that place in time.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.190
And so it was very
handy for us.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.970
It was reassuring for me, as a
scientist, to be able to build

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.010
that into a tool that I might
also be able to use.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.160
In addition to just kind
of putting content

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.670
on, the other thing--

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.420
I showed you these kind of
wire-frame boxes before, of

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.260
where things were.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.420
Location is important.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.540
It's an essential first step.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.870
But the other thing you might
want to do is actually take

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.170
all of those images and put
them on the globe so that

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.490
someone can actually paw through
them, much like they

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.500
do in Google Earth or in Maps,
and really look at

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.040
what the data is.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.460
And so some of the projects that
we've been involved in

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.450
have been making these big,
planetary-wide mosaics.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.600
But again, sparse mosaics.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.490
So these, on the left, we worked
with Microsoft in their

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.830
WorldWide Telescope project to
put all the HiRISE images--

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.730
25 centimeters per pixel--

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.310
this doesn't do it justice,
because you could zoom all the

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.240
way into these things in
WorldWide Telescope.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.990
We also just, this year,
did the same thing.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.920
There's a medium-resolution
imager that's only 3 to 6

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.160
meters per pixel, called
Context, CTX, on Mars.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.810
And that also has kind of a
sparse mosaic that we put into

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.470
Mars mode for Google Earth.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.780
And these provide another step
for people to explore Mars at

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.930
a very high resolution.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.770
Not just average people,
but also scientists.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.390
Also with Google Earth, one of
the things that I talked about

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.040
is I wanted to make it useful
for scientists.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.870
And one of the greatest things
about building a tool or

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.070
working with something is when
someone uses it in a way that

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.210
you didn't expect, and
it's a cool result.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.050
And so one of the things that
we learned was happening was

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.650
that people who drove
the Mir spacecraft--

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.810
you may have forgotten it.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.830
It landed in 2004.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.540
One of them is dead.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.210
This is "Spirit." That's where
it is right now, where we lost

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:33.660
contact with it.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.630
But "Opportunity" is still
kicking, almost 10 years after

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.150
it got there.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:43.450
And so after the initial flash
of the spacecraft landing and

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.225
all the guys in coordinated
shirts at JPL jumping up and

00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:51.130
being happy, operations for
that spacecraft don't just

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.100
happen at JPL.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.410
Over time, the scientists who
plan and operate those

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.140
spacecraft, they go
back home to their

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.560
families and their friends.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.370
And so the planning process of
where to drive one of these

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.740
rovers is this geographically
distributed process, of

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.270
different members of the science
team taking different

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.520
shifts at different times, and
saying all right, where are we

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.400
going to send this rover?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.270
The scientists assemble
a plan and then

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.650
essentially send it to JPL.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.620
And the guys at JPL actually
drive the rover and plan out,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.230
you know, drive a
meter this way.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.070
Turn right, drive a
meter that way.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.110
But it comes from
the scientists.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.030
And one of the things that
they learned they had a

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.890
problem with doing is kind of
workshopping where they wanted

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.290
this rover to go in the next
day, or the next two days,

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.880
when they were doing
this planning.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.515
And what they ended up doing is
they ended using, after we

00:24:38.515 --> 00:24:43.230
had made Mars mode in Google
Earth, they started

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.010
using it for that.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.360
Because it was a great way for
somebody on their laptop or in

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.610
their office machine to pull up
Google Earth, flip it on to

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.290
Mars mode, and use the authoring
tools to say, I want

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.190
the rover to go here.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.190
And they could use the polygon
tool and draw a line, and then

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.590
they could send that small KML
file to their colleague two

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.100
states away, and they
could talk about it.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.210
And they could use the shared
map abilities of Google Earth

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.620
to plan out what was good
and what was bad.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.220
I don't really need to tell you,
and be evangelical about

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.350
the values of a shared
digital map.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.940
But for these guys, it was a
new experience for them.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.410
They didn't have this for
their planet before.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.610
That's not to say that Google
Earth was the ultimate

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.170
planning tool.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.200
But it allowed the scientists to
kind of say, well, let's go

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.250
this way, and that way and
annotate things and discuss

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.040
things before they said, all
right, we have agreed that

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.420
this is what we want you to
do, and then they can send

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.370
that information to JPL.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.130
And JPL kind of executes it.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.510
So that was a cool way that
people used Mars mode that I

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.850
did not expect.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.500
We have other challenges in the
solar system, beyond the

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:42.990
moon and Mars.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.840
A lot of them, I'm not
going to talk about.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.200
But small bodies, small
asteroids, things that are not

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.480
triaxial ellipsoids.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.040
How do you define latitude and
longitude on something that's

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.880
shaped like a peanut?

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.040
How do you even conceive
of coordinates in map

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.060
projections, and then how would
you deal with those

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.540
things in software?

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.950
These are challenges that
are ahead of us,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.410
actually still, for NASA.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.330
Even though we have explored
some of these places, we

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:14.330
haven't done it enough times to
standardize on something.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:18.510
And so there are still lots of
challenges in mapping in the

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.860
solar system.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.330
But I'm going to come back to
the Earth and talk about how

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.310
we've adapted some of this stuff
to terrestrial work.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.440
So again, kind of the underlying
theme is this

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.690
three-dimensionality.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.550
I'm going to show you some
examples of maybe terrain

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.960
products that you're familiar
with and how it compares to

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.220
what we've been able to do.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.620
So this first one on the
left is an SRTM DEM at

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.180
31 meters per pixel.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.510
Let me give you the
background.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.980
So this is a quarry south of the
San Luis Reservoir, where

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.160
we've done some rover tests.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.780
And one of the things we wanted
to do is to actually

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.630
have a DEM of our area, much
like if we went to Mars, we'd

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.320
have a DEM of the area first,
and then you would land your

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.960
rover, and you would drive your
rover around in the area.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.030
So we wanted to have
the same thing.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.040
We wanted to have a DEM
of our test site.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.840
And then we would drive our
rover around inside of it and

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.580
compare, and that
would be fun.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.920
And so the SRTM data here,
at 31 meters per pixel--

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.890
I don't know if you can tell or
not-- you can't even really

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.500
tell that there's
a quarry here.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.310
This just looks like
a nice mountain.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.800
The next one over is the
USGS NED DEM, at

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.670
9 meters per pixel.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.740
Here, you can begin to see that
there are some terraces

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.370
here where the mountainside
has been quarried.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.960
And this terrain model that we
built from our tools, from the

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.460
WorldView-1 data, is at half
a meter per pixel.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.130
And that's the big scene
that you see up above.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:36.090
And you can see the terraces and
locate yourself very well.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.380
And we can compare that great
against the rover that we had.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.660
It also had a LIDAR, a Velodyne
system for pinging

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.350
its terrain.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.660
And also stereo cameras, so it
allowed us to really compare

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.420
between the two models, just
like you would on an actual

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.010
space mission when you'd
actually do that.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.430
But we're not talking about
actual space missions.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.860
We're talking about the Earth.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.190
And the reason why we had the
ability to change this to work

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.800
with terrestrial data is because
of a need that came

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.580
from Arctic researchers,
of all folks.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.530
So it turns out, the people who
study ice in the Arctic

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.070
used to have a satellite, of
all things, called ISAT.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.520
And it had a LIDAR on it, and
it took data of the ice pack

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.700
in the Arctic regions.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:17.990
Great.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.520
Important for monitoring
ice, because of

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.370
course, that stuff changes.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.310
You want lots of repeat
coverage.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.810
But at one point, ISAT,
of course, died.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.710
And it will still be a few
more years before the

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.900
replacement for ISAT, which will
probably be called ISAT

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.880
II, will be launched.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.820
And in this time, there's no
good terrain data of the ice

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.420
at the poles.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.450
One of the things that Arctic
researchers kind of found out

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.890
is that the private
companies--

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.270
WorldView, Digital Globe--

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:45.523
I don't know.

00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:48.460
Maybe all those guys are
the same company now.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.190
They have paying customers that
will pay them to take

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.820
data around the equator, where
people live, but no one was

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.440
really interested in buying
data at the poles.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.390
Good for cryosphere
researchers.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.310
So what they found is that
there's a lot of overlapping

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.660
stereo coverage at the poles,
over this ice, that would

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.460
allow them to kind of
fill in gaps in

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.720
their ice pack coverage.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.550
And they asked us, well, can
you use your software to

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.010
create terrain models
of this for us?

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.070
And we said, I don't know.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.050
Maybe we can.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.620
So we figured out how to pull
in that terrestrial data--

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.200
which is kind of a funny thing
that we didn't know how to do

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.930
that, since we were so busy
on other planets.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.960
But it allows us to build
terrain miles of ice sheets

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.540
and ice packs.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.650
And why that's cool-- so this
is an example from the

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.030
Jacobshavn Glacier
in Greenland.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.280
And here's the image-- ignore
the black parts.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.400
This is the bay, and you
can see icebergs

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.140
floating in the bay.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.530
And this is the glacier, coming
in here, and you can

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.280
see the terrain model
that we made.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.210
What researchers did--

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.580
so this is useful for monitoring
ice thicknesses,

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.440
but also how things change.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.330
So I was talking about how it's
cool when people use your

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.030
tools to do things you
didn't expect.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.950
One of the things that one of
the researchers at University

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.230
of Washington, this guy named
David Sheen, did is--

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.010
part of the stereo process is,
you know, you have your left

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.925
image and your right image, and
you correlate them, and

00:30:04.925 --> 00:30:06.910
you try and make sure, you
know, this thing is that

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.090
thing, and that builds the
parallax of your image to

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.250
build the terrain model.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.630
So there's a correlator step,
that compares the images.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.090
And these are two terrain
models that we made from

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.340
different times.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.840
One is from 2009.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.960
One is from 2011.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.360
There's some difference.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.010
This pool was full of melt
water, when it wasn't a

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.000
couple years ago.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.600
But what David did is he took
those terrain models that we

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.680
had made and ran them through
our correlator again.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.600
Which seemed strange to us.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.760
We wouldn't have thought
to do that.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.510
But what David wanted to do is
to find out how fast the ice

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.170
was moving between
the two terrain

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.670
models that we had made.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.580
And that resulted in this map
down here, that shows how the

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.470
ice was moving.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.580
And it turns out that it's
really hard to instrument

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.150
glaciers, because of the Arctic
conditions and the fact

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.110
that ice moves, but it moves
slowly and it really chews up

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.030
instruments.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.360
And so it's really actually hard
to get this kind of data,

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.920
really, in any other way.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.720
So that was pretty cool.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.820
We were pretty happy
about that.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.720
So it allowed these researchers
to take terrain

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.020
models of glacier ice and see
how they were moving.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.010
More importantly, they're
interested in how ice pack

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.110
changes are happening.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.630
And again, without ISAT up, it
was hard for them to monitor

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.170
and measure those things.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.290
And so here are two, again, kind
of different examples.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:22.150
So this first image
on the left is a

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.000
difference-in-terrain model.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.670
So where you see dark blue, the
ice has gotten thicker.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.980
Where it's white, nothing
has changed.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.590
And of course, out here, where
there's no glacier, you

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.710
wouldn't expect anything
to change.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.000
That shouldn't change.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.140
And this is over a winter.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:40.490
So between September and March,
this shows when it gets

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.250
cold in Greenland over winter,
the ice pack thickens.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.550
The glacier snout gets thick
before it calves off

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.160
into the sea ice.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.210
That's what you would
kind of expect.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.950
The second image, of
course, shows--

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.120
the other thing was it
was taken over a

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.980
different time frame.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.140
It was taken from the end of
winter to one year later at

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.590
the end of the summer.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.330
And it shows the loss
of ice in the

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:04.530
glacier and the retreat.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.450
And if you can do this enough
times and take measurements of

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:13.640
the terrain model along that
glacial trace, our terrain

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.760
models show that, you know,
not only is the glacier

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:23.440
retreating back, you're
losing depth.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.730
And so we are helping these guys
learn things about the

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.590
ice pack, which is cool, and
not anything that we would

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.170
have thought we would
have been involved

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.510
in two years ago.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.470
But it's a way of, again,
providing the data to people

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.750
in a way that's useful
for them.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.250
We didn't do this analysis.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.225
We simply provided them with
the tools to build the maps

00:32:43.225 --> 00:32:45.180
that they needed to
do this analysis.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.950
So ultimately, I know
that I've talked

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:50.680
about a lot of things.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.870
I've gone all over the solar
system on you today, and I

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.130
apologize a little
bit for that.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.620
But not too much.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:02.190
There are a lot of challenges
in how we take data, how we

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.760
present data to scientists and
engineers in ways that they

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.820
can meaningfully consume it and
use it to be useful for

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:10.280
their jobs.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.990
Either it's landing spacecraft
or doing engineering purposes

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.300
or science exploration.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.140
And we have lots of interesting
ways to go about

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:19.930
doing that.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.970
And one of things that we're
really interested in doing is,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.636
we've talked with some
of your guys here in

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:25.880
Geo about Earth Engine.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.460
And we're real excited about
getting other planetary data

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.780
into Earth Engine and unleashing
the powers of Earth

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.260
Engine on planetary data.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.405
Because other planets
are like Earth too.

00:33:36.405 --> 00:33:38.390
Now, that doesn't work quite as
well as the other way, when

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:39.360
you say Earth is a planet too.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.810
But Earth Engine should be able
to allow us to answer

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.830
questions that we can't
really do right now.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.030
The planetary scientists aren't
even thinking about it.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.400
When I talked with Noel about
Earth Engine, how it would

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.450
work last year, he said, well,
what could you do if

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.490
processing time wasn't
a problem?

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.150
What could you do if
you could just have

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.360
all the data available?

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.810
And I was like, I don't know.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.750
I've never thought about
it that way.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.969
Planetary scientists, much like
terrestrial geologists,

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.620
kind of usually pick a
spot, and they say,

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.469
here's my study area.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:16.620
It's this few kilometers wide,
and I'm going to study the

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.500
crap out of this little patch,
and really, really learn about

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.870
this one spot.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.889
Partially because it's important
to know something

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.090
very specific about that place,
but also because it's

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:29.929
hard to pull in all the data--
and I mean all the data.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.630
Hyperspectral data and terrain
data and image data.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.610
There's a ton of data
about this planet.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.610
Ton of it.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:39.179
And no one person can kind of
have it all swapped into

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.610
memory and do something
sensible with it.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:44.060
And so I'm excited about kind
of unleashing Earth

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.969
Engine to do that.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.219
Also, a lot of times what we do
is we see something in an

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.590
image and we say, wow,
where have I seen

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.389
that texture before?

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.860
Or that kind of crater?

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.239
Or that shape?

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.680
Was it at a talk?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.710
Or was it somewhere else?

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.990
And so just having kind of sane
ways to interrogate the

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.880
data, kind of Image Search for
planetary data would be

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.960
awesome, and that
kind of thing.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.780
So we're really looking forward
to applying mapping

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.280
concepts and planetary stuff to
the Earth work that you do,

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.600
to the Earth Engine stuff.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.200
And also using that to provide
more public-facing stuff.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.820
I don't know if any of you have
visited Moon in Google

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.680
Earth lately, but it's stale.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.340
I hate to tell you.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.100
All the same data's there when
we launched it in 2009.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.040
And we've taken data of
the moon since then.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.030
Mars is a little better.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.100
We've added some more stuff.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.690
Some of the rovers are moving.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.570
Unfortunately, we don't have
"Curiosity" in there yet, for

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.440
reasons that are complicated
and strange.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.110
But we're working
on those things.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.180
And the more data we can get
to the public is great.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.450
And if we can provide this kind
of science back-channel,

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.250
then scientists can find
it useful, too.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.630
So I'll stop there with my kind
of crazy, random walk

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.380
through planetary mapping,
and take any

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.430
questions you might have.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.638
Thank you.

00:36:02.638 --> 00:36:07.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:09.610
ROSS A. BEYER: And I'm told
there are microphones at the

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.590
side of the room if you have
questions, so that it can get

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.548
captured for posterity.

00:36:13.548 --> 00:36:17.290
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
what's the most surprising

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.152
thing that you've learned
from the Mars imagery?

00:36:20.152 --> 00:36:24.370
And a related question would
be, what's the biggest

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.523
unanswered question that you
hope to be able to answer from

00:36:27.523 --> 00:36:30.740
the Mars imagery
in the future?

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.984
ROSS A. BEYER: Ooh.

00:36:32.984 --> 00:36:34.880
Those are really
hard questions.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:42.020
ROSS A. BEYER: So there isn't
really any kind of one thing

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.510
that I've seen, that I've been,
like, wow, that is the

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.000
most important, crazy thing
I've ever seen on Mars.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.360
Because since it's kind of my
job to look at pictures, which

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.780
is awesome, I see a lot of crazy
things that you wouldn't

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.850
expect to see on Mars.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.020
So I've seen--

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.320
we've caught avalanches in
process of happening at the

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.760
Martian poles in springtime.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.630
We can actually see
dust coming down.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.060
We usually don't get to see
dynamic things, so those are

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:07.530
pretty cool.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:11.520
Usually when we look at Mars,
we have to play CSI.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.440
What happened here?

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:12.930
I don't know.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.870
We weren't here when
it happened.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.330
How did it happen?

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.370
So it's fun to see those.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.190
It's fun to see dynamic
processes on Mars.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:23.000
It's fun to see dunes and
ripples move and change.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.580
It reminds us that Mars,
although mostly dead, is not

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.620
quite dead yet, and that there's
still things happening

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.400
on Mars, even today.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.470
Another fun thing that I've
seen is boulder tracks.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.195
So when we have these really
high-resolution images, there

00:37:37.195 --> 00:37:40.210
are slopes where apparently,
some time in the past, a very

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.020
large boulder detached and
rolled down a slope.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.510
And I actually saw one, and you
can kind of see the path,

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.980
and it kind of plows through the
dust, and you can see the

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.500
rock at the very end.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.300
We saw a couple of those.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.170
And one time, we saw one where
it hopped this small crater.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.410
It was really cool.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:55.820
You could see the
path going down.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.010
You could see it go up one side,
and then you could see

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.030
it land on the other, and there
was no trail in the

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:01.260
middle of the little
tiny crater.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.910
It was only a meter
or two across.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.850
So it must have had
a lot of energy.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:06.100
So those were cool.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.140
As far as what would
we hope to learn?

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.220
Man, kind of everything.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.300
So the biggest question that
we have, the million-dollar

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.000
question that we're hunting
for on Mars, the most

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.910
important thing, that who knows
if we'll ever get to it,

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.920
is did life ever evolve
independently on

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.980
the surface of Mars?

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.370
That would totally change
everything we know about how

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.950
things work.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.550
Turns out that's a really
hard thing to get at.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:40.070
Because it's possible that we
could look everywhere and

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.310
still not find it, even
if it did happen.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:48.660
So our process on Mars is to
kind of follow the trails, not

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.110
necessarily of water, because
although that is what we do,

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:57.540
is we try and think about, what
places might water have

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.940
been for a long enough period of
time to make enough layers?

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.380
Or where do we think life
might have started?

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.140
It needs energy and it needs
water-- at least

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:05.720
as far as we know.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.930
It may be different on Mars.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.680
But we have to go with
what we know.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.740
And so places where we monitor
things on Mars where we might

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.510
find traces of that are
valuable to us.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.400
So from above, we can't
go in and say, is

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.520
there a microbe there?

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.630
We can't see that from
where we are.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.870
But what we can do is we can
say, oh, is there liquid

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.180
moving down the slope
there today?

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.630
Or is that just ice?

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:34.010
Or is that just dry rocks?

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.395
And taking that data and
understanding that data set as

00:39:37.395 --> 00:39:41.080
a whole, so we can find places
where, oh, was there water

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:41.840
activity here?

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.100
Is there water activity
somewhere today where we could

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.840
send a spacecraft
to do more good?

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.020
To do more science in situ,
at the pinpoint of

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.370
where we need it.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.240
What we're looking for from
orbit is to kind of get the

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.600
gestalt and figure out where
it's worthwhile to send more

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.810
spacecraft or more assets.

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:01.520
That's a great question.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.060
I probably answered
it very badly.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.760
AUDIENCE: How long does it
take to process a single

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.270
stereo [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.120
ROSS A. BEYER: How long
does it take?

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.330
It depends.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.590
How big are your input images?

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:23.370
So MOC images--

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.370
I know this, because he knows
how big a MOC image is.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.520
From the Mars rover camera from
the spacecraft a couple

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.080
years ago, they're a couple
thousand pixels by a couple

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.810
thousand pixels.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:35.110
Those take like five
minutes to run.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:40.510
HiRISE images that are much
bigger, that are 20,000 pixels

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:45.030
wide by 40,000 or 50,000 pixels
long, those can take

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.740
10, 15 CPU hours.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.060
Kind of depends on what's in
the scene and how smart our

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.000
algorithms are.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.500
So if things are well-behaved
and it finds its matches

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.220
quickly, it can go shorter.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.990
If it gets confused and finds
a lot of false positives, it

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:00.020
may take longer.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.910
I don't know how long it took
to do the terrestrial ones.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.410
I have to talk to
Zach about that.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:09.330
But in that order of time.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:09.770
Great.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:10.980
Well, thank you very much.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.900
Enjoy your afternoons.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:17.575
