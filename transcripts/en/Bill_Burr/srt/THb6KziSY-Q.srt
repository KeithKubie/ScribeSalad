1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,163
Yeah.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,850
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:08,280
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.
And

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:10,930
[inaudible]

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,550
just checking in on you.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,680
I'm just checking in on you
so you know your week's going.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,130
Oh, it's Thursday. You know,
somebody gave me shit the other day.

8
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:25,510
Fucking talking about how, uh, you know,
I always say Thursday, it's payday.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,670
I go, who couldn't fucking job?
Did you have, will you got by?

10
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:31,390
I always got paid on Friday. I always
get paid on Thursday. Whatever.

11
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,200
So you're getting your money today
or getting it tomorrow, right?

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,100
We all know you're going to be broke by
Tuesday. Right? Wednesday walking around,

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,900
you know with your brown bag,

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,570
you got to bring a fucking lunch
cause you got no money for fucking

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,720
to go out to the roach coach.
Yeah, you packed a lot.

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,820
Chatty on funny, healthy.
You're pro. Gotcha. Yeah. Um,

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,930
I can't believe the fucking money
I used to blow when I was a kid.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,820
I used to make 260 bucks a
week, right? My only expense.

19
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,860
Why had I had a car payment? 130 $838
and 62 cents. I still remember it.

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,370
And uh,
that was it.

21
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:16,480
And gas that was making 260 bucks.
And I was t that was my take home.

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,260
260 bucks a week, right? So what's that?

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,850
860 times four is two 40 I was making
over grand a month and I'd be fucking

24
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:29,630
broke every Wednesday.
Fucking idiot. I swear to God,

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,930
if I was a miser,
I might as well have been a miser.

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,220
This is what the fuck I should've done.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,050
Tell it was going out in
the clubs and crushing it.

28
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,290
Coming out with my fucking orange Afro.
Hey ladies.

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,970
I mean, it was a shit show. It was
Charlie Brown trying to kick the football.

30
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,860
It was like Atlanta trying to
win a champion job. Come on bill.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,300
Come on. The new Cleveland Ladies
and gentlemen, all of a sudden,

32
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:02,470
Cleveland wins a fucking basketball
championship and the entire country's and

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,120
the cubs won. How nervous were
you down there in La and Atlanta?

34
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,160
You know what I mean? Atlanta. I
came to say it this morning. Atlanta.

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,740
Atlanta. How fucking nervous, where you
Cleveland winds. You're like, Oh shit,

36
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,060
all we got less the cubs,
you know,

37
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,910
maybe if the Indians win,
then they went to champions.

38
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,740
Cleveland winds two
championships in a year.

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,460
The cubs is still the fucking sad
sacks at like 108 years or whatever.

40
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:33,340
And then they went three in a row.

41
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,410
The cubs win it and the entire
sporting world just stops,

42
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,190
turns around and stares at

43
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,580
Atlanta Quiver and over in the corner.
Like, hey guys, you know, for the record,

44
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:53,460
the Braves one at 95,
it's got to count for something.

45
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:57,840
Right? Oh, those poor bastards.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
You,
I just connected in a,

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,630
I connected in with the fuck
was I in, um, in Atlanta.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,440
And I saw this woman walked by and she
had on a falcons hat and I was like,

49
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:15,180
you know what, good for, there's a real
fan still wearing the Atlanta shit. Right.

50
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:19,770
And it was a red hat, but then I also
noticed that she was wearing red sneakers,

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,850
you know what I mean? And she then, she
was also African American and I was just,

52
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,650
and I just assumed she didn't give a fuck.

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,050
I learned that from Patrice O'Neil
the first time I saw them with like an

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,360
islanders hat on. Right. I was like,
Oh fuck man, you like the islanders.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,700
He was like, what? I go,
you liked the islanders.

56
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,210
And he took off his hat and looked at,
he goes, Nah man, I don't give a shit.

57
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,871
I goes, I, he goes,

58
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:44,871
I just liked the colors and these pair
of fucking islanders covered colored

59
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,000
sneakers on. You told me to
say, Bill Black people don't
give a fuck about, I mean,

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm not saying generally, you know,
hey, we got all the white guy.

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,950
I've got to fucking make sure I fucking
say this correctly. He was saying,

62
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:59,430
generally speaking, we wear this shit
because of colors. It's not, you know,

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,080
and he joked, he just fuck it. Yeah.
He trashed me all the fucking time.

64
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,780
So anyways,
so I looked at her and I did that.

65
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,570
Patrice conversation just popped into
my fucking head and I was just like,

66
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:13,320
as she probably just probably just needed
a hat to go with those fucking shoes.

67
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,140
Supposed to white people where
were the same fucking hat forever.

68
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,610
It's all frayed and shit.

69
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,820
Walking around with your cargo
pants and your flip flops.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't think I'll ever get over
fucking northern Florida. I know,

71
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,120
I've heard a zillion jokes about it,
but Jesus fucking Christ,

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,710
Jesus fucking Christ.
There are some characters out there.

73
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,030
And what's amazing is
it's absolutely gorgeous.

74
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,010
And then there's people
with like beautiful homes
in money, but they're there.

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,410
I swear to God, isn't me.
There's no middle-class.

76
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,790
It's like when you go to a third
world country, it's just like this,

77
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,420
just fucking people living in this crazy
poverty and then they'll just be this

78
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,080
mansion. I Dunno. Anyway, well,

79
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,351
you know,

80
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:04,850
probably didn't help that I fucking went
to the Daytona 500 bunch of Yahoos like

81
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:09,800
me. And by the way, I fit right in. I
fucking fit right in. I'm, I'm, you know,

82
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,930
I don't know. I should be
more white collar. But uh,

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,440
due to some financial reasons, I
had a very fucking, you know, I'm,

84
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm pretty much a put
it this way. I, it was,

85
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,290
it wasn't until I hung out with a
bunch of, of poetry stories here.

86
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,340
I wasn't until I hung out with Patrice
that I realized that macaroni and cheese

87
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,390
wasn't a main dish.

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,390
We used to have all of that shit.

89
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,580
Macaroni and cheese with toast
was a meal and I fucking loved it.

90
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,750
Get half a tray just scooping that
shit out was the craft. I've told you.

91
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,800
Talk to you guys about this
chicken Alec King on toast.

92
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,410
Chipped beef on toast.
I fucking hated that shit.

93
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:56,150
Chicken Alan King was also
gross. Um, those are the, yeah.

94
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:59,720
You know, in mother's work and
she comes home, she's got 90 kids,

95
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,370
opens up a couple of cans, throws it
in a pot and make some toast. Yay.

96
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,890
You're fucking animals.

97
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,560
Um, anyways, chef boy yard d.

98
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,250
Okay.

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,740
You know, when I think
back, this was born,

100
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,500
we didn't know anything about
fucking nutrition back then. TV.

101
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,540
We weren't never really
big on the TV dinners.

102
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,370
And I remember I used to
ask my mother to get them.

103
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:28,020
I think that there was something,

104
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,390
I don't what the fuck was called
Hungry Jack's or some shit.

105
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,500
Something that had jack in it.
It sounded manly, you know,

106
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,540
and the commercials all you know,
big chunks and Turkey with gravy Matt of,

107
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,090
and I was sitting there going
[inaudible] that looks fucking delicious.

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,680
Okay.

109
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,290
I Dunno. We just never, we never,
we weren't, we never, we didn't,

110
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,340
we didn't cross that line
with the fast food. You know,

111
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,830
I remember steak hymns, those were
my favorites. I'd be sitting in,

112
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,690
I would be sitting not paying attention
in the last three periods of school when

113
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,410
I was in a middle school, junior
high, whatever the fuck you call it.

114
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:05,840
Just thinking about the state of that
I was going to make when I got home.

115
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,380
That's all I gave a felt. That
was a game changer. You know,

116
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,230
kid from the seventies eighties you know,
you came home,

117
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,870
your parents weren't home, right.
Latch key kid, you come home.

118
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,790
The game changer was when you went from
making something just room temperature

119
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,970
or cold to actually get in the,
you know,

120
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,740
the next level. It's like
moving up in like a, you know,

121
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,440
army ranks as Scientology,
whatever.

122
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,400
When you get to a new level
of security clearance, okay,

123
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:39,050
you can use the fucking frying pan and
all of a sudden you had a fucking hot

124
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:43,730
meal.
I used to cook those fuckers up,

125
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,930
put them on white bread and then you had
to eat it real quick because the grease,

126
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,040
there was so much fucking grease from
whatever cut of meat. Was it squirrel?

127
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,270
I didn't know what the fuck it was.

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,430
It was such a shit cut of meat that the
grease would just be coming through the

129
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:02,690
bread. It was, it was fucking gross
push. You put ketchup on and shit.

130
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,090
Sorry if I'm grossing. Yeah.
Let me get off the subject.

131
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,840
I gotta. I gotta address all the
fucking who and whom police. Oh my God.

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,900
That's like a whole cult within itself.

133
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,300
The level of fucking arrogance that people
came and the joy that they had that I

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,240
see that I'm not good at.

135
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Who in home you would think that you
could actually make money off of that?

136
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,670
Like they had a hot
stock tip or some shit.

137
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,990
Hey this fucking company's going to
go public. You didn't hear it from me.

138
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,770
This is one thing that I learned.
I think I finally figured out,

139
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,090
cause people told me this trick before,

140
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:43,091
it's like if you could substitute he or
she use who you know him or her use home

141
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,820
some like to whom do I have the pleasure
of speaking to and I'm like to him,

142
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,670
I have the pleasure of,
of speaking with,

143
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,760
I wouldn't say that that sentence doesn't
work to she do I have the pleasure of

144
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,324
speaking.
Yeah.

145
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,003
Okay.

146
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,960
Like I don't fucking get it. But then
it's like, no, who you speaking to?

147
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,160
You would say to him, to her. Then I
was like, oh, that's what they mean.

148
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,820
I thought the, I thought you just meant
take out a who are home and plug in.

149
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,654
He or she

150
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,080
who did this shit, he did this shit.
I get it. I think I just got it.

151
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,850
I think I finally
cracked the fucking code.

152
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,070
But here's the deal with
who and wants the deal. Woo.

153
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,550
Here's the deal with that shit.

154
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,440
Nobody says whom out loud unless
you're teaching an English class.

155
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,010
No one says that.

156
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,970
Right? It's always hope. Who the
fuck do I? You know, it's not.

157
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,450
To whom am I speaking? Was I,
what the fuck am I talking to? Oh,

158
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,284
the fuck are you?

159
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,520
Who am I fucking speaking with?

160
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,720
Yeah,

161
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,350
it's speaking to fucking him. That's why
you said fuck it home. Oh, all right,

162
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,160
thanks Jerry. Nobody says it out loud,
but it's one of those things if you,

163
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,990
if you don't write it
correctly, you know, if you,

164
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,360
people flip the fuck out and they
judge you like you're a fucking more,

165
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,340
but I've never heard
anybody, you know, that's,

166
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:25,430
that's another one that's, that's
another like security level. You go past,

167
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,170
if you start out loud
using the not not writing,

168
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:31,760
okay.

169
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Speaking and you use the word whom like
you've alienated probably 80% of the

170
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:39,500
population of my country.

171
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
And I don't think that there's a bigger
example of the gap between wealth and

172
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:52,260
regular people than using whom in
public. I always picture that. I

173
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,280
know you know something
even that you know,

174
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,380
because there's people that fucking rob
and steal their way into the upper 1%

175
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,480
and then they just a fucking dope
like me still. But if you're born,

176
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,100
if you're born into that shit,

177
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,140
if you've got some trust
fund hanging over your head,

178
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:11,080
if you one of those kids and
you have to learn how to fence,

179
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,730
take a fencing fucking class in college
to show that you're a gentleman.

180
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,983
You know,

181
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,270
did you walk around with the
date rape drug in your pocket?

182
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,050
Cause your dad knows a judge and can
get you off and you wear loafers with no

183
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,260
socks. Right? There's a
bunch of stereotypes. Um,

184
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,160
I was speaking to that, me and the, I got
this fucking monster debate last night.

185
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,460
She take this show, she goes,
she goes, Hey, I take this show.

186
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,500
It's about rappers in Paris. You know, you
ought to check this out. So I was like,

187
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,940
all right, I'm going to
watch this shit. Right.

188
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,410
So immediately they show in these
guys and they're rapping and French.

189
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,680
I don't know what this saying. So you
know, I'm trying to read the words.

190
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:01,330
I'm a dope. It's going by too fast.
But it sounds a lot like, you know,

191
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:05,410
it's the same sort of point of
view as a lot of rappers over here,

192
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,070
which I am in a the minority group.
I'm getting treated like shit.

193
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm living in the shittiest part of the
fucking city. A lot of that stuff. Right.

194
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,660
But it's flying by because
I can't read fast enough.

195
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,910
So they got this fucking nerdy white
kid goes to interview this dude, um,

196
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,900
who's Muslim and he's living
in some part in Paris. Right.

197
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,790
And he's talking about all of this stuff
that's happening to him now. Right.

198
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,560
And uh, no, the first
thing he talked about,

199
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,780
he said that he was talking about how um,

200
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,920
he said thank God that he found, you
know, rap and he did that, cause you know,

201
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:44,500
he could've gone the other way.
He said, I could've become a bomb.

202
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,570
That's what he said. So the white dude
goes like, oh, you mean like, you know,

203
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,970
you would've blown some people
up or something like that.

204
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,790
And then the dude's basically like,
I knew you're going to take it that way.

205
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,140
That's not how I meant it. That's
really offensive. And I, you know,

206
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,340
and he's speaking through an interpreter,

207
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:02,650
tell him if he's going to come
down here and talk to people,

208
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,720
he needs to check the way he's
talking to people, blah, blah.

209
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,500
And I'm just sitting there going like,
you totally set him up for that.

210
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,920
That was like fucking attracted. What
do you think? He's going to think?

211
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,470
Okay.

212
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,020
So Nia goes, well, he's not doing that.

213
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,590
So you know,

214
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,340
he gets judged because of those
actions of the few of the few.

215
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,880
And it's just like, I understand
that. I totally understand that,

216
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:29,780
but at some point you have to address
the fucking elephant in the room,

217
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:33,240
don't you?
You know?

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,640
Yeah.

219
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,281
Like when people,

220
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:39,270
like when I travel outside of this country
and people treat me like shit because

221
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,660
I'm an American, I don't act like
that just fell out of the sky.

222
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,040
I know where that's coming from.

223
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,730
The pure listic way that we've
colonized the entire fucking world,

224
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,110
the amount of time we've,

225
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:52,860
we've cited with dictators because
they've given us fucking oil is they're

226
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,100
oppressed in their own PD amount of times
we've been on the wrong fucking side

227
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,120
of shit. It's like an a walk around like,
well, I didn't show it. That's like,

228
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,430
you know,
as much as it's still wrong to judge me,

229
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,600
I understand that when I walk out of
the House, I'm no longer me anymore.

230
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,840
It's teams. It's like red
sox and Yankees. Okay,

231
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,720
and you're low and you're fucking the hat,

232
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,490
the team hat you're wearing is you skin.
Okay.

233
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,340
And people are going to
judge you for that. You know,

234
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,710
back when I had here and I came walking
down the street looking like fucking

235
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,450
Richie Cunningham,
you know,

236
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:32,040
I knew that people were looking at
me like that, you know, like fucking

237
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,470
[inaudible]. I can take this kid's
lunch money, look at his fucking hair.

238
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,340
Okay,

239
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,460
does it make it right?
Absolutely does not make it right.

240
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,970
But to sit there and act like you
don't know where shit is coming from.

241
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,500
That's what drives me nuts.

242
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,980
And it's like I completely understand
that on my side to have empathy for that

243
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:53,841
guy.

244
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:57,920
But what was pissing me off was there
was no empathy coming from the other side

245
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,510
being like, listen, I
understand. You know,

246
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,030
cause there was no understanding of that,

247
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,390
that wrapper that this guy is
totally on the outside looking in.

248
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,400
So he's going to come from this fear-based
fucking thing that he's, you know,

249
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:16,820
from the shit that he sees in the
media and the media is basically,

250
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,790
you get judged all groups of people,

251
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:24,791
you get judged by the Jerry Springer
fucking group of your people.

252
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,510
That's basically it. So with white
people, we're either living in a trailer,

253
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,550
fucking our sister or where these lizard
people shapeshifters that live under a

254
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:38,600
fucking mountain. Illuminati
is essentially it, right?

255
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,200
There's a lot. This is a zillion of
them. We were in a fucking eight group.

256
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,780
We're in the fucking clan, we
got have, we got a four wheeler,

257
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,640
we're shooting a gun or whatever.
Right.

258
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,340
And you've got all those
fucking stereotypes, um,

259
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,430
which obviously is not
a fair fucking thing.

260
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,240
And I also wanted to stand
that despite those stereotypes,

261
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,420
the Matrix is made for white people.
So I this spite those,

262
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:04,310
it really doesn't affect my life and I
get all of that type of shit. But I mean,

263
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,340
I dunno, I just needed that guy in the
moment to just be like, you know what?

264
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,330
I understand why you said
that. You know, rather than,

265
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:13,010
than just immediately go into lecture
mode because then when you're sitting at

266
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:16,220
home, I don't know if you're like
me, I just plugged myself in. Well,

267
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:19,880
who would I be in that scenario? Oh,
I'd be that guy getting a lecture.

268
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,320
So I just started saying all this shit.

269
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:25,130
I would've said back to him and it drove
my fucking wife up the wall. She's like,

270
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:29,420
why can't you just watch
things? It's like, you know I,

271
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,440
what do you mean why can't I,

272
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
the TV's interacted to me the same shit
I do when I watch wheel of fortune and I

273
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:40,670
make fun of every contestant and you
sitting there laughing your ass off and I

274
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,520
turned it into this like a comedy show.

275
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,690
You then get mad at me when I do the
same fucking thing when I'm watching this

276
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:52,070
other shit. And so I, we just
made a truce. It's like, don't,

277
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,190
I don't want to watch any of any shit
with you that has to do with this stuff

278
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,590
because we're going to end up in a
fucking argument because I'm going to act

279
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,850
like I'm watching wheel of fortune.

280
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,160
Um, anyways, why is this thing bing bang
and booming and all that type of shit.

281
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,240
You know,
having said all that,

282
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,880
I completely understood where that
guy was coming from. It's like, yeah,

283
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:20,630
I didn't do any of that shit. You know,
I'm trying to get the fuck outta here.

284
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,700
I've lived in this country my whole
life and I never felt like it was mine.

285
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,980
Okay. Which is, you know, and this is
the arrogant thing that I'm going to do,

286
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,390
not even living over there,
I'm going to chastise white people like,

287
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,050
cause we do it here.
You can't do that to people.

288
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:39,890
You can't have people living in the
country their whole fucking lives.

289
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,220
And the our American, they are French
and all that. You cannot treat them like,

290
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,360
yeah, but you know, you know, you're
not real American American. It's like,

291
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:51,980
well fucking neither were you then you're
European or whatever the fuck you're

292
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,180
from. Um, so I don't know.
I'm not, I'm not a fucking,

293
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:59,340
I like to think I'm not a fucking bad guy.
I get all of that type of shit.

294
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,460
But Jesus Christ at some point,
you know,

295
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,090
like I used to joke right after nine
11 and they started racially profiling

296
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,160
Arabs and all that, which was completely
fucked up. And I understood it,

297
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,650
but I never heard it. Like I just
always looked at it like, all right,

298
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:20,580
if 20 red heads knocked down
some skyscrapers, you know,

299
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,160
I'd expect to be getting some
looks that next day at the airport.

300
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,470
Does it make it right? But I
wouldn't be sitting there going, oh,

301
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,460
I completely understand
where this is coming from.

302
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,070
And I don't like it cause I'm an it.
I'm an innocent guy.

303
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,450
But I would have the empathy to at least
address where the fear is coming from.

304
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,780
And it's,
I think that if you just fucking do that,

305
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,250
the other side can relax and
maybe listen to your point,

306
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,070
you know,

307
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,250
because that's what happened to me when
I watched that and I watched that kid

308
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:52,510
all of a sudden get a lecture after
that guy said I'd turned my s I could've

309
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
become a bomb.

310
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,590
And I just felt he set the fucking kid
up and then I immediately went into

311
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:01,550
defense mode defending that kid. And I
know, and I didn't even at that point,

312
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:04,880
sit and listen to what this guy had to
say. So then I didn't learn anything.

313
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,070
I would equate that to like, you know,
when people make, try to make a point,

314
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,620
like when people were trying
to teach me who and home.

315
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,380
So much of it started
with, hey, fuck head,

316
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,240
maybe you should try blood. Um,
how do I get past? Hey, fuck it.

317
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,060
I don't know. I like to think that
there was a decent point made in there.

318
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:29,750
I'm sure I'll get a bunch of shit
for that. But um, either way,

319
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,800
it was an interesting
debate, you know, hey,

320
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:38,120
I bought those fucking Boston Celtics
had beat the Cleveland Cavaliers.

321
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,790
What a God's name is a cavalier.

322
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,790
There's probably some fucking
fancy name for white oppressor.

323
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,100
Wait a second,
Kev.

324
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,040
I know you can act cavalier
if your cavalier attitude,

325
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,980
can you ever have a cavalier
attitude and it's like a fucking,

326
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,520
you'll get good thing.
Cavalier is like,

327
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,580
that's like a happy go lucky
upper 1% or you know what I mean?

328
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,660
Like if they were broke,
they be,

329
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:10,740
they be ob Taylor with the fucking
stick over the shoulder with the little

330
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,520
little fish hook on it. You know,
just going to go skip some rocks.

331
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,540
But all of a sudden,
you know,

332
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,280
if you cavalier and you're in the upper
1% is a white dude. That means a, I dunno,

333
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,860
there's a bunch of kids digging for
fucking m diamonds. I don't fucking know.

334
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:30,270
Let me look this up. Okay
hottie disdainful. I, because
I was Ron Hardy. Disdainful

335
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,830
or supercilious.
I don't know what that word is.

336
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,010
An arrogant and cavalier
attitude towards other, offhand

337
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
Cleveland Cavaliers is, is it
anything, it's gotta be something else.

338
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,430
Yeah. Are they really the Cleveland
arrogant concepts that what they,

339
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,280
they named themselves. It can't be
that. It's got a horseman there. It is.

340
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,220
Especially a mounted soldier a night.
Yeah. Oppressive, oppressive wire.

341
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,780
White Guy.
Uh,

342
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,440
one having this spirit
or bearing of a knight.

343
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,240
A courtly gentleman galleon.

344
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,030
These guys are arrogant.
Huh?

345
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,180
A man escorting a woman or acting
as their partner in dancing.

346
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,770
All right. We'll just slowly
get into the NBA lifestyle here.

347
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,850
They're coming out of the shower and all
the whores hanging out waiting to get

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,690
him his fucking magic. Johnson used
to say, you got chastised for that.

349
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,370
These women, they're out to get you after
the show. Oh, that's offensive to women,

350
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,210
not the horse. That's who I
was talking about. Sweetheart,

351
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,990
go back to your soccer mom. Pay
with your red wine. Thank you.

352
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,980
Um,
okay.

353
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,620
And a adherent of an adherent of Charles,

354
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:50,380
the first of England in
his contest with the pound.

355
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,100
It's amazing that I speak this language
in so many words that I've just never

356
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:58,030
seen before and have no idea
how to pronounce. All right.

357
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,310
As an adjective hottie disdainful.

358
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,600
And that's supercilious whatever
the fuck that is. Um, offhand,

359
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,370
that's a good name for a fucking dance.

360
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:10,220
Like one of those meatpacking district
dance clubs I got, I got down at,

361
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,370
it's sell us last night. Am I old
girlfriend? Totally fucking outdated.

362
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,500
And apparently, yeah. Oh No. Getting
onto the transplant. All right.

363
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:21,600
Offhand or unceremonious

364
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,880
of a relating to the Cavaliers.

365
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,600
That's a fucking lazy
definition of relating to a
characteristic of the cavalier

366
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:34,480
poets or their work. All right.
I don't know what a cavalier is.

367
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:39,230
This is either a gentleman,
a knight, a poet,

368
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,940
or a cunt. You know, one of the other,

369
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,250
I guess it depends if you
live in Cleveland or not.

370
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:49,630
They probably think they're a bunch of
gentlemen. They're not yet animals. Oh,

371
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,050
those, that's a special kind of animal
that lives up there in Cleveland.

372
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,943
You know what I mean?

373
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,610
You know why that Lake caught on fire?
It wasn't the lake of Zuora.

374
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,160
You know what it was because so many of
those animals walked into it and bathed.

375
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,510
That's what happened.
They took that beautiful water yeah.

376
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,490
That God made and they turned
it into something flammable.

377
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,770
I'm just kidding.
Yeah.

378
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,410
They always say that mistake by the
lake and they always say that lake eerie

379
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:23,850
caught on fire. It didn't catch on fire.
It was, it was way more understandable.

380
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:24,421
It was like a,

381
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:28,590
I think it was a whatever the runoff that
went into the city and they were just

382
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:33,580
dumping all their pollution into it. They
didn't light a great lake on fire. Um,

383
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,950
I dunno. But now with all that
fracking, the FRAC and down the road,

384
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,090
Shit, I go to get it my goddamn above
ground pool. Next thing you know,

385
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:47,690
I'm having a fucking,
except I'm the main course.

386
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,310
Okay

387
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,450
Sir. We understand
that, uh, you are upset,

388
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:55,260
but we don't feel that our company has
anything to do with your above ground

389
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:58,350
pool catching on fire. Oh,
fuck you in your soup buddy.

390
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,363
Okay.

391
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,830
Um, all right, let's read some advertising
here for this week. Dirty Lemon.

392
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,210
That sounds the only stupid fucking
jokes. Hey, that dirty Sanchez.

393
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:12,350
You know those fucking joke book jokes
and everybody seems to love for fucking

394
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,740
real. When you fucking take
a piece of road speech,

395
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:20,330
slap her in the tit and then you come
on a foot. Oh, is that what it's called?

396
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,830
Doing those jokes.

397
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,400
She's got called the f the get the fuck
Outta here cause I don't wanna hear

398
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,640
anymore. That's stupid. It get really ugly

399
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,330
dude. Rub One out and just fucking
relax with you. Knock Knock Dick Jokes.

400
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,260
All right.
Dirty Lemon.

401
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:40,820
Dirty lemon is a wellness beverage brand
featuring ingredients that have been

402
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:45,440
well established in the, Oh God.
He's another English word. Cancer.

403
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,060
A net ne natural pathic
community nature. Oh. Pathic

404
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,660
naturopathic
knit Toora paddock.

405
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,830
Anyway, so there's three types of
these fucking things right now. Sleep,

406
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:04,310
detox in skin plus hair. Oh
Shit. I might get some of this.

407
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,120
And each one contains the
juice of one lemon, no sugar,

408
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,960
and it's under 10 calories. I have
no idea what the fuck this stuff is.

409
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,680
There's sleep drink for example,
includes magnesium.

410
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,820
Was there anything grosser than milk
of magnesium when you were a kid?

411
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,580
You need some milk of magnesium
came in that blue bottle.

412
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,840
What was that supposed to do?
Coat your esophagus.

413
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:29,830
Okay.

414
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,300
Was that for a fucking sword?
Swallower um,

415
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,060
probably a lot of that
backstage at the circus.

416
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,290
And each one contains the juice of one
lemon. No sugar in is under 10 calories.

417
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,030
Their sleep drink for example, includes
magnesium rosewater and camel meal,

418
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,740
which all help you sleep better.

419
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,870
Evidently I drank one the other night
before bed and I slept like a bear.

420
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,390
Okay.

421
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,050
Why, why wouldn't you send me
this product first and I would,

422
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,540
uh, say something about
better dreams. Oh, okay.

423
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,810
So when I didn't drink this
thing and I slept like a bear,

424
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:12,430
I had this fucking amazing dream that uh,
uh,

425
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:12,911

fucking ride my deck and the Detox is

427
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:21,520
secretly great hangover cure.
Oh, now you are in my wheelhouse.

428
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:26,470
Drink a bottle and the activated
charcoal absorbs toxins in your body.

429
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,560
I would like a 12 pack of that police.

430
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,890
But the best part about dirty lemon is
that the only way to order is via text

431
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:38,980
message. You'll never find
it in stores. Jesus Christ.

432
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:42,520
This is some underground shit to order.
Go to dirty lemon.com.

433
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:45,480
Register your mobile number,
then send them a text message.

434
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,920
Say it all to a real human.
And after a few texts,

435
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,000
a six pack is sent to your door in one
to two days. Once you buy via text,

436
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:57,360
you'll never want to go back. When
you text them, mentioned your hurt.

437
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,140
I'm going to fucking get some of this
shit and I'm going to go out and I'm going

438
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:04,050

That'd be great.

441
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,610
Sitting here with a fucking wife
and a beautiful baby. You know,

442
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,090
you've given me shit for getting drunk.
It's like, Nah, I'm researching a product.

443
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,040
Um,
when you text them,

444
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:20,670
mentioned you heard about it on my podcast
and they'll throw in an extra case of

449
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,520
Lemon.

450
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,433
All right,

451
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,250
come on. You guys are a bunch
of drugs like me, aren't you?

452
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,380
Would you like a little check and
you're fucking Sass Barilla there all

453
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,580
distilled genes. Great genes don't have
to be complicated. Where is the zipper?

454
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,990
If you're not into crazy
stitching diamonds or embedded
studs, you're not alone.

455
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,070
Oh yeah. Remember those true
religion jeans? Jesus Christ.

456
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,870
There's so many people that got those
and knocked up a chicken and now dad's

457
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:09,950
pushing strollers around those fucking
true religion jeans with the stitched

458
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:14,540
horseshoe on the fucking ass pockets and
then the lining down this side. Yeah,

459
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,210
that's standing. That's pushing
somebody on a swing right now,

460
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,970
I'll afraid at the bottom.

461
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,883

463
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,070
The stilt offers luxury grade
denim at an affordable price.

464
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:32,180
Jeans that would normally cost you
hundreds distilled start at just 75 bucks.

465
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:34,850
These are great jeans. I've actually
tried these on. I enjoyed them.

466
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,950
They felt great around my balls and seq
area. Um, they utilize the same fabrics,

467
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,420
factories in wash houses as the best
known brands and designers who works in

468
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:47,610
those places.
Where do you work?

469
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:49,500
I work in a denim wash house.

470

markups and middlemen the result. Pure,

472
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:58,820

on my new fucking youtube page,

568
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,650
youtube.com/user/monday morning podcast.

569
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,300
Once again,

570
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,040
www.youtube.com/users/monday
morning podcast.

571
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,140
I'm going to start doing
those city tours again.

572
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,740
I wanna make little stupid videos.
I'm going to get that fucking thing going.

573
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,950
Speaking of which, I'm going to
be in Phoenix this week, Monday,

574
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,530
Tuesday and Wednesday, flying in Sunday
night to see the fucking Celtics,

575
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,190
Isaiah Thomas p against the
Phoenix Suns there on Sunday night.

576
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,220
I'll see you guys at the game.
Um, oh, I'd also like to thank uh,

577
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,370
some people at the, uh, Tampa Bay
lightning for hooking me in forest.

578
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,840
Shot up with some tickets.

579
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:29,841
We got to see a Nikita coop giraffe get
a hat trick against the Ottawa senators.

580
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,520
It was a great fucking game, great
fucking game. You know, Tampa,

581
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,480
Tampa Bay came out and it was like they
were fucking owning them and then all of

582
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:42,930
a sudden auto it goes, hey
gee, they're easy there.

583
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,420
And then they took control of the
game and then after the fucking,

584
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,420
the first intermission,
I don't know what the,

585
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:50,940
I don't know what sort of a third
time adjustments that they used.

586
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,470
It's not half time for all you non hockey
fans who try to say that there's two

587
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:58,950
half times in hockey, you know, that
always makes me feel smart. I'm like,

588
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,450
mathematically that doesn't make sense.

589
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,210
There's a third and then there's
two thirds through the game.

590
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,080
And if you ever played pickup
hockey three on fucking three,

591
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,950
if you've ever fucking done that and you
look at of, there's no substitutions,

592
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:13,890
you know why? You would know
why they take two breaks. Okay?

593
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,480
Then a fucking lollygagging around like
a bunch of baseball players and they

594
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:23,210
just need to stretch once every
seven 30 there is sprinting.

595
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,010
Someone could beat the shit out of you
and just sit down for five minutes. Okay.

596
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,620
You're going to need to take a couple
of breaks. All right, let's talk.

597
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,670
Gas Monkey garage.

598
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,833
Um,

599
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,120
Monday nights episode was the episode
that they'd been teasing the whole,

600
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,160
the whole fucking season.

601
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,090
The shit that you read about on social
media before the season even started.

602
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,980
The bearded wonder Aaron
Kaufman came back from vacation.

603
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,810
Eh, he fucking just, he
straight up quit. It wasn't,

604
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:59,200
he didn't give notice. A, I'll help you
on a couple of builds. He was just like,

605
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,310
I am out. It's been a great
run. I'll fucking see you later.

606
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,120
And,
uh,

607
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,700
I'm Richard Rollins as
always was hilarious.

608
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,050
It's like I feel like I'm going to Puke.

609
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,733
Okay.

610
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:14,901
Can you go?

611
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:19,280
Oh he's only said that a few times
during the series and it's always fucking

612
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:22,130
hilarious cause I feel like
the word puke is kind of,

613
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,720
that's like from my generation. Like he
graduated high school the same year. I,

614
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,680
I watched the show a lot.
I'm not a psycho, but he,

615
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,700
he mentions all the time he built
that fucking, that mercury comment.

616
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,220
You mentioned that he graduated
high school in 87 and a
I should've graduated in

617
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,780
86, but we're not going to talk. Why,

618
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,630
why I didn't because I'm a cause you
cause you heard cause you hear me read out

619
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:44,720
loud. It should've happened in 86. It
was exciting. I'm a year older than him,

620
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,280
but puke. I just feel like nobody
says that. I never hear it.

621
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:54,020
I don't hear it enough. And he's only said
it a couple times. He said it lat, uh,

622
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,760
on Monday when Aaron quit going to
Puke and he said it when he bought that

623
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:02,150
Ferrari that had been in that major
accident. And it was like his big,

624
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,050
this giant investment, like 300
grand. He went in with the other,

625
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,870
the fucking rich dude up the street
who likes all the European stuff.

626
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,550
I don't know why,
I can't remember his name.

627
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:14,330
I only seen him in fucking 9,000 episodes.
And afterwards he was,

628
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,710
he was so fucking nervous. He was talking
about just, I feel like I'm gonna Puke.

629
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,570
I don't know why. It always
makes me laugh. So anyways, um,

630
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,540
as a fan of the show, you
know, it was like watching
van Halen break up. It's like,

631
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,150
ah, fuck, now they're going
to bring in, you know,

632
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,700
some other guy who was in David Lee Roth,
not shitting on Sammy Hagar, you know,

633
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm just saying, you know what I mean,
you like the be want the original guy.

634
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:43,750
So I was actually happy that they,

635
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,790
they for the rest of the episode.

636
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:50,620
So they was showing Aaron at his
house and he was doing this build.

637
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,210
It was fucking hilarious and everything
fit engine went in, transmission,

638
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:58,600
everything fucking winded fine.
Um,

639
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,150
and then he just got up and took a
break and went over and was feeding his

640
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:06,840
horses and I'm just like, oh, here you
go. Although when he was, you know,

641
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,510
he was trying to make this race car
and he was taking all this shit out,

642
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:11,490
you know, that they don't need
so he can make it lighter,

643
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,260
watching him have to do that by himself.
I bet that kind of sucked. But, um,

644
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,170
I'm just hoping as a fan that Aaron
gets his own shows cause I read a really

645
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:26,490
good interview and it
wasn't all this he said,

646
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,271
she said Shit,

647
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:32,271
it just seemed like he wanted to do
more adventurous builds of cars that,

648
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,140
you know, when you're not on a
TV show, you know what I mean?

649
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,400
You're kind of under the constraint.

650
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:40,230
He was just saying how fast
they will build in cars,

651
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:43,190
kind of limited what they could do.
And uh,

652
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,480
I think that that was probably
the reason why he left.

653
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,660
Just got a little burnt out or whatever.
But um,

654
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,510
it's fucking brutal, man. I mean that was
the guy. So we'll see what happens. But

655
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,580
I have faith, I have faith that they're
going to find someone to replace him.

656
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:04,090
And I'm hoping that I'm going
to get two shows out of it. Um,

657
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,210
I dunno, but whatever. It's definitely
the end of, of a Goddamn era.

658
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,100
And, uh, I'm trying to think of my,

659
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,120
my favorite builds that
they've done on that show. Um,

660
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,200
I always liked the random
shit that they did.

661
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,240
I've mentioned this before.

662
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:26,350
I love when they did that low rider and
I can't remember if it was one of those

663
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,870
like a 85 Oldsmobile cutlass or something.

664
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,010
I love that they just gave Casey a chance
to fucking show off what he could do.

665
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,040
And he was shown all that different
kind of steady just painting it black or

666
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,890
green. But I understand that
they always say, you know,

667
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:42,700
those are the two colors that sell and
you gotta make you fucking money. But, um,

668
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,790
there was another time they built
this car, can't remember what it was,

669
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,280
and it was this white car and on top,

670
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,840
Casey did this lace thing on the hood,
on Msre on the roof.

671
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:56,020
I fucking love that.
Um,

672
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,640
did they have a fucking
Lincoln continental?

673
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:05,530
I've always loved the random
shit as opposed to the,
uh, the more obvious stuff.

674
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:09,040
I love that fucking mercury comment that
they made, although I gotta tell you,

675
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,790
I like to fucking white and blue color
scheme better when they first had it and

676
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:13,960
I liked those rims better,

677
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,440
but if they just did all the gas monkey
shit underneath it and slammed it down

678
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:21,880
to the ground, that's a fucking killer.
Cock. I don't know. I like weird shit.

679
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,363
Um,

680
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,940
and my biggest heartbreak on that show
was one time when Richard Rawlings blot

681
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:32,140
that fucking cab over engine truck, that
jeepers creepers truck. And I was like,

682
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:35,060
oh my God, what the fuck are they
going to do to this? And then he just,

683
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,900
somebody came in like, the next day
I'll give you an extra two grand for,

684
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,570
he's like, I fuck it. Get outta here.
And I was just like, what the hell?

685
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,890
I want to see them build more trucks. I
hope they do. Um, all right. That's it.

686
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,760
Uh,
so good luck to Aaron Kaufman.

687
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,920
I hope I see him on another
TV show or whatever. I,

688
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:57,100
I should give a shout out to his.
Um, he's got, um, he has his own,

689
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:02,770
he's got his own a, um, company, I guess
that builds parts for, believe it or not,

690
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:07,450
Ford f one hundreds. What? I have 68
FordF 100 and I believe it's called,

691
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:12,040
I think it's called arclight. Just
look up, uh, Aaron Kaufman, arclight.

692
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,530
And uh, you'll actually find that
article. I should put a link to it.

693
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,840
It's a really good article
about, um, why he left the show.

694
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:20,080
And I thought I was happy that it wasn't
a bunch of mudslinging or anything like

695
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:20,261
that.

696
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:22,590
It just seemed like it was time and he
wanted to go in a different directions.

697
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:27,010
So, so that's it. Um, that is the
podcast for this fucking week.

698
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,750
Um, no, it isn't this, that's
just me checking in on you.

699
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,330
I'll do the real podcast on Monday.
This is not a real podcast. All right.

700
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,320
That said, go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.

701
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,840
You've constant joy of the music and
equals doing an extra half hour above

702
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,270
greatest hits from a podcast
in a fucking Monday gone by.

703
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,623
Well,

704
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,413
we were

705
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,193
[inaudible].

706
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,230
So anyways,

707
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,910
I went up to see some family over the
4th of July to celebrate the birthday of

708
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:47,890
this country. And, uh, as I'm driving up,

709
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,490
I'm listening on the radio and
evidently I looked up the song on,

710
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,130
uh,
on the Internet.

711
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,610
Okay.

712
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,570
It's a, uh, Carrie Underwood song, who
I don't, I don't know what she has.

713
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:07,040
I'm guessing she's white cause it sounded
country and she had a little Twang in

714
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,740
her voice, but I don't want to
piss off any Koreans out there.

715
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,710
She might've been Korean,
um,

716
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,160
as a song called before he cheats.

717
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,470
So I'm driving a log and you know,
I'm driving my buddy's car.

718
00:44:21,471 --> 00:44:23,600
This is how I'm going to
fucking defend myself.

719
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:26,440
That I was on a radio station that was
actually playing this and I was just sort

720
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,650
of clicking the, uh,
the preprogram radios,

721
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,170
fucking whatever. You know what I'm
saying? I'm home, I'm feel like shit.

722
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,420
Cut me some slack this week. So
anyways, this song comes on and this,

723
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:43,680
this Carrie Underwood CIC is sitting
there singing this song going a rat.

724
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,680
Now he's probably slow dancing.

725
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,140
I have a bed Pratt now and she's
singing about her boyfriend.

726
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,340
I got the lyrics right here right now.

727
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:57,140
He's probably buying her some fruity
little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey

728
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,170
right now. He's probably up
behind her with the pool stick,

729
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,330
showing her how to shoot a combo.

730
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,330
And then they go into the chorus
and she goes and he don't know,

731
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,040
um,

732
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,040
that I dug my keys into the side of his
pretty little souped up four wheel drive

733
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,080
car of my name and to his leather seats.

734
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,570
I took a Louisville
slugger to both headlights,

735
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:22,480
slashed a hole in all four tires.

736
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,520
And all I could think was,
why don't you just break up with them?

737
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,050
You dumb cunt.

738
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,573
You know what I mean?

739
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,160
What are you going to do?
You're going to do all this shit.

740
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,020
Then he's going to get mad and then what
you're going to make up after five days

741
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:41,520
and then you're going to blow him again.

742
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,810
I hate this fucking song and I'm going
to tell you why, because it's, I,

743
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,760
I'm pretty sure it's a hit.
It's on the radio, right? Uh,

744
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,940
I dunno.
And you,

745
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:57,250
what do I love about this is people will
listen to this song and they won't even

746
00:45:57,251 --> 00:46:01,030
question the rationale of what
the fuck someone's doing in there.

747
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:04,600
Because so many people in life,
myself included,

748
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,120
you, you, you, you play,
you like powerless in life.

749
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,190
You just play the powerless card,

750
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,473
you know,

751
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,600
just get out of the fucking relationship.
I fucking hate this song.

752
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,930
And this is one of these songs too.
We're fucking women all get together.

753
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:25,770
They start singing, hey guy,
cat, I don't even ask her.

754
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,840
You're all a bunch of dumb cunts.
Okay, you're fucking stupid.

755
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,410
Just break up with the guy.
Just break up with them.

756
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:39,330
Not even to mention the fact that now
you're going out there and you're,

757
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,560
you're, you're doing damage. You, I don't
know, is that a fella that's not a felony?

758
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:44,394
I don't know what it is,

759
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,750
but it's just a classic thing where a
woman would listen to that song and at no

760
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:52,530
point would she ever think, man,
maybe I could get arrested for this.

761
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,390
I am damaging somebody's property.
No, you got fucking vagina.

762
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,520
You can just go out in broad daylight.

763
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,590
You don't even have to
wear a fucking mask.

764
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,920
Do you know what I would have to do
if I wanted to go out and go fuck up

765
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:08,100
somebody's car? I would have
to wait for the, first of all,

766
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:11,310
I had to make sure I had an alibi.
It'd be like I was killing somebody.

767
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,370
I had to make sure somebody could
cover for me and say that I was fucking

768
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:15,390
somewhere.
Right.

769
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,460
I had to put on some goddamn cat
suit and a fucking a mask. Right?

770
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,680
Like I'm in there dead presidents
movie and all I would able to get,

771
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,980
I'd be able to get off one quick
hit, right? One quick kid, let's,

772
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,570
I want to start carving it up
like a pussy. Right? But if I,

773
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:34,330
if I really was going to go out there
and smash somebodies head lights,

774
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,360
I can hit one and the second
the car alarm goes off,

775
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,640
I have to fucking take
off and then run home,

776
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,760
get out of my little fucking fucking a
little cat suit and then try to put on my

777
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:47,770
pajamas.
So when the cops show up,

778
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,230
because you know they're going to
find some sort of fucking fingerprint,

779
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,910
I got to act like I'm not out of breath.

780
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,910
Like I actually have been sitting there
for fucking eight hours watching TV.

781
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,340
I Dunno, I just, I can't stand, you know,
it just reminds me of when that movie,

782
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,490
a fatal attraction came out,
right.

783
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,330
And the amount of women who would just sit
there and you see that movie, Eh? Yeah.

784
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,620
That's what you get.
And as t yet, you know,

785
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,010
there's no thought of like
this bitch put a rabbit in,

786
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:19,820
in boiling water.
There's none of that women there.

787
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,080
They're out of their fucking minds.
But that's not even the point of this.

788
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,810
My point of the Carrie Underwood song,

789
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,110
it actually made me feel like a loser
because the amount of fucking times,

790
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,090
I mean I haven't gone out
and fucked up somebody's car,

791
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:34,600
but the amount of times you don't,
what does that song is that song,

792
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,720
it's a powerless song.
That's what the fuck it is.

793
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:42,010
And I went to the whole lyrics to see if
she breaks up with them in the end and

794
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:47,011
there's sort of an ambiguous line in
the end where she goes a cause the next

795
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:50,650
time he cheats, oh you
know, it won't be on me.

796
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,920
So that's sort of ambiguous because it
could mean because I broke up with them

797
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,430
or it could be because he doesn't
want to get his truck fucked up.

798
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:05,390
So I dunno. You know, I just,

799
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,610
it just fucking annoys me.

800
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,350
That song just annoyed the shit out of me

801
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,960
on both levels where you got somebody,
it's like,

802
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:22,540
just break up with the guy
and your solution is,

803
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,780
you know something,
if a girl ever fucking cheated on me that,

804
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:27,160
that I would break up with them.

805
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:32,970
I'm not saying I wouldn't flip out
and I give him a good fucking trashing

806
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,850
verbally, but I would
never go in like, uh,

807
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,210
what, you know, throw all their clothes
out in the front lawn and Burnham.

808
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,670
You know, why wouldn't I do that?
I don't know. I don't know why.

809
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,440
I think a lot of it has to do,

810
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,620
cause I'd be fucking worried I'd
get arrested for damaging property.

811
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,720
Why do women have an exemption from
damaging property? I don't understand it.

812
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:05,530
Have a woman sat there
smashing up somebody's car
and broad daylight because the

813
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:10,400
guy cheated on him. People would
be laughing. I would be laughing.

814
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,820
Everyone. It, we, it's, it's
a comedy. It's just hilarious.

815
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,210
But if the exact same scenario
was going down and a guy did it,

816
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,710
it'd be the classic, you know, the cops
come and they put you in that little,

817
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,060
you get tasered and they mush your face
into the fucking pavement. I Dunno,

818
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,990
I get it. Women have carry a kid around
in that goddamn stomach for nine months,

819
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,310
but I don't think that gives you the right
to go out and tack somebody fee Arrow

820
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:37,430
. I really don't. You know, so why
don't you guys just fucking relax.

821
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:43,070
All right. Yeah. A bunch of
Goddamn Psychos, you know,

822
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,100
with your, I'm on my period
excuse, so three weeks a month,

823
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:50,680
you're out of your fucking mind.
I think if a girl goes,

824
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:53,320
even if you were cheating on
a girl or on a woman, right?

825
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:54,460
And she fucks up your car,

826
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:58,600
I really think you ought to be able to
go up to her and give her a nice fucking

827
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:01,510
two piece combination to
the Goddamn fucking cabbage.

828
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,630
What do you think about
that? Right? Just fucking,

829
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:07,090
just hook off on that fucking

830
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,440
hair teased head a lettuce on the
top of her fucking shoulders. Right?

831
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,420
What would you go with?

832
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,690
I'm really gonna alienate a
lot of my thoughts on this one,

833
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,280
and I want you to know that most of this
is not me advocating punching a woman

834
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:23,870
in the face.
Most of this is,

835
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,980
I can't fucking sit in this
stupid hotel room anymore.

836
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,280
I can't fucking do it.
I've had the Goddamn

837
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,050
okay.

838
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,330
Do not disturb light
on for like four days.

839
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:37,750
They probably think I overdosed in here.
I'm really big on that.

840
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:40,810
Don't clean up the
room. Beat it. You know,

841
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,350
you gotta come in and every three days
and change the sheets. Like I'm a royalty.

842
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,800
I changed his sheets like
fucking once every three weeks.

843
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,840
Maybe that's the only if that's only
if they are white and I could tell how

844
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:56,620
filthy they are. That's right. Wrinkle
your nose up. You fucking pop his broads.

845
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:00,850
That's how I live my life. Um,
Jesus, why am I attacking women?

846
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,670
I don't know why. What was I
talking about? Oh yeah. If you,

847
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,210
if you could punch a woman in a face,
you're allowed to punches,

848
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:10,900
what would you go with?
Okay. What'd you go? Classic.

849
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,840
Would you set up the
overhand right with the jab?

850
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:16,900
Would you actually waste the
jet? You know, waste a jab?

851
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,480
Would you go, this is just
evil. All right, I gotta get
off this fucking subject.

852
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,130
I know that song just annoyed me.
Um,

853
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,740
I hate those fucking songs when women
just just openly talk about how they're

854
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,040
going to go out and destroy a guy's
fucking property rather than break up with

855
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:37,270
them, you know? And it's considered
some sort of justification,

856
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,570
you know, rather than looking
inward going, you know,

857
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,030
maybe I'm a bad judge of character.

858
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,250
What sort of qualities am
I looking for in somebody?

859
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,380
And I'll date that.
I mean,

860
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,250
didn't the fact that the guy had a
souped up four wheel drive truck,

861
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,240
didn't that give it all up within that?
Give it away on any fucking level.

862
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,910
Huh? In his, I mean, souped up four
wheel drive truck, Carrie Underwood,

863
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,070
your dumb fucking, what
else did he have? Huh?

864
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:10,840
A a fucking earring hanging down with
a lightening bolt on the side of it.

865
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:15,150
I have this fucking song sticks.
This is one of the,

866
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:18,330
you know why I hate to sign this and
I'm going to do my whole podcast on this

867
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:21,120
fucking song. This is going to
be one of those fucking songs.

868
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,180
When I'm the raw on the
road and I'm hating my life,

869
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:28,920
you and I just don't want to go back
to the hotel room and be lonely and I'm

870
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:33,060
going to go out to a bar and that
song's going to come on and fucking four

871
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:37,530
fucking twats with their ear piercing.
I'm singing and I'm drunk.

872
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,430
High pitch voices are going to start
singing every fucking word of that song.

873
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,590
Liked it. They liked these
fucking cunt bad asses. Okay.

874
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,570
Okay. And I'm done.
Alright, I'm done with that.

875
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:52,300
I'm done with that fucking Oh
Jesus Christ. That fucking suck.

876
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,513
[inaudible] [inaudible]

877
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,600
hey,
what's going on?

878
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:54,800
It is Bill Burger and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday.

879
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,050
Uh, what does it March 1st, 2009. Ah,

880
00:55:00,051 --> 00:55:02,240
in like a lamb out like a lion.

881
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:07,100
I ate all that old fucking crap.
They always talk about, you know,

882
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,050
I've got to look at some
fucking groundhog in the,

883
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,390
what are they going to let that shit go?
You know? Yeah. I've done mall shows.

884
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:19,230
It's fucking left ball. Then it's
gonna rain for the next nine Dars Jag.

885
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,330
Hey nobody's, he's to dress up in a
top hat like it's the fucking old days.

886
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,350
You know what I mean?
Some people are just so fucking married.

887
00:55:27,351 --> 00:55:29,330
It's disgusting that
they, they, they just,

888
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,860
that's all just repressed
like sexual energy. You know,

889
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,810
they've been banging this same broad
until their fucking uterus dried out.

890
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,423
You know?

891
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,920
So now they got to go out and they got
to dress like fucking JP Morgan waiting

892
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:52,060
for some wrote in to stick his fucking
head out and then they got, you know,

893
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,020
and if you're not familiar with
the expression, they have a,

894
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:59,080
what is it in like a lamb out
like a lion and like a lamb out.

895
00:55:59,081 --> 00:56:02,470
Like I don't know what the fuck it
means. You know, if it starts off good,

896
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,740
it's going to end bad.
If it starts off bad,

897
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:10,150
it's going to end a good,
that's how that would go.

898
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,330
I am completely not even fucking
prepared for this podcast.

899
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:18,520
Usually I wait until about 45 minutes
in and I let you guys figure it out that

900
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:20,320
the podcast is going
to suck for this week.

901
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:23,860
But I'm going to give you a warning almost
like have you ever see like going to

902
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,120
movies coming out and they say a,
this film has yet to be rated.

903
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,760
That means usually that
means it sucks so bad.

904
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,100
We're trying to keep it
away from the critics.

905
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,980
So by the time you figure out it's sucks,

906
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,840
you're going to be looking
at your date like, Oh God,
you know what, I saw trailer,

907
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,990
we all going to be bad. Will
Smith is in it. You know,

908
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:47,860
he's playing some homeless guys
that even in the world. Um, yeah,

909
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:52,780
this podcast is gonna suck.
Um, I just got back from, uh,

910
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,410
I was in, uh, Houston, Texas and uh,

911
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,290
I was so good in Texas and
I don't mean comedically.

912
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,170
I mean as a person that I'm,

913
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:06,970
I was just mind numbingly boring fucking,
you know,

914
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:11,590
I'm not drinking no internet porn.
You can't do it. It's impossible. No,

915
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,590
there's never an expression out there
that says beware of the man that has no

916
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,630
vice, isn't there? Hmm.
Can I just ask you that?

917
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,390
Can I just fucking throw that out there?
You know what?

918
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:26,470
This is why this sucks right now cause
I'm actually fucking trying to pull

919
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:31,471
something up right now that I have to
play because yesterday was probably the

920
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:36,760
biggest fucking hockey game
in the United States. Um,

921
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,930
yeah, probably since, uh, 1980.
That's what they're saying.

922
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:45,340
I don't want to use that hack thing,
dude, I don't want to do that.

923
00:57:45,341 --> 00:57:46,780
But it was fucking huge.

924
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,590
Evidently 75% of Canada,

925
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,620
they were estimating was watching the
gold medal game and for all you Americans,

926
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,500
actually not Americans, all you, all
you people from the United States, uh,

927
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,720
the u s has a hockey team,

928
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:07,660
I'll call team USA and every four
years they play in the Olympics and a,

929
00:58:07,661 --> 00:58:12,070
we made it to the final round for the
gold medal and that game was yesterday.

930
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,790
I know it's a little obnoxious,
but that's how I felt in Houston.

931
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,310
If 75% of the people who
are watching it in Canada,

932
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:22,210
I don't think there was more than 75
people watching it in fucking Houston.

933
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:25,960
They just completely didn't give a shit.
I went down, this is basic, basically,

934
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:30,010
I don't want to ruin it for
you, but a Canada one, um,

935
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,210
they just played a better game. I think
that they, they were a better team. Uh,

936
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:36,250
yesterday, I don't know what they
did. Figured out their lines,

937
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:39,400
but it was night and day since we, uh,
beat them the week before how they looked,

938
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:41,500
they looked awesome. I definitely
thought they were a better team.

939
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:43,870
And what I liked was nobody really choked.

940
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:49,000
There wasn't any bullshit fucking
calls. Um, I'll fuck you Canada.

941
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,850
What the offsite thing. You guys got
enough penalty. Shut the fuck up.

942
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,680
I want to hear it. You won the game. Um,

943
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,500
but that play was off sides
and we did get a goal,

944
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,400
but you know what I'm saying.
But it was pretty much, it was,

945
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,990
it was free of that and it
went into overtime. And uh,

946
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,420
I so wanted the United
States to win because, uh,

947
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,560
obviously I'm a huge, it was on two
levels. Obviously I'm a huge hockey fan,

948
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:19,210
but then secondly,
the level with which Canada gives a shit,

949
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,010
it is very few times that

950
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:27,010
you get a chance to devastate an entire
nation and it doesn't involve dropping

951
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:32,510
bombs on them. You know, like
if we want that hockey game, um,

952
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,860
I don't know what they
would've been doing.

953
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,710
Those people would have been slitting
their wrists up there and their rig loose.

954
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,780
Sorry, I just had to throw some
ignorant American shit out there.

955
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,450
Like you guys are fucking smart
up there smoking cigarettes,

956
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,710
sitting in a fucking Tim Hortons eating
another fucking donut. What you think?

957
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:49,940
I never been to Calgary.

958
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,140
You know think you never thought I took
that fucking highway up to Edmonton.

959
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,460
Pass all those fucking
cows in the oil wells.

960
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,580
Fucking guys. Everybody's acting
like their cosmopolitan. All worldly.

961
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,210
Even these days,
I'm getting tired of it.

962
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,740
I'm tired of listening to the fucking
hype about how fucking stupid Americans

963
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:16,150
are. People who misstates here,
not North Americans in general.

964
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,480
Just people from the fucking states.

965
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:22,010
And then you travel and you run into the
exact same shithead that you are with a

966
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:24,770
different accent. All right? Get over
your fucking cells. But you know,

967
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:27,740
I got to give it up.
Got to give it up. Uh,

968
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:32,870
they won the fucking game.
So I figured I'd find the gayest

969
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,730
version.
That national anthem.

970
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,283
True.

971
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,770
I think this was a, I don't know if this
was old town or if this was in sync.

972
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:49,430
Who did this one? This is a tribute
to Canada. Our friends up north

973
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:55,430
never harmed a fly.
Never started a war.

974
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,150
Like to pretend you're from Paris.
Alright. Stop blaming the east.

975
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:07,190
That arrogance goes right across the
country. Stop with the arm down to Earth.

976
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,850
Cause I'm from Winnipeg. I'm not buying
it all you guys. You look down on us.

977
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,540
Okay. I can't even listen to the
rest. I gotta I gotta leave it.

978
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:16,950
You won the fucking gold medal.
Go ahead.

979
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:19,080
I bet you guys a tearing up
up there right now. Aren't you

980
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:25,380
crying into your fucking, I don't
know what, some sort of winter garb.

981
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,250
Oh,
is there any worse than acapella singing?

982
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,840
What is the worst mimes or
Acapella? I think. I think

983
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:40,170
Acappella Leisha can't hear him or
him. What's the deal? Yeah. Right.

984
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,080
Sons of bitches you want again,
but by the skinny teeth.

985
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,710
Congratulations.
Your fucks.

986
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,210
It's a hell of a game. Does a hell of a
Goddamn game. You know, the best part was,

987
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,290
was, uh, the United States.

988
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,590
For those of you in America who
didn't fucking watch it, uh,

989
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,800
Zack per se, or the fuck you
say his last name is, he, uh,

990
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:05,890
he fucking tied it up with 20 seconds
left and 75% of Canada collectively shit

991
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:08,670
their pants. And I was like, oh my God,

992
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:13,620
it's going to happen now that they
soiled themselves. Ah, you know,

993
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,620
they just fucking annoy me.

994
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,980
They're cocky fans annoy
me every fucking it

995
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,800
would come down. Right. Anytime
you Americans doing anything good,

996
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,460
they'd always be that fucking
idiot wrapped in the, the America,

997
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:30,390
the fucking Canadian flag
gesturing at the fucking ice.

998
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,680
Like the ref miss something.

999
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:36,030
That's what I don't like about Canadians
when it comes to hockey is their

1000
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,210
fucking, you know, this is our game.

1001
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,830
Did we get pissed when the Blue
Jays won the fucking world series?

1002
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,900
I maybe a little bit. I was a, you know,
I don't know. Fuck, I don't remember.

1003
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:49,591
You know,

1004
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:54,591
I did realize that the fucking Stanley
Cup has not been in Canada since 1993,

1005
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:00,630
you know, so maybe that's why they went
so crazy. Hey, what the fuck did they do?

1006
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,770
The metals,
by the way,

1007
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,340
I kind of tapped out in the last couple
of Olympics that you still look cool.

1008
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,200
It used to look like an Oreo cookie,

1009
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,080
but it was made out of gold that had
the same sort of engraving, right.

1010
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,130
Had there like the Olympic sign and now
it looks like you took the metal and you

1011
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:18,420
put it on the fucking railroad
tracks. Somebody ran over
it. You know what I mean?

1012
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,110
I don't know. Whatever. I'm
fucking around. Congratulations. A,

1013
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,010
that was a great game. It was great
for hockey, but it was definitely a,

1014
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,920
all you guys out there, listen to me
talk shit, you know, and enjoying, uh,

1015
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,470
Peyton Manning, uh, losing the
Superbowl fucking up and all that. Uh,

1016
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:33,900
the Karma came back around.

1017
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,880
I was devastated all by
myself out in Houston. And,

1018
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,040
uh, but it was, it was still
great, man. And, you know, I,

1019
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:44,810
I did make fun of Michael will
bond saying when he said, ah,

1020
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,700
this is the best hockey out there.
I gotta admit,

1021
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,600
I gotta admit without the A,
without the fighting.

1022
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,170
Um, the, uh, I don't know. Do you guys
like no touch icing, automatic icing?

1023
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,700
I liked a lot of it.
I got to admit,

1024
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:03,930
I kind of liked the PG version of hockey.

1025
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,290
It was kind of Nice. This is sacrilegious
to be saying this, but I kind of,

1026
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:10,050
I kind of enjoyed it,
you know, to be great.

1027
01:04:10,051 --> 01:04:12,900
If a couple of goons would make it
to the fucking, the Olympic squad,

1028
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,750
you just so good. They put you on
there. You just have like, you know,

1029
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:20,310
George La rock verse. Uh, I dunno
who's the other big heavyweight,

1030
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,600
that fucking who's at big going on,
on uh,

1031
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,960
Minnesota with that weird last name that
has like three letter bs and an n in it

1032
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:34,770
or some shit. I don't fucking
know. Anyways, let's plow
ahead with the podcast.

1033
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,240
This is the Monday morning podcast
from Monday, March 1st. Uh,

1034
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:41,840
the rent is due and, um, yeah,

1035
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,810
I had a hell of a fucking weekend
out there in Houston, Texas.

1036
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,960
I want to thank everybody who
came out to the Improv. And, um,

1037
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:53,040
I had great shows Friday night that led
into Saturday night and Saturday night.

1038
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:57,690
I think I might've had two of the best
shows I've had in recent memory. Um,

1039
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,190
they were just, uh, everything
sort of clicked. I kind of,

1040
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:06,920
I was sitting in this
restaurant, um, eh, this is,

1041
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:08,850
this is how clean living I am.
Okay.

1042
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:13,851
It's right before 7:00 AM I have an a
salad with fucking a chicken breast in it.

1043
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:19,090
Right? I got my laptop, I'm typing out
this fucking script, finishing it up,

1044
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:22,480
drinking a glass of water,
getting the shit out of the way.

1045
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,360
And I just remember like,
just having this feeling like this,

1046
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:28,960
this is what Tony Robbins does,
you know?

1047
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,360
And that's how he has that fucking psycho,

1048
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:36,580
terminally happy fucking smile
on his face, you know? And um,

1049
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,270
I don't know. I realized some shit in
that moment. I brought it to stage.

1050
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:43,960
I started riffing. The whole fucking
thing worked. And I recorded it. But

1051
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,970
the beautiful thing about the universe
is when you hit something great happens,

1052
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,190
something else has to balance it out.

1053
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:55,900
Like I get to see Peyton manning fuck
up the Superbowl and thus make me feel

1054
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:58,270
vindicated.
And then two weeks later,

1055
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,200
a crushing fucking over time loss.
It wasn't crushing cause they used,

1056
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:05,050
they used to beat us by fucking,
they used to be this like seven to one.

1057
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,980
All right, you gotta admit.
Okay, you can at a Fox.

1058
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:12,430
Remember that back in the day it was a
joke. Our hockey was a joke. First of all,

1059
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,530
90% of the people in the
league were all from Canada.

1060
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:18,160
Granted they were only six
fucking teams, but still, um,

1061
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,420
and you guys used to crush us and now
we're breathing down your neck and you

1062
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:24,730
better enjoy that gold medal cause I
got a feeling that's the last one you're

1063
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,650
going to be fucking having for
awhile. How are you like dad? Huh?

1064
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,530
Now you wait till fucking next year buddy.
Ah,

1065
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,980
can you guys handle that shit
talking? All right. Anyways,

1066
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:40,240
so twice this weekend I had
incidents with people in the crowd.

1067
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:45,820
Um, and both of them were women. And A,

1068
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:48,700
I'm the first to tell you that I do have
fucking issues with women, but the, uh,

1069
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:53,200
the first night, um, I was on stage
and there was this woman write down,

1070
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,740
I don't know if it's stage left to
stage right from where I'm fucking at it

1071
01:06:56,741 --> 01:06:58,990
stage left.
All right?

1072
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,870
So I think that's the proper terminology.

1073
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,810
Why the fuck do you guys need
to know stage left stage, right?

1074
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:09,070
You're in the crowd. You
know, I go down to midas.

1075
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:11,710
Do I need to know what fucking wrench
they're gonna use? I don't need, okay,

1076
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:15,880
so stage left or right, I'm looking
down and a, this fucking girl is, she's,

1077
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:19,510
you know, she's talking,
continue on with my jokes.

1078
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:24,340
They look down and she's still talking.
So finally I say, hey, it is sweet tits.

1079
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:28,690
Why don't you a, what's the
problem? What are you talking about?

1080
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:32,080
And then she does the usual [inaudible],
you know,

1081
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,440
I wouldn't say she was attractive
if she was in from a small town.

1082
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:39,850
She be a Hottie, you know, just
out of percentages. But um,

1083
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,090
so she did the usual like,
what, what? I have a,

1084
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:46,240
I had no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
You know, 10 minutes later I look back,

1085
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:48,850
she's still fucking talking.
It gets a little more heated.

1086
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:53,080
I basically went to her table about six
times until I finally told her to shut

1087
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:57,310
the fuck up and then I don't really even
fuck her. Remember? Then all of a sudden,

1088
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,001
next thing you know,

1089
01:07:58,001 --> 01:08:01,510
she's hammered and she's getting kicked
out when I got like five minutes left in

1090
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:05,110
my show, so she threatened to sue
the place and all this type of shit.

1091
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:08,710
Now usually that's the end of the night,
you know,

1092
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,730
the whole crowd is fucking clapping as
she's leaving because she's been fucking

1093
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:16,640
annoying. Everybody around
them who paid to see the show.

1094
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:22,100
All right, so usually that's the end of
it. But you know what this psycho did.

1095
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:27,130
She actually sent a letter to the Improv
and she tried to pretend that she,

1096
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:29,960
that she wasn't herself.

1097
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:34,220
She tried to pretend that she was an
impartial member of the audience who

1098
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:38,600
completely agreed with her and thought
that I was a fucking idiot. So, uh,

1099
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:42,280
I want to read you a little bit
of this fucking letter here. Um,

1100
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:47,240
to whom it may concern, I attended bill
burrs first show on Friday, the, uh,

1101
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:51,350
the 26th and was utterly
appalled by his performance.

1102
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:56,510
I love comedy. Oh, this is what you
always have to do whenever you bitch. Um,

1103
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,290
and you're not there in person so they
can't see what a radiant human being you

1104
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:02,960
are. You have to then
after you state your bitch,

1105
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:07,630
you then have to fucking
show how easygoing you are
as a human being. So anyway,

1106
01:09:07,631 --> 01:09:11,540
she saw my show. She was utterly appalled
by, by my performance. And then she goes,

1107
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:15,140
I love comedy and I certainly
expect there to be rudeness,

1108
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,620
crudity and what can be offensive topics.

1109
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:23,870
That's what comedy is all about. It
makes it fun. That being said, okay,

1110
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:27,970
now she's established how fucking cool
and laid back she is back to trash and oh

1111
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:30,800
, fucking howdy duty. Here
she goes. That being said,

1112
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:35,270
Bill Bird took it way too far and he was
quite unprofessional to say the least.

1113
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:39,740
While initially there was indeed
quite a lot to laugh at. Yeah.

1114
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:42,620
That was the part where you was sober,
your fucking lightweight.

1115
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:47,090
That was the beginning of the show when
you weren't fucking on your nine fucking

1116
01:09:47,091 --> 01:09:50,510
drink and you are actually paying
attention to the show. So yeah,

1117
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:54,210
initially there was indeed quite
a lot to laugh at. I ain't,

1118
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:58,070
this person's trying to write as if
it's medieval times and I should be like

1119
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:01,610
fucking holding this thing like a goddamn
scroll. I know that isn't medieval ish,

1120
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:02,361
but she's used,

1121
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:05,750
she's doing that biblical thing where
she's using extra fucking words to try to

1122
01:10:05,751 --> 01:10:07,160
sound intelligent.
Well,

1123
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:10,760
initially there was indeed quite a
lot to laugh at instead of being,

1124
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,840
at first it was funny. Um,
anyways, the show ended up,

1125
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:19,580
the show ended up being a complete
disappointment okay for it. Okay.

1126
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:23,020
This is her complaint here for at
least 30 minutes. He, blasphemy,

1127
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,790
God and the name of Jesus Christ.

1128
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:29,150
He outright degraded the
Catholic religion. All right.

1129
01:10:29,151 --> 01:10:33,260
Now that's complete bullshit.
I only blasphemy God,

1130
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:37,160
the name of Jesus Christ and the Catholic
religion for about seven minutes.

1131
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,090
30 minutes. What, what am
I fucking George Carlin,

1132
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,890
I can't talk about
anything but 30 minutes.

1133
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:46,040
Maybe you weren't so fucking
hammered. You'd dumped cunt. You know,

1134
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,490
you'd have a better perception of,
of, of how much time in a lapsed.

1135
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,670
Oh Jesus. All right, let's
continue. Although I'll go,

1136
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,520
that's this and another thing,
another thing w was she,

1137
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:01,040
she's pulling this move again. He
outright degraded the Catholic religion,

1138
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:05,210
although I do not belong to this religion.
So now you're supposed to be like,

1139
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,420
wow,
she's not even part of that religion.

1140
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,170
And even she found it offensive.
Have you guys picked up on that?

1141
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:16,530
On Youtube at all? Like when
someone wants to trash Obama, um,

1142
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,200
they'll say like Obama is
the worst president ever.

1143
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,880
And then the right and I'm a democrat. You
know, like you can prove it either way.

1144
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,020
Just trying to cut people off the past
before they go, fuck you, you Fox News,

1145
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:30,390
watching right-wing, whatever. You know,

1146
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:35,740
women need to shut the fuck up. And
I'm a girl, that dumb shits. Okay.

1147
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:39,040
So evidently she was,
she was offended and she's not even a,

1148
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,210
she's not even Catholic anyway.

1149
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:45,210
She said it was offensive and
what he said went on and on again,

1150
01:11:45,911 --> 01:11:50,560
while this type of thing should be accept
a expected, he took it way too far.

1151
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:51,400
Um,

1152
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:56,400
and there was a young lady who like I
and my friends was becoming offended.

1153
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:00,910
Yeah, of course she was because
she's you, you fucking psycho.

1154
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,820
Can you believe that she
thinks I'm this fucking stupid.

1155
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,210
And I know at this point is
probably not obvious to you guys,

1156
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:08,920
but wait till I finish the rest of this.
All right.

1157
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,620
I'm probably going to sound like some
maniac here, but I don't give a fuck.

1158
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,850
I said there was a young lady who like
I and my friends was becoming offended

1159
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,440
and said a few words instead of
few words to someone at our table,

1160
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,450
you fucking lion sack a Twat. Anyways, uh,

1161
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:29,500
she, he said when he rudely addressed
her, that's when I said, Hey lady,

1162
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,200
I guess lady is rude.
Hey Lady,

1163
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,610
could you do me a favor and maybe
look at the show at some point. Um,

1164
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:39,850
he said when he really addressed her,
she told him that she was Catholic.

1165
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:43,660
That never happened.
He had no apologies or considerations.

1166
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:48,450
Just utter disrespect. Okay? First
of all, she never said that out.

1167
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,980
She never said she was Catholic.
And if she did, she said,

1168
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,140
it's so quietly that I couldn't hear it.

1169
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:57,280
So how the fuck could this random fucking
woman in the crowd hear what she said?

1170
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:03,090
Oh, this fucking thing. It's gonna make
me mad again. Alright, let's continue.

1171
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:06,930
After he finally got off that subject,
his show just got worse.

1172
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,840
This is when she's on
about her sixth strength.

1173
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,320
It appeared to my friends and I that he
may have been getting heat from some of

1174
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,960
the audience and that
he felt uncomfortable.

1175
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,310
This may very well be the reason why
he continued to pick on the lady,

1176
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:25,390
the lady. This is why I'm picking
on her, not because she, I,

1177
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,940
and as I'm doing my act,
by the way,

1178
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:30,330
I keep looking down and she's getting
some sort of Martini thing that looks like

1179
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:32,580
there's a beer in it.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

1180
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,550
It's one of those chick fucking drinks,
you know,

1181
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,880
like what if we take rid pair and
second fucking roofie in it? You know,

1182
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:42,270
she was drinking those
things. Okay. And uh,

1183
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,750
so now she goes in this
very male, uh, he goes,

1184
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,430
this may very well be the reason why he
continued to pick on that lady even at

1185
01:13:50,431 --> 01:13:53,160
one point telling her to shut the fuck up.
Yeah.

1186
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:57,810
I told you to shut the fuck up because
you were talking the entire time you Twat

1187
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:01,170
anyways. A, this is
downright unprofessional.

1188
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,950
Who said that someone cannot say a
few words to people at their table.

1189
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,410
Did you see how obvious this is that
this is this the actual fucking woman who

1190
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:12,940
would give a fuck this much?
That you would write three pages.

1191
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:17,620
They were quietly speaking and not
making any noise whatsoever. Oh,

1192
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:22,150
yet you heard her say that she was
Catholic on the other side of the stage.

1193
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,780
There was another table,
uh,

1194
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:27,940
talking quite a bit more and they were
louder due to the drinks yet he did not

1195
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:31,690
pick on them. Do you want to fucking all,

1196
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,140
let me just fucking relax here.
This isn't even funny anymore.

1197
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,640
Like I totally lost. I have, I've
lost the whole humor in this.

1198
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:39,700
This is fucking making me so mad.
They were more disruptive than anything,

1199
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,130
although he of course made jokes about it.
All right?

1200
01:14:42,131 --> 01:14:44,770
There was this table next to me.
They were also drinking,

1201
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,190
but they were more doing that church thing
where I would say something funny and

1202
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:51,400
then they was sorta like fucking repeating
it so they were a little bit rowdy,

1203
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,600
but they were acceptable.

1204
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:56,380
This woman who was fucking out drinking
everyone at the other table had

1205
01:14:56,381 --> 01:15:00,550
basically essentially her fucking back
to me to the point that if I fucking

1206
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:04,120
punched her in the back of the head, I
would've got two minutes for boarding pat.

1207
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:07,720
Possibly a fucking game is conduct.
All right. There is something for you.

1208
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:11,650
Olympic hockey, fucking people. Anyways,
let's, let's continue here. Actually,

1209
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:12,670
that would be roughing,
wouldn't it?

1210
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,940
Let's say I took the mic stand
and I turned it sideways.

1211
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,450
I could have crosschecked her on the
fucking neck. All right, here we go.

1212
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:23,440
We are convinced that his wrong
demeanor was due to his discomfort.

1213
01:15:23,441 --> 01:15:27,400
After realizing that he had offended
some of the audience in order to justify

1214
01:15:27,401 --> 01:15:30,130
himself and ease any tension
coming from the audience member,

1215
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:33,160
he said something along the lines of,
don't listen to me.

1216
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,610
I'm just an idiot up here speaking.
Pray for me please.

1217
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,960
That was obviously a demonstration
of his uneasiness that this is,

1218
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:43,900
this is how drunk she was.
What I was doing was I was,

1219
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:48,610
I was telling people in the crowd that
if they were religious that I respected

1220
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,030
their religion. All right? I just ha,

1221
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,850
I just personally don't buy into it.
Okay,

1222
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:00,260
so I'm only stopping right now to
say this because I know some of you,

1223
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:03,590
you get so religious,
you get so into it that you can add.

1224
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,860
You get so holy that you
can actually commit murder.

1225
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,780
You know God's usually Angela
tool or you know, vengeance.

1226
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:16,520
I think that was the line I used. I said,
okay, you shouldn't be getting mad at me.

1227
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,950
You should pray for me
to help me see the light.

1228
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,760
And everyone got a huge fucking
laugh at it. About it. Okay.

1229
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:27,380
And this lady is basically us. She's,
I can't wait to email her back.

1230
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:30,290
I don't know. I, I've, I've flipped
flopped a hundred times in my head.

1231
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,600
What I was going to say, you
know, I just can't wait to, uh,

1232
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,030
I think I'm just gonna write back
something really quickly. Like, Ruth,

1233
01:16:39,031 --> 01:16:43,410
you actually pretending to not be the
dumb drunk bitch in the crowd is one of

1234
01:16:43,411 --> 01:16:45,450
the funniest things I've ever read.
Something to that effect.

1235
01:16:45,451 --> 01:16:48,390
Basically let her know that I know that
it's her and I'll see you next year at

1236
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:51,660
the Improv. You're content. Um,
anyways, I'm very surprised.

1237
01:16:51,661 --> 01:16:54,060
Surprised that your calling,
this is where she tries to, um,

1238
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:56,940
this is where she tries to
get me banned from the club.

1239
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:59,790
I'm very surprised that a,
your club hosted this comedian.

1240
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,350
It was a true disappointment.

1241
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:05,430
I am embarrassed as I was the one who
suggested the Improv when my friends and I

1242
01:17:05,431 --> 01:17:07,110
were planning to on sing a comedy show.

1243
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:11,180
I do hope that you will consider not
having this comedian back as he gives your

1244
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:15,560
club a bad name. If this is a, this
had been my first time to the Improv,

1245
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,250
I never would have returned. You might
consider hiring some local talent.

1246
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:21,050
There are several good
comedians in the area.

1247
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,330
We are good friends with one of them.
If you'd like his name,

1248
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:26,150
I'll be happy to give it to [inaudible].
All right.

1249
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:27,740
As for the lady who we picked on,

1250
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:31,130
she and her table were
unjustifiably asked to leave.

1251
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,850
There was no grounds on having them
escorted from the show right in the middle

1252
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:36,410
of it.
That's how drunk she was.

1253
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:41,000
She got escorted out 50 minutes
into my one hour set and she's like,

1254
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:42,770
she was escorted out in the middle of it.

1255
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,620
Do you understand how drunk
this woman was? I talked for,

1256
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:48,620
Jeez about Jesus for 30 minutes.
No, actually it was seven minutes.

1257
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,750
I was escorted out in the middle.
No,

1258
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:54,530
you actually escorted out 50 minutes into
the show when you were on your fucking

1259
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:56,060
six drink.
You're drunk count.

1260
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,750
There were no grounds of on
having them escorted from, uh,

1261
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,790
from the show right in the middle of it.
Again,

1262
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:04,640
they were not being disrupted at all.
This and this,

1263
01:18:04,641 --> 01:18:08,150
this impartial person just wants to keep
talking about how innocent this fucking

1264
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:11,630
lady is that she never met. If it hadn't
been for bill burr picking on them,

1265
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:15,080
no one would even notice them. Okay.
The kids who tell this is just the,

1266
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:18,920
the fucking drunk argument they had in
the crowd and in the car on the ride home,

1267
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,271
the loud table.

1268
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:24,050
And the other side though is the one
that took away attention from his show.

1269
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,200
I do understand that it is private
property and then anyone can be asked to

1270
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:30,590
leave at any time. But this was wrong
to do. This is a wrong time to do it.

1271
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:34,340
I personally believe that she should
receive an apology from the Improv,

1272
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:38,210
but mostly from bill burr. That's
clearly not my call. Just the thought.

1273
01:18:38,211 --> 01:18:39,340
What a fucking,
ah,

1274
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,593
okay.

1275
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,710
I don't know. Did I take too long
reading that fucking thing. There you go.

1276
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:47,530
You want to be a standup comedian? That's
what the fuck you have to deal with.

1277
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,890
She's actually like a total
fucking control freak.

1278
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,920
And what happened that night was
she completely lost on all levels.

1279
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:57,760
Okay.

1280
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,511
You know,
it's weird.

1281
01:18:58,511 --> 01:19:01,900
You become like a part time psychologist
as you're breaking down the crowd as a

1282
01:19:01,901 --> 01:19:05,710
comedian and she sat at the
power position at the table.

1283
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,510
The table is at like a fucking,

1284
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,420
we'll say like a 30 degree
angle coming in stage left.

1285
01:19:10,421 --> 01:19:13,450
This is going to get technical. All
right, you fucked. Don't, don't,

1286
01:19:13,451 --> 01:19:15,370
don't leave me here. She, you know,

1287
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:19,840
she didn't sit at like the the chair
furthest away. If you sit furthest away,

1288
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,470
everybody you're at the table with
has the back of their head to you.

1289
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:26,530
So then when you want to fucking
talk, it's, it's a difficult time.

1290
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,830
What she did was not only did
she sit in the first chair,

1291
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,390
she sat on the first chair closest to me,
so they'll,

1292
01:19:33,391 --> 01:19:34,920
so all she had to do is turn around.

1293
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:38,110
She had the whole fucking tables
attention and when she stood up,

1294
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:41,830
when she went to leave her whole table
stood up like a bunch of fucking minions.

1295
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,780
You know,
like you remember that dude,

1296
01:19:43,781 --> 01:19:47,260
he used to carry the fucking umbrella
for puffy. That's how they all got up.

1297
01:19:47,261 --> 01:19:48,100
It was pathetic.

1298
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:52,540
And people like that surround themselves
with fucking weak people like that

1299
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,780
because any normal people, person,
you know, think about that.

1300
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,120
All you guys listening right now,
if you're,

1301
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,980
if your buddy was being a drunk fucking
asshole and got booted from the club,

1302
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:03,360
would you get up and leave immediately?

1303
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:07,980
Stand up like the fucking general just
got up. I mean, I guess maybe you would.

1304
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:09,090
Could you be walk,
he's drunk.

1305
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:12,060
Maybe he's going to go fuck and walk
out and pee on a cop or something.

1306
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:16,380
I guess maybe. I Dunno. Anyways,
you know, before I email her back,

1307
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:18,750
what do you guys think I should write
back and come up with something clever

1308
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:21,210
other than calling her a con like I did.
I think I'm just,

1309
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:24,150
I'm going to write back something to the
effect that I realized that it was her.

1310
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,010
And um, I don't know. I don't fucking
know. Was that just a big waste of time?

1311
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:32,850
Should I not have been bothered
with all of that? You know,

1312
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,630
I dunno. Then I had another incident with
another fucking person. I don't know. I,

1313
01:20:38,631 --> 01:20:42,960
I have issues with, with a
beautiful woman. I really do.

1314
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:45,390
This is actually a bit I want
to do on stage and I'll just,

1315
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:49,440
I'll maybe I'll do part of it for you
here at bay. The basic idea, I just,

1316
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,500
I don't respect them on a certain level.

1317
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:56,100
I feel like I had to do something

1318
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:02,170
to achieve in life. All they had to do
was basically they were born beautiful.

1319
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,690
This, it's really not an accomplishment
I guess. You go to the gym,

1320
01:21:04,691 --> 01:21:08,320
you stay beautiful past a certain age.
It is an accomplishment I guess.

1321
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:11,380
But you know,
I don't know,

1322
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:13,510
for in order as a guy to
get around beautiful women,

1323
01:21:13,511 --> 01:21:17,650
you have to accomplish all this shit in
life and all they have to do to get to

1324
01:21:17,651 --> 01:21:21,790
where the fuck you're at
after accomplishing all this
shit is basically take a

1325
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:25,300
shower and feather their hair back
like Farrah Fawcett and they're in the

1326
01:21:25,301 --> 01:21:29,590
fucking VIP. You know? I also
don't like them because, uh,

1327
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,160
I dunno. I Dunno if they're
smart. They, if they're smart,

1328
01:21:33,161 --> 01:21:36,100
they're absolutely stunning though.
I have to admit that. But you know,

1329
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:38,020
okay.

1330
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:39,610
If they're, if they're dumb, that's like,

1331
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:42,760
it's like you got a Lamborghini but you
find out it has a four cylinder in it,

1332
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:47,770
or even worse. My fucking hybrid. Did
that make any fucking sense? You know,

1333
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,740
they have that one default emotion.
Oh my God.

1334
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:54,700
And they give 58 different reads.
You know,

1335
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,420
if they see something cute like a
little puppy, they're like, oh, Mike,

1336
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,553
good.

1337
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:03,300
You know, if you do something
sweet from, Oh my God,

1338
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:04,930
yeah.

1339
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:08,440
Did you know you'd do something
that they fucking hate? Oh my God.

1340
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:13,540
Fucking idiots. They got
three words floating around
in there and they're in VIP,

1341
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:17,680
you know? Yes. Slapped a fucking
spit out of the mouth. All right,

1342
01:22:17,681 --> 01:22:21,610
let's plow ahead here. This is the Monday
morning podcast and I'll also, you know,

1343
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:25,360
I don't know why I didn't think to say
this. I'm like, oh, I have a new player.

1344
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:29,290
I've kind of abandoned Libsyn already.
Okay.

1345
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:33,310
That was like my rebound girl after
I broke up with fucking Geniecast.

1346
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:36,640
It just didn't work out. Um, you know,

1347
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:39,610
like Eddie Murphy and one of
the spice girls, you know,

1348
01:22:39,611 --> 01:22:43,030
but fortunately I didn't impregnate a
luminosity that luminosity. I'm sorry,

1349
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,690
I've just redone that. Ah,
Lipson, I'm speaking of that.

1350
01:22:46,691 --> 01:22:50,560
I'll let the cat out of the bag. Um,
this is something I'm trying to do is uh,

1351
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,020
to actually go on the internet
and rather than becoming,

1352
01:22:53,021 --> 01:22:57,160
even even dumber than I really am or
is it more dumb? I don't even know.

1353
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:01,750
I know it's more stupid. It's not
stupid or is it? I have no fucking idea,

1354
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,520
but all I know is,
uh,

1355
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:08,140
I'm trying to figure out how not to become
more of a shithead online and I would

1356
01:23:08,141 --> 01:23:11,320
really like to start this
as a new segment. Where is,

1357
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:14,110
are there things out
there that I can look at?

1358
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:18,700
I know ted.com I love that site even
though I haven't been to it in a month.

1359
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:23,710
Ted like Ted kennedy.com
minus the rape and alcohol.

1360
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:28,690
Um, there's one out here
called luminosity.com,

1361
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,870
l u m o s I t y.com.

1362
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,370
And it's basically games for your
brain. And I'm telling you, man,

1363
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:41,400
it's fucking awesome and I cannot even
begin to tell you how low I scored on

1364
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:46,330
these things. Uh, you know, they got
these things, they got everything.

1365
01:23:46,331 --> 01:23:49,870
Literally they got one game
called like duck hunting, right?

1366
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:55,450
And what happens is a duck appears
on the screen while simultaneously,

1367
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:59,620
you know, somewhere in your
peripheral vision, while
simultaneously on the screen,

1368
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,820
a letter appears.

1369
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:05,680
And then what you have to do is you have
to click where the bird was and also

1370
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:09,760
remember the letter. And then when
the, then they'll give you a series,

1371
01:24:09,761 --> 01:24:13,060
like a lineup, usual suspect of letters.
You got to pick the right letter.

1372
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:14,740
And then it's like wheel of fortune.

1373
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,580
You got one letter and you're trying to
solve the word and it's a name of a bird.

1374
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:22,900
So you're fucking learning to look
at two things at one time, process,

1375
01:24:22,901 --> 01:24:26,680
both of them. And you're getting better
at wheel of fortune all at the same time.

1376
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:30,550
And learning new names of fucking birds
that you didn't even know existed.

1377
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:33,730
That's just one fucking game.
Okay?

1378
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:38,290
So if we can get back into the
ying and Yang, the balance of life,

1379
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:43,291
if you want to somehow balance off nine
hours of fucking going onto you porn and

1380
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:47,800
watching people get kicked in
the nuts on youtube, I highly,

1381
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:51,430
I can't recommend this site highly enough.
You can sign up,

1382
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:55,390
you get a free week of games,
luminosity.com l u m o s,

1383
01:24:55,391 --> 01:25:00,130
I t y.com and then, you know, even
the membership is not that bad.

1384
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:05,200
But, um, I dunno, I'm not the brightest
guy, but I think I have good common sense.

1385
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:10,030
And I have a feeling then in about 10
years after all the how to get fucking a

1386
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:12,850
six pack abs books have been written,

1387
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:18,060
somebody is finally going to focus on
the brain and start to realize that your

1388
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:23,710
brain, like your fucking midsection
can turn to mush the exact same way.

1389
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:24,544
And like I,

1390
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:29,600
I definitely think my brain is not
nearly as sharp as it was 20 years ago.

1391
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:33,370
It's weird because as you
get, you get older, you know,
that whole thing, you know,

1392
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:37,600
you get older, you get wiser, you know,
basically you're learning from fucking up,

1393
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,580
but you're not as sharp.
And, uh, I dunno this, this,

1394
01:25:42,581 --> 01:25:44,560
this,
um,

1395
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:50,230
this site was the closest thing to doing
like mental pushups and they're cool.

1396
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:52,150
They're fun games, man.
It taps into the video.

1397
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:56,860
I actually have a new found
respect for video games where like,

1398
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,490
um, you know, I,

1399
01:25:58,491 --> 01:26:02,230
I got away from video games because they
were just eating up all of my free time.

1400
01:26:02,231 --> 01:26:05,060
The last one I really played
was grand theft auto part three,

1401
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:09,170
and it absolutely consumed my life.

1402
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:14,120
And the thing about that game was
even after I finished the game,

1403
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,150
I had to get the sheets. I'm going to
lie to you. I'm not gonna lie to you.

1404
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,890
You had to cheat, you know, um,
when I finally finished everything,

1405
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:24,690
I would still play the game
and just go on those rampages.

1406
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:29,060
And I found it to be like a stress relief
and uh, but it was just like too much.

1407
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,150
But after it, seriously, after playing
those games, I kind of realized that, um,

1408
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,420
look at me. I'm too fucking
stupid to convey this idea.

1409
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:39,410
Just go to luminosity.com and if anybody
else knows any other sites like that or

1410
01:26:39,411 --> 01:26:43,430
just something that, uh, can
give me some mental setups,

1411
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:46,700
I would really like it because I'm,
I'm getting into that stuff. Like,

1412
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,310
I don't know if I told
you guys a this comedian,

1413
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:50,930
I forget who the fuck
it was told me about.

1414
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:53,690
There was some book out
there that was saying, um,

1415
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,700
a great exercise to do is if you're like,

1416
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:59,610
lefthanded is to start doing things with
you that you normally do with your left

1417
01:26:59,611 --> 01:27:01,460
hand right handed.
All right,

1418
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:03,540
I'm going to wait for you guys to
finish doing the Dick joke there.

1419
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,760
[inaudible] fucking rub. One elder
will wait few weeks. Somebody else, uh,

1420
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:11,810
you guys fist pumping in your cubicles
with that hack joke from fucking make me

1421
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:16,160
laugh in 1977.
Can I continue with my podcast?

1422
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:20,890
Thank you. Um, no, it actually,
I don't know what it does. It's,

1423
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,100
it's somehow it actually makes you more,
uh,

1424
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:29,390
God, I'm so fucking stupid.
What is the word? Um,

1425
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:33,140
like say if you were playing
guitar, say if you're, uh,

1426
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:35,090
if you're a lefthanded
guitarist like I am,

1427
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,630
it's so pathetic to even
call myself a guitar.

1428
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:42,050
Someone who attempts to play guitar.
Um, I play left handed. If you actually,

1429
01:27:42,051 --> 01:27:46,070
if I were actually to fuck around on a
right handed guitar and try to learn to

1430
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:48,380
play something,
if I,

1431
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:51,320
then the the second I went
to the lefthanded guitar,

1432
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:54,410
you would actually learn it quicker.
I have no idea why,

1433
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,890
which should be obvious at this point
because I could barely fucking explain it.

1434
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:01,580
So anyways, I fly a lot. It
drives me nuts. I hate flying.

1435
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:07,060
And so what I do when I fly is I actually
sit there and I listen to music and I

1436
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:09,860
write the lyrics with my right
hand rather than my left hand.

1437
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:13,890
And I've actually gotten like
halfway decent at it. And uh,

1438
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:18,020
at the very least I'm thinking of someday
if I'm unfortunate enough to have a

1439
01:28:18,021 --> 01:28:21,620
stroke, you know, my turnaround
time's going to be incredible.

1440
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,170
I'll be rubbing them out.

1441
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:27,530
I'll be right in fucking letters
catching the drool with my opposite hand.

1442
01:28:27,531 --> 01:28:31,670
You know, that's so fucking bad. Yeah,

1443
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:36,030
that's what it is. Join me.
Become stroke proof or whatever.

1444
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,400
Not stroke proof. Become A, I
dunno, cuts your rehab costs 50%.

1445
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:43,640
God knows nobody has fucking
health insurance anymore.
It could be a good thing.

1446
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:48,920
Right? Have I said anything funny
in the last fucking 19 minutes?

1447
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:49,731
I have no idea.

1448
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:53,030
Somewhere in the middle of that letter I
got fucking mad again and all the funny

1449
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:57,110
went out the window. And I'll tell you
the first rule of fucking losing a crowd.

1450
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:00,200
Well, I guess no confidence and
having no jokes would be first,

1451
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:05,250
but other that it's just going up there
and being an angry fucking cycle. Um, oh,

1452
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,200
I want to thank everybody
for, uh, you know,

1453
01:29:07,201 --> 01:29:10,530
last week I talked about women's
curling and uh, and by the way,

1454
01:29:10,531 --> 01:29:12,030
I totally enjoyed the Olympics.

1455
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,820
I love the Winter Olympics and I'm
sick of people shitting on them.

1456
01:29:14,821 --> 01:29:17,520
All these late night talk show hosts
talking about how those are the fucking

1457
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:21,960
boring. Really. Why don't you go
do another lame monologue, Huh?

1458
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:26,220
About fucking that girl who got eaten
by a fucking whale. Give me your take.

1459
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,310
Coming out there wearing a suit like you
have a fucking war when before you had

1460
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:32,370
the Goddamn show.
Sorry.

1461
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,830
You know I get heated when people
make fun of the Olympics. You know,

1462
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:37,390
I was talking about how hot the
fucking women of curling were.

1463
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,830
A little bit of phlegm left.
Um,

1464
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:44,070
and somebody said a was
actually saying like,

1465
01:29:44,071 --> 01:29:46,980
I was trying to figure out why I was
finding these fucking women so attractive

1466
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,610
other than the obvious that they were good
looking women. This guy actually said,

1467
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:55,050
hey, bill, uh, beside the obvious hot
women vigorously scrubbing the floor,

1468
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:58,530
I really set that up bad.
He's saying,

1469
01:29:58,531 --> 01:30:03,210
this is why men find women curlers
attractive. I just blew that joke.

1470
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:03,930
He said,

1471
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:08,220
besides the obvious hot women
vigorously scrubbing the floor,

1472
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:12,390
I have two t I you so deserved a huge
laugh on that and I just fucked you out of

1473
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:15,480
it. I'm sorry about that.
Um, anyways, he says,

1474
01:30:15,481 --> 01:30:18,150
I have figured out why we
love watching this so much.

1475
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,890
When they released that stone,

1476
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:25,220
the way they let it slide out of their
hand is reminiscent of the way a skillful

1477
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:30,360
woman releases your cock after
delivering a massive hand job.

1478
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,251
First of all,

1479
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:37,251
I hope you're a surfer because that's
the only reason why to the massive hand

1480
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:40,200
job,
um,

1481
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:45,270
fucking massive hand job. Or maybe
you just have a fucking bit, oh,

1482
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:49,710
maybe I'll just, you have a fat cock.
I Dunno. So anyways, she goes a,

1483
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:51,510
they don't drop it.
Don't push it.

1484
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:56,511
Just let it slide out naturally as I go
to sleep with my boxes around my ankles.

1485
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:00,210
Oh, I forgot. That was
creepy. I know. I read it.

1486
01:31:00,211 --> 01:31:03,060
I was supposed to just read the beginning
joke cause I thought the joke was

1487
01:31:03,061 --> 01:31:03,661
fucking great.

1488
01:31:03,661 --> 01:31:08,661
I forgot the fucking picture in his ugh
guys with those fucking insect looking

1489
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:12,930
legs on guy's legs, like insects
with that fucking hair all over him.

1490
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:18,120
Skinny fucking legs were a mess.
Fucking mess.

1491
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:22,680
I'm like praying mantis legs.
Anyways, I'm a long time ago.

1492
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:24,480
I talked about unacceptable.
This is when,

1493
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:27,930
you know the podcast sucks and I'm just
plowing from fucking topic to topic and

1494
01:31:27,931 --> 01:31:32,931
there's just no sort of a no
segway other than dead silence.

1495
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,900
Um, let's go to youtube videos for the
week. Let's, let's, let's go over here.

1496
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:40,920
You know, I feel like the
fucking dumb fuck on, uh,

1497
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:45,840
on like jeopardy when there's like
five difficult topics in one easy ones,

1498
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:51,210
you know, great scientist,
architecture, medieval, whatever.

1499
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,540
And let's go, let's go with, uh,

1500
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:00,040
developments in lawn chairs for 100.

1501
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,920
That's not even easy, isn't
it? I'm so far. I'm just too
dumb. I'm too fucking dumb.

1502
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:08,770
Whatever. You know what? I played those
brain games. I'm too stupid this week.

1503
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,760
Here's a youtube video to look up.
Look up Douche off.

1504
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,390
D O u c h e o f f a Douche off.

1505
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:19,480
Maybe you'll find that humorous. I
can't remember if I did. I think I did.

1506
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:23,260
I believe I did because I left it
there. Ah, bad wedding stories.

1507
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:27,970
This is another topic. Who the fuck
do I sound like I'm doing right now?

1508
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,900
Did somebody do a Bob Dole
impression lay out of, I can't.

1509
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:39,910
Can I tap out at this fucking point
37 minutes in a bag. Wedding stories.

1510
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:43,500
I'm, hey bill, I haven't listened
to your podcast since the beginning.

1511
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,720
Decided it was about time I emailed
you and told you how much I enjoy it.

1512
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:50,920
Thank you very much. Uh,
but, but the, the, okay,

1513
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:55,120
let's get to the, uh, to
get to the marriage thing.

1514
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:00,790
Um, okay. I got a marriage
story when I was 23.

1515
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:04,780
I was dating a girl and she got pregnant.
Uh,

1516
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:10,330
dude. Okay. Uh, so we decided
to get married. Okay. Stupid.

1517
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,890
Fucking move number two,

1518
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:16,360
even though a month before this I
was thinking about dumping her ass.

1519
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:21,040
Stupid mistake number three. Actually
that was the smart move. That was the,

1520
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:23,950
that was the three card Monte right there.
Don't knock her up.

1521
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:29,290
Don't fucking marry your white.
Knock her up. Marry her dumper ass.

1522
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:33,400
You know which one had the
marble? You fucked up. All right,

1523
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:37,060
so all the plans are made, our families
meet each other. Okay. Just cause I,

1524
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:37,361
you know,

1525
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,540
had to do that stupid three card Monte
joke in a desperate attempt to try to be

1526
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:43,210
remotely funny at this
point. You know, it was,

1527
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:45,640
I have a blue wind screen this week.
I'm going to blow that. I'm going to,

1528
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:49,300
I'm going to blame it on that one. You
know, my fucking dog ate the orange one,

1529
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:53,620
so I'm going to blame it on the blue
windscreen. Anyway. So basically,

1530
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:56,350
sky's 23 years old.
He knocks up this fucking girl.

1531
01:33:56,351 --> 01:33:58,240
He decides to get married even though he,

1532
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:02,110
he thought about dumping our month before.
So anyway, so all the plans are made.

1533
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:08,110
Um, families meet each other, invitations
are sent out, all that bullshit.

1534
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:09,730
So three days before the wedding,

1535
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:14,590
I'm watching some stupid movie where
this guy tells his other guy that his dad

1536
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:18,370
told him before his wedding,
it's never too late to change your mind,

1537
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:21,820
to which his friend says,
but you're not married.

1538
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:25,690
And I guess it is. That's
a laugh. So anyways, uh,

1539
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:30,640
so taking this as a sign from God that I
just happened to be watching this movie.

1540
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:35,410
I canceled a wedding.
Great fucking move.

1541
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:40,960
Alright. Which says, suffice to say,
brought a shit storm into my life.

1542
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,170
The worst part is that
I actually felt so bad.

1543
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:48,460
I married the chick three months
later. Oh Dude, you were out.

1544
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,040
You will fucking out.
So basically I was a pussy.

1545
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:56,530
Yeah. Yeah, but too, that's a hard thing.

1546
01:34:56,531 --> 01:34:59,750
You were dealing with a lot of shit
at 23 your parents were crying.

1547
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:03,890
She was knocked up. Yeah. I
wouldn't say you were pussy.

1548
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:06,220
You gave into peer pressure.
Anyways,

1549
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:11,360
we were married for seven years with every
year being worse than the year before.

1550
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:14,270
So we're divorced.
So we're divorced now.

1551
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,540
So I guess I should have gone
with my gut to wrap this up,

1552
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:20,240
I got a little gripe with,
with chicks.

1553
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:24,860
My ex used to ask me when the marriage
was going down, if I could go back,

1554
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:28,520
would I not meet her? Which
I would say, fuck yeah,

1555
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:33,500
I would avoid you like the
plague. Which she would say, uh,

1556
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,250
but w at which point she would say,
but you wouldn't have our two kids,

1557
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:41,930
don't you love them? And then he
would say, yeah, but then I'd say,

1558
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:45,110
but I, I would never have met you,
so I would have never had the kids.

1559
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:47,840
So in that scenario,
the kids aren't even a thought.

1560
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:53,080
This of course would lead to a huge fight
about my lack of carrying a moral to

1561
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:58,040
the story. Don't use logic when
talking to chicks. All right?

1562
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:02,080
That's actually not the moral
to the story. What it is,

1563
01:36:02,081 --> 01:36:06,800
is you got to think how women think, you
know, which, you know, if you're lucky,

1564
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:09,080
at some point when you're 90,
you'll know,

1565
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:13,970
you'll understand 10% of what the
fuck is going on in that brain. Um,

1566
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:18,110
basically when she's asking you that,
she was asking that,

1567
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:23,420
I would guess one of two reasons.
One, she was insecure that, you know,

1568
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:27,230
you knocked her up and then you married
her and you know that you were gonna

1569
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:31,160
marry her. Then you broke it off and
then you fucking married her. Uh,

1570
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:34,250
believe it or not, I'm sure that's not
how she dreamed of getting married.

1571
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:38,240
She probably dreamed of
meeting her soulmate and they
were so hopelessly in love

1572
01:36:38,241 --> 01:36:40,820
that everyone in the crowd
had tears in their lies for.

1573
01:36:40,821 --> 01:36:43,690
They never found a love
soap as great as theirs.

1574
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:49,630
She could have been thinking that and
she wanted you to reassure her or she

1575
01:36:50,301 --> 01:36:54,410
probably was just banging you,
you know,

1576
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,200
and didn't want to fucking marry you
and didn't think that you were the one

1577
01:36:57,201 --> 01:36:57,620
either.

1578
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:02,620
And all of a sudden she got knocked up
and she probably sitting there looking at

1579
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:06,440
the side of your fucking head one
morning as you were eating pancakes,

1580
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:11,000
trying to find where in
the world she loves you.

1581
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:15,050
You know, on what fucking level. You know,

1582
01:37:15,051 --> 01:37:17,630
just watching your temples going
in and out as you're chewing,

1583
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:22,490
just fighting that fucking urge to
slam a toaster over your fucking head.

1584
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,870
You know, just wondering, how the hell
did I end up with this fucking guy?

1585
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,910
Why did I say Yes to this guy?

1586
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:33,410
Why did I let him fucking drop a fucking
load in me? What is wrong with me?

1587
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:38,840
And just trying to make the fact that
you had these two kids justice justice

1588
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:43,010
enough, you know, that's what the
fuck was probably going on. But, uh,

1589
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,001
I dunno dude,

1590
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:48,140
you didn't really talk about how much
of a nightmare the wedding was that that

1591
01:37:48,141 --> 01:37:51,710
was the meat of the story there.
I think you at the beginning and the end.

1592
01:37:51,711 --> 01:37:53,900
But what are you thinking is
she's coming down the aisle.

1593
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:56,810
What is your family thinking?

1594
01:37:57,290 --> 01:38:00,740
You're not her up and then you dumped
her and yen and you're like, fuck it,

1595
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,370
I'll marry or anyways, and you're only
23 they know you don't want to do it.

1596
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,500
Those weren't tears of joy, my friend,
you know? What are you thinking?

1597
01:38:08,501 --> 01:38:10,760
Is your up there?
You know,

1598
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:18,580
was your Cumberbun like wringing wet
with flop sweat as you was standing up?

1599
01:38:18,581 --> 01:38:19,570
I can't imagine that.

1600
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:22,793
Ugh.

1601
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:28,150
Has anybody ever just ran off the side
door? Cause I could definitely see like,

1602
01:38:28,151 --> 01:38:30,340
oh my God, I don't know what to
say. How do I get out of this shit?

1603
01:38:30,341 --> 01:38:35,320
And then just in a panic when
they started, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,

1604
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:40,160
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,

1605
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,360
you turn around looking,

1606
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,510
where is she a what a fucked and I
have some wedding music underneath this

1607
01:38:46,511 --> 01:38:50,650
would've would've been hilarious
if I fucking prepared. You know,

1608
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,550
you're looking for the bitch,
where the fuck is you?

1609
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:55,900
And then she comes around the corner
and you're trying to make yourself lover

1610
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:00,700
and she comes around the corner and you
just see that fucking face and you see

1611
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:01,910
those eyebrows and you know,

1612
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:06,790
we're going to be touching by the time
she's 40 and you just fucking run out the

1613
01:39:06,791 --> 01:39:09,970
side door in those cheap
tuxedo bowling shoes

1614
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:16,480
and you know what I mean? And you're
in such a fucking panic, you know,

1615
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:21,630
there's no way that you're going to be
able to get your car keys out in time,

1616
01:39:21,681 --> 01:39:25,880
get them into the door, open the
door, lock the door and get in there.

1617
01:39:25,881 --> 01:39:29,540
And it's like people are going to be
coming out running out of the church like

1618
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:33,320
some fucking Zombie movie as you're
trying to get your car started.

1619
01:39:33,321 --> 01:39:37,520
I mean the move there is shit,
if anybody does that,

1620
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:41,250
don't go to your car.
You keep running. Okay.

1621
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:45,720
Most people get married in the suburbs,
so headed head for a wooded area.

1622
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,490
Alright, go online. Learn how to turn
your fucking Cumberbun into a tent.

1623
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:55,350
Hang out there for a couple of days.
Let Shit cool off. Grow a beard,

1624
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:59,940
come back to town, get some provisions
that point you'll be so fucking filthy.

1625
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:03,060
You just another homeless guy
wearing a suit. You know what I mean?

1626
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:06,290
Just let her forget all about you.

1627
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,950
Then maybe they'll think that you're
mentally ill and then uh, you know,

1628
01:40:09,951 --> 01:40:12,680
one day you just show up on your
mother's front steps and she faints.

1629
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:16,760
Her Dad catches you and punches you in
the face cause he's a former marine.

1630
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:20,390
You know, haven't we all seen
this movie? I'm trying to say.

1631
01:40:20,391 --> 01:40:21,770
Run out the fucking door.

1632
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,530
Run out the fucking door if
you're in that situation,

1633
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:30,540
if you're in that situation.
All right, bill, longtime
listener, first time writer.

1634
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:35,190
I've got a winning story to tell you.
I'm 23 years old now. The 23 year old,

1635
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:39,570
I'd been to a, here's one for you. Don't
go to a wedding or get married at 23.

1636
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:41,760
They all seem to have bad stories.
Um,

1637
01:40:41,761 --> 01:40:45,600
I've been to a few weddings and let
me start by saying in this story,

1638
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:49,350
it wasn't actually a wedding I witnessed.
It was a wicking,

1639
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,020
a Wiccan hand fastening. Okay. Now though,

1640
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:56,730
for those of you not familiar
with the Wiccan religion,

1641
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:01,040
I just want to state at this
point, neither am I. Um,

1642
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:07,130
I can't remember if that's the one
that actually has all those, uh,

1643
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,830
pagans symbols that,
you know,

1644
01:41:09,831 --> 01:41:14,831
the Catholic Church then so that they
were devil signs according to the,

1645
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:18,530
uh, fucking Rosetta Stone or whatever that
fucking movie was. I read the book too.

1646
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:23,000
What the fuck is the name of that
Davinci Code? Um, whatever it was called,

1647
01:41:23,001 --> 01:41:24,290
a wicked hand.
Fascinating.

1648
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:28,010
And I know that because my sister
didn't invite people to our wedding,

1649
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,590
she invited them to her hand fastening.

1650
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:34,490
That's why he knew it was a Wiccan
hand fastening and not a wedding.

1651
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:39,980
Because she said, I'd like to invite
you to my hand fastening cheeses.

1652
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:45,310
Um, he said, if you're 41, you still
don't know what a hand fastening is.

1653
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:48,340
Congratulations. Thank you. Because
I didn't, so anyways, he goes,

1654
01:41:48,341 --> 01:41:51,160
I'm 17 at the time,
my sister's 23 or 24,

1655
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:54,610
we both still lived with our parents
who are boyfriend and unemployed,

1656
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:59,320
alcoholic living off money. His
mom left him when she died. Ah,

1657
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,690
there you go ladies.
There you go.

1658
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:06,760
You don't have to settle for less when
this guys like him out there. Um, anyways.

1659
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:11,930
Um, fuck am I, why didn't
I make this type bigger?

1660
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:15,440
Jesus. What a flop this
podcast is. So anyways, a,

1661
01:42:15,441 --> 01:42:17,780
so this fucking alcoholic was
over for dinner one night.

1662
01:42:17,781 --> 01:42:21,920
He tapped his fork on the glass a few
times to get everyone's attention.

1663
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:27,140
We were three feet from him
and immediately my stomach
knotted up because I knew

1664
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:31,160
this moron was about to say something
stupid. You've got to meet you.

1665
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:35,030
You guys are fucking funny writers,
man. Some really talented people.

1666
01:42:35,031 --> 01:42:38,240
Listen to this fucking podcast. You
guys write better than I do. Anyways,

1667
01:42:38,241 --> 01:42:42,830
basically he announced his engagement
to my sister in front of my mom and dad

1668
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:47,720
pulled out two onyx rings and they put
them on each other's middle fingers.

1669
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,170
You know, I went to the Onyx Strip club
in Houston last night. How funny is that?

1670
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:54,710
Anyways,
it was dead silent and um,

1671
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:59,420
the look of re a repressed horror
on my mom's face was unmistakable.

1672
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,310
It was so awkward.

1673
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,030
So I just started clapping going Yay.

1674
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:07,640
Quietly because nobody else joined in.

1675
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,310
Oh, that's great. Is that your
role in the family? You're,

1676
01:43:13,311 --> 01:43:17,540
the person always tries to make it
better. Uh, God bless you. Anyways,

1677
01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:21,350
it was just dead silence and my sister
and her boyfriend kissing each other like

1678
01:43:21,351 --> 01:43:22,520
everything was fine.

1679
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:27,950
A few months later I found out they were
financing those rings and going into

1680
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:29,720
payments on them.
Every week.

1681
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:34,340
My sister's collecting child support and
neither of them have a job and they are

1682
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:37,680
financing onyx hand fastening rinks.

1683
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:42,710
Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

1684
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:45,290
I can't believe there's more to
this story. All right, here we go.

1685
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:50,300
Fucking knee deep. I got to go the rest of
the way. All right. Anyway, so I finally,

1686
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:53,240
uh, it finally to their
hand, fascinating day,

1687
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:56,870
and they're doing the ceremony
right on Newport beach.

1688
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:02,000
It's in the middle of the day on a, on
Sunday in the summer, they didn't have,

1689
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:08,240
oh, they didn't reserve a piece of beach
or anything. They just showed up and go,

1690
01:44:08,241 --> 01:44:11,450
hey, let's have the wedding here. Um,

1691
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:16,100
the family we had, I don't know. Fuck,
I gotta sit close to the damn screen.

1692
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:19,970
I can't read anymore. The family we have
near the beach mostly all showed up.

1693
01:44:19,971 --> 01:44:22,410
All the people who live near
the beach mostly showed all up.

1694
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:25,640
There were about 30 or 40 of us.
None of us,

1695
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:29,480
none of us are dressed in beach clothes.
Half of them are in suits and dresses.

1696
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:32,090
There are no chairs.
There's not even an altar.

1697
01:44:32,091 --> 01:44:36,170
Everybody's just standing around hot and
they can't sit down because there's no

1698
01:44:36,171 --> 01:44:38,570
chairs and they don't,
they don't want to ruin their clothes.

1699
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:42,020
My sister shows up in an
all black gown with a veil.

1700
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:46,610
The boyfriend is wearing like a Tux
with his face painted like one of the

1701
01:44:46,611 --> 01:44:51,470
misfits, kind of like a
skeleton face. Jesus Christ.

1702
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,370
It sounds like the episode of the office.
Anyways,

1703
01:44:55,371 --> 01:44:57,410
they don't do any
traditional wedding stuff.

1704
01:44:57,410 --> 01:45:01,550
They just go right up front of the crowd
with their Wiccan priest or whatever.

1705
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:04,370
The wicked priest is basically
just a friend of theirs.

1706
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:09,050
He reads a bunch of a bunch of stuff
from a book in some other language.

1707
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,020
My sister and the boyfriend are
responding in some other language.

1708
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:14,660
Nobody has any idea what's going on.
Then all of a sudden,

1709
01:45:14,661 --> 01:45:19,661
the boyfriend pulls out this
crazy looking knife with a what?

1710
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:24,350
A hilt. I didn't know what that is.
Uses it to cut my sister's veil.

1711
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:28,610
Then pokes the end of it into
his finger until he's bleeding.

1712
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,410
He sticks the knife into the sand and
wraps his bloody hand around my sister's

1713
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:37,010
neck while they kiss.
The stone.

1714
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:41,120
Hippy priest holds up his book and
said something loud in that different

1715
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:41,954
language.

1716
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:47,000
I assume it was her equivalent equivalent
of I now pronounce you husband and

1717
01:45:47,001 --> 01:45:49,310
wife.
I'm sure being comedian.

1718
01:45:49,311 --> 01:45:52,760
You've heard the sound of 50
people gasping simultaneously.

1719
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:56,990
Family members in suits and dresses
are just walking away at this point.

1720
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:01,970
A lifeguard saw with the boyfriend did
with the knife called the cop and the day

1721
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:06,050
ended prematurely with him getting cuffed
and driven away in a police cruiser.

1722
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:10,510
Jesus Christ. Anyways, thanks for the
podcasts. I really enjoy Jesus Christ.

1723
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:13,820
How about a fucking round of
applause for that story? All right.

1724
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:18,080
I think I have to read up on
the a Wiccan religion. You know,

1725
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:19,340
one thing I did like about that,

1726
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:22,910
I did like the fact that they just showed
up and just decided to have a wedding

1727
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:26,510
and they avoided all those other costs.
Um,

1728
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:30,020
cause I wanted to say halfway through
that, like, you know, they didn't have,

1729
01:46:30,021 --> 01:46:33,770
they didn't reserve that piece
of the beach or anything.
And I was thinking like,

1730
01:46:33,771 --> 01:46:37,310
well, you never had to back in
the day. You know what I mean?

1731
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:39,890
You just fucking had a wedding.
There was,

1732
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:43,010
it wasn't like nine zillion fucking
dollars. Didn't matter where you were,

1733
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:45,700
but I guess you have to do that now.
Uh,

1734
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:49,970
because there's nine zillion
people and uh, and bankers run

1735
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,410
the fucking world. Hey,
speaking of that, did you,

1736
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:55,890
somebody sent me an email the other day.
Evidently Europe elected a president.

1737
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:01,650
You hear that Europe elected a
president, not England, not France,

1738
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:05,790
Europe, the entire continent
now has a fucking president,

1739
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:08,130
has one guy in charge of all of them.

1740
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:13,350
See that just like those three d
TVs that are only a few months away,

1741
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:16,730
that new world daughter is going to
be available right down at the best.

1742
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:21,570
Come and sewed, come and fucking soon.
If you go on and read about the uh,

1743
01:47:21,571 --> 01:47:25,600
the bailout, uh, rolling stone
has a great article and a,

1744
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:30,120
usually I try to stay away from their
politics because there's so brutally to

1745
01:47:30,121 --> 01:47:34,320
the left. It's fucking
ridiculous. Um, you know,

1746
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:38,880
they never trashed Democrats or
when they do it, so like light hand,

1747
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:42,120
they just doing it just because
they trashed a republican so bad.

1748
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:45,510
They're trying to show that they're fair
and balanced like those other fucking

1749
01:47:45,511 --> 01:47:50,460
maniacs. Um, Fox News actually has a
store now when you go through the airport,

1750
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:54,780
which I think is hilarious, they sell
water and that type of shit. So I dunno,

1751
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:57,120
it's going to be with going gonna
be one fucking news channel.

1752
01:47:57,270 --> 01:48:00,180
There's going to be one president and
one fucking currency and money and you

1753
01:48:00,181 --> 01:48:01,260
better do what they say.

1754
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:05,310
Oh, I ra, that's going to be the
end of it, my friends. Um, anyways,

1755
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:07,110
if you want to check it out, it's the, um,

1756
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,620
it's the rolling stone that actually has,
uh,

1757
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,860
Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck on the cover.
And if you guys are fans of music,

1758
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:17,220
I guess they're going to be doing a
tour together, which is unbelievable.

1759
01:48:17,221 --> 01:48:20,910
They used to be big time rivals back in
the day and now they're fucking in their

1760
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:24,420
sixties. They're like, yeah, let's get
some money for the medication we now need.

1761
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:29,640
And A, I guess they're going to be
doing a tour and a, and with that, um,

1762
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:31,410
I didn't have time, you know, cause I,

1763
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,210
I got a couple of weird weeks coming
up guys. I gotta tell you this. Well,

1764
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:36,030
I usually take Sundays off,

1765
01:48:36,031 --> 01:48:40,470
so I'm flying home on Sundays and so
then I get a good night's sleep and I can

1766
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:45,180
give you a decent podcast. But, uh,
this week and this upcoming week,

1767
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:47,010
I'm going to be at the Improv in San Jose.

1768
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,520
And I am working Thursday,
Friday,

1769
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,580
Saturday and Sunday so I won't
be, uh, it is a quick flight.

1770
01:48:53,581 --> 01:48:55,110
So the next weeks will be a good podcast,

1771
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:56,580
but that's why this one was so late today.

1772
01:48:56,581 --> 01:49:01,530
So I apologize and I didn't get a chance
to recommend any of the music that you

1773
01:49:01,531 --> 01:49:06,080
guys have been sending in,
but I'll definitely try to
read it next week. And uh,

1774
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:11,150
I finally have gotten into Pan
Tara to a sick fucking level and,

1775
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:15,810
um, if you get a chance, um,

1776
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:21,000
download a vulgar display of
power or cowboys from hell.

1777
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:26,370
And um, I actually used to play
in this fucking, uh, you know,

1778
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:31,140
garage band and a, my brothers
and some of their other friends,

1779
01:49:31,141 --> 01:49:33,330
she used to get into thrash
and I was never into it.

1780
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:36,840
I was more liking to ACDC and John Bonam
and trying to get my bass drum foot is

1781
01:49:36,841 --> 01:49:40,400
fast as bottoms, so I never got a
double pedal or any of that shit. Well,

1782
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:44,280
few years ago, I finally got one
and listening to cowboys from hell,

1783
01:49:44,281 --> 01:49:47,980
I got to fucking get that
down because, uh, I dunno,

1784
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,060
combination of Vinny Paul
and Tim Alexander really
make me want to play double

1785
01:49:52,061 --> 01:49:54,950
bass and Alex Van Halen. Those are, uh,

1786
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:56,740
and I'm actually listening
to the lamb of God. Now.

1787
01:49:56,741 --> 01:49:57,790
I don't know what the fuck happened.

1788
01:49:57,791 --> 01:50:01,510
You guys sent me that old school
fucking hip hop from the late nineties.

1789
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:06,160
I fucking devoured that shit. And then
now I'm going into deep into thrash.

1790
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:11,890
I Dunno. I like all of it. I like
all of it except country music. Oh,

1791
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:12,650
speaking of which,

1792
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:16,630
you seen that stupid song that fucking
woman wrote about being a redneck woman.

1793
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,170
How she likes being a redneck
woman. Okay. If you guys,

1794
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:24,460
if you got crushed in this economy,
if you want to get rich quick scheme,

1795
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:29,850
just write an anthem that celebrates
being a complete fucking moron.

1796
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:34,630
And I'm
in,

1797
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:38,980
you basically tell people that under
achieving in life is a good thing and

1798
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:42,100
people will absolutely love it. Like,
just sing those stupid songs where like,

1799
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:47,101
I'd rather have a beer and sit in my own
to where then fucking eat a steak and

1800
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:52,960
visit all the countries because,
well,

1801
01:50:52,961 --> 01:50:54,820
it's never going to be better land.

1802
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:59,270
But you can right here with my book
and Banjo in a bear, in a tennis fit.

1803
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:03,640
All right. Something like that.
It has to rhyme, you know,

1804
01:51:03,641 --> 01:51:06,390
and then you gotta throw the fucking flag
in there. I'll tell you right now, if,

1805
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:10,150
if, if, if country
musicians ever did stand up,

1806
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:14,200
they would be the fucking worst comedian.

1807
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:15,790
They would be the exact kind of comedian.

1808
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:19,860
I hate the one that panders to the
crowd, which is what, you know,

1809
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:21,850
the ones that fucking sit there

lot of them fucking singing those songs

1820
01:51:56,200 --> 01:52:00,160
