00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.610
And we have here a most
remarkable machine,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.640
which is being developed
by David Mitchelson.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.430
And he, in fact, knows how to
operate this better, I think,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.640
than anybody else does.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.660
So he's going to help
us to get this set up.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.280
Now, the way it
works is like this.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.620
Inside this box of tricks
there are three mirrors,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.370
one inside each window.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.130
And they're rotating
at very high speed.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.200
The two outside ones
spin about a vertical

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.820
axis about 3,000
times per minute.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.880
And this one spins
about a horizontal axis

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.700
at the same speed.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.240
They emit light
from the windows.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.910
The light is reflected back
from that prism of glass

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.160
that Mr. Mitchelson is
now holding in his hand.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.960
And the reflected light goes
back to these three mirrors.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.780
A signal is picked
up the instant

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:50.700
the light hits the
mirrors, which is virtually

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.680
instantaneous in the travel.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.070
And the angular position of
mirrors is then recorded.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.810
From trigonometry,
the computer, then,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.770
can work out exactly where that
little piece is, and can do it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.550
at high speed.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.850
And we shall be registering
the position on the xy plotter,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.220
that I hope you can see,
as the light is moving.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.820
No connection, except the
light, is driving the plotter

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.360
forwards and backwards as
Mr. Mitchelson moves it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.570
in those directions.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.059
Now, we need a volunteer
to help us with that.

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:20.850
And we've got somebody
kitted out, I think,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.100
who's able to do it.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.330
So if you'd like to come forward
and tell me what your name is--

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.820
Freya.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.220
Freya and Dominic.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.540
So, Freya, if you'd
like to stand there,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.180
Dominic, just behind
me for the moment.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.390
Take the pen in your left hand.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.556
Move it around a little bit.

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.200
Just get the feel of the action.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.240
And then what I'd like you to
do is to write the word "hello"

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.500
in the air.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.870
Not too big, but nice,
gentle movements.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.880
And you'll see that
the pen will actually

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.744
follow the writing in the
air and will spell it out

00:01:47.744 --> 00:01:48.660
on the sheet of paper.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.320
Fine.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.195
Would you like to go?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.870
That's going well.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.850
Now, you're writing freely.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.232
And do a nice, round
"o" at the end.

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:02.940
And there we are.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.648
That's very good.

00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:05.161
And we can see what you said.

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:05.660
Now

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:07.031
of course, that's just fun.

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:07.945
Doing it that way.

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:10.230
But it has a serious
purpose, of course,

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.454
and the purpose is clinical.

00:02:11.454 --> 00:02:12.870
And now we have
another volunteer.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.600
Dominic.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.709
Dominic, who's got one of
these things stuck on his head.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.000
Or will, in a minute, have
something stuck on his head.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.400
We now take this off and we
imprint it on his forehead.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.940
So that's the marker.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.840
And the machine, now,
should detect his motions.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.640
If you could stand just here,
on the yellow marker, there.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.200
That's right.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.800
That between your two feet.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.080
And now he's facing
the mirrors and we'll

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.480
ask him to stay still.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.280
It's impossible to
keep your head still

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.110
without swaying
slightly, and the trace

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.132
is now recording his swaying.

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:48.840
Would you like, now,
to stand on one leg?

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.860
More difficult to
keep still now.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.546
Would you like to
close your eyes?

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:56.920
And you can see
that he's moving.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.531
If I give him a gentle push,
then he falls right over.

00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.030
Fine.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.970
Thank you very much.
