getting out of bed in the morning to go
 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.800
getting out of bed in the morning to go
to the office and that was kind of a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810
to the office and that was kind of a
 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.690
to the office and that was kind of a
weird feeling because this was a company

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700
weird feeling because this was a company
 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.600
weird feeling because this was a company
i co-founded and if I felt that way I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610
i co-founded and if I felt that way I
 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.219
i co-founded and if I felt that way I
wondered how all the other employees

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229
wondered how all the other employees
 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.920
wondered how all the other employees
must have felt so we ended up selling

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930
must have felt so we ended up selling
 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.980
must have felt so we ended up selling
the company and what Zappos wanted to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
the company and what Zappos wanted to
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.200
the company and what Zappos wanted to
make sure that I didn't make the same

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210
make sure that I didn't make the same
 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.330
make sure that I didn't make the same
mistake again so from the beginning

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340
mistake again so from the beginning
 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.370
mistake again so from the beginning
culture has always been really important

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
culture has always been really important
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.180
culture has always been really important
and to this day culture is actually the

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190
and to this day culture is actually the
 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.039
and to this day culture is actually the
number one priority in the company and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049
number one priority in the company and
 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.170
number one priority in the company and
our whole belief is that if we get the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180
our whole belief is that if we get the
 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.370
our whole belief is that if we get the
culture right that most of the other

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380
culture right that most of the other
 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.620
culture right that most of the other
stuff like delivering great service or

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630
stuff like delivering great service or
 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.780
stuff like delivering great service or
building a long-term enduring brand will

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790
building a long-term enduring brand will
 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.900
building a long-term enduring brand will
just happen naturally on its own

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910
 
 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.170
 
so I guess my definition of you know

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180
so I guess my definition of you know
 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.530
so I guess my definition of you know
what culture would whether a culture

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540
what culture would whether a culture
 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.350
what culture would whether a culture
would be a right fit for me personally

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360
would be a right fit for me personally
 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.310
would be a right fit for me personally
would just be what I want to hang out

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320
would just be what I want to hang out
 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.130
would just be what I want to hang out
with these people if we weren't forced

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140
with these people if we weren't forced
 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.370
with these people if we weren't forced
to work together and at link exchange

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380
to work together and at link exchange
 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.230
to work together and at link exchange
the answer was no I mean that's athis

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240
the answer was no I mean that's athis
 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.660
the answer was no I mean that's athis
the answer's yes in fact most employees

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670
the answer's yes in fact most employees
 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.760
the answer's yes in fact most employees
when they leave the office leave to go

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770
when they leave the office leave to go
 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.350
when they leave the office leave to go
hang out with others hapless employees

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360
hang out with others hapless employees
 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.510
hang out with others hapless employees
and we spend our weekends together and

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520
and we spend our weekends together and
 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.199
and we spend our weekends together and
so that was really yeah that's probably

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209
so that was really yeah that's probably
 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.810
so that was really yeah that's probably
the criteria I use for whether a culture

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820
the criteria I use for whether a culture
 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.199
the criteria I use for whether a culture
it is right for me

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209
 
 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.030
 
well our whole belief is that if you get

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
well our whole belief is that if you get
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.339
well our whole belief is that if you get
the culture right then most of the other

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349
the culture right then most of the other
 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.440
the culture right then most of the other
stuff will happen naturally out of it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
stuff will happen naturally out of it
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.110
stuff will happen naturally out of it
but it really depends on you know what

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120
but it really depends on you know what
 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.910
but it really depends on you know what
the culture isn't so that it's a big if

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
the culture isn't so that it's a big if
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.030
the culture isn't so that it's a big if
we're us we've kind of formalized the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
we're us we've kind of formalized the
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.920
we're us we've kind of formalized the
definition of our culture into our ten

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
definition of our culture into our ten
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.839
definition of our culture into our ten
core values so if you do a Google search

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849
core values so if you do a Google search
 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.789
core values so if you do a Google search
for SAP those core values you'll see

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799
for SAP those core values you'll see
 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.789
for SAP those core values you'll see
what those ten are and I guess in

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799
what those ten are and I guess in
 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.180
what those ten are and I guess in
Herring in those 10 needs to be stuff

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190
Herring in those 10 needs to be stuff
 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.729
Herring in those 10 needs to be stuff
that is relevant to business for example

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739
that is relevant to business for example
 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.339
that is relevant to business for example
one of our core values is to embrace and

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349
one of our core values is to embrace and
 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.990
one of our core values is to embrace and
drive change I think that's really

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
drive change I think that's really
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.030
drive change I think that's really
important for business another one is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040
important for business another one is
 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.890
important for business another one is
about being adventurous creative and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900
about being adventurous creative and
 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.550
about being adventurous creative and
open-minded and another one is do more

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560
open-minded and another one is do more
 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.789
open-minded and another one is do more
with less and so I definitely think that

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799
with less and so I definitely think that
 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.649
with less and so I definitely think that
the core values need to incorporate

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659
the core values need to incorporate
 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.899
the core values need to incorporate
business concepts but they don't

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909
business concepts but they don't
 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.349
business concepts but they don't
necessarily need to sound business see

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359
necessarily need to sound business see
 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.190
necessarily need to sound business see
for example other companies might say

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200
for example other companies might say
 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.259
for example other companies might say
increased company efficiencies which is

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269
increased company efficiencies which is
 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.420
increased company efficiencies which is
exactly what do more with less means

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430
exactly what do more with less means
 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.819
exactly what do more with less means
we're just less formal about it

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829
we're just less formal about it
 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.819
we're just less formal about it
in terms of the actual wording
