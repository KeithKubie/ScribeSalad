an epinet is a diagram it's a diagram
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.980
an epinet is a diagram it's a diagram
that lets me figure out and map and keep

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
that lets me figure out and map and keep
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.169

track of what you're thinking what

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179
track of what you're thinking what
 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.300
track of what you're thinking what
you're thinking I'm thinking what other

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
you're thinking I'm thinking what other
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.250
you're thinking I'm thinking what other
people in the room think about what I'm

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
people in the room think about what I'm
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
people in the room think about what I'm
thinking and what each things about what

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
thinking and what each things about what
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.820
thinking and what each things about what
every other person in the room is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
every other person in the room is
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.470
every other person in the room is
thinking that sounds like a lot and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
thinking that sounds like a lot and
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.290
thinking that sounds like a lot and
that's why you need a diagram and it's a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
that's why you need a diagram and it's a
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.400
that's why you need a diagram and it's a
little bit different than your

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
little bit different than your
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800
little bit different than your
traditional social network diagram in

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
traditional social network diagram in
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.959
traditional social network diagram in
that you don't have only people that are

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
that you don't have only people that are
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.049
that you don't have only people that are
connected by edges and lines you also

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
connected by edges and lines you also
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.380
connected by edges and lines you also
have various beliefs so if I think that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
have various beliefs so if I think that
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.500
have various beliefs so if I think that
you think that today it is Friday then

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
you think that today it is Friday then
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.450
you think that today it is Friday then
there's going to be an arch that takes

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
there's going to be an arch that takes
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.119
there's going to be an arch that takes
us from me to you to the proposition

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
us from me to you to the proposition
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.970
us from me to you to the proposition
today is Friday if I think that you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
today is Friday if I think that you
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.529
today is Friday if I think that you
think that I think that today is Friday

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
think that I think that today is Friday
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869
think that I think that today is Friday
there's an arch that takes me from me to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
there's an arch that takes me from me to
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639
there's an arch that takes me from me to
you back to me and back to the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
you back to me and back to the
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.590
you back to me and back to the
proposition today is Friday why is this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
proposition today is Friday why is this
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.319
proposition today is Friday why is this
very helpful in the context of something

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
very helpful in the context of something
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750
very helpful in the context of something
like a meeting or a gathering of any

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
like a meeting or a gathering of any
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.420
like a meeting or a gathering of any
kind or an email exchange when we have a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
kind or an email exchange when we have a
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.300
kind or an email exchange when we have a
meeting there are a lot of unspoken

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310
meeting there are a lot of unspoken
 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.399
meeting there are a lot of unspoken
suppositions and a lot of attributions

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
suppositions and a lot of attributions
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.679
suppositions and a lot of attributions
that I make I think about what other

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
that I make I think about what other
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.660
that I make I think about what other
people think and what they think I think

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
people think and what they think I think
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.460
people think and what they think I think
and sometimes I have conversations with

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
and sometimes I have conversations with
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.530
and sometimes I have conversations with
somebody that are meant to be

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540
somebody that are meant to be
 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.240
somebody that are meant to be
dramaturgical so they're meant to be a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
dramaturgical so they're meant to be a
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.440
dramaturgical so they're meant to be a
piece of theater that we play out for

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
piece of theater that we play out for
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149
piece of theater that we play out for
the benefit of other people in the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
the benefit of other people in the
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789
the benefit of other people in the
audience so I might try to persuade you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
audience so I might try to persuade you
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260
audience so I might try to persuade you
that it's a good thing for you to put

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
that it's a good thing for you to put
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780
that it's a good thing for you to put
your hat in the ring for a presidential

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
your hat in the ring for a presidential
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.149
your hat in the ring for a presidential
race or the cane or race not because I

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
race or the cane or race not because I
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920
race or the cane or race not because I
think that's a good thing but because I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
think that's a good thing but because I
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080
think that's a good thing but because I
think somebody else thinks that I don't

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
think somebody else thinks that I don't
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.100
think somebody else thinks that I don't
think that's a good thing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
think that's a good thing
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230
think that's a good thing
I want to persuade that person that in

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
I want to persuade that person that in
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.730
I want to persuade that person that in
fact I think highly of you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
fact I think highly of you
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620
fact I think highly of you
so what I've done in that case is I've

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
so what I've done in that case is I've
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.429
so what I've done in that case is I've
used the topology of the beliefs that

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
used the topology of the beliefs that
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380
used the topology of the beliefs that
various people have and the beliefs that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
various people have and the beliefs that
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.060
various people have and the beliefs that
they have about other people's belief in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
they have about other people's belief in
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.539
they have about other people's belief in
the room to create a situation so you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
the room to create a situation so you
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.399
the room to create a situation so you
can think of an epinet first of all as a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
can think of an epinet first of all as a
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080
can think of an epinet first of all as a
diagram but then you can also think

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
diagram but then you can also think
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.899
diagram but then you can also think
about it as a design tool and it's a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
about it as a design tool and it's a
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.089
about it as a design tool and it's a
tool for the design of human

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
tool for the design of human
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.330
tool for the design of human
interactions in contexts that are

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340
interactions in contexts that are
 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.470
interactions in contexts that are
high-stakes interpersonal

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480
high-stakes interpersonal
 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.839
high-stakes interpersonal
the acute if you will because that's

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849
the acute if you will because that's
 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.759
the acute if you will because that's
where we spend a lot of time obsessing

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769
where we spend a lot of time obsessing
 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.710
where we spend a lot of time obsessing
about what everybody thinks and what

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
about what everybody thinks and what
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.580
about what everybody thinks and what
everybody thinks we think and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
everybody thinks we think and
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.500
everybody thinks we think and
complicated even the very simple

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
complicated even the very simple
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.740
complicated even the very simple
structures that I was telling you about

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
structures that I was telling you about
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.530
structures that I was telling you about
have a very complex interactive belief

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
have a very complex interactive belief
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.360
have a very complex interactive belief
hierarchy there are things that I

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
hierarchy there are things that I
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.820
hierarchy there are things that I
believe that you don't know about there

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830
believe that you don't know about there
 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.229
believe that you don't know about there
are things that you believe that I don't

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239
are things that you believe that I don't
 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:37.800
are things that you believe that I don't
know about

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810
know about
 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.960
know about
there are conjectures that you have

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970
there are conjectures that you have
 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.819
there are conjectures that you have
about what I think which I am oblivious

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829
about what I think which I am oblivious
 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.460
about what I think which I am oblivious
self because I can't even imagine some

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
self because I can't even imagine some
 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.460
self because I can't even imagine some
of them and there are things that I can

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470
of them and there are things that I can
 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.020
of them and there are things that I can
conjecture about you which you may be

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030
conjecture about you which you may be
 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.710
conjecture about you which you may be
oblivious of and it's very important to

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720
oblivious of and it's very important to
 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.300
oblivious of and it's very important to
not necessarily to obsess and to be

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310
not necessarily to obsess and to be
 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.069
not necessarily to obsess and to be
doomed to become neurotic about this but

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079
doomed to become neurotic about this but
 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.099
doomed to become neurotic about this but
it's important to be precise and it is

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109
it's important to be precise and it is
 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.050
it's important to be precise and it is
valuable to be precise and that is what

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
valuable to be precise and that is what
 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.630
valuable to be precise and that is what
a lot of the EPI Nets work that we've

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640
a lot of the EPI Nets work that we've
 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.910
a lot of the EPI Nets work that we've
done tends to show that more greater

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
done tends to show that more greater
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.240
done tends to show that more greater
precision greater depth so if I think

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250
precision greater depth so if I think
 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.099
precision greater depth so if I think
more carefully about what you think and

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109
more carefully about what you think and
 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.420
more carefully about what you think and
what you think I think and what you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430
what you think I think and what you
 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.300
what you think I think and what you
think I think you think then it makes me

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310
think I think you think then it makes me
 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.309
think I think you think then it makes me
more likely to respond to your concerns

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319
more likely to respond to your concerns
 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.180
more likely to respond to your concerns
it makes me more likely to address

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
it makes me more likely to address
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.020
it makes me more likely to address
problems issues and complaints that you

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030
problems issues and complaints that you
 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.050
problems issues and complaints that you
might have it makes us more likely to be

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
might have it makes us more likely to be
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.430
might have it makes us more likely to be
able to coordinate our actions

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
able to coordinate our actions
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.159
able to coordinate our actions
successfully it makes us more able to Co

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169
successfully it makes us more able to Co
 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.409
successfully it makes us more able to Co
mobilize in order to do something that's

mobilize in order to do something that's
 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.349
mobilize in order to do something that's
important to both of us and that comes

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359
important to both of us and that comes
 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.210
important to both of us and that comes
from greater precision it doesn't come

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220
from greater precision it doesn't come
 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.970
from greater precision it doesn't come
necessarily from a catch-all Theory like
