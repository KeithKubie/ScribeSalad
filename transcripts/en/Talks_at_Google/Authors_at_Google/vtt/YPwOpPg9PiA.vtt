JONATHAN: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.180
Welcome to Talks at
Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.410
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Ben Mezrich.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.890
Ben is one of the rare
nonfiction authors,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.650
like Michael Lewis,
whose books not only

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.660
have the urgency of
compelling fiction,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.420
but which become part
of the zeitgeist.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.070
We immediately think of
"Bringing Down the House,"

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.845
which became the movie "21," and
"The Accidental Billionaires,"

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:39.500
which became "The Social
Network," among many others.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.062
Ben joins us today to talk about
his 17th-- is that correct?

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:45.270
BEN MEZRICH: That is correct.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.250
JONATHAN: Yes, hooray.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.950
17th book, "Once Upon
a Time in Russia:

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.020
The Rise of the
Oligarchs-- A True Story

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.270
of Ambition, Wealth,
Betrayal, and Murder."

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.070
It's also destined
to become part

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.100
of our national conversation--
a story of two men who amassed

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.600
vast riches after the
breakup of the Soviet Union

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.840
and what happened to them then.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.370
Spoiler alert-- murder
is in the title.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.500
The book has already been
optioned for the movies

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.570
by Warner Brothers and Brett
Ratner's production company.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.646
And unlike the thousands
of times where we say,

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:23.020
oh yeah, it's been
optioned, this

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.240
is actually going to
be made into a movie.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.200
Believe it.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.530
So look for it on the big
screen before too long.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.420
And please join me in
welcoming Ben Mezrich.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.465
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:36.840
BEN MEZRICH: Thank
you very much.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.630
Thank you.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.470
Hi.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.780
Thanks very much.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.789
So yeah, my new book is
"Once Upon a Time in Russia."

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.830
But I figured I would talk
a little bit about how

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.190
I got here and the
previous books,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.590
because when you
go to see a band

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.140
and they won't play any of their
big hits, only the new one,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.223
you always get pissed off.

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:56.320
So I want to talk a little
bit about the older works.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.410
I never really set out to be
a journalist or a nonfiction

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.330
writer.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.142
I actually always hated
nonfiction growing up.

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:06.330
I was a big television
junkie when I was little.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.331
And I would watch
the worst TV shows,

00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:10.289
like "Saved by the Bell"
and "Three's Company."

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.980
And my parents,
fearing the worst,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.650
wanted me to start
reading books.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.400
So they made a rule
when I was little

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.410
that we had to read
two books a week

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.410
before we were
allowed to watch TV.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.470
So at the age of 12 or 13,
I became a speed reader.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.730
I would read everything.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.000
And by the time I was
graduating college,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.360
I realized I wanted
to be a writer.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.101
So I graduated.

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:30.850
I went to Harvard.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.540
I lived in Boston.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.930
And I was a big fan of
Bret Easton Ellis and Jay

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.720
McInerney at the time, which is
actually a big mistake when you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.178
want to be a writer,
because then I

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:40.560
attempted to be one of them.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.770
And I wrote nine
novels in the year

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.860
I graduated from college that
were all deep, dark stories

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.610
that took place in
bars in New York City

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.660
and consequently was rejected
by everyone in publishing.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.775
I got about 190 rejection
slips over a year.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.150
And I used to tape them to
all the walls in my apartment.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.140
I looked like a serial killer,
surrounded by rejection.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.130
But eventually I wrote a
book that was a little better

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.740
than the rest.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.980
It was a medical thriller,
because it was the dawn of "ER"

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.760
and George Clooney
was really big then.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.301
And everybody was
talking about "ER."

00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:12.830
So my dad is a
doctor, so I wrote

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.289
a medical thriller called
"Threshold," which none of you

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.080
have ever heard of.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.330
But it was my first book, which
got me a second book, which

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.520
was called "Reaper,"
which again, none of you

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.220
ever heard of, which was
about a computer virus that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.000
made the jump to the
biological world.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.950
And people started getting sick
from their television sets.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.470
And it was made into a very bad
TV movie called "Fatal Error,"

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.484
which still airs
on the SyFy channel

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:35.650
at like 2:00 in the morning.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.650
I don't know if any of
you have seen this movie.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.060
But it stars Antonio
Sabato, Jr. Remember him?

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.720
The underwear model.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.720
I think he was on "Melrose
Place" for a while.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.200
And he played a surgeon, which
was very believable casting.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.970
I didn't know surgeons
did so many sit ups

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.220
in between all their patients.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.700
But I remember
watching this movie

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.420
with my dad, who
is a doctor, again,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.920
and there was a scene where
Antonio Sabato, Jr. is

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.900
leaning over a patient's chest.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.286
And he goes, we've got
a subdural hematoma.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:03.660
And my dad turned
to me and goes,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.140
you know that's in the
head, right? [LAUGHS]

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.320
So it was the quality
of the work at the time.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.441
But I kept on going.

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:10.940
And I actually ended
up meeting some

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.260
of "The X-Files" producers.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.890
And they asked me to come
write for "The X-Files."

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.620
At the time I didn't drive,
so I didn't want to move to LA

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.550
and become an LA writer.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.560
So I wrote a book called "Skin,"
which stars Mulder and Scully.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.420
So if any of you are
real "X-Files" fans,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.230
you might have seen this book.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.990
But it was about a skin
transplant gone bad.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.430
And this professor gets a skin
transplant from a murderer

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.990
and starts murdering people.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.140
And Mulder and Scully track
the skin back to Thailand,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.710
where I had never been.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.560
So I wrote the whole book
from a Fodor's Guidebook.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.960
Google didn't exist back then.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.760
So it was pre-Google, I think.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.540
And it showed what I was doing.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.380
And it wasn't until I met these
MIT kids-- so I was hanging out

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.100
a bar, Crossroads,
which a lot of you

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.770
probably know Crossroads, which
is that bar across the river.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.274
And there was a
group of MIT kids

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:01.440
that used to hang out there.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.660
And I was introduced to them.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.170
And they were like
your regular MIT kids.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.420
They were kind of geeky.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.000
Most of them were Asian.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.860
But they had tons of money.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.370
And it was all in $100 bills.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.690
And the thing is, in Boston, you
never see $100 bills anywhere.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.840
In New York, you see
$100 bills a lot.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.100
In Vegas, they come out
of the ATM machines.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.890
But in Boston, you
never see $100 bills.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.750
And so I went up
to the main guy.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.620
In the book I called
him Kevin Lewis.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.167
In reality, his
name was Jeff Ma.

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:30.750
When I was writing
the book, he didn't

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.890
want to be known as
the blackjack guy.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.351
And then we made
the movie "21," he

00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:36.100
did want to be known
as the blackjack guy,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.750
so now I use his real name.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.550
I went up to Jeff.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.380
And I was like, why do
you have all this money?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.680
And he said, well,
come to my apartment.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.660
I want to show you something.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.118
And I went, and he had this
really nice apartment for a guy

00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:47.050
his age in the South End.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.650
And he shows me his laundry.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.185
And in his laundry was
$250,000 in stacks of hundreds.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:54.685
So immediately I
think, OK, this guy

00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:56.143
has got to be a
drug dealer, right?

00:05:56.143 --> 00:05:58.817
Because who has this much
cash in their laundry?

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.400
But he didn't seem
like a drug dealer.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.510
He was a really geeky guy.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.468
And he was really nice.

00:06:02.468 --> 00:06:05.370
And basically he invited
me to Vegas the next day.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.870
And so I went on
the plane with him.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.485
And five of his
buddies flew with us.

00:06:08.485 --> 00:06:10.610
But they all pretended they
didn't know each other.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.900
And everyone was sitting
in different seats.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.360
And we landed in Vegas.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.497
And there's this limo
waiting with this driver.

00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:17.330
And he's like, Mr.
Lewis, your car is ready.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.690
And that wasn't even
this guy's name,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.980
so this was pretty bizarre.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.850
And we went to this
huge suite in Vegas.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.616
We had like a swimming
pool and a butler.

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:26.490
We didn't even know what
to do with a butler,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.540
and we had a butler.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.280
And all the MIT kids show up
and start pulling money out

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.580
from under their clothes.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.210
And they stacked
it up on a table.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.830
And they said, we're
the MIT Blackjack Team.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.520
And so I had kind of
heard of something

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.469
called the MIT Blackjack Team.

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.010
No one had ever
written about it yet.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.080
There had never been
a TV show about it.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.780
I thought it was
like a math class

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.610
where you learned how
to play blackjack.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.180
But the reality
was this had been

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.740
going on for 25 years at MIT.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.240
And a group of
students would train

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.680
the next group of students.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.670
And essentially, this
group of six kids

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.020
had made over $6 million
playing blackjack.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.180
And I was blown away.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.750
And it was better than all of
the crap I had been writing,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.820
but it was true.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.010
So I essentially became
a nonfiction writer

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.160
to write that story.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.260
And I'm not going to
go too much into it.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.051
We could go into it if
people want to know.

00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:12.390
But you've seen the movie
"21," or a lot of you had.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.390
It was pretty much that-- 10
college kids hitting a casino.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.230
Card counting is actually
something fairly simple.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.630
The idea is that blackjack is a
beatable game because blackjack

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.210
has a memory, which means that
the deck changes as you play,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.585
which is different
than roulette.

00:07:29.585 --> 00:07:31.660
It doesn't matter how
many times you spin red,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.201
it's not going to
change your chances

00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:34.390
of getting a red or a black.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.510
But in blackjack, if all
the aces come out of a deck,

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.570
you can't get blackjack.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.810
So the odds do
change as you play.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.790
And there is a time when
the player has an advantage.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.510
And that's when there are more
high cards still in the deck.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.690
So all that card counting
is watching the cards,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.180
watching the cards, waiting
until more low cards have

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.900
come out.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.504
More high cards are still in,
and then you raise your bet.

00:07:54.504 --> 00:07:55.420
And that's what it is.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.380
The problem is the
casino frowns upon it.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.710
They don't want you doing this.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.570
They don't want you using
your brain in a casino.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.260
So if you get caught doing this,
you get kicked out or worse.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.470
The MIT team would
spread college kids out

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.530
across the casino, one kid
sitting at each table keeping

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.770
track of the cards.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.240
He would signal
in the guy called

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.730
the big player who comes
in, bets $10,000 here,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.110
$10,000 there.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.500
He's only betting on good
decks, so you're essentially

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.770
winning a higher percentage
of all those hands.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.520
And then when you get the
signal it's no longer good,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.199
you just keep walking
around the casino.

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.740
And so this system
works pretty well,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.539
until eventually
you do get caught.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.549
They start tracking one
of these big players

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.470
and realize this
guy's always winning.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.970
And they actually
followed them back

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.929
to Boston, these private eyes.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.510
They got a hold of
all these yearbooks.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.000
And they took all the
photos out of anybody

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.220
who had gone to MIT
in a 10-year period

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.970
and used in all the
facial recognition

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.530
software that the casinos use.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.030
So if had gone to MIT
in a 10-year period

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.844
and were betting big,
an alarm would go off

00:08:54.844 --> 00:08:55.760
in the security booth.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.080
And that's how they eventually
cracked the MIT Blackjack Team.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.760
So moving forward, I
wrote this story up.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.712
I wrote an article
for "Wired Magazine."

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.170
And the book was
about to come out.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.664
And Kevin Spacey
read the article.

00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:10.580
And I was sitting at
home and the phone rings,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.590
and it's Kevin Spacey.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.690
And he's like, I want
talk to Ben Mezrich.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.170
And I was like, it's
not really Kevin Spacey.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.560
And I hung up on
him, I remember.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.604
And I called my mom.

00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:20.020
And I was like, I think Kevin
Spacey is trying to call me.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.200
And she said no, it's MIT
kids prank calling you.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.200
Because they used to prank
call me all the time.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.400
But really, it was Kevin.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.900
I went out, and he said, I want
to make a movie out of this.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.300
And we actually sent it
out to all of the studios.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.075
And everyone rejected
it except for MGM,

00:09:33.075 --> 00:09:35.450
which was the same casino
system that we had been hitting

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.889
with the MIT Blackjack Team.

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:39.430
And so it turned they wanted to
get some of their money back.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.890
They were really
psyched to make it.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.640
The movie premiere
was about to happen.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.150
And we were doing this big
premiere in Vegas for "21."

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.650
And I was sitting at home, and
basically I got a random email

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.770
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.170
And it was an email
from a Harvard senior.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.600
And it said, my best friend
founded Facebook and no one's

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.930
ever heard of him.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.520
And so this was before
Facebook was big.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.370
Well, it was big.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.590
It was a hundred
million members.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.410
And I knew about Facebook
because I'd seen it.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.090
My wife was on it, and she kept
putting pictures up of parties

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.549
that I didn't know
we had gone to,

00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:12.840
and I'd see all these pictures.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.339
And I was like,
this is interesting.

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:16.160
I'd heard of Mark
Zuckerberg, but I'd never

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.020
heard of anybody else.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.160
So I went out for a drink.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.830
And it was in the
Bar 10 at the Westin

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.010
I don't think
that's still around,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.051
but if you remember that.

00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:25.090
And in walks Eduardo Saverin.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.110
And if you saw the movie
"The Social Network,"

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.066
he looked a lot like
Andrew Garfield--

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:30.690
not as good looking
as Andrew Garfield,

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.894
but he was kind of a
less good-looking version

00:10:32.894 --> 00:10:33.685
of Andrew Garfield.

00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:36.502
And he proceeds to get
really, really drunk.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.210
And he starts the
conversation by saying,

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.716
Mark Zuckerberg fucked me.

00:10:39.716 --> 00:10:41.840
And I thought that was kind
of an interesting start

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.930
to a conversation.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.640
And he began to
tell me that story.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.000
And a lot of you have
seen "The Social Network."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.360
You kind of know the story.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.770
Two geeky guys who had a lot
of trouble meeting girls-- Mark

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.790
was really smart with computers.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.590
Eduardo had made a lot
of money trading stocks,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.580
and his family was rich.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.060
And Eduardo had wanted to
be a member of this finals

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.560
club, The Phoenix, and got in.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.120
Mark couldn't get
into a finals club.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.828
And instead he went
on a date with a girl

00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:07.760
that went really bad.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.950
He got home.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.150
He drank a bunch of
beers and then hacked

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.960
into all these
computers at Harvard,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.990
got all these pictures
of every girl on campus,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.310
and made a site where you
could vote on who the hottest

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.430
girl at Harvard was.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.800
At the time, he also
had a little thing

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.750
where you could compare
the girls to farm animals.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.250
And when he got in
trouble for this,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.370
he said, well, the girls were
beating the farm animals.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.120
So he thought no one
should be mad at him.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.490
But it shows you the social
state he was in at the time.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.394
Basically, he leaked
this program out

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:36.310
to a bunch of friends.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.060
It spread all over campus.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.060
It actually got him
in a lot of trouble.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.560
He nearly got kicked
out of Harvard.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.935
And that's when he caught the
attention of the Winklevoss

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:44.650
twins.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.170
You couldn't invent these
guys if you wanted to, right?

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.230
6 foot 5" identical
twin Olympic rowers.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.010
They were the cool
kids on campus.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.810
They always wore suits to class.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.020
I remember meeting them in
a hotel room in New York.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.380
And Cameron or Tyler--
I don't know which one.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.560
You can't tell them apart.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.150
He was like, you
look at us, and you

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.730
think we've got to be the
bad guys in this story.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.240
Because we look like the
guys in an '80s movie who

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.020
would be chasing the
karate kid around

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.050
dressed as skeletons, right?

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.840
I remember I put that
line into the book.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.200
And then Aaron Sorkin put
that line into the movie.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.575
And then when the
movie came out,

00:12:17.575 --> 00:12:19.410
Ralph Macchio actually
called me and was

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.026
excited that the
karate kid was being

00:12:21.026 --> 00:12:22.150
talked about in this movie.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.274
So I thought that was cool.

00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:24.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.257
But the Winklevoss saw Mark
Zuckerberg getting in trouble

00:12:27.257 --> 00:12:29.340
in all the papers for this
website he had written.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.200
And they were working
on their own website

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.990
in their dorm
room, which is what

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.210
I loved about Harvard
at that time period,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.320
is even the jocks were making
computer programs in their dorm

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.870
room.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.130
They were working on a
dating website called

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.730
TheHarvardConnection.com.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.427
And the idea behind it was to
help women meet Harvard men.

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:48.010
Harvard men spent a
lot of time trying

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.301
to help women meet Harvard men.

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:50.440
This was their idea.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.130
The problem was they didn't
know anything about computers.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.030
So they wanted to hire
someone that could

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.401
make this program for them.

00:12:55.401 --> 00:12:57.150
They see Mark Zuckerberg
in the newspaper.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.700
And they say, we're
going to hire this guy.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.449
Now, Mark didn't think
much of their idea.

00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.570
He thought it was stupid.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.040
He thought they were stupid.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.850
But he thought, hanging out
with the cool guys on campus--

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.730
that's cool, so I'm
going to do that.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.840
So he basically led them on.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.920
He went to his friend
Eduardo, his roommate,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.210
and basically said, Eduardo,
I've got an idea for a website.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.810
People will put
their own stuff up.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.090
We won't get in trouble.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.870
If you put up the
money-- and at the time,

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.080
it was $1,000-- you
can be CFO and you

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.850
can have 30% the company.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.810
Now, it's two college
kids in a dorm room.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:27.740
There's no lawyers.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.280
There's no contracts
or anything like that.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.960
And Eduardo says
sure, here's $1,000.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.290
Mark locks himself in a room.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.680
He writes Facebook.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.180
And the rest is kind of history.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.130
It rolls out.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.320
Everyone at Harvard joins.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.364
It starts going from
college to college.

00:13:41.364 --> 00:13:42.780
When it hits
Stanford, that's when

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.545
Sean Parker joins
the story-- you know,

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:46.230
the Justin Timberlake character.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.970
He was the cool kid
of Silicon Valley.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.100
Some of you might know Sean.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.350
He dresses in Armani.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.780
He's got girls on his arms.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.470
But he also has an
EpiPen in his pocket

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.970
because he's allergic
to everything.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.230
So he's got that kind of mix
of cool and geek going on.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.340
Eduardo thinks he's
a snake oil salesmen.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.250
Eduardo doesn't
like Sean at all.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.930
Mark is totally into Sean.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.620
He idolizes Sean.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.370
Mark moves off to California.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.780
Eduardo stays behind.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.220
Sean ends up living
with Mark in a house,

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.020
and basically is starting to
take it to the next level.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.510
Eduardo feels like he's being
left behind, gets very upset,

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.420
and he freezes the bank
accounts of Facebook.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.170
At this point, he put
$18,000 into the company.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.330
He freezes it.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.860
So Sean takes Mark over
to Peter Thiel and says,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.720
we need some money.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.190
And Peter Thiel give them
half a million dollars,

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.020
but says, well, who's this
guy listed as your CFO who's

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.820
not even here?

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.600
We need to get rid of
this guy, basically.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.370
So they invite Eduardo
out to California.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.650
Eduardo shows up and walks
into a room full of lawyers.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.600
He thinks that
they're his lawyers.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.500
They're actually
Facebook's lawyers.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.700
He signs a document which
dilutes him to zero.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.740
Then he goes back to Boston.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.590
The Winklevoss, meanwhile, are
off rowing in Henley or London

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.300
or whatever.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.940
And they realize
that Facebook is huge

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.160
and they're not involved.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.420
They sue Mark.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.700
Eduardo sues Mark.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.620
And that's when I
came into the story.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.400
Eduardo wasn't supposed
to be talking to anybody.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.510
He was in the midst of
this massive lawsuit.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.480
He was being ignored.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.800
He wasn't getting anywhere.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.730
So he thought by
talking to a writer,

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.270
he could maybe force
Facebook to settle with him.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.300
I hung out with Eduardo.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.740
I wrote a 14-page book proposal.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.710
And my book proposal
leaked onto the internet.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.430
It landed on a site
called Gawker.com.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.030
And on that day, all
hell broke loose.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.140
Facebook settled
with Eduardo for what

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.790
eventually became $4 billion.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.570
Part of the settlement
agreement says,

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.810
you may never speak
to Ben Mezrich again,

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.010
because they were hoping to
stop the book from happening.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.002
So Eduardo sends me a
legal restraining order

00:15:45.002 --> 00:15:46.460
that I can never
speak to him again

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.139
and runs off to
Singapore, breaks

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:50.680
up with the girl he was dating
because she was my wife's best

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.380
friend.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.180
And listen, I understand,
for $4 billion,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.721
I would never speak
to me again, too.

00:15:54.721 --> 00:15:55.340
I get it.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:55.894
I get it.

00:15:55.894 --> 00:15:57.310
But he disappeared,
and I have not

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.240
spoken to Eduardo ever since.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.560
Facebook comes to me and is
like, what are you writing,

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.400
all this kind of stuff.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.024
I start going back
and forth with them,

00:16:04.024 --> 00:16:05.430
that I want to talk to Mark.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.280
Let me interview.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.010
Mark would not let
me interview him.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.980
He knew he couldn't control
what I was going to write.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.874
He knew the Winklevoss
were talking to me.

00:16:12.874 --> 00:16:14.290
So he did not want
any involvement

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.960
with it, which is his right.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.010
Basically, Aaron Sorkin also
saw this online and said,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.000
I want to write this
as my next movie.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.600
David Fincher saw
it online and says,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.590
I want to direct this as my next
movie, which is all wonderful,

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.700
except for I hadn't
actually written a book yet.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.375
So I locked myself in
a hotel room in Boston

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:32.670
and I wrote the book
in about three months.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.670
And Sorkin came out, and
he wrote the screenplay

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.080
about three weeks after that.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.060
And it became "The Social
Network," which was awesome.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.520
Had it not been for
"The King's Speech,"

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.070
it would have won
all the Oscars.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.861
But "The King's Speech"
was very good, too.

00:16:42.861 --> 00:16:46.460
But anyway, this is where
my career was at this point.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.550
And this is how we get to
"Once Upon a Time in Russia."

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.200
Brett Ratner, the director,
who did the "Hercules"

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.060
movie, "The Rush
Hour," movies, he

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.869
was a producer on
the movie "21."

00:16:55.869 --> 00:16:57.410
So I had known him
through the years.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:02.040
And he would often call
me with ideas for stories.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.180
They were always dangerous.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.575
They were always like gun
runners in Miami, or people

00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:07.950
who had been selling drugs
out of the back of their house

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:08.579
or whatever.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.430
And I would say, Brett, how
dangerous is this story?

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.480
And he'd always say, it's
like an eight out of 10.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.730
And I said, oh, I don't want
to do an eight out of 10.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.220
So anyways, two years
ago, he calls me up again.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.230
And he says listen,
Ben, I got a story.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.939
It's really good.

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:21.938
You need to come to London
and meet some people.

00:17:21.938 --> 00:17:23.369
And he didn't tell
me what it was.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.662
And I was like,
ugh, really, I got

00:17:24.662 --> 00:17:25.460
to fly all the way to London?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.609
He's like, Ben, trust
me, it's a great story.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.210
So I flew to London.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.169
I landed in London.

00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:31.585
I went straight
to this restaurant

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:32.814
where we were meeting.

00:17:32.814 --> 00:17:34.480
And there were all
these security people

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.700
outside, like a
dozen security, all

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.870
these black Mercedes limousines.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.120
And I get in, and
across the room

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.250
was an oligarch, so a
real Russian oligarch,

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.930
someone that is very famous.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.520
And I walk in.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.330
I'm like, no fucking way.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.455
That was my first response.

00:17:48.455 --> 00:17:50.010
I was like, Brett, I don't
want to be involved with this.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.870
This is too big.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.036
These people are very scary.

00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:53.460
It's this intense, huge story.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.900
But I sat down and I
began to hear this story.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.910
And it was really mind-boggling.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.860
It's this incredible drama about
these two men, Boris Berezovsky

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.560
and Roman Abramovich.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.570
And through them, you
get the whole story

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.500
of where Putin came from,
the fall of communism

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.950
and the rise of capitalism,
and this incredible creation

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:11.780
of wealth.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.050
At one point in time, seven
men owned 50% of Russia's GDP.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.070
And these were men from
nowhere with no backgrounds.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.470
They were poor.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.060
Many of them were Jewish
in an anti-Semitic society.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.840
They had built these
incredible fortunes off

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.460
of this chaotic, turbulent shift
from communism to capitalism.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.460
So after going back and
forth a number of times,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.602
I did decide to write it.

00:18:33.602 --> 00:18:35.560
And we ended up selling
the movie and the book.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.930
And so the movie's
going to be with Warner.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.290
And just to give you a
brief idea of the story--

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.450
because I don't want
to give too much of it

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.130
away, because not
everyone in the US

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.770
knows these names that well.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.740
Boris Berezovsky was
essentially a car salesman.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.300
And in the early '90s,
he was a mathematician

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.640
by background, a brilliant
man, but he was an outsider.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.094
He really didn't have
anything behind him.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.760
He wasn't a member
of a communist party.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.190
And when communism
fell, capitalism

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.010
was quickly shoved into
place by Boris Yeltsin,

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.420
who was the president.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.520
The idea was that
there was this fear

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.440
that communism would come back.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.150
So they wanted to quickly place
all of the resources of Russia

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.920
into the hands of
private people,

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.730
into businesses that were
owned by private citizens,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.320
so that it became
capitalism overnight.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.280
So essentially, there
was this free for all.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.950
And a man like Boris
Berezovsky, who

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.300
was very crafty and very smart,
was able to find a way in.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.160
He became a car
dealer, who essentially

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.780
became one of the
wealthiest men in Russia

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.122
by opening up car dealerships
all over the country.

00:19:33.122 --> 00:19:34.330
And that's what he was doing.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.520
In 1994, he was in
his car riding out

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.160
of one of his companies
when the car was blown up.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.200
He was nearly killed.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.504
His driver was decapitated.

00:19:43.504 --> 00:19:44.920
It was this
assassination attempt.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.587
He actually caught fire,
but was able to survive,

00:19:47.587 --> 00:19:49.420
had a lot of bandages
on them, and basically

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.860
decided he needed to
get into politics.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.030
Because the only way to
protect yourself in Russia

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.550
was to be a politician.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.720
So he wormed his
way into the Kremlin

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.930
and became part of the inner
circle of Yeltsin-- the Family

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.160
with a capital F.
It was at this point

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.490
that he met Roman Abramovich.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.190
He was on a yacht
in the Caribbean.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.990
And Roman Abramovich was
a 26-year-old toymaker.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.000
He used to make rubber
ducks and baby's toys.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.410
Came from nowhere, again--
an orphan from Siberia,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:19.720
no background at all.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.070
And he was on this boat.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.560
He met Berezovsky, and
he pitched him the idea

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.520
of privatizing an oil company.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.260
Basically, there
was all these pieces

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.400
of an oil company owned
by the Communist Party,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.264
essentially, that had
to become private.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:34.680
And they decided that they
would be the people who did it.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.000
So Boris Berezovsky
became his roof.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.140
In Russian, the word
is the [? cretia ?].

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.770
You have a roof above
you that protects you.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.620
It comes from the
mafia, but it moved

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.000
into politics and business.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.834
If you had someone above
you protecting you,

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:47.916
you could build a company.

00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:49.570
So again, just like
the Facebook story,

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.070
there were no shares
changing hands.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.310
There were no
contracts being signed.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.440
Berezovsky was in the Kremlin
and would help out on that end.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.960
And Roman would do the legwork
and be the businessman.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.380
And they built what became
the second largest oil

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.180
company in Russia, Sibneft.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.280
In this process,
they got wealthier

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.490
and wealthier and wealthier.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.240
Abramovich would have to
make payments to Berezovsky.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.900
Suitcases full of money--
these were the payments.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.380
They would show
up with $3 million

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.017
in a suitcase, $5
million in two suitcases.

00:21:17.017 --> 00:21:19.350
And these payments could come
once a week, twice a week.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.740
One year they ended up
giving him $100 million.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.830
It was crazy amounts
of money-- wealthier

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.130
and wealthier and wealthier.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.370
But at the same time,
Yeltsin was getting ill.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.620
He was getting sick.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.670
And the people behind
him, these oligarchs,

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.510
realized that Yeltsin
was going to die

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.710
and they needed to put someone
in his place, a new president.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.180
And that's where they
found Vladimir Putin.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.460
Putin was this nobody.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.580
He was a low level KGB
agent in St. Petersburg.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.540
He worked for the mayor
of St. Petersburg.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.599
He was known for being
incredibly loyal.

00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:48.890
And that's all he really had
going for him at the time.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.360
Nobody knew anything about him.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.390
But they wanted to place someone
in power who was very loyal.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.840
And they figured this is a cog.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.440
This is someone we can control.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.480
So they essentially
handpicked Putin,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.400
and they made him president
of Russia after Yeltsin.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.010
The minute he took over,
everything changed.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.280
A week later, he
invited these oligarchs

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.380
to Stalin's old house.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.480
You could actually see
bullet holes in the wall

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.430
where people had been
lined up and shot.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.150
The oligarchs were
sat down at a table.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.150
And Putin got in front
of them and said, listen,

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.550
you've all made a lot of money.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.050
You've done very, very well.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.290
You can keep your money,
but stay out of my way.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.870
And from that moment on, the
oligarchs were given a signal.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.090
They had two choices.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.250
Keep your money and do whatever
Putin says, or go against me

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.780
and you're either
exiled or dead.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.260
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.070
Berezovsky he went
up against him

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.914
and eventually ended
up exiled to London.

00:22:35.914 --> 00:22:38.080
And then-- well, I don't
want to give too much away.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.700
But you really pretty much know
this if you've read any news.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.860
He's eventually found
hanging a year ago.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.060
Meanwhile, Abramovich
stays in good with Putin,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.410
grows and grows and grows.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:54.030
He ends up offering
Berezovsky $1.3 billion.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.800
He hands him a check
for $1.3 billion

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.450
on an airfield in
France and says,

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.120
basically, here's your payoff.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.200
Now you're finished.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.260
And Berezovsky took the
money and then regretted it

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.460
and sued Abramovich, in the
largest lawsuit in history,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.700
for $6 billion in
the legal courts,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.710
and eventually lost the case
and then was found hanging.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.800
So this is the story.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.790
It's really intense.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.030
It's really huge.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.014
Throughout the story, there's
the character of Litvinenko

00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:20.680
some of you might
have heard of, the guy

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.280
who was polonium poisoned
a few years back.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.750
He actually moonlit.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.470
He worked as security
for Berezovsky

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.090
and also was a KGB
agent under Putin.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.340
So he's a character that
links all of these characters

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.560
together.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.330
But in the end, he met his fate.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.430
He drank a cup of tea that
was laced with polonium

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.290
and died in a very
horrible matter.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.357
On his deathbed,
he blamed Putin.

00:23:43.357 --> 00:23:45.190
But there's a lot of
mystery surrounding it,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.470
which I get into in the
book a little bit more.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.060
In the end, the story was
intense and crazy to write.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.170
I do remember one time
Brett and I were sitting

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.500
at a table with these people.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.440
And Brett goes, are we going
to get killed for writing this?

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.924
And the oligarch goes,
you watch too many movies.

00:23:59.924 --> 00:24:02.340
And then Brett said, well,
what if we say the wrong thing?

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.500
And he said, don't
say the wrong thing.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.140
So it's as simple
as that, right?

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.830
So I figured at this point--
I know it's a big story,

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.190
but I tell it in a small way.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.860
If you read the book
it's a thriller,

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.440
James Bond-esque a little bit.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.529
And all of it is true,
built on these sources.

00:24:19.529 --> 00:24:21.820
But I figure I'd open it up
to questions at this point.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.192
I know my career spans
a number of topics

00:24:24.192 --> 00:24:25.900
that you may or may
not be interested in.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.780
And I'd love to hear what
anybody wants to know.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.900
So-- sure.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.350
AUDIENCE: So hello.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.030
The question was,
you seem to stumble

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.039
upon these amazing stories,
or they are able to find you.

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.830
I'm just wondering how
you're so plugged in

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.480
and are able to identify these
things that other people just

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.660
say, eh, not a big deal.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.040
BEN MEZRICH: Yeah, right.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.810
Well, I have all
these criteria I look

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.030
at before I get into a story.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.196
And I want to first make
clear that I don't actually

00:24:54.196 --> 00:24:55.050
find these stories.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.250
They come to me.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.800
Ever since "Bringing Down
the House" and "21" came out,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.895
every college kid who does
something stupid emails me.

00:25:01.895 --> 00:25:04.270
Every college kid who does
something cool also emails me.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.130
All of these stories
started to come

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.890
and be sent to me because
of that movie and that book.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.640
The idea of a bunch of kids
taking on a casino really

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.845
caught something in the way
people who don't love authority

00:25:15.845 --> 00:25:19.140
or are very smart want to
do things different think.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.665
So people come to
me with stories.

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:22.790
And I look into the story,
and I try and figure out

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.490
not what's going to be hot or
what's going to be a big story,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.460
but what is intriguing
to me because it

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.610
has these themes of exotic
locations, something

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.365
using your brains.

00:25:31.365 --> 00:25:32.780
I don't want criminals.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.950
I want someone to do
something through ambition,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.757
but is super smart and figures
out a way to game the system.

00:25:37.757 --> 00:25:39.090
All of my books have that theme.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.020
And Mark Zuckerberg,
really, he changed a system

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.259
that didn't work for him.

00:25:43.259 --> 00:25:45.050
He was a geeky guy you
couldn't meet girls.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.580
As much as he
denies that, that's

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.000
really what his story was.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.450
And he wanted to create
a world where people like

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.770
him could be socially stars.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.720
And he created Facebook to
make a social world that

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.520
worked for Mark Zuckerberg.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.320
The oligarchs saw
an opportunity.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.380
They were incredibly
ambitious and smart.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.150
They were willing
to kill people.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.010
But they essentially
built these fortunes

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.320
because they looked at this
crumbling system and said,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.810
I know a way to win here.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.440
And so I'm always
intrigued by that.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.280
So it's not that I'm
trying to guess what's

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.279
going to be the next hot
thing, or is this going

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:15.570
to work for a big audience.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.700
I do, however,
never start a book

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.830
if I don't think
there can be a movie.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.720
Because I feel like if
it can't be a movie,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.500
it's probably not going
to be a good book.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.640
I know there's a
lot of writers who

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.264
don't think that way
and probably don't

00:26:27.264 --> 00:26:28.590
like me thinking that way.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.700
But I do feel like
the stories I choose,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.180
they work because they
could also be on the screen.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.600
They are very cinematic.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.500
They have those Shakespearean,
dramatic themes to them.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.454
So I really look
for those criteria

00:26:39.454 --> 00:26:41.245
when I'm trying to find
something to write.

00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:43.199
But yeah, it's tricky.

00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:44.990
I mean, you never know
what's going to work

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.948
and what's not going to
work when you sit down.

00:26:46.948 --> 00:26:48.840
So I remember when I
wrote the Facebook book,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.629
I sent it to Kevin
Spacey and Dana

00:26:51.629 --> 00:26:52.920
Brunetti, who runs his company.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.510
And one of their first comments
was, yeah, it works as a book.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.120
But I don't know if I
see this is a movie.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.280
And my mom said the same thing.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.620
She's one of my first
readers, always.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.720
And she's like, yeah, no
one cares about Facebook.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.845
And you know, maybe no one
did care about Facebook.

00:27:03.845 --> 00:27:07.290
But suddenly they did when it
was presented in the right way.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.650
So it's just a matter of
figuring out these themes that

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.200
really send a story forward.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.337
Sure.

00:27:14.337 --> 00:27:14.837
Anybody?

00:27:14.837 --> 00:27:15.337
Yeah.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:24.190
AUDIENCE: So with Russia
getting isolated with sanctions

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:28.810
with the standoff
over Ukraine, there

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.565
is a general
sentiment-slash-hope

00:27:32.565 --> 00:27:38.200
that the oligarchs might push
Putin away from that course.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.492
What are your thoughts on that?

00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:41.700
BEN MEZRICH: I actually
think there's a misconception

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.160
about Putin and the oligarchs.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.840
In the olden days, yes, the
oligarchs ran the country.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.540
There were seven men who
owned 50% of the GDP.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.780
They propped Yeltsin up.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.030
They created Putin.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.420
But everything flipped.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.009
Putin is above
the oligarchs now.

00:27:54.009 --> 00:27:55.550
It's not that the
oligarchs are going

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.540
to gather together
and get rid of Putin.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.250
Putin gets rid of the oligarchs.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.250
And I think there's a
misconception in the West

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.150
about Putin, how strong he is.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.220
He's very strong.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.970
The people in Russia love him.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.060
The oligarchs who have stayed
in control and power love Putin.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.930
They're known as
Putin's cash register.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.660
When he wants money, he asks
for it and they give it to him.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.640
So the idea that
sanctioning Russia

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.010
is going to make the oligarchs
take Putin down is incorrect.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.964
It's going to make
Putin react violently

00:28:20.964 --> 00:28:22.630
in a lot of different
ways, because he's

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.800
a very strong leader.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.960
He believes very
strongly that Russia

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.130
shouldn't be under the control
of the rest of the world.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.945
So I don't see that
happening, personally.

00:28:30.945 --> 00:28:32.320
I mean, I guess
I could be wrong.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.660
I'm not a Russian expert
in a lot of things, other

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.240
than this particular story.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.540
I really feel that
backed into a corner,

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.290
Putin becomes stronger
and lashes out more.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.230
So I don't know what
the answer is there.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.530
I do think that economically
the country is being hurt badly.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.520
The oil prices going down
is dramatically destroying

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.970
oligarchs' wealth as well
as the Russian wealth.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.330
But Putin's power
base seems to be

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.140
getting stronger, not weaker.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.630
The oligarchs who go up against
him don't end up well, right?

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.620
They end up dead, or
they end up broke,

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.850
or they end up in prison.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.040
And that continues.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.290
I don't know how that changes.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.019
You see a lot of
oligarchy money coming

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:10.060
into New York and London.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.510
The reason is the oligarchs
are afraid of what's

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.591
going on in Russia-- not for
Putin, but for themselves.

00:29:15.591 --> 00:29:18.090
They think, OK, I'm going to
go by $100 million house in New

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.298
York so I have money when
I have to get out of there.

00:29:20.298 --> 00:29:21.550
It's not the other way around.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.716
It's not, let's take this
money and take Putin down.

00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:26.410
So I don't know that is the
right way to look at it.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.220
I know that that is what
people want to happen.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.520
But in the real world, Putin is
a very popular man in Russia.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.740
He's more popular than any
president we've ever had.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.990
And that's not because they're
forced to vote for him.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.790
People love a strong
leader in a strong country.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.016
And that's what they
look to Putin for.

00:29:43.016 --> 00:29:43.890
So that's my opinion.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:44.431
I don't know.

00:29:44.431 --> 00:29:45.875
I mean, I'm not
an expert on that.

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:47.750
So there are people who
will say differently.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.936
But that's what I
think's happening.

00:29:49.936 --> 00:29:52.735
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to ask,
in writing this most recent

00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:54.360
book, "Once Upon a
Time in Russia," did

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.290
you have a chance to
personally interact

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.339
with some of the oligarchs?

00:29:58.339 --> 00:29:59.130
BEN MEZRICH: I did.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.530
I don't go into who my
sources are specifically.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.170
I definitely had
first readers who

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.280
read every line in this
book who were involved very

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.100
heavily in the story, so there
were at least one oligarch

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.627
involved.

00:30:12.627 --> 00:30:14.210
I will say this is
the first book I've

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.730
written where I didn't
want to uncover anything

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:17.820
that wasn't already known.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.450
And I wasn't like, I want
to find some secret tie

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.210
between Litvinenko's
murder and somebody

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.130
in particular, because that
wouldn't necessarily be good.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.350
But in general, I had
some amazing sources.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.910
I also had all these
incredible court documents.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.210
There were all these
depositions taken

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:36.180
in this trial between
Berezovsky and Abramovich,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.870
depositions all the way
to Putin's head of staff.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.680
Abramovich is deposed for
a thousand pages in there.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.987
And I received this document.

00:30:43.987 --> 00:30:46.070
And I don't know how much
of this trial was public

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.570
and how much of it
wasn't, but I was

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:51.020
at a meeting of these Russians,
and a man came up behind me

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.530
and put something
into my pocket.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.184
And he said, don't look at it
until you get to your room.

00:30:55.184 --> 00:30:56.350
And I went back to my hotel.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.433
And I put in the computer.

00:30:57.433 --> 00:31:00.632
And it was the entire trial
and all the depositions.

00:31:00.632 --> 00:31:02.590
And then I had to fly
home to the US with this.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.370
I was like, is this even
something I'm supposed to have?

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.060
I have no idea.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.143
But I didn't get arrested.

00:31:06.143 --> 00:31:08.570
So anyway, it was
an amazing story.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.820
And I did have access to a lot
of really great information.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.759
But in general, I'm not really
naming sources in this one.

00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:15.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.174
I guess just a more
general question about it

00:31:17.174 --> 00:31:19.360
then, about the
sources you did have.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.522
How were they as people?

00:31:20.522 --> 00:31:21.230
BEN MEZRICH: Yes.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.080
You know what?

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.980
Very pleasant.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.610
I get blamed for this a lot.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.050
I love the people I write
about in every book.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.550
I think it was Janet
[? Mazen ?] who

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.050
said I'm like the evil
billionaire's best friend.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.660
But the reality is is
that I like people,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.990
and I like people who are open.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.160
And what I like most
about people like this

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.645
is that they're not fake.

00:31:42.645 --> 00:31:43.410
You know what?

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.390
You see right up front
who these people are.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.962
There's no lying going on.

00:31:46.962 --> 00:31:48.920
They tell you exactly
how they made their money

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.044
and where they got it from.

00:31:50.044 --> 00:31:53.260
And hearing the stories like
that, it was an amazing thing.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.590
So in general, I actually
got along well with them.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.340
There was one person I was
working with for a long time.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.580
And then as I did my research,
I was like, holy crap.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.540
This guy was, like, heavy.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.950
This guy was a tough
guy, but in person,

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.450
very kind and very smart.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.010
And I learned a lot.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.850
For the most part,
these are very smart,

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:12.180
ambitious people who are
living in a very Wild West--

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.230
they call it the
Wild East-- society,

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.330
where there weren't the
same sort of rules you

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.709
have in the West in business.

00:32:17.709 --> 00:32:19.500
They said, don't look
at the '90s in Russia

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.550
like the '90s in America.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.810
Look at the '90s in Russia
like the 1890's in America,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.090
where people were shooting
each other on the street.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.750
This was a world in which if
you were the CEO of a company,

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.060
and the CEO of another
company came against him,

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.520
and you killed him,
you got his company.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.410
That doesn't happen
in American business.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.059
There's a board of directors.

00:32:37.059 --> 00:32:38.350
It doesn't get you the company.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.070
But in Russia, at the time,
it did get you the company.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.760
There's a great
story in the book--

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.880
and this is all true--
where the oil company

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.120
they were building,
they needed what's

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.260
called a red director,
which was a communist leader

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.870
of a piece of a company, to
OK the deal they were making.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.450
So they went to meet
with this guy in Siberia.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.970
He's an Old World Communist guy.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.520
And it was Abramovich
and Berezovsky.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.040
Berezovsky had lunch with him.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.940
And they said, we need
you to OK this deal.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.850
And this guy said, no, I'm
not going to OK this deal.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.090
So they went back to Moscow.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.860
That night, that man went
swimming in the Irkutsk River

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.890
in the middle of
Siberia, drowned.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.400
His bodyguard, who was the only
witness, got into a bar fight

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.570
and died.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:20.920
And then the deal went through.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.010
So I hear this story.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.440
And I'm like, well, that
sounds a little shady, right?

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.565
And they guy goes, yes, it
was much trouble for us.

00:33:26.565 --> 00:33:28.806
Everyone assumed
we had him killed.

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:30.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.120
I don't know.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.342
But that was the story.

00:33:33.342 --> 00:33:34.300
He went and he drowned.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.290
It happens.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.710
The way they described
it, he was a big man.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.350
He was macho.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.360
He had these girls with him.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.430
He wanted to impress them.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.360
He jumped in the water.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:41.859
It was cold.

00:33:41.859 --> 00:33:43.400
He had a heart attack.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.390
It happens.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.150
So the story is there.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.070
It's an incredible story.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.630
But in the scope
of this story, this

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.590
happened over and
over and over again,

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.290
where the person
in your way died.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.330
Something would happen.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.350
And it was a lesson,
but everyone kind of

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.704
knew the game they were playing.

00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:00.120
That's the other
thing about this.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.480
Nobody was a businessman
in Russia in the '90s

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.500
and didn't realize that this
is how this game worked.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.810
They all had security
of 50, 60 men.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.510
Every company had a
division of wetworks

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:14.870
whose job it was to deal with
security issues, anything

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.710
from protecting a
CEO to bashing up

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.469
a showroom of another company.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:22.090
So that's how business
was working in the '90s.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.610
It was very corrupt and chaotic.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.930
And Abramovich had a
great quote in the trial,

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.679
where they ask him
about this and he says,

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.178
well, this was the
world we were in.

00:34:29.178 --> 00:34:30.810
I mean, this was how it worked.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.489
Was it corrupt?

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:32.280
Was it chaotic?

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:32.940
Sure.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.830
But we were all
businessmen in the world

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.380
with these sorts of rules.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.090
So your choice was
to be a businessman

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.820
or not be a businessman.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.801
So I actually am
intrigued by that.

00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:43.300
I could never do
anything like that.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.341
I'm scared of everything.

00:34:44.341 --> 00:34:49.920
But the idea to me is these were
very upfront, ruthless people

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.900
working in a very
ruthless, upfront society.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.909
So I don't know.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:56.560
There's something
appealing to me about that.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.600
AUDIENCE: Do you
multitask at all?

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.980
So when you work
on this project,

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.450
do you have things lined up?

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:01.890
BEN MEZRICH: I do.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.890
I have a lot of projects
going on at the same time,

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.080
more than one should have.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.810
I have four movies
in development,

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.370
a television show with
FX and Jerry Bruckheimer

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.791
based on my book
"Ugly Americans."

00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:12.540
Some of you might have
heard of this book,

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.680
about expats living in Asia and
the Japanese sex underground.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.071
But it's also about bankers
in Tokyo around 2000--

00:35:21.071 --> 00:35:23.570
although we're updating it, so
it's like "Entourage" in Asia

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:24.140
now.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.160
So the show is
going to be called--

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.930
I don't know what it's
going to be called,

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.721
but it's based on my
book "Ugly Americans."

00:35:28.721 --> 00:35:31.695
So I'm working on multiple
projects, and then this book,

00:35:31.695 --> 00:35:33.070
and then another
project as well.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.710
So I do have a lot going on.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.281
I try and focus until
something is done

00:35:37.281 --> 00:35:38.530
and then move to the next one.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.488
But in general, it's
impossible, because if you

00:35:40.488 --> 00:35:43.830
have multiple things going--
so yeah, I multitask a lot.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:47.140
But it's more like just
crazed, wild, this and this

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:47.890
and this and this.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.790
It's not a controlled
multitasking.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.540
I'm not like one of those people
who keeps a book, and this 15

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.130
minutes, I'm doing this, and
there's 15 minutes of that.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.450
I should be one of those people.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:56.725
But instead I'm just
doing this-- oh, shoot,

00:35:56.725 --> 00:35:57.390
I have to do that.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.598
Oh, shoot, I have to do that.

00:35:58.598 --> 00:36:00.170
And then somehow,
it all gets done.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.725
I don't recommend this form
of working for anybody,

00:36:02.725 --> 00:36:03.890
but this is what I do.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:04.520
Yeah.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.290
Sure.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:07.640
AUDIENCE: So there's
this point in your story

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.260
that seems like this lacuna
that you don't quite believe.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.860
It begins with-- so
you meet Ma in a bar.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.360
And I knew people who knew some
of these people back at MIT.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.943
They didn't just,
like, tell everybody

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:20.350
in a bar what they did.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.040
So there was some
conversation you had.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.772
And then you said,
oh, come back to my--

00:36:23.772 --> 00:36:25.980
Somehow, like, yeah, you
just-- and then these people

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.750
tell you all their secrets.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.580
Some I'm curious what you
can tell us about that.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.980
BEN MEZRICH: I'm very
ingratiating, first of all.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.780
I think people in
general-- I don't

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.830
go in with a notebook
or a tape recorder

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.635
and get people to
tell me their stories.

00:36:35.635 --> 00:36:38.010
First of all, it's people who
want to tell their stories.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.046
People come to me
all the time and say,

00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:40.671
you know what would
make a great story?

00:36:40.671 --> 00:36:42.020
FIFA, all the craziness in FIFA.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.769
Well, yeah, that would
make a great story.

00:36:43.769 --> 00:36:45.850
But I need a guy who
wants to tell the story.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.080
And Jeff was a guy who
wanted to tell the story.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.080
I met Jeff through
the girl on the team,

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.509
who introduced me to them.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.300
She was the one that
Kate Bosworth ended up

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.227
playing in the movie, Jane.

00:36:55.227 --> 00:36:56.310
She's here in Boston, too.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.540
She's at Ropes &amp; Gray,
a big-time lawyer now.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.110
She was dating one of the
MIT blackjack members.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.420
Now, I didn't know that.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.805
I didn't know that she
was a blackjack player.

00:37:05.805 --> 00:37:07.930
She was actually one of
the best blackjack players.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.530
And she basically
ended up saying,

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.760
you got to meet these guys.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.326
So I met them,
saw all the money,

00:37:12.326 --> 00:37:13.950
and then started
following Jeff around.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.950
Jeff wanted to tell his story.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.381
It wasn't like twisting his arm.

00:37:17.381 --> 00:37:19.380
Although there was a point
right before the book

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.979
came out that
suddenly he realized

00:37:20.979 --> 00:37:22.020
this was going to happen.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.130
He was like, let's
just cancel this.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.030
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.154
And I was like, Jeff, this
is coming out in a week.

00:37:26.154 --> 00:37:27.920
You don't have a
choice anymore, Jeff.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.862
But I do become friends
with these characters.

00:37:29.862 --> 00:37:31.070
I become part of their lives.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.360
As I said, Eduardo was
dating my wife's best friend

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.359
and we were hanging out.

00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:35.882
That's how I write my stories.

00:37:35.882 --> 00:37:37.340
So when someone
pitches me a story,

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.260
I'm also trying to figure
out how close to this person

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.064
can I get.

00:37:41.064 --> 00:37:43.230
And sometimes it works out
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.630
Sometimes it becomes
an awful situation,

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.370
where you're with
someone for a long time

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.300
and you realize this is going to
go bad somewhere along the way.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.250
But that's the way
I write my stories,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.470
is I become a part of it.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.180
I join into whatever group
it is I'm writing about.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.644
With the Russian oligarchs,
it was much trickier.

00:37:58.644 --> 00:38:00.560
I got along very well
with a lot of the people

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.490
I was working with.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.370
But in the back of
your head, you're

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.203
thinking, well, what
have these people done?

00:38:04.203 --> 00:38:05.770
Who are these people really?

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:09.970
But in general, I try and find
a way to get inside their head

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.110
and get very close to them.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.150
And so in the end, they
really want to talk.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.250
And I will say the
movie thing helps a lot.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.410
Almost everyone wants to
see themselves in a movie.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.170
Everyone thinks that their
story needs to be on the screen.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.700
And a lot of people's story
could be on the screen.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.080
And so essentially,
when I go into it,

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.330
people know that there's a
chance it could be a movie.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.190
They'll be more
talkative and more open.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:32.520
Other people, of course,
immediately clam up,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.965
people who don't want
their story told.

00:38:35.965 --> 00:38:37.590
And I know when that's
going to happen.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.798
I'm like, OK, this person
is not going to talk to me.

00:38:39.798 --> 00:38:41.380
But the MIT team
that I worked with,

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.930
they all really wanted
their story out there.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.710
So yeah.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.350
Sure.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.110
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned oligarchs

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:54.810
trying to put their money in
safe places, such as New York

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:55.950
real estate.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.010
And before the talk,
you said something

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.390
which seemed
particularly fascinating,

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:06.530
which is American movies
as a particularly big focus

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.210
for oligarchs.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.110
BEN MEZRICH: Yeah,
so Brett knows

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.340
a lot of these guys
personally, which

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.760
is how we got into the story.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.530
There's a lot of Russian
money in Hollywood.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.444
There are people with enormous
amounts of money-- and not just

00:39:16.444 --> 00:39:17.860
the oligarchs with
their billions,

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.710
but multi-millionaires
from Russia--

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:20.777
who want to make movies.

00:39:20.777 --> 00:39:22.360
And the honest truth
is that Hollywood

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.230
will take money from anybody.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.340
It doesn't matter who you
are or what you've done.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.130
If you're willing to put a
few million dollars into movie

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.930
that will probably not make
any money, you're welcome.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.150
You can be a producer.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.590
So a lot of money is coming
in from Russia into Hollywood.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.757
And so that's where this story
probably was connected into.

00:39:40.757 --> 00:39:42.590
But yes, there's a lot
of money going into--

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.720
and to a lot of industries.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.420
I mean, listen.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.230
You know, there's hundreds
of these billionaires,

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.990
essentially, now from
countries like Russia and China

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:52.700
and the Middle East whose
countries are not that safe.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.030
So where are they going
to put their money?

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.090
They're going to
move it all here.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.360
Which makes it hard
for regular people

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.070
to buy apartments in
Boston now, right,

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.580
but that's essentially where
all this money is coming from.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:03.450
Yes.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.680
AUDIENCE: So now that you
have a personal connection

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.701
to the Brooklyn Nets,
I hope that you will

00:40:07.701 --> 00:40:09.050
be moving into spots stuff.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:12.650
And I'm sure you're hard at work
on the FIFA scandal right now.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.930
That would be the
obvious next project.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.982
I actually have two questions.

00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:17.690
I hope that's OK.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.440
BEN MEZRICH: Sure.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.940
AUDIENCE: And
actually, one question

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.320
is a little obliquely
related to this.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.500
People often put you
and Michael Lewis

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.010
in the same category Jonathan
did when he introduced you.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.950
There's some obvious
similarities there,

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.430
although Michael Lewis's
subjects seem a little more

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.250
staid than a lot of yours.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.540
But I'm just wondering if you
have any kind of relationship

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.160
at all with Michael
and have ever

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.110
thought about doing
anything collaborative.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.610
And that leads me to
the second question,

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.880
which is-- I'm not clear.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.680
Have you ever done any
actual screenwriting?

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.300
And would you want to do that?

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.170
Have you tried it?

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.809
Do you do it?

00:40:53.809 --> 00:40:55.600
That's certainly an
area where people often

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.766
collaborate with each other.

00:40:56.766 --> 00:40:59.105
But anyway, those are my
two questions, Michael Lewis

00:40:59.105 --> 00:41:00.080
and screenwriting.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:00.320
BEN MEZRICH: Yeah.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.445
So Michael Lewis, first of
all, one of the greatest

00:41:02.445 --> 00:41:03.790
writers around today.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.950
And he has Wall
Street covered so well

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.680
that I can't do Wall
Street unless I find

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.350
something he wouldn't touch.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.545
I think he's amazing.

00:41:10.545 --> 00:41:12.670
I'm very competitive and
sad that he's so much more

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:13.462
successful than me.

00:41:13.462 --> 00:41:14.628
I think Michael's brilliant.

00:41:14.628 --> 00:41:15.230
He's a genius.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.450
I have never worked with him.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.470
I've never met him.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.220
He's my younger brother's
favorite author,

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.310
which bothers me to no end.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.143
Every time I write a
book, my little brother

00:41:22.143 --> 00:41:24.740
calls me and goes, it's good,
but it's no Michael Lewis.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.064
But yeah, he's amazing.

00:41:26.064 --> 00:41:27.480
And I would love
to work with him,

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.620
I just don't know how that
would ever come about.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.850
In terms of screenwriting,
I've written one screenplay,

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.350
for my book "Ugly Americans."

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.920
I had written it for 2929
or DreamWorks at the time,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.650
I can't remember.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.983
It didn't get made, and now
it's being made into a show.

00:41:41.983 --> 00:41:43.035
So I'm not writing that.

00:41:43.035 --> 00:41:46.300
I will write screenplays, but
I'll always be a book writer.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.250
I love the idea of
doing a screenplay,

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:49.550
and I probably will do it.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.380
I think the process is very
tough, and in many ways,

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.230
demeaning.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.041
You write it, and
there's a whole committee

00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:58.290
of people that work with you
and change it, change it,

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.498
and change it, and change it.

00:41:59.498 --> 00:42:00.510
And it never gets made.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.470
There's hundreds of
working screenwriters

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.950
who make good livings who've
never had a movie made.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.630
And that would be incredibly
frustrating to me.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.980
With a book, you write the book.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.550
For better or worse,
you control it.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.490
It comes out.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.460
Whether people buy it or not,
you don't have a lot of control

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:14.960
over.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.010
But it's your
project, and then they

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.630
can make a movie out of it.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.180
I will do screenplays.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.050
I'd like to adapt some
of my own projects.

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.444
In general, Hollywood does
not want you to do that.

00:42:24.444 --> 00:42:25.860
When you sell a
project, they want

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.970
to attach an A-list
screenwriter to it.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.910
And that's the quickest
way a movie gets made.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.576
So you usually say
yes, because the goal

00:42:31.576 --> 00:42:32.870
is to get a movie made.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.386
If I wanted to, I could
say, no, I want to write it.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.260
They would say, sure.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.926
They'd let me write it, and then
they would hire a screenwriter.

00:42:38.926 --> 00:42:40.340
So usually that's what happens.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.690
But I will eventually
try my hand

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.330
in a bigger way
in screenwriting.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.094
I think it's a very
different format.

00:42:46.094 --> 00:42:47.760
You don't get all the
interior dialogue.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.093
You don't get a lot of the
stuff that you get in a book.

00:42:50.093 --> 00:42:52.670
But on the other hand,
my books are always,

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.850
for better or worse,
called cinematic.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.750
I think my very
first book review--

00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:00.130
when I was 25 years old, in
"The New York Times"-- it said,

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:01.220
this is a bad book.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.920
Someone should make
it into a movie.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.469
So I think from
the very beginning,

00:43:04.469 --> 00:43:06.260
I've always been seen
as someone who writes

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.840
books that could be movies.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.120
So eventually, I probably
will do more screenplays.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.370
But also, the reality is I
never want to leave Boston.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.090
I love the city.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.130
This is where I live.

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:15.790
And to be a working
screenwriter,

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:17.210
eventually you end up in LA.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.110
And that's not for me.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.420
I love LA for a week.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.140
But beyond that, I got
to come back to Boston.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.720
So yeah, so far so good.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.220
And Michael Lewis,
listen, anytime

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.990
he wants to do
something, I'm here.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.720
But he's great.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.872
I think he's an amazing writer.

00:43:32.872 --> 00:43:33.830
Anybody else, question?

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:34.312
Sure.

00:43:34.312 --> 00:43:36.910
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
which work are you most proud,

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:37.540
and why?

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.290
BEN MEZRICH: Yeah.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.690
I would say "Once Upon a Time in
Russia" I think is in many ways

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.080
my first adult book.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.100
It's my first book
of a serious topic.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.507
I did an interview for
the BBC the other day.

00:43:49.507 --> 00:43:51.340
And they're like, so
tell me about glasnost.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.081
And I was like, holy
shit, what did I do?

00:43:53.081 --> 00:43:54.580
I can't tell anybody
about glasnost.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.640
But I think "Bringing
Down the House"

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.160
was the book that was
most, like, amazing to me.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.300
It changed my life.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.759
I was out in Vegas.

00:44:01.759 --> 00:44:02.300
I wrote this.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.430
It was my first nonfiction
book, and it did very well.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.410
So that was a book
I'm very proud of.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.740
I think "Ugly Americans"
is a great story.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.840
Japan was amazing.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.486
I spent a month over there
and was just blown away by it.

00:44:14.486 --> 00:44:16.360
And I thought that was
a lot of fun to write.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.776
I wrote a book called "Sex on
the Moon," which we're still

00:44:18.776 --> 00:44:20.720
trying to make into a
movie, about a kid who

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.410
stole moon rocks from NASA.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.840
And it's a really wild
"Catch Me if You Can"

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.470
type of story, where he
stole the 600-pound safe

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.750
full of moon rocks from every
moon landing in history.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.660
And he spread them on a bed
and had sex with his girlfriend

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.700
on the moon, and then
tried to sell the moon

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.970
rocks over the internet.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.660
And it's this wild,
bizarre true story.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.030
He ended up spending 10
years in prison for what to

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.264
him was like a college prank.

00:44:43.264 --> 00:44:45.430
And then the day he got out
of prison, he called me.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:46.910
And he was like, I want
to tell you a story.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.320
And I was meeting
this guy who had just

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.320
been in prison a decade.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.486
And I was, like, all scared.

00:44:50.486 --> 00:44:52.510
And he's like the
nicest guy, super smart.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.180
He was on his way to
being an astronaut

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.260
and had just done
something really stupid.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.070
And I was kind of just
interested in that.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.986
And I think that book
came together very well.

00:44:59.986 --> 00:45:01.660
So "Sex on the Moon"
was a good one.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.912
But yeah, I think
that people will like

00:45:03.912 --> 00:45:05.120
"Once Upon a Time in Russia."

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.200
I think it's going to
make an awesome movie.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.970
So hopefully that's
a project that people

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.430
will look at and like.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.590
Anybody else?

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.881
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
"Once Upon a Time in Russia"

00:45:15.881 --> 00:45:18.200
as your first adult book
or sort of serious topic.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.070
Are you hoping anything comes
of it beyond a movie and people

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:21.570
reading it?

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.204
Are you hoping that will cause
any changes here or in Russia

00:45:24.204 --> 00:45:25.120
or anything like that?

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:25.390
BEN MEZRICH: Well, listen.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.570
I do want to preface this
by saying, first of all,

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.740
that this is probably the
most pro-Putin book you're

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.890
going to read from an American
author around this time.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:36.030
Because in the
scope of this story,

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.110
Putin is not the bad guy.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.110
He came to this
country at a time

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.680
when everything
was falling apart.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.300
Oligarchs had all
this wealth and money.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.620
Nobody knew what to
do with capitalism.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.140
And he took power, basically
saying, no more taking

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.390
the money out of this country.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.450
This country is going to get
great and strong and powerful

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:52.950
again.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.610
And I'm going to wipe out
anybody who says no to that.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:46:01.890
So in the scope of the
story, he's not the bad guy.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.490
But I will say-- do I want
anything serious to happen

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.390
because of this book?

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.030
You know, that's
a good question.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.012
I don't ever sit
down and think, how

00:46:09.012 --> 00:46:10.220
is going to affect the world?

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.386
Am I going to change policy?

00:46:11.386 --> 00:46:13.300
Is anything going to
happen because of this?

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.034
I just don't take myself
that seriously in general.

00:46:16.034 --> 00:46:17.200
I write thrillers, you know.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.880
I write fun,
entertaining stories.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.120
I do think people will get a
better perception of Putin,

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.510
a better, more real
perception of how this all

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.404
happened by reading this book.

00:46:27.404 --> 00:46:29.820
Because you really don't see
a lot in the news about where

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.450
he came from.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.033
You really don't see
a lot in the news

00:46:32.033 --> 00:46:36.780
about why he's so powerful,
or why these oligarchs are

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:37.700
all in London.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.320
And I feel like this
is the first time

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.869
the story is told in this
way, or at least in a big way.

00:46:43.869 --> 00:46:44.660
Yeah, I don't know.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.993
I don't have the solution to
all the problems in Russia.

00:46:46.993 --> 00:46:50.947
It's such a complicated
issue, the world as it is now

00:46:50.947 --> 00:46:53.030
and how Russia is dealing
with the Ukraine and all

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.890
this kind of stuff.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.640
I just think reading
this book will

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.550
help people have a better
understanding of that period

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.032
in time, the '90s.

00:47:00.032 --> 00:47:01.740
But no, for me it's
really entertainment.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.677
In the end, I'm an
entertainer, I think.

00:47:03.677 --> 00:47:04.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:05.630
BEN MEZRICH: Yes.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:08.300
Hey.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.700
AUDIENCE: OK, so
connected to that,

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.010
do think that when it goes
from your book to your movie,

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.140
the general sort of
sentiment is preserved?

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.570
And do you think it will be
in this movie about Putin

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:19.110
and Russia?

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:20.609
BEN MEZRICH: Yeah,
a great question.

00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:22.660
So for me, I sell
the project, and I

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.250
hope I sell it to the people
who will make the best movie out

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:25.750
of it.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:27.620
Because once you
sell it as an author,

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.759
you're on the lowest
part of the totem pole.

00:47:30.759 --> 00:47:31.800
You're below the caterer.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.680
You're not important.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.720
And they don't want-- they want
you to hang out there, and sit

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.220
at the bar, and hang out with
the actors, and then go away.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.011
I always say the
producer's favorite author

00:47:40.011 --> 00:47:41.530
is a dead author,
because then they

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.210
don't have to deal with them.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.300
So in general, I've
been very lucky.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.180
I thought "21" was really fun.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.950
A lot of people say the book
was more serious blackjacky

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.470
and the movie was more fluffy.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.091
But I think the movie "21"
was kind of perfect for what

00:47:56.091 --> 00:47:56.590
it was.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.930
Every 21-year-old kid watched
it on the way to Vegas.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.860
It was fun.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:00.570
It was exciting.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.027
And I thought Spacey was great.

00:48:02.027 --> 00:48:03.860
And then "The Social
Network" was brilliant.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:08.090
Sorkin and Fincher did an
amazing thing with that story,

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.279
beyond anything I
could have hoped for.

00:48:10.279 --> 00:48:11.445
So I've been very fortunate.

00:48:11.445 --> 00:48:12.880
I didn't have a lot of control.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.860
I was consulting.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.160
I talked a lot on the
set to everyone involved

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.610
and was involved
in that respect,

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.030
but I didn't have any real
control over anything.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.830
But sooner or later,
a bad movie will

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.220
be made from one of my books.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.820
I believe this is going
to be a very good movie.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.112
We've got a lot of
really amazing people

00:48:28.112 --> 00:48:29.820
who are interested in
doing it right now.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.451
So I don't know yet who the
specific director or writer

00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:32.950
will be.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.930
But I know the people in
contention are phenomenal.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.490
So I do think this will
be a very big project.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.450
It's at Warner's now.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.220
And Warner's will
make the decision

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.890
very shortly of who's going
to write and direct it.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.381
And I think it's going
to move very quickly.

00:48:47.381 --> 00:48:48.880
So I do think it's
going to be good.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.240
But it's early.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.620
It's early, and you
never really know.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:53.890
And we'll see what happens.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:54.570
I've been lucky.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:55.240
I know I've been lucky.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.660
I have a lot of friends
in the business who've

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.159
had movies made of their books
that didn't come out so well.

00:48:59.159 --> 00:49:02.430
And "The Social Network" is just
one of those crazy situations,

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:05.430
where suddenly you have this
Oscar-winning movie based

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.370
on Facebook.

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.820
Who knew, right?

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.641
So it's something
that worked out.

00:49:10.641 --> 00:49:11.140
Sure.

00:49:13.724 --> 00:49:16.390
AUDIENCE: I'm a little intrigued
by what you said just recently,

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.990
that you just
write to entertain.

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:21.320
In our book club we read
another story about Russia

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.450
by this guy Bill
Browder, "Red Notice."

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.410
And I was struck by how
he, as a Wall Street

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:31.180
money-making guy went to
Russia, did all this stuff.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.430
And then when his
lawyer gets jailed,

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:37.530
decided completely to change
his life, to write a book,

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.800
to go to Congress and
actually get his act passed.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.160
So how have these stories
kind of changed you?

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.910
BEN MEZRICH: Yeah.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:47.125
AUDIENCE: And I hope you
don't say, no, I just write--

00:49:47.125 --> 00:49:49.583
BEN MEZRICH: Well, his story
is fascinating and incredible.

00:49:49.583 --> 00:49:51.590
And I think he's a
very brave man who

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:53.010
went through something intense.

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:55.760
And his lawyer was
murdered, died in prison.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:00.800
And then he wrote that book
as a way of protest, in a way,

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.520
to really make something happen.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.260
He and I are very different.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.590
This is my 17th book.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:10.075
I write books because
the story compels me,

00:50:10.075 --> 00:50:10.950
and it's fascinating.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.640
It's interesting and intriguing.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.632
I live vicariously
through the characters.

00:50:14.632 --> 00:50:16.840
You know, I wanted to be
the MIT kid taking on Vegas.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.131
I wanted to be Mark Zuckerberg.

00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:21.070
I wanted to be an oligarch
while I was writing the book.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.950
The idea is fascinating to me.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:24.530
So yes and no.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:27.020
Does it change me?

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.114
I have to explain
me a little bit.

00:50:29.114 --> 00:50:30.780
And I know this is a
weird thing to say,

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.610
but I'm a very neurotic,
bizarre person.

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.724
And in my regular life,
I'm like a hermit.

00:50:35.724 --> 00:50:37.140
I don't really
want to go outside.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.306
I live in the mall, and I
don't ever leave the mall.

00:50:39.306 --> 00:50:43.076
I'm like a very pale,
tiny little creature.

00:50:43.076 --> 00:50:45.200
And yet when I write a
book, I become a part of it.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.410
I live this incredibly
amazing life,

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:49.450
where I'm flying
around in private jets.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.550
And I'm in Sean Parker's
limo for the night.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.431
And I'm running around
like whatever character

00:50:54.431 --> 00:50:55.180
I'm writing about.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:59.260
I'm hanging out in
[? yukuza ?] bars in Osaka.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.887
And so I live like
the characters

00:51:01.887 --> 00:51:03.970
for that period in time
when I'm writing the book.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.990
And then the book ends,
and I go back to me.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.860
So no, in a way, the books
don't affect who is me.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.170
But during the process
of writing the book,

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.490
I become whatever it
is I'm writing about.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:15.635
I know it sounds strange.

00:51:15.635 --> 00:51:17.260
I always worshipped
Hunter S. Thompson.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.070
And I wanted to be
Hunter S. Thompson.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:20.742
But I wanted to be
him without the drugs

00:51:20.742 --> 00:51:21.950
and the guns and the suicide.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.300
I always liked the
safe version of him.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.780
And I feel like by
compartmentalizing

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.530
my life, that's what I do.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.410
So I can become him
for a little bit,

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:32.210
and then I go back
to my regular life.

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:34.010
So yeah, in a way, it's
sad because there's

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.890
no personal growth.

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:37.432
But on the other
hand, there's lots

00:51:37.432 --> 00:51:39.890
of moments of personal growth,
and then I quickly pull back

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:40.890
into who I am.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.950
So I guess that's the
answer, which may not

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.260
be what you're looking for.

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.890
But it's kind of
what works for me.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.590
And that's why this book has
been a phenomenal experience.

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:56.200
And then I move on to the next
project, if that makes sense.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.390
But yeah.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:59.434
Sure.

00:51:59.434 --> 00:52:01.264
AUDIENCE: What is
your next story?

00:52:01.264 --> 00:52:02.680
BEN MEZRICH: Yeah,
the next story.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.032
So I'll be on tour for
this for a little while,

00:52:05.032 --> 00:52:05.990
for the next few weeks.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.910
And I have a book I just sold,
and a movie as well, called

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:13.220
"The 37th Parallel," which
will be out next year, which

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.340
is a really wild, true
story about a guy who is

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.720
known as the Mulder of El Paso.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.340
He's a sheriff's deputy in
Colorado, El Paso, Colorado,

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.280
who became obsessed with UFOs.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.590
And it's not about UFOs,
but it's really more

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:31.620
like "Close Encounters."

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.550
This obsession kind
of became his life.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.640
He has a couple kids.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.390
He gets an RV.

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:38.910
And on his days off, he
takes them off to UFO sites,

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:41.340
where people have seen
UFOs, to investigate.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:42.819
They check into a motel.

00:52:42.819 --> 00:52:45.360
And he gets his Glock and goes
out in the middle of the night

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.490
to look for UFOs.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.450
And while doing this,
he kind of uncovered

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:50.120
something really bizarre.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.360
And it ties all the
way into the CIA,

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.320
and all the things
we've heard about,

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.241
and all the bizarre
conspiracy things.

00:52:58.241 --> 00:52:59.990
But it all comes back
to this simple story

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.768
of this guy and his family
and what he uncovered.

00:53:02.768 --> 00:53:04.226
I don't want to
give too much away,

00:53:04.226 --> 00:53:05.450
because this is really early.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:07.514
But that's going to be
the next project for me.

00:53:07.514 --> 00:53:09.180
And I'm working on
that over the summer.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.075
Anybody else?

00:53:14.075 --> 00:53:15.470
AUDIENCE: Is that fiction?

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.720
BEN MEZRICH: True.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.320
True story.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.990
He's the real
"Close Encounters."

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:20.120
I mean it's a story
that will really

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.740
be mind-boggling
to a lot of people,

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.360
because what he
discovered-- it's

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.890
very clearly that something
bizarre is going on.

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:31.714
But what it is is
still undecided.

00:53:31.714 --> 00:53:32.880
But it's really interesting.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.254
I'll give you one
little snippet.

00:53:34.254 --> 00:53:39.030
Whenever the FAA gets a report
of a UFO sighting by a pilot,

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.470
that information is actually
sent to a private company,

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.720
an aeronautics
company that actually

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.360
makes gaskets for the
International Space Station.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.090
This company funds
a UFO response team.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.057
And so that's all true.

00:53:52.057 --> 00:53:53.640
So just think about
that for a second.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.280
That's bizarre.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.140
And yet that is something
that is part of this story.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:03.030
So there is something going
on, but it's not necessarily

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:04.990
UFOs and aliens and
stuff like that.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.340
But there is a lot of
money and a lot of interest

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:08.990
in these bizarre things.

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:11.260
And I think that that's
fascinating, for whatever

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.550
reason it might be.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:13.050
Sure.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.550
Awesome.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:17.485
Well, listen, thank you so much.

00:54:17.485 --> 00:54:18.110
This was great.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:20.030
I'll hang out here and
sign whatever you want.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.510
And if anybody has any
questions up front and personal,

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:23.170
I'm good to go.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:23.740
So thank you so much.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:24.440
I appreciate it.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.173
