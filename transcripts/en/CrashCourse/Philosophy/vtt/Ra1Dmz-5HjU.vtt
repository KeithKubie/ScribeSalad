00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.200
It’s your funeral.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.140
No, um, actually, you’re – you’re dead.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.540
Your loved ones are all sitting around, reminiscing
about your life.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.640
What are they saying?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.040
How will you be remembered?
Did you have a good life?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.020
How would we know?
What constitutes a good life?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.460
The first thing to consider is whether the value of a life is determined by the liver of that life, or by other people.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
What if your last thought before you died
was that you had a perfect life –

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.380
but when your loved ones sit around and discuss it,
they all decide that your life was kinda awful?

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.351
Is that possible? Could they be right about
your life, and you be wrong?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.740
Or, run it the other way: what if everyone else
thinks your life was amazing, but you die miserable,
feeling your life was a total waste?

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.600
Who’s right? And which of these two
options would you prefer?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.360
We have reached the end of Crash Course Philosophy,
and it’s time to examine your own life.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.900
And that means asking yourself some big questions,
like:

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.760
Are you living the way you think you should?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.420
Are you working toward goals you actually
care about?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.140
How important are these things to you?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.300
Right now, the choices you make, the way
you spend your time, these things are
shaping the type of life you’ll lead.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.780
So think about what matter, because, as Socrates
said, the unexamined life is not worth living.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:16.180
[Theme Music]

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.340
The 20th century French philosopher Albert Camus
recounted the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.760
You’ve probably heard of it.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.380
Due to various transgressions he’d committed,
Sisyphus was condemned by the gods to roll
a boulder up a mountain.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.620
And when he reached the top, the boulder would
roll back down and then, Sisyphus would have
to start all over again.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.420
This was the entirety of his existence.
He couldn’t do anything else.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.780
It was just up and down the hill, in a never-ending
cycle.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.600
And you know what Camus said about that?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.910
He said, “we must imagine Sisyphus happy.”

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.360
Really?
“Happy”?!

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.500
Well, Camus was an existentialist, and he
thought that each one of us basically is Sisyphus.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.080
Nothing that any of us does is inherently
important, because stuff just doesn’t have
any inherent meaning.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.410
We’re all just rolling boulders up hills.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.370
But! We can choose to give meaning
to what we do.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.900
After all, we decide what to value, so when
we throw ourselves into a task, it becomes
filled with meaning – meaning we give to it.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.320
Some people find this story of Sisyphus to
be really depressing, because, on the one hand,
it’s kind of saying that nothing you do matters.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.160
But on the other hand, it’s saying that
anything that you do matters, provided you
choose to imbue it with value.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.780
Become a doctor and save lives.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.130
Be a stay at home parent and create a beautiful
childhood for your kids.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.580
Be an amazing best friend.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.380
Find a career that gives you the space in
your life to pursue a hobby you adore.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.710
Volunteer your time promoting a cause you
care about.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.250
Put your energy into amassing a great deal
of wealth.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.700
Become a champion Scrabble player.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.700
Feed squirrels.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.980
It doesn’t matter what you do.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.700
What matters is that it’s meaning-making
for you.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.290
The existentialist message is that your life
is in your hands.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.950
You and only you have the power to make your
life great, and only you can evaluate its greatness.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.400
Contemporary American philosopher
Joanne Ciulla encourages you to think
about the philosophy of your work.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.280
She reminds us that, for most of your life,
you’re going to spend more of your waking
hours at work than anywhere else.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.720
So find a job you love.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.180
If you don’t love it, find a different one,
even if it has less status.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.060
The highest paying job is not always the best
job.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.620
Basically, existentialists tell us that our
lives are in our hands.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.460
So if you’re unhappy, change it.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.380
Now, let’s head over to the Thought Bubble
for our final Flash Philosophy.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:31.000
20th century American philosopher Robert Nozick
asked us to imagine that scientists have developed the
ultimate innovation in virtual reality, known as
the Experience Machine.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.660
This machine allows you to have any experience
you like, for as long as you like

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.380
– an hour, a day, two years, even for the
rest of your life, if you want.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.500
Your body will rest comfortably in a bed, tended
by scientists, and nourished through feeding tubes.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.780
Meanwhile, your mind will experience the best
your imagination has to offer.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.320
You can achieve fame and fortune, cure cancer, climb mountains, date Beyonce – whatever you choose.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.200
And the simulation is so complete that while
you’re in the machine, you’ll be convinced that
these experiences are really happening.

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.819
It will feel as real as the experiences you’re
having right now.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.280
There will be no way to tell it’s a simulation.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.319
Now, Nozick himself had no interest in entering
such a machine.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.320
And he thought most of us wouldn’t either because the experiences it gives us don’t correspond with reality.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.900
Even though you might feel like you’re having
meaningful relationships in the machine,

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.419
in the actual world, those people would be out living their own lives, without you, while you’re lying in a bed having simulated experiences of being with them.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:33.340
And if having an actual impact on the real world is
important to you, well, that’s one thing the Experience
Machine wouldn’t be able to give you.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.320
However, if you’re a hedonist – that is, a person
who believes the good is equal to the pleasurable –

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.300
then simply having whatever experiences
you desire is what you’re after.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.440
So it might be hard to see why you shouldn’t
take the old Experience Machine for a spin.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.700
After all, it could let you experience things
you could never have otherwise.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.120
So what do you say – you want to go in there?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.220
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.870
Now, of course, the ancient Greeks had their
own ideas about what a good life was.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.440
Socrates cautioned the people of Athens to
avoid complacency.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.710
He said you should be critical of your own
life.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.050
Don’t wait for someone to come along and
save you; save yourself.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.520
And if this study of philosophy has taught you
anything, it’s that things are not always as they seem,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.280
and great good can come from looking deeper, challenging the status quo, and being willing to question everything – including how you live.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.880
Remember eudaimonia?

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.060
Back when we talked about Aristotle and virtue
theory, I brought this up.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:35.260
It describes a life of flourishing, a life in which a person is constantly striving for self-improvement, to be more virtuous, more wise, more thoughtful and self-aware.
Better.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.840
This was Aristotle’s idea of a life well
lived.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.760
He wouldn’t agree with Camus that we all
get to make our own meaning, and that there
are infinite ways to live a good life.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.300
And he certainly wouldn’t endorse the use
of the Experience Machine.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.940
Aristotle believed in a human essence,
that there’s a proper way to be a human being,
and that we’ll only flourish by finding that path.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.240
Aristotle said humans are the rational animal, so
living a good human life means seeking to know.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.080
Know your world, know yourself, and strive
to govern yourself through reason.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.260
Work to be the best, most virtuous version
of yourself.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Underachievers, in this view, cannot live
good lives.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.280
Aristotle also believed that some ways of living
are definitely better – or worse – than others.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.020
So if you want to be a good human, what you
prefer has nothing to do with it.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.860
Choosing to be a couch potato, or to indulge one’s
pleasures, he said, is to live a not-good life.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.540
This stands in stark contrast to the picture
we get from Camus, who said that we are all
the determiners of the value of our own lives.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.840
So, a guy from ancient Greece and a guy from 20th
century France are sending you conflicting signals.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.100
What does that tell us?

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:46.460
Well, in our very first episode, we talked about how philosophers are still grappling with many of the same questions that were first posed 2,500 years ago.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.800
And now, 46 episodes later, you can see that
they’re still disagreeing with each other.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.940
But at this point, hopefully you see that all
of the questioning and disagreeing isn’t some
character flaw that all philosophers have.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.640
It, in itself, is a deliberate, chosen way
to live.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.170
No matter what kind of philosophy they prefer.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.880
Some philosophers are theists, and others
are atheists.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.280
They’re dualists and materialists, utilitarians
and Kantians, libertarians and determinists.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.300
Some devote their lives to studying philosophy
and teaching it to others.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.140
But there are also plenty of lay philosophers out there, with different careers, who practice philosophy every day

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.740
– not as a paying profession, but simply as a way of living whatever life they have chosen.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:34.120
You can see the philosopher in authors like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, in the movies of Christopher Nolan and the Wachowskis, in the humor of George Carlin and Margaret Cho, and many other entertainers.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.480
But people who practice philosophy are
also simply people who ask why,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.200
who are willing to challenge something that doesn’t
seem right, to listen to other people’s opinions,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.030
and to be ever-ready to accept new truths,
if the evidence is there.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:55.630
These are parents who talk with their kids about why they have to do things, rather than just issuing edicts, who even let their children have a hand in decision-making, when appropriate.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.610
These are enlightened employers, and mindful
workers.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:08.509
Philosophers actually make good bosses, and they make good employees, in whatever profession they choose, because philosophy teaches you to be creative, flexible, and holistic in your vision and thinking.

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:13.851
To live as a philosopher means to never stop
questioning, and to never stop striving for Truth

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.180
– to continue working to live better, to know more,
and to revise your position based on new evidence.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.280
Philosophers are convinced that this is the
best way to live a good life.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.940
Today we talked about what it means to live
a good life.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.520
We learned about the myth of Sisyphus and
Robert Nozick’s experience machine,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.600
and discussed Aristotle’s eudaimonistic
picture of a good human life,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.820
as well as the existentialists’ view that we
each determine the value of our own lives.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.680
