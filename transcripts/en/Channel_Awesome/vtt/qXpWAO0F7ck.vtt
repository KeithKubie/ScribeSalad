00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.340
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.900
As many of you know,
I'm a big lover of classic nostalgic kids shows.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.920
From Ninja Turtles, to Transformers,
to the Disney Afternoon, to Fox Kids,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.620
we had some pretty awesome shows in our time.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.940
Which is why it really pains me to say this,
but at some point you just have to accept reality.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.600
Kids shows now are much better than they were before.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.400
And that's so weird to say, seeing how much I love the shows I grew up with

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380
and will always hold a place in my heart.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.060
But when you look at shows today,
like Adventure Time, Gravity Falls and Steven Universe,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.900
there's no question that they're pushing the boundaries
of what's normally expected of children's programming.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.360
At least, what WAS expected in the past.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.780
Don't get me wrong,
we still have plenty of mindless stuff,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.560
but these shows are going the extra mile
to not only fascinate kids, but adults as well.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.320
And in a way that was never done in the past.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.040
For so many years we complained
about how there's nothing good on for kids.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.440
Hell,
we complain how there's nothing good on for adults!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.740
Well, now intelligent, funny, thought-provoking
kids shows are suprisingly in competition.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.160
Yeah, they're no longer the rarity,
they're kind of the norm!

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.220
And in a bizarre world
where things seem to make sense,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.900
the more effort in the show,
the bigger the hit it is.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.140
So how and why is this possible?

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.400
Hasn't kids stuff, for the longest time, been...
just that, kids stuff?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.400
Well, not always.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.080
People forget, when the art of animation started,
it was for both kids and adults.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.240
But the more we got used to it, the more it made sense to aim it more towards kids,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.920
because you could be more exaggerated
and expressive.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.460
Which kids can relate to easier.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.620
But even then, some of the adults putting it together
didn't slack off on the effort.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.780
Disney and Warner Bros., two animation giants,
are prime examples of that.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.340
The Warner Bros. cartoons focused more on comedic writing that you would find in most vaudeville acts,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.960
and Disney,
despite it usually being seen as more kid-oriented,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.720
threw in much more artistry and design
that may not get as big a laugh as Goofy or Mickey,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.320
but offered more of an artistic expression
that weren't in most children's entertainment at the time.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.160
Both of these studios challenged
what was seen as mere kids entertainment

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.960
and were both big hits because of it.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.460
So big that, years later, they're still worth big money.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.640
Most homes wouldn't dream of being without at least a few Disney films,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.940
and everybody, young and old,
still knows the Looney Tunes by name.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.220
This led to the conclusion
that kids shows can lead to big moolah,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.320
and show business, still being a business, tried to capitalize on it and make them even more profitable.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.500
The problem was, they focused on the wrong areas.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.300
Shows, for a while, were concentrating less
on good characters and story

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.740
and instead more on what'll sell toys.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.700
So every episode of He-Man, My Little Pony or whatever

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.900
were rushed out with new characters,
vehicles and accessories

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.280
whether they made sense in a coherent story or not.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.600
And we ate it right up.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.900
We didn't care if it made any sense
to what was going on, it was stuff! And we love stuff.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.580
The more stuff we could have related to that show,
the better.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.500
But the problem they eventually figured out was,
stuff fades.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.720
He-Man and My Little Pony ran for a while,
but we eventually grew up and saw it as kids stuff.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.560
Kids stuff was only for kids
and just lame to adults.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.500
But if that were truly the case,
why are so many adults wearing Looney Tunes t-shirts?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.960
Why do so many adults still go to Disneyworld,
even when they don't have any kids?

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.100
Shortly after, producers started to realize

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.120
that the reason Warner Bros. and Disney
were still making money

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.940
is because the writing was good and timeless.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.120
We appreciate them because we can enjoy them
both as kids AND adults!

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.240
Which, from a marketing standpoint,
could double your audience.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.720
So, shows started to take a few more chances.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.180
Animaniacs, Batman, Gargoyles...

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.380
These were shows that adults could watch with their kids and enjoy on an entirely different level

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.500
because they tried harder than most other shows.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.120
They went that extra mile and introduced new jokes, themes and styles that had never been done before.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120
At least, not with this kind of effort.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.080
Don't get me wrong, we went to crap shortly thereafter,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.080
and for a while, we hit a bit of a dead zone.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.080
Roughly around that same time as that Dark Age of Movies.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.280
But the people who watched those other great shows eventually grew up to make their own shows.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.080
And guess what? They were influenced by those shows that put in the extra work.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.600
Thus, they had a new bar to hold themselves to.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.220
Now most kids shows, and movies, for that matter,
are expected to entertain adults just as much as kids.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.860
At least, the ones that are expected to be big hits.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.400
And even today, DVDs, toys and other merchandise
are being bought not just by adults but FOR adults.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.520
Grown people dress up to say thank you for the dedication these creative teams put in their work.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.640
But come on! We grew up with great stuff!
So... why is this stuff apparently better?

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.280
Part of it is while those other shows are great and changed a lot, it was going through a transitional period.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.640
So creators at the time
didn't know what they could get away with.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.800
The dark writing in Batman
was never dabbled with in this much detail,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.680
nor the adult jokes experimented with in Animaniacs.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.540
Because there was more focus on these new elements, which still hold up today,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.540
they were still bound by certain understandable rules.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.260
Batman still had to fight someone.
Animaniacs still had to keep their stories to a half-hour.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.220
Nowadays,
the limits have been stripped more and more.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.040
Comedic series dont have to be comedic
all the way through.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.660
Dramatic series don't have to be dramatic
all the way through.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.540
Stories can continue an entire season if need be.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.180
And even a show based on comedy and action
can have little to none in some episodes

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.960
and still get critical praise for it.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.000
Tiny Toons is great

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.400
but you wouldn't see them dive into heavy, drawn-out turmoil like you would in Adventure Time.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.540
Nor tackle as many potent issues.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.200
The con with those shows in the past was they were still experimenting and didn't know how far they could go.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.140
The pro is that it gave way
to so much more experimentation today.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.880
Arguably more than what was ever done in the past.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.920
There's a few reasons for that.
1: Technology.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.720
These shows usually look beautiful and that's because computers have sped up the time to get them done.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.380
You'll also notice that the designs of many of these characters are much simpler than the ones of the past.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.320
They do this because it gives way to faster animation,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.640
while also allowing more time to focus on color, backgrounds and, of course, the story.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.640
Second: feedback nowadays is instant.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.220
Even though we still have focus groups, the internet is the most blunt and massive feedback there is.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.680
So if something doesn't go over well, they can know right away and make the appropriate changes.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.880
Hell, even use some of the backlash
in the show sometimes.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.060
ACTRESS: We cannot give up hope! (sobs dramatically)
KATARA: Well, that's just silly. I don't sound like that!

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.280
Third is: People finally see the possibilities!

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.700
Shows like Lost and X Files demonstrated
that a continuing mystery can be a big draw,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.040
but if you focused on that
and not as much on the characters,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.260
it could lead to a bad experience if you don't deliver on the ending.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.020
Shows like Gravity Falls and Adventure Time
have similar mysteries, but that's not their draw.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.780
Their draw is their environment, their characters,
and the fact that anything is possible in them.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.720
So even if the last episode
doesn't give a satisfactory answer to the mystery,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.060
people won't feel ripped off
because they were in it for more than that.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.360
Now, that's not to say
Lost and X Files had bad characters,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.340
but when compared to the likeability and even complexity of these characters,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.060
they're just gonna last longer.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.720
But how can something as simple as these characters be more interesting than these characters?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.720
Well, I just said in that sentence:
They're simple.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.020
What are you gonna remember more? The complex inner workings of Matt Damon from Interstellar,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.000
or how badly the coyote wants to catch the Road Runner?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.020
Chances are, we're gonna be quoting "beep beep"
before any line of dialogue in this film.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.140
With kids shows, you have to keep the motivation simple so they can follow it.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.700
But what they go through to achieve it
is where the complexity comes in.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.340
Because these worlds they create
are fueled by imagination rather than logic,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.280
more possibilities are available to them,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.080
with new ways of tackling and explaining issues
that were never present in kids shows before.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.040
Issues you never thought would be in a kids show,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.320
like abandonment, anxiety, sexuality, inferiority, depression, control.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.800
These shows are exploring these issues in everything but name.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.020
You can have characters with goofy identities,
like the Ice King and the Vampire Queen,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.400
but when you put them in a loving situation
where one has almost entirely forgotten the other,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.520
it's one of the most heartbreaking things you can watch,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.160
and can also help people in real life identify
with the pain of Alzheimer's.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.560
Avatar: The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra educate on the themes and ideas of East Asian philosophies.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.100
Yeah! East Asian philosophies,
and all explained in a way that kids can understand!

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.720
There's a power in Steven Universe where two people can combine their mind and bodies together in one,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.700
meaning they have to work together to share both their mental and physical abilities.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.100
There's so many levels of identity being addressed here, it would make Kafka blush.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.940
Even political issues can be brought up!

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.340
Both Adventure Time and Korra
give some pretty interesting conversations

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.580
about how much control a government should have.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.060
They're not just based on cookie cutter villains
trying to take over the world,

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.060
they're legitimately compelling arguments about how much do you sacrifice and how much do you let slide,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.960
both walking the tightrope
of what's ethically acceptable.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:00.400
Gravity Falls not only has hilarious writing,
but it also litters its episodes with puzzles and clues,

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.480
encouraging kids to solve a mystery
that even most adults haven't figured out yet.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.480
Even sexuality plays a role!

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.360
While government was taking its time
to legalize gay marriage,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.220
shows like Steven Universe, Korra,

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.680
and even shows intended for much younger kids,
like Postcards from Buster,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.180
were getting the jump
on what they already knew was right,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.160
introducing kids to gay and lesbian couples
before their minds could be exposed to any prejudice.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.360
None of these would be tackled
in the toy-centric shows of the past.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.200
Even the ones that started the change
wouldn't quite touch a lot of these subjects.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.280
Now, this doesn't mean I love them any less,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.260
but it does mean I should acknowledge
when an art form is clearly advancing.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:42.000
TV for both kids and adults has gotten so good recently,
but it's the TV for kids that's even more important.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.460
We know we can show them anything,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.560
and for years we took that as an excuse to merely profit and distract while sometimes educating.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.940
Now, we're using it not only to legitimately entertain
and educate, but also enlighten them.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.620
They're used to expand their mindset
and show possibilities.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.140
Instead of just introducing information,
they're introducing wisdom,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.640
and through the best way possible: without them even realizing they're learning anything at all.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.220
They're fun, exciting and silly,
but also smart, artistic and insightful.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.680
They play with mood, character and different ways of telling a story than any kids show has done in the past.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.400
A 5 year old can watch Adventure Time and enjoy it,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.800
but then grow up years later
and enjoy it for entirely different reasons.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.400
It's a strange time now where talent and respect for your audience actually equals big bucks.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.700
Maybe people finally got tired
of rewarding the same repeat programming

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.680
or maybe the means of recognizing that frustration
have just gotten more obvious,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.320
but whatever it is,
it's leading to some great work.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.000
New classics, new characters, and new stories
that will not only be remembered years later,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.840
but appreciated on levels that we never appreciated
on kids programming before.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.160
Over the years, pioneers saying kids should be given our best instead of our leftovers

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.980
are being heard and explored through brand new ways,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.100
discovering, educating, creating,
and all while having a great deal of fun.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.380
The generation that watches these shows now
will then grow up

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.020
and bring us even newer and greater possibilities

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.420
because, hey, we gave them a great starting point
to be inspired by.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.900
It's a great world of imagination,
intelligence and ingenuity

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.520
that hopefully isn't slowing down anytime soon.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.960
I'm the Nostalgia Critic,
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.400
