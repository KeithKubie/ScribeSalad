00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.741
As your country's top spy,

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.087
you must infiltrate the headquarters
of the evil syndicate,

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.828
find the secret control panel,

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:16.435
and deactivate their death ray.

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:19.205
But all you have to go on 
is the following information

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.334
picked up by your surveillance team.

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:26.481
The headquarters is a massive pyramid
with a single room at the top level,

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:27.990
two rooms on the next,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.700
and so on.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.141
The control panel is hidden
behind a painting

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.048
on the highest floor that can satisfy
the following conditions:

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:40.772
Each room has exactly three doors
to other rooms on that floor,

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:42.672
except the control panel room,

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:44.589
which connects to only one,

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:45.794
there are no hallways,

00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:47.857
and you can ignore stairs.

00:00:47.857 --> 00:00:50.460
Unfortunately, 
you don't have a floor plan,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.140
and you'll only have enough time
to search a single floor

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.163
before the alarm system reactivates.

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.892
Can you figure out which floor
the control room is on?

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.986
Pause now to solve the riddle yourself.

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:01.824
Answer in: 3

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:02.762
Answer in: 2

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.132
Answer in: 1

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.618
To solve this problem, 
we need to visualize it.

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:10.995
For starters, we know 
that on the correct floor

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:12.154
there's one room,

00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:13.798
let's call it room A,

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:16.017
with one door to the control panel room,

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:17.878
plus one door to room B,

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.236
and one to C.

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:21.785
So there must be at least four rooms,

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.904
which we can represent as circles,

00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:26.578
drawing lines between them
for the doorways.

00:01:26.578 --> 00:01:28.764
But once we connect rooms B and C,

00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:30.763
there are no other connections possible,

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:34.558
so the fourth floor down 
from the top is out.

00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:37.743
We know the control panel has to be
as high up as possible,

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:40.025
so let's make our way down the pyramid.

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:43.223
The fifth highest floor 
doesn't work either.

00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:45.399
We can figure that out by drawing it,

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.821
but to be sure we haven't missed
any possibilities,

00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:49.364
here's another way.

00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:52.616
Every door corresponds to a line
in our graph

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:55.314
that makes two rooms into neighbors.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:59.311
So in the end, there have to be
an even number of neighbors

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.762
no matter how many connections we make.

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:05.818
On the fifth highest floor,
to fulfill our starting conditions,

00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:08.871
we'd need four rooms 
with three neighbors each,

00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.769
plus the control panel room
with one neighbor,

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.081
which makes 13 total neighbors.

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.336
Since that's an odd number,
it's not possible,

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:21.754
and, in fact, this also rules out every
floor that has an odd number of rooms.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:23.975
So let's go one more floor down.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:25.866
When we draw out the rooms,

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:30.637
low and behold, we can find an arrangement
that works like this.

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:33.824
Incidentally, the study 
of such visual models

00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:37.520
that show the connections and
relationships between different objects

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.327
is known as graph theory.

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:44.345
In a basic graph, the circles representing
the objects are known as nodes,

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:47.274
while the connecting lines 
are called edges.

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:50.693
Researchers studying such graphs
ask questions like,

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:53.135
"How far is this node from that one?"

00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:56.737
"How many edges does 
the most popular node have?"

00:02:56.737 --> 00:03:01.571
"Is there a route between these two nodes,
and if so, how long is it?"

00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:05.491
Graphs like this are often used
to map communication networks,

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:08.327
but they can represent almost
any kind of network,

00:03:08.327 --> 00:03:10.322
from transport connections within a city

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:12.353
and social relationships among people,

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:15.116
to chemical interactions between proteins

00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:18.536
or the spread of an epidemic
through different locations.

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:22.361
So, armed with these techniques,
back to the pyramid.

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.709
You avoid the guards and security cameras,

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.773
infiltrate the sixth floor from the top,

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.148
find the hidden panel,

00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:30.148
pull some conspicuous levers,

00:03:30.148 --> 00:03:33.494
and send the death ray crashing
into the ocean.

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:35.274
Now, time to solve the mystery

00:03:35.274 --> 00:03:40.326
of why your surveillance team
always gives you cryptic information.

00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:41.323
Hi everybody.

00:03:41.323 --> 00:03:44.084
