00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
- Good Morning.

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.730
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.563
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:03.450
I'm in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.390
And if you ask someone
from northern Thailand

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.510
what is their comfort food,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.502
it's quite likely that they would say

00:00:08.502 --> 00:00:09.930
(speaking foreign language).

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.030
It's an amazing dish.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.480
I mean anyway, we'll talk
more about that later.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.440
But today is a very special day.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.940
We're driving out to
Three Trees Doi Saket,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.997
which is, it's about an hour away.

00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:22.400
And we're gonna meet my friend, Hanuman.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.520
Hanuman is a great friend
of mine, we go way back,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.050
and he is one of the most knowledgeable,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.590
he is the most knowledgeable person

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.050
about Thai food that I know.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.130
He's a master of Thai food

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.700
and he runs a professional cooking class.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.910
And so today we're gonna have
an honor to go to his place.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.360
We're gonna see the cooking.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.970
We're gonna eat.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.230
It's just gonna be a lot of fun

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.599
and I'm gonna share it all with
you in this video right now.

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:46.182
(upbeat music)

00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:51.350
We're getting close,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.840
but the mountains are
just incredibly beautiful.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.673
The greenery,

00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:56.630
the misty peaks.
- In 600 meters, turn right.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.140
- And just to quickly
tell you about Hanuman.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.740
Hanuman is a great friend of mine.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.810
We've been friends for many years.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.058
And formerly, he was based in Bangkok.

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:05.360
But I had been following
his entire journey.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.980
He bought this plot of land
in Chiang Mai in Doi Saket

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.340
and it was originally like a swampy area

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.590
that he fully developed,
he had the full vision.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.580
And so I had been following
along the progress,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.930
him posting photos, he built a house,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.340
and that is now Three Trees Doi Saket.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.340
So this is exciting for me

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.670
because I'm finally gonna have a chance

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.690
to visit Hanuman here in Chiang Mai

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.700
and we'll have a chance to cook and eat

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.583
and, yeah, it's just gonna be
so much fun and so beautiful.

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.166
(upbeat music)

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.720
Yes, there, check that out.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.700
Oh wait, tree.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.050
Oh yes, Hanuman.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.390
Chili bush, right there.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.059
Can you pick a chili right
out of the window, Ying?

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:52.630
(laughing)

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.930
- Ah, ready to eat?
- OK.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.880
That's my first bite at
Three Trees Doi Saket.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.830
Don't tell Hanuman.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.403
Oh, it's so good.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:06.007
Mmm, it has this beautiful sourness to it.

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:06.840
- I can smell it.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.080
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.258
Wow.

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:10.803
- Whew, yeah, that's spicy.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.182
- [Hanuman] Hello.

00:02:14.182 --> 00:02:15.015
- [Mark] Hello.

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:15.848
Good morning.

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:16.870
- Good morning, sir.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.703
How are you?
- Good to see you.

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:18.890
Very good to see you.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.920
Good, how are you?
- Was it a good, good drive?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.720
- [Mark] Beautiful.
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.653
Beautiful drive.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.170
Everyone say hello to Hanuman.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.615
- Hello (speaking foreign language).

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:28.448
Hanuman.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.340
- [Mark] And we've just arrived
to Three Trees Doi Saket.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.600
It's an honor to be here.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.230
On the way driving here,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.580
I was mentioning how you had told me

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.970
the whole story of this place

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.230
and how you had--
- Yeah, it was a long--

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.970
- Transformed the entire property

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.300
and so it's so great to
actually be here in person now.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.670
- Yeah, you're welcome, come.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.222
- Thank you very much.

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:46.480
This is the.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.913
Oh man, this is house is beautiful.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.853
- [Hanuman] So the house
is basically stretched-out.

00:02:51.853 --> 00:02:53.410
- Wow.
- So this is the kitchen.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.570
This is the dining room.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.130
Here we have an office
and a small living room.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.555
The living quarters over there.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.842
- [Mark] OK.

00:03:01.842 --> 00:03:02.675
So those are the--
- Those are

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:03.508
the bedrooms.
- Those are your rooms.

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:04.341
OK.

00:03:04.341 --> 00:03:06.590
- [Hanuman] So we have a
naturally underground stream.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.423
- Hmm.

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:09.040
So we're just getting first the tour,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.720
oh, be careful, Micah.
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.354
Be careful, man.
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:14.354 --> 00:03:15.910
- Down, down.
- Come on, man.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.210
- Down, down.
- We're just getting

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.770
a quick tour walking around
the house and the compound,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.620
but it's laid out so incredibly beautiful.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.720
Thai style, yet with a modern touch.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.553
- [Hanuman] Yeah.

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:29.160
- There's the kitchen and
there's the dining room

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.560
at the front here and then the next room

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.150
while walking on this
beautiful wooden deck.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.380
These are the rooms here.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.290
- [Hanuman] So this is.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.830
This is our on-site
sewer treatment system.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.378
- [Mark] Ah.

00:03:43.378 --> 00:03:45.961
(upbeat music)

00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:52.310
- [Hanuman] This is
where the magic happens.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.143
- [Mark] Wow.

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:56.140
Fully like a commercial kitchen.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.390
Even better.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.390
- Yeah, that's a commercial kitchen, but

00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:05.100
we have put the, all
the dry spices are here,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.030
fresh ingredients here.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.220
That's where the magic happens

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.970
and then we're ready to do
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:11.803
- Today.

00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:12.636
- Today, yeah.

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:13.469
- Awesome.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.415
But I know it's gonna
be like the next level

00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:17.057
(speaking foreign language)
- I hope so.

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:18.400
I hope so.
- Yeah, for sure.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400
Guaranteed.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.200
Anything that I've ever eaten with Hanuman

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.970
or Hanuman has cooked, it blows your mind,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.912
just the next level, the care,

00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:33.912
the research and the
zero shortcuts process

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.660
that he takes in all of his cooking.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.720
The dish that we're gonna be focusing on,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.880
that we're gonna be making today,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.290
is called (speaking
foreign language) and--

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.450
- And (speaking foreign
language) means Shan people

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.327
or Shan people style,
so it basically means

00:04:50.327 --> 00:04:54.420
(speaking foreign language)
or fresh rice noodles

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.031
with Shan style broth.

00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:58.369
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:59.202
This is the cotton, we haven't used it.

00:04:59.202 --> 00:05:01.959
What I do, I used it now, I
use (speaking foreign language)

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:05.780
and (speaking foreign
language) is from soy beans.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.887
So I use (speaking foreign language).

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.313
And I use (speaking foreign language)

00:05:10.313 --> 00:05:11.146
and I use soy sauce.

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:12.940
So you get all these levels of five

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.040
umamis going together.

00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:17.770
- Yeah, those are all
like fermented ingredients

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.610
that just build in complexion with age.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.443
And flavor.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:26.430
- Just do red curries,
good color, nice aroma.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.970
So what we're going to
do, we're going to do

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.825
a red curry paste, and
then we use an under paste.

00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:32.680
So with the under paste,
we use fresh chili,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.425
just to improve the color.

00:05:34.425 --> 00:05:39.425
(speaking foreign language)
for northern tribes,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.710
you either use mature
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.017
or in season you use
(speaking foreign language).

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.550
- You're making this purely on experience.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.910
You know all the amounts.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.079
You even, that comment that he made

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.540
about half the amount of
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.305
as chilis.
- You don't measure.

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.031
- A quarter.
- You don't measure.

00:05:58.031 --> 00:05:58.864
- You don't measure.
- You don't measure.

00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:04.193
In cooking, ratios are more
important than quantities.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.043
- OK.

00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:10.350
- So when you cook, you
have to think ratios,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.560
rather than absolute quantities.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.690
So if somebody say to you, OK,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.320
take this, start to do the
(speaking foreign language),

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.883
you know how it throws
the domino by ratios.

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:22.489
(upbeat music)

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.847
And that's (speaking foreign language).

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.931
- So that is fermented fish.
- That's fermented fish.

00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:34.347
And what we do, we take
the fermented fish,

00:06:34.347 --> 00:06:38.060
and we put it on a bed of lemongrass

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.977
and (speaking foreign language).

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.150
Now what I do, I do many layers.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.150
So then I can basically
put it on low heat.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.720
And then I generate smoke.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.100
- When that's finished
smoking, it's just gonna be

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.770
like flavor upon flavor upon flavor.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.290
Fermented soybeans?
- Yeah.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.263
Fermented soybeans.
- Made into a little.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.400
- So again, when you
have smoke, it goes good

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.600
with the umami.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.333
Let's do it third smoke.

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.140
So we do it.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.973
We take the chilis,

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:12.870
and we need to rate rate it.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:30.616
We would.

00:07:31.476 --> 00:07:32.660
This will be loud.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.493
- That's OK.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.540
As soon as, it just started to blacken

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.979
just like a second, he tossed in water

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:40.600
because we don't want
to blacken the chili,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.290
we don't want the black chilis,

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.110
we want to keep the chilis red,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.933
but that's just gonna
increase the smoky flavor.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.720
- If we are doing smoke,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.350
so that's burned in one day.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.300
- [Mark] OK, we'll have smoke and fire?

00:08:05.802 --> 00:08:08.052
(laughing)

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.773
Coming right out of the pan.

00:08:14.773 --> 00:08:16.930
Those have just like blistered up.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.060
Oh, they're so fragrant.
- So I put tomatoes,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.850
pink tomatoes, and charred tomatoes,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.210
so you get three layers,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.866
and you have one smoke, two smoke.

00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:29.105
Three smoke, four smoke.

00:08:29.105 --> 00:08:31.560
It's all about layering.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.200
Counting your elements.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.123
- Next level.
- Cut the nail.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.750
- In the meantime, he's
preparing some of the ingredients

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.983
for the broth, including
chicken teeth and pork bones.

00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:50.360
- [Hanuman] Now, the same
thing, you don't have to

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.230
deseed it first, you
basically just take it

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.363
and cut it into little chunks.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.240
How is your pounding skills?

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.302
- Could be better.

00:09:01.302 --> 00:09:02.509
For the gray paste.

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:03.509
- 54.
- 54 minutes?

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.053
54 minutes later, we
will have a smooth paste

00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:09.995
with all of these ingredients

00:09:09.995 --> 00:09:11.613
that we've been preparing.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.923
All mingled together.

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:25.972
(upbeat music)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.390
Oh, yes, (speaking foreign language).

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:33.590
- [Hanuman] So I put the
(speaking foreign language),

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.364
so it will be dry.

00:09:36.364 --> 00:09:38.414
So it will be dry when I put the shallot.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.280
- In goes that fermented soy bean wafer,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.348
and then also the shallots next.

00:09:45.348 --> 00:09:49.015
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:52.860
And that is the little
pile of fermented fish

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.860
that he smoked out in
the banana leaf packet.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.150
What's so incredible to
hang out with Hanuman

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.110
as he cooks is the history,

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.330
the culture, and just the wisdom

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.810
that he brings with
Thai food and knowledge.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.403
- In order to get signals,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.980
you should have taste MSG.

00:10:30.844 --> 00:10:33.719
Taste it.
- I've never done this before.

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:34.552
- Taste it.
- I usually order

00:10:34.552 --> 00:10:36.350
without MSG.
- There is nothing

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.850
wrong with that, that's umami.

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:40.160
- Pure MSG.
- Oh yeah,

00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:42.128
tastes like seaweed.

00:10:42.968 --> 00:10:45.280
- So you didn't get a big sensation,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.270
it's something in your mouth, right?

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.800
Now let's unlock it.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.903
Take a cucumber and now taste it.

00:10:53.046 --> 00:10:54.050
- Wow.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.530
Yeah, it's like seaweedy.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.060
Now with a cucumber?
- Yeah, take with

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.450
a cucumber.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.283
You can do it.

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.093
- Mm, mmhmm.

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:04.958
Yep, yeah.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.453
It does change the like
composition of it almost.

00:11:11.636 --> 00:11:12.613
- The only free umami

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.600
flavor in nature is tomato.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.837
Tomato has both
nucleotides and glutamates.

00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:24.370
In one.
- That's cool.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.370
- We put much attention to
layering our umami in the

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:33.239
(speaking foreign language).

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.000
So this is also an umami factor.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.740
So you use big, you
use green, you use mid,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.260
you use red, you use all the colors,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.230
so you get layering of the same element.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.240
And then you use then smoked, as well.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:55.142
(speaking foreign language)
is the cotton tree.

00:11:55.142 --> 00:11:56.720
I like to take a batch and deep fry it,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.480
be crispy, so we can eat it.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.500
Deep fried chilis and then we
have to do chili oil, as well.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.300
- Hanuman is gonna do some of

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.553
his own fried crispy ingredients.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.557
- This is a homemade
(speaking foreign language),

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:14.567
25 ingredients.

00:12:20.944 --> 00:12:23.527
(upbeat music)

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.430
When I cook, I think about

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.460
the three dimensional flavor profile.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.630
Where I have smoked fat umami

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.100
and then wrap it with
rice, spice it, slice it

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.310
with sours and swits and
elevate it with herbs.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.498
Some people thinks that, you know,

00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:05.470
once you do a curry
paste, you finish cooking.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.900
No, you just started.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.330
You created a new ingredient.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.420
So I create an under paste,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.078
and in the under paste, I
put things I want to show

00:13:14.078 --> 00:13:16.310
on my top paste.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.640
So in my top paste, I use fresh tomatoes.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.990
So I don't have any fresh
ingredients in my paste.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.540
I have dried chilis,

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.680
I have all the umami.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.590
So I put layers of freshness under it

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.660
so I get another layer,
if you think about it

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.670
in three dimensions.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.313
- So Hanuman is starting
on the under paste next.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.850
- So, see, it's not much.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.863
You use pork fat.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.450
- All the components are prepared.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.810
We're ready to start assembling curry,

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.287
it's a curry, yeah?

00:13:56.287 --> 00:13:58.120
Curry paste, it's a curry.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.860
- Anything that has a
paste in Thai is a gang.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.693
- Gang.

00:14:08.802 --> 00:14:11.219
(chattering)

00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:14.916
Curry paste in there.

00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:15.917
- Yeah, pork fat.
- Pork fat.

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:16.750
- Then curry paste.
- The under paste.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.460
Oh, the under paste first.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.433
Then the regular paste, and
then the minced pork went in.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.390
Then he added in the stock
with the chicken feet

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.460
and the pork bones and then dropped in

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.083
all of the tomatoes,

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.690
the variety of tomatoes.
- We have saltiness from

00:14:59.749 --> 00:15:03.280
(speaking foreign language).

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.683
And some salt, right?

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.183
- So this is a first
evaluation before adding.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.524
- He did the two step.

00:15:14.524 --> 00:15:16.165
(laughing)

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.910
When you are cooking Thai
food, it's essential,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.823
it's mandatory that you taste.

00:15:22.927 --> 00:15:25.177
(laughing)

00:15:30.853 --> 00:15:32.000
Yes.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.300
The (speaking foreign language)

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.903
you can taste in there nicely.

00:15:40.609 --> 00:15:43.026
(chattering)

00:15:51.623 --> 00:15:52.640
This is chicken?
- This is chicken.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.940
- And then he just tossed
in the chicken blood jelly.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.064
Curry is ready, it's simmered
for maybe 20 minutes or so?

00:16:00.064 --> 00:16:01.062
- 15, 20 minutes.

00:16:01.062 --> 00:16:02.061
- Yeah, wasn't that long.

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:04.300
And the dish is ready, the meal is cooked.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.370
The paste was pounded,
and it was more about

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.640
assembling it all and then
just boiling it together

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.088
for a little bit.

00:16:11.088 --> 00:16:13.370
But it's to be eaten with
(speaking foreign language),

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.370
which are the soft,
they're fresh rice noodles.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.400
Beautiful, yes.

00:16:51.131 --> 00:16:52.030
- Hanuman, thank you, thank you.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.380
- Fascinating.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.900
And that is mission complete.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.590
Even the assembling was beautiful.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.690
Combining those parts.

00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:00.964
I mean, you've got the curry.

00:17:00.964 --> 00:17:03.240
Then he added on those
roasted firework tomatoes.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.350
Fried chilis and cotton flower.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.053
Some chili oil.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.340
Some fried garlic, some shallots,

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.530
some pickled mustard greens,

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.984
a Hawaiian wedge, it's
all there, it's all ready.

00:17:15.984 --> 00:17:17.263
We're ready to eat.

00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:20.904
(upbeat music)

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:28.952
(chattering)

00:17:28.952 --> 00:17:30.430
Thank you, Hanuman, thank you so much.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.980
- My pleasure.
- It's so beautiful.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.610
It's so colorful.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.170
You've got all the, I mean, the curry,

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.597
then the toppings, the
multiple even layers

00:17:40.597 --> 00:17:43.730
and levels of toppings that go into this,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.744
and not only the food, but
also we're just staring

00:17:45.744 --> 00:17:48.123
into the greenery of the mountains.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.970
It's beautiful, it's beautiful.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.900
So we are all sitting down to eat.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.768
I'm gonna just like taste a little bit of,

00:17:55.768 --> 00:17:57.730
thank you.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.618
(laughing)

00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:01.117
Yes, a little more chili oil on there.

00:18:01.117 --> 00:18:02.990
And you can see, the difference between

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.660
the tomatoes that were
cooked, within the curry,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.210
they've sort of like slightly dissolved

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.890
and are sort of like mixed into the stew

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.840
and made it tomatoey,
but then you've also got

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.668
the umami fireworks tomatoes that were

00:18:17.668 --> 00:18:20.900
literally lit on fire for a few seconds,

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.960
or for many seconds, and you can kind of

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.200
stir it around, look at
that, look at the chunky

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.250
beautifulness of that.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.000
So thick compared to any other version

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.593
of (speaking foreign language) I've had.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.023
Whoa.

00:18:38.728 --> 00:18:40.253
(laughing)

00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:41.560
The tomatoes.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.440
When we were sampling it,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.148
like you could taste the paste,

00:18:45.148 --> 00:18:47.510
you could taste the
(speaking foreign language).

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.950
But then the tomatoes sort of,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.145
now as they dissolve more,

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:55.700
you can see how they've mingled into that.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.045
Sort of toned down the
(speaking foreign language),

00:18:58.045 --> 00:18:59.550
but also--
- They're the same group.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.186
They are umami.

00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:03.507
So the (speaking foreign language),

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.550
the soy sauce, they're all umami,

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.380
and the tomato's also an umami,

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.880
so she joins the group very easily.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.588
And then we have the
pork, the chicken feet,

00:19:17.588 --> 00:19:20.793
the blood, they're all umamis, right?

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:23.690
- [Mark] The umami fireworks tomato.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.390
Is that too much in one bite?
- No, I don't think so.

00:19:29.708 --> 00:19:30.541
- And maybe a piece of blood, then.

00:19:31.677 --> 00:19:33.080
(laughing)

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.530
Yeah, that is a fully loaded bite.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.230
This is the (speaking foreign
language) in there, too.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.650
Mm, mm, oh.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.160
It hits you like, after
you sink your teeth

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.040
into the tomato.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.676
We have smoky, but like
deep fried at the same time,

00:19:55.676 --> 00:20:00.676
tomato skin, and then it
just bursts into tartness

00:20:00.986 --> 00:20:02.593
and juiciness.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.930
Did I get some tomato
splotches on my chin?

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.453
That's successful.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.800
So you can find (speaking
foreign language)

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.280
just throughout markets and
little local restaurants

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.200
throughout northern Thailand,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.092
and it's a very favorite dish,

00:20:29.092 --> 00:20:31.400
but most of the versions that I've had

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.530
are quite watery and they're more,

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.330
yeah, they're just much more watery.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:43.510
Not nearly as many tomatoes
or spices or ingredients

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.863
that go into theirs,

00:20:45.863 --> 00:20:47.750
but this one is not watery at all,

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.560
even though it's water based,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.750
it's thick and rich
and you taste vibrantly

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.100
the tomatoes, as well as all those

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.270
other fermented ingredients.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.060
It's sensational.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:20:59.910
Yes.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.598
Thank you so much, Hanuman.

00:21:01.598 --> 00:21:03.265
Awesome.
- Thank you.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.800
For inviting us to share
such an amazing dish.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.704
- My pleasure.
- In your dream.

00:21:09.704 --> 00:21:11.593
This is beautiful.
- Yeah.

00:21:11.593 --> 00:21:13.383
And also.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.030
The dish, the cooking, the
food, which is delicious,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.210
but the knowledge and
the stories behind it.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.170
That also makes a huge difference.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.078
- Well, cooking is about humans.

00:21:26.078 --> 00:21:30.050
Is about making new friends.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.550
It's about politics, it's about war,

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.050
it's about trade, it's about immigrations,

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.340
it's about natural resources,
it's about our health.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.800
There are so many layers
that you can scrap through

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.600
when you're eating a dish.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.980
So, we're at least fortunate
to have another layer,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.630
which is friendship,
that we can put on top of

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.000
all of that.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.320
So welcome, it was really
my pleasure having you.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.363
- Thank you so much.

00:22:00.596 --> 00:22:03.025
(speaking foreign language)

00:22:03.025 --> 00:22:06.573
- [Hanuman] I like it very much.

00:22:17.598 --> 00:22:22.200
- Oh, you taste the dark
soy sauce in there, too.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.010
When you get that much.
- That's why you get

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.220
the nice glaze, otherwise
you wouldn't get the color.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.210
Because the black soy sauce has molasses.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.860
That's what makes it black.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.540
So you put it into the whole oil,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.193
you get some caramelization.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.540
- What a day, what a cool day, man.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.953
Thank you.

00:22:42.953 --> 00:22:44.118
- I'm quite the passive host.

00:22:44.118 --> 00:22:47.139
You know, it's a self service water.

00:22:47.139 --> 00:22:49.389
(laughing)

00:22:52.055 --> 00:22:52.888
- No.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.830
No, Hanuman has been taking care of us

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.243
is what he means to say.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.480
Like fully.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.780
- And even, we're the travelers.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.797
He's telling us stories and feeding us.

00:23:05.797 --> 00:23:09.630
- And with coffee at the end to finish off

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.660
just an experience of a meal.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.210
Oh, cheers.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:16.043
Cheers.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.520
Cheers.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.353
- Cheers.

00:23:20.464 --> 00:23:23.256
(laughing)

00:23:23.256 --> 00:23:25.559
(speaking foreign language)

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.960
- Mm.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.564
Oh I can smell the
(speaking foreign language).

00:23:28.564 --> 00:23:30.840
Turkish coffee with the view.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.550
Yeah, things cannot get better than this.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.680
And now the light is changing

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.413
so it's really like bright green.

00:23:44.713 --> 00:23:47.290
I'm still processing
the entire experience,

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.290
but I mean, it was more than just a lunch

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:55.290
and a meal, it was an entire
educational experience

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.560
and the food was unbelievably good,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.150
but the location, the
atmosphere, the friendship.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:05.720
He's so passionate and so
knowledgeable about Thai food

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.160
and even Thai history,
which ties in so much

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.050
into Thai cuisine.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.060
And you learn, I mean, just
in spending a few hours

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.600
with him this afternoon
today, I learned so much

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.970
about (speaking foreign
language) and then so much

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.760
about Thai history and the process.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.770
And even on top of that,
also about ingredients

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.600
and the layers of flavor and taste.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.930
It's such a sensory, such
a well rounded experience,

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.590
all wrapped up into Three Trees Doi Saket

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.370
in a beautiful location.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.940
And Hanuman is offering professional

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.110
cooking courses, total immersion programs.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.400
But even single day classes.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.520
So you can check out what he has to offer.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.280
I'll have all his links in
the description box below.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.900
But he is so knowledgeable.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.710
He's a walking encyclopedia
of Thai cuisine and history.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.370
And again, go follow Hanuman

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.900
and I'll have all the information

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.210
in the description box below.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.950
