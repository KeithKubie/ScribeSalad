00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:06.738
So, when we first started hiring people,

00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:08.120
I had the idea

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.126
that really the only important thing

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:14.576
was that I get the smartest person

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:16.805
to hire for the job,

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:21.369
and that actually turned out to be wrong

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.539
because in practice

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.110
it matters so much

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.238
whether the person that you hire

00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:29.345
fits in well with the team,

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:32.509
knows how to work with other people.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.433
You can get people who are really brilliant

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:41.023
but still manage to pull down the performance

00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:43.680
of everyone else around them,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.960
and so I gradually started looking

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.193
more and more toward social skills and initiative

00:00:52.193 --> 00:00:54.599
and these kinds of soft skills

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:57.302
that didn't seem as important in the beginning

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:59.307
but actually turn out to make a huge difference

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:01.930
in how people perform on the job.
