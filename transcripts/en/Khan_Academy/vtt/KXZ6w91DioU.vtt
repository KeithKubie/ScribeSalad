00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.440
Let's start off with segment AB.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.920
So that's point A. This is
point B right over here.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.820
And let's set up a perpendicular
bisector of this segment.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.330
So it will be both perpendicular
and it will split the segment

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.410
in two.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.700
So thus we could
call that line l.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.840
That's going to be a
perpendicular bisector,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.610
so it's going to intersect
at a 90-degree angle,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.750
and it bisects it.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.020
This length and this
length are equal,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.650
and let's call this
point right over here

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.260
M, maybe M for midpoint.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.220
What I want to prove
first in this video

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.200
is that if we pick an arbitrary
point on this line that

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.220
is a perpendicular bisector of
AB, then that arbitrary point

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.860
will be an equal distant
from A, or that distance

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.450
from that point to
A will be the same

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.160
as that distance
from that point to B.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.550
So let me pick an arbitrary
point on this perpendicular

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.690
bisector.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.100
So let's call that
arbitrary point C.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.360
And so you can imagine we
like to draw a triangle,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.750
so let's draw a triangle where
we draw a line from C to A

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.140
and then another
one from C to B.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.550
And essentially, if we can
prove that CA is equal to CB,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.220
then we've proven
what we want to prove,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.166
that C is an equal distance
from A as it is from B. Well,

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.290
there's a couple of
interesting things we see here.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.180
We know that AM is
equal to MB, and we also

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.010
know that CM is equal to itself.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.410
Obviously, any segment is
going to be equal to itself.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.560
And we know if this
is a right angle,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.780
this is also a right angle.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.560
This line is a perpendicular
bisector of AB.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.400
And so we have two
right triangles.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.430
And actually, we don't
even have to worry about

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.650
that they're right triangles.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.060
If you look at triangle
AMC, you have this side

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.020
is congruent to the
corresponding side on triangle

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420
BMC.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.120
Then you have an angle in
between that corresponds

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.790
to this angle over here, angle
AMC corresponds to angle BMC,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.030
and they're both 90 degrees,
so they're congruent.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.170
And then you have the side
MC that's on both triangles,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.720
and those are congruent.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.100
So we can just use SAS,
side-angle-side congruency.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:15.910
So we can write
that triangle AMC

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.755
is congruent to triangle BMC
by side-angle-side congruency.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.840
And so if they are
congruent, then

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.210
all of their corresponding
sides are congruent

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.840
and AC corresponds to BC.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.970
So these two things
must be congruent.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.340
This length must be the same as
this length right over there,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.390
and so we've proven
what we want to prove.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.350
This arbitrary point C that
sits on the perpendicular

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.510
bisector of AB is equidistant
from both A and B.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.660
And I could have known that if
I drew my C over here or here,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.290
I would have made the exact
same argument, so any C that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.674
sits on this line.

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:00.590
So that's fair enough.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.590
So let me just write it.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.092
So this means that
AC is equal to BC.

00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:08.550
Now, let's go the
other way around.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.580
Let's say that we
find some point that

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.320
is equidistant
from A and B. Let's

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.210
prove that it has to sit on
the perpendicular bisector.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.640
So let's do this again.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.394
So I'll draw it like this.

00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:27.410
So this is my A. This is my B,
and let's throw out some point.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.140
We'll call it C again.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.900
So let's say that
C right over here,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.450
and maybe I'll draw
a C right down here.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.870
So this is C, and we're going
to start with the assumption

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.890
that C is equidistant
from A and B.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.399
So CA is going to
be equal to CB.

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.190
This is what we're
going to start off with.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.290
This is going to
be our assumption,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.680
and what we want
to prove is that C

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:59.550
sits on the perpendicular
bisector of AB.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.110
So we've drawn a triangle here,
and we've done this before.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.680
We can always drop an
altitude from this side

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.540
of the triangle right over here.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.930
So we can set up a
line right over here.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.180
Let me draw it like this.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.887
So let's just drop an
altitude right over here.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.470
Although we're really
not dropping it.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.600
We're kind of lifting an
altitude in this case.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.025
But if you rotated
this around so

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:28.290
that the triangle looked like
this, so this was B, this is A,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.460
and that C was up
here, you would really

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.380
be dropping this altitude.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.260
And so you can
construct this line

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.710
so it is at a right
angle with AB,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.700
and let me call this the point
at which it intersects M. So

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.140
to prove that C lies on
the perpendicular bisector,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.980
we really have to
show that CM is

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.480
a segment on the
perpendicular bisector,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.450
and the way we've
constructed it,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.970
it is already perpendicular.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.230
We really just have to
show that it bisects AB.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.762
So what we have right over
here, we have two right angles.

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:02.720
If this is a right angle
here, this one clearly

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.755
has to be the way
we constructed it.

00:05:04.755 --> 00:05:06.310
It's at a right angle.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:16.030
And then we know that the CM
is going to be equal to itself.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.110
And so this is a right angle.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.190
We have a leg, and
we have a hypotenuse.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.850
We know by the RSH postulate,
we have a right angle.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.044
We have one
corresponding leg that's

00:05:30.044 --> 00:05:31.710
congruent to the other
corresponding leg

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.960
on the other triangle.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.700
We have a hypotenuse
that's congruent

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.940
to the other hypotenuse,
so that means

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.590
that our two triangles
are congruent.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:48.350
So triangle ACM is congruent
to triangle BCM by the RSH

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.260
postulate.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.690
Well, if they're congruent,
then their corresponding sides

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.773
are going to be congruent.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.660
So that tells us that AM must
be equal to BM because they're

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.829
their corresponding sides.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.370
So this side right
over here is going

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.910
to be congruent to that side.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.620
So this really is bisecting AB.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.525
So this line MC really is on
the perpendicular bisector.

00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:19.330
And the whole reason why
we're doing this is now we

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.810
can do some interesting things
with perpendicular bisectors

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.090
and points that are
equidistant from points

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.640
and do them with triangles.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.460
So just to review, we
found, hey if any point

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.810
sits on a perpendicular
bisector of a segment,

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.852
it's equidistant from the
endpoints of a segment,

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:34.934
and we went the other way.

00:06:34.934 --> 00:06:37.680
If any point is equidistant
from the endpoints of a segment,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.430
it sits on the perpendicular
bisector of that segment.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.975
So let's apply those
ideas to a triangle now.

00:06:44.975 --> 00:06:48.040
So let me draw myself
an arbitrary triangle.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.380
I'll try to draw
it fairly large.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.260
So let's say that's a
triangle of some kind.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.035
Let me give ourselves some
labels to this triangle.

00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:59.590
That's point A,
point B, and point C.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.330
You could call
this triangle ABC.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.510
Now, let me just construct
the perpendicular bisector

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.010
of segment AB.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.520
So it's going to bisect it.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.030
So this distance is going to
be equal to this distance,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.020
and it's going to
be perpendicular.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.280
So it looks something like that.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.416
And it will be perpendicular.

00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:21.290
Actually, let me draw
this a little different

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.020
because of the way I've
drawn this triangle,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.534
it's making us get close
to a special case, which

00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:28.450
we will actually talk
about in the next video.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.575
Let me draw this triangle
a little bit differently.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.820
OK.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.925
This one might be a
little bit better.

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:44.050
And we'll see what special
case I was referring to.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.460
So this is going
to be A. This is

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.606
going to be B. This
is going to be C.

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:50.980
Now, let me take
this point right

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.200
over here, which is
the midpoint of A and B

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.950
and draw the
perpendicular bisector.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.915
So the perpendicular bisector
might look something like that.

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:04.290
And I don't want it to make
it necessarily intersect in C

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.820
because that's not necessarily
going to be the case.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.300
But this is going to
be a 90-degree angle,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.500
and this length is
equal to that length.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.800
And let me do the same thing
for segment AC right over here.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.480
Let me take its midpoint, which
if I just roughly draw it,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.540
it looks like it's
right over there.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.180
And then let me draw its
perpendicular bisector,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.085
so it would look
something like this.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.570
So this length right over
here is equal to that length,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.080
and we see that they
intersect at some point.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.360
Just for fun, let's
call that point O.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.039
And now there's some interesting
properties of point O.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.370
We know that since O sits on
AB's perpendicular bisector,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.590
we know that the
distance from O to B

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.595
is going to be the same
as the distance from O

00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:54.880
to A. That's what we proved
in this first little proof

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.410
over here.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.270
So we know that OA is
going to be equal to OB.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.580
Well, that's kind of neat.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.770
But we also know that
because of the intersection

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.590
of this green
perpendicular bisector

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.619
and this yellow
perpendicular bisector,

00:09:08.619 --> 00:09:10.660
we also know because it
sits on the perpendicular

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.310
bisector of AC that
it's equidistant from A

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:21.240
as it is to C. So we know
that OA is equal to OC.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.710
Now, this is interesting.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.915
OA is equal to OB.

00:09:23.915 --> 00:09:27.070
OA is also equal
to OC, so OC and OB

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.780
have to be the
same thing as well.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.960
So we also know that
OC must be equal to OB.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.270
OC must be equal to OB.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:43.550
Well, if a point is equidistant
from two other points that

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.470
sit on either end of a
segment, then that point

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.670
must sit on the perpendicular
bisector of that segment.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.480
That's that second proof
that we did right over here.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.860
So it must sit on the
perpendicular bisector of BC.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.830
So if I draw the perpendicular
bisector right over there,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:09.670
then this definitely lies on
BC's perpendicular bisector.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.660
And what's neat about
this simple little proof

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.800
that we've set up
in this video is

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.070
we've shown that there's a
unique point in this triangle

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.870
that is equidistant from all
of the vertices of the triangle

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.001
and it sits on the perpendicular
bisectors of the three sides.

00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:26.500
Or another way to
think of it, we've

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.680
shown that the perpendicular
bisectors, or the three sides,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.680
intersect at a
unique point that is

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.270
equidistant from the vertices.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.240
And this unique point on a
triangle has a special name.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.960
We call O a circumcenter.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.770
And because O is
equidistant to the vertices,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.224
so this distance-- let
me do this in a color

00:10:53.224 --> 00:10:54.140
I haven't used before.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.240
This distance right over here
is equal to that distance right

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.400
over there is equal to
that distance over there.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.510
If we construct a circle
that has a center at O

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.770
and whose radius is
this orange distance,

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.310
whose radius is any of
these distances over here,

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.250
we'll have a circle
that goes through all

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:19.620
of the vertices of our
triangle centered at O.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.380
So our circle would
look something

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.121
like this, my best
attempt to draw it.

00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:26.120
And so what we've constructed
right here is one,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.460
we've shown that we can
construct something like this,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.434
but we call this
thing a circumcircle,

00:11:33.434 --> 00:11:35.850
and this distance right here,
we call it the circumradius.

00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:41.010
And once again, we know
we can construct it

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.640
because there's a point here,
and it is centered at O.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.660
Now this circle, because
it goes through all

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.390
of the vertices of
our triangle, we

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:58.550
say that it is circumscribed
about the triangle.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:03.300
So we can say right over
here that the circumcircle O,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:12.560
so circle O right over
here is circumscribed

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.740
about triangle ABC, which
just means that all three

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:24.330
vertices lie on this circle
and that every point is

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.295
the circumradius away
from this circumcenter.
