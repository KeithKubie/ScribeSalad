00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.720
To start let's talk about how you would

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.120
network two machines, each with a single interface,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.858
to each other. So Host 1 and Host 2 would be connected by two Ethernet adapters

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:15.734
or network interfaces and each of these would

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.072
have a LAN or physical or MAC address.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.470
Now a host that wants to sent a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.980
datagram to another host can simply send that datagram

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.540
via its Ethernet adapter with a destination MAC

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.380
address of the other host that it wants to

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.420
receive the frame. Frames can also be sent to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.790
a broadcast destination MAC address which would mean that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.760
the datagram would be sent to every host

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.690
that it was connected to on the local area

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.080
network. Now, of course, typically what happens is a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.170
host knows a DNS name or or an IP

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.430
address of another host, but it may not know the hardware or MAC address of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.710
the adapter on the host that it wants to send it's datagram to. So we

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.319
need to provide a way for a host to learn the MAC address of another

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.710
host. The solution to this is a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.130
protocol called ARP or the address resolution protocol.
