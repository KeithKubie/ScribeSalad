00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.592
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:07.110
JILL EBSTEIN: Thank
you for coming.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.670
And think Google for
providing a forum

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.800
that people like me
can share our ideas.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.880
So first I want to do is tell
you a little bit about the

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.780
"At My Pace" series.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.050
This was the first book, in
case you guys did not see it.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.060
And what caused me start with
"At My Pace", this whole idea,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.880
was at the time Sheryl
Sandberg had her "Lean In"

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.820
conversation and everybody
was running with "Lean In",

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.340
except for a fair chunk
of my friends and people

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.770
I knew who felt it
didn't apply to them.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.350
And the question
was, is there a story

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.560
to be told about women who
aren't on the autobahn going

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.000
full speed ahead?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.880
Is there a story to be
told about those people who

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.260
have a windy road
with starts and stops

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.070
who are enjoying life in
a different kind of way?

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.070
And I could not find
a book out there

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.560
that laid credence to that.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.380
And so I decided that we
would write that book.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.640
And I had, as my model in the
back of my mind, the "This I

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.780
Believe" series.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.282
Does anybody know
"This I Believe"?

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:08.990
It's really worth
checking out some time.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.380
So they are 500-word, very
pithy pieces on different topics

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.709
that high school
students oftentimes read.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.250
And you get a chance
to see the world

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.791
through many different
peoples' eyes.

00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:23.484
But I knew that 500 words
would not capture the topics

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:24.400
that I was looking at.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.950
So I said, let's bump it
up to a thousand words.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.540
Let me do some guidelines
and let me help people.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.420
I wanted people
who weren't famous

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.610
and people who don't
typically write.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.260
I wanted to get those
voices out there.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.300
It's the voices of the
people that most of us

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.110
interact with every day.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.400
And the goal was
to see the world

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.337
through many different
perspectives,

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:46.420
at the end of the day, to
expand the conversation.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.370
So that time it was
about leaning in

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.830
and the woman's journey,
which I since have learned it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.496
shouldn't have been
the woman's journey.

00:01:52.496 --> 00:01:54.610
It should have been the
journey, because we all

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.294
have the same challenges of
how we're going to do it.

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:59.710
And then at the end of it all,
in some way in that process

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.510
we would discover
something about ourselves

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.690
and find some truths that
would mean something to us.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.630
And why it's "At My Pace"
is because, even though we

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.710
live in a fast-paced society,
finding out these truths

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.480
or working our way
through these issues

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.720
doesn't happen that quickly.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.600
It's some organic process.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.430
And my hope was that
these books would

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.860
help foster a conversation
that will get to that place

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.130
that we can feel
good about the topic.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.870
So that was the first book.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.970
I continued to give lots of
discussion groups on that.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970
But the second book-- so
then what was happening

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.500
was I was thinking, is
there another book in me?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.730
And my mother was in
her 91st year of life,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.630
and she wasn't doing that well.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.450
And so she lived
in Denver and I'd

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.640
fly in and see her
every five or six weeks.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.720
I would be there.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.540
I was always driving
her crazy with,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.580
are you drinking enough,
are you eating enough,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.480
and how's the PT going?

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.480
And just like your teenagers can
sort of shut you down and sort

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.170
of--

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.190
she was basically not wanting
to engage in that conversation.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.290
So I decided I would
change the conversation.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.870
And I wrote her a
piece on one lesson

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.110
I took from her life
and its impact on me.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.080
And that lesson was about
continuous lifelong learning.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.780
In her 80s, she was
still taking classes.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.340
She had very young
classmates in her class.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.220
One of the classes they
gave her a rolling backpack

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.350
because they were afraid
that she would fall as she

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.270
tried to carry these books.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.540
And so it's my mother's rolling
backpack, that even in her 80s

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.620
she's taking classes.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.157
And I realized that,
for me, I'm always--

00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:34.990
you know, I wasn't
always working on my own.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.600
I worked in different
established companies.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.020
And I was always told
how curious I was.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.210
And I think that curiosity
and that wanting to learn

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.590
came from her.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.674
So I wrote my piece.

00:03:45.674 --> 00:03:46.590
And then she loved it.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.740
And then I thought, well, this
is going to be my next book.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.460
I'm going to go ask people to
write a piece on their mother,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.820
only one lesson,
not 10, story based,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.590
and it cannot be mushy gushy.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.530
That was just me because I'm
not a big mushy gushy fan.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.350
So it turns out that mushy
gushy was really not that much

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.690
in the cards anyway
because people

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.380
have very complex feelings
about their mothers,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.890
oftentimes-- not
always, oftentimes.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.000
So I'm going to show you
the cover of the book.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.830
This was the cover,
as you have it there.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.260
And my question to
you is, what do you

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.510
think I was thinking when I
had a fledgling with a flower

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.989
and a mother bird looking down?

00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:26.530
What do you think
was in my thoughts?

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:31.560
OK, I'm going to help you guys.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.857
AUDIENCE: Judgement.

00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:33.940
JILL EBSTEIN: What was it?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.773
AUDIENCE: Judgement.

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:37.900
JILL EBSTEIN: Gratitude.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.240
This fledgling had a
flower, and to me, it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.120
was a sign of giving
back, a saying thank you.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.050
Now it turns out that
sometimes it's not a flower.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.940
Sometimes it's an olive branch.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.850
Sometimes it's putting
your mother in context

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.910
and being able to
explain her to yourself

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.510
and being able to validate
that relationship.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.580
And I mentioned that I
have guidelines when I go

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.530
through this with contributors.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.680
And this guideline I said,
you may not dis your mom.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.500
If it turns out that you cannot
get to that place that you can

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.410
put her in context
and appreciate her,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.489
then it's not the book for you.

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:15.530
And some people couldn't.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.830
I had one woman who wrote
me and she said, "I've tried

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.750
three times to write my piece.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.790
It is still a rant.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.410
So I thank you because I'm
going to see a therapist now."

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.090
And we were just
talking about dogs.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.150
I have a dog that
I love dearly and I

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.740
went to take him to my groomer.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.490
I said, "Oh, by the
way, I got this book.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.980
How would you like
one of these books?"

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.450
And she's like,
"It's about moms."

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.810
I'm like, yep.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.170
"I have a really complicated
relationship with my mom."

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.280
I'm like, "Well, you
don't have to take it."

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.642
"No, no worries, I was just--

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:45.350
no, I'll take them"
I've been a customer.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.861
She probably felt obliged.

00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:49.360
And then when I came back the
next go around she said to me,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.760
"That was so meaningful
because I have never

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.230
been at peace with my mom.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.430
I read the book.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.360
I wrote a piece."

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.240
She and I cried.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.460
It was a very healing moment.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.162
So I had a lot of
things like that happen.

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:01.620
So what I want
today is two things.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.900
I want to talk about the
flower and the olive branch,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.500
the people who just had
sort of sheer appreciation,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.110
and the olive branch, the people
who really had to struggle

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.389
to put their mother in context,
and give you guys a feeling--

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.930
let me get my reading glasses
so I can actually read a little

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.680
bit--

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.080
and give you guys a
feeling for what I heard

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.580
and what I took
away from it all.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.140
So do we want to hear olive
branches or flowers first?

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.530
OK, if you guys aren't
voting I'm going for flowers.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.000
All right, so there's a story
here called "Rough Patch".

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.240
And "Rough Patch"-- it's
written by Laurel Lloyd--

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.040
is a woman whose mother,
when she was young,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.440
all she wanted to do was drama.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.080
Now her parents, one was a
teacher, one was a nurse.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.799
And she lived in
that stage of living

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:54.840
where parents seem to be
able to actually dictate

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.280
what their kids did.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.857
And so her parents said to her,
you can do drama on the side,

00:06:58.857 --> 00:07:00.190
but you're not going to do that.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.900
You're going to be a teacher.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.190
That's a nice, solid career.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.900
You can support yourself.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.400
So she taught, but
she didn't like it.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.460
And she ended up
reverting back to drama,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.480
and that's what she did.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.880
And then one summer when
she was doing drama,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.610
she met what would become
her husband on the stage.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.620
At the end of the summer
they were engaged,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.060
and they then went
ahead and had four kids.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.610
They left New York City
and they headed to Vermont

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.450
and they raised their kids in
a very small town in Vermont.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.500
He had a small hardware store.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.480
She was a mom who did
PTA and Girl Scouts

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.830
and sort of a traditional role.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.600
She didn't have too
much time to act,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.700
almost no time, a
little bit occasionally.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.730
He was still doing
acting on the side.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.357
And Laurel remembers
that somewhere

00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:41.940
in the 20-year mark
of their marriage,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.320
they hit this rough patch.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.270
And at 23 years in their
marriage, they got divorced.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.020
When he was on stage in one of
his shows, he met an actress.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.490
They fell in love.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.320
And that was the end of
his marriage to his wife.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.020
So Laurel describes that moment
when she says about her mother,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.360
"She felt rejected and alone.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.230
But at age 50 she picked
herself up and moved forward.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.300
In the years that
followed, my mother

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.660
acted in multiple theaters
outside of our town.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.820
She got a degree in
counseling, worked

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.600
as a counselor in a local high
school and at a local shelter

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.830
with teens.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.640
She became the caretaker of
a refugee Guatemalan family,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.570
helping to raise five children
while working at a Benedictine

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.020
monastery.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.840
In time, her
relationship with my dad

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.000
healed, and they
often chatted when

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.309
seeing each other in town."

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.440
Now the weird thing
is that Laurel's

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.390
telling this story
as an adult. She

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:46.200
was married for 20 years,
hit the same rough patch.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.250
And literally 23 years into
her marriage, at age 50,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.960
she gets divorced.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.090
Actually divorced, goes
through on the exact day

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.240
of what would have been
her parents' anniversary.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.910
And so she's feeling
all over again,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.460
like remembering her
mother and the pain.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.630
And she describes,
"With a young daughter,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.180
it was inevitable that I'd be
seeing my ex and eventually

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.390
his wife," because
her ex also had

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.750
a new woman, who actually
moved into the house

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.400
that Laurel moved out of.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.860
"So I braced myself and
put my best foot forward.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.670
I went back to work and
began to rebuild my life.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.400
Five years since our
split, my ex and I

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.950
have moved beyond
our difficult time.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.020
My goal during the
hurt of the divorce

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.980
was that we would find our
way back to a positive place.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.600
And it has happened.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.660
I even had Thanksgiving
dinner at my former home

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:45.760
this past year with my ex,
his wife, her ex, their son,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.980
my daughter, and
some other guests."

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.040
And she concludes.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.540
She said, "My friend
stifled a gasp

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.290
when I told her I'd
be having Thanksgiving

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.970
dinner with my ex and his wife.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.420
But isn't that how
it should be, letting

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.640
go of the adversity
in our lives,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.150
appreciating the good in
what was, and moving on?

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.550
In the end, it's the
children who win.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.430
And that's the lesson that my
mother taught me with the grace

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.420
and kindness she showered
on those in her life, a gift

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.250
that I'll be sure to
pass on to my daughter."

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.090
So the same rough patch
that her mother had

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.080
was the same rough
patch that she had.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.350
And she was able to take
her mother's equanimity

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.240
and strength and copy that
when she had her moment.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.570
By the way, feel free to
ask questions or interject

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.920
with a comment.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.290
This is supposed to be
informal and interactive.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.090
OK, I'll give you another story.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.890
That's what I call
a flower story.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.290
This is a shorter one.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:52.200
So the story is that Elise
Friedman, who's in her 70s,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.120
remembers being in Maui,
traveling with her husband,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.910
super excited to get up early
in the morning and go tour

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.850
the island.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.140
And they're up very early.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.290
And they're stuck in
traffic because there

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.909
is a big dump truck
filled with pineapples

00:11:10.909 --> 00:11:11.950
that's blocking the road.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.010
She said just filled
with pineapples.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.800
So she's sort of laughing
at the peculiarity,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.600
up early to go see the
island and here you

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.380
are in traffic because
of a truck of pineapples.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.360
And she calls her mother
who lives in Buffalo.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.109
Now first of all, she's
on her cell phone.

00:11:26.109 --> 00:11:26.906
This is the 70s.

00:11:26.906 --> 00:11:28.530
And her mother first
was like in shock.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.020
Oh my gosh, you're
calling me from Hawaii

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.070
on her phone in Buffalo.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.111
So that was sort of cool.

00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:35.320
Then when they got
through that, Elise says,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.760
"But mom, I'm calling you
because we are stuck in traffic

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.500
because there is a dump
truck in front of us filled

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.090
with pineapples."

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.190
And so her mother
says, "Well Elise,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.140
have you tried the pineapples?"

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.549
To which Elise says, "Mom, you
know I don't eat pineapple."

00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:51.090
Elise describes
herself as the person

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.256
who always fished the
pineapple out of any fruit cup

00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:55.920
before she would even start
to have the fruit cup.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.920
And her mother says,
"Elise, be a grownup.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.700
Try the pineapple."

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.210
So she actually decides
to listen to her mother

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.100
and she tries the
pineapple later that day.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.220
And she finds out that lo and
behold, the pineapple in Hawaii

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.381
is way different than any
pineapple she's ever tasted.

00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:13.880
And then she later that day
goes to one of those gift stores

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.879
where they can find that
exact kind of pineapple

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:17.650
that she can ship to her mother.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.440
So she does that.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.824
And she heads back home.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.490
And then two weeks
later she gets a call

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.280
from her sister in Buffalo.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.120
And her sister says that their
mother has just had a stroke.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.770
So Elise immediately goes
to Buffalo to visit the mom.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.010
And at the end of the day,
she goes to her apartment.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.650
And she opens up the fridge
to go get some water,

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.140
and there she sees the
pineapple, uneaten,

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.810
never to be eaten by her mother
who can't swallow anymore,

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.850
right there, unwrapped.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.630
And she has a very big learning
moment for herself right there.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.790
And I'm going to
say it in her words.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.760
She writes, "I have a
tendency to be rather

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.610
emphatic in my
opinions, some of which

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.920
I may have formed
without a whole lot

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.440
of reasonable evidence.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.170
Every so often I am in the
midst of holding forth,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.660
explaining why I would
never, ever consider

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.220
doing this or that.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.130
And then I hear my
mother cautioning me.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.140
Elise, she is saying,
be a grownup."

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.180
So for her, the pineapple
was about opening up her mind

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.310
and really taking
the world fresh

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.836
and not bringing her
prejudices to that instance.

00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:32.210
So those are some
flower stories.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.605
Anybody have a lesson
they want to share

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.230
about their mother,
something that they

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.950
took that was on the
sweet side of life?

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.850
Do we want some
olive-branch stories?

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.280
OK, we'll go for an
olive-branch story.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.910
So there's a story in this book
called "Emotional Blinders".

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.120
And it's the story of a man
named Martin Abramowitz who's

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.040
in his 70s.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.090
His father was a cutter for
the Triangle Shirt Factory.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.290
Does anybody know about
the Triangle Shirt Factory?

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.710
That was a factory that-- it
was a moment of tragedy, went up

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.741
in fire and many, many
young girls were killed.

00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:14.740
I don't remember what the
year was, but it was--

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.670
AUDIENCE: Early 19.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.130
JILL EBSTEIN: Early 1900s.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.540
His father was a
cutter for the factory.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.334
He remembers his father
was not a well man.

00:14:21.334 --> 00:14:22.750
He was in and out
of the hospital.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.880
Marty remembers
visiting him but not

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.440
being able to go
into the hospital

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.210
because they don't let
kids into the hospital.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.668
He would have to
be on the outside,

00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:31.600
sort of at the window waving.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.600
And Marty has an older
brother, 10 years older.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.510
So one day his mother tells
him that his father has

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.500
gone to Florida to convalesce.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.980
And he sort of takes
it at face value.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.389
He remembers that day.

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:48.430
It turned out to be the
day of his dad's funeral,

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.710
but the mother has
lied and told him

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.920
that the father has moved
to Florida to convalesce.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.510
He says, "I remember
what I'm sure was

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.510
the day of that funeral.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.530
My brother walked me to school
on that rainy March morning.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.870
I still see the expanding
raindrop circles

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.890
in the puddles on our
block and feel the sadness

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.790
as I put my boots
and raincoat away

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.290
in the walk-in
closet at the back

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.399
of my second-grade classroom."

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:12.940
And that's all he remembers, no
funeral, no visitors at home,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.490
no weeping mother, no
words of huge or hugs

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.310
or consolation or
processing of any kind.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.440
And he proceeds along this path
that his dad is in Florida.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.810
And two years pass, no phone
calls, no letters, no anything.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.880
And finally he
goes to his mother

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.000
and he says, "Daddy
is dead, isn't he?"

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.770
And what he explains then
is the impact of that lie.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.350
"Because I had
absorbed the lesson

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.440
of my mother's decision--
don't acknowledge death,

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.460
don't notice pain, don't pay
attention to any feelings--

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.760
a low-level, won't-go-away
sadness that you won't put

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.360
into words works as a strategy
to avoid pain and get through

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.770
life."

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.880
But that has an impact on
every profession in his life,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.030
because he describes
as an older person,

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.350
he was a failed partner,
a failed parent.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.450
He couldn't find any
real energy for life.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.630
He has a very active
mind, but there was just

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.140
a lethargy about how he did
life because he had so learned

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.640
to repress his feelings.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.210
And when I asked him if he
wanted to write a piece,

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.270
he wanted to write a piece
because it was his chance

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.520
to explain to himself
and to his children

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.150
and to his grandchildren
why his mother did that.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.250
And he saw it in a
whole different light.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.820
And he was able to find
some peace for himself.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.040
So I'm going to read to you how
he puts this in perspective.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.130
He says, "I have come to
understand Rosie's decision

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.980
through a different lens,
one that has a much more

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.780
positive lesson.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.470
A widow at 42 with
one acting out

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.910
17-year-old son and the
other a frail seven-year-old,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.000
and no income except
Social Security.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.690
Rosie seems to have put
on emotional blinders.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.910
She never bewailed
her situation,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.800
never looked for a man.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.990
Instead, she set
about making sure she

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.640
could support her family by
hand-sewing labels on men's

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.845
neckties.

00:17:16.845 --> 00:17:18.220
My brother and I
have that memory

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.430
of trying to keep up with her
as she would go full speed ahead

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.020
navigating the
aisles of Macy's, not

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.869
looking back to see if we
were even keeping pace.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.420
So Rosie's decision
to avoid pain

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.030
was also about getting on
with the business of life.

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:35.970
She was smart
enough to know that,

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.970
at some instinctive level,
what she needed to do

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.226
was to keep her family
and our lives intact.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.600
I have enormous respect for
her ability to have done that

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.000
and to have taught
me a survival skill,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.750
even as I mourn her
losses and mine."

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.930
So I asked him
why he wrote this.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.666
I mean, he's been living
with this for many years.

00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:56.040
I think for him,
He really wanted

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.880
to codify that experience, what
it meant to him at the time,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.270
what it means to him now, and
how he can love and respect

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.830
her decisions even if, for a
very large chunk of his life,

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.956
it had some very
detrimental effects on him.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:13.730
AUDIENCE: It's hard
not to be judgmental.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.282
JILL EBSTEIN: It's hard not
to be judgmental, very hard.

00:18:16.282 --> 00:18:18.490
AUDIENCE: It seems really
tough for a mother to not--

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.820
JILL EBSTEIN: Yeah,
right, and to see--

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.010
I mean, and also that older
brother who knew, right?

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.722
Can you mentioned being the
brother, 17-year-old brother,

00:18:26.722 --> 00:18:28.180
10 years older who
knew [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.870
and had to actually
keep the lie as well.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.320
So there's probably
a lot of ways

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.260
to unpack that that was
damaging in a lot of ways.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.730
I had a woman--

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.310
so I always try in these
stories to reach out

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.787
to groups that are
not Newton Jewish.

00:18:43.787 --> 00:18:45.620
That's sort of my sweet
spot, Newton Jewish,

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.730
but I try to reach out to
other parts of the universe.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.720
I was much more successful
in the second book,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.511
in this book, than I
was in the first book,

00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:55.350
and successful again
in the third book.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.540
So I reached out to a
woman who is from Guyana.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:06.110
And her parents-- her
mother was a little more--

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.460
on the social caste
of society, her mother

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.130
was higher on the
rung than her father.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.330
They lived in Guyana.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.020
Her father was a police
officer who made his way up to,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.630
I think, a military
officer of some kind.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.580
They had four daughters.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.790
And at some point their
parents get divorced.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.590
And she is now living with her
mother and her grandmother.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.810
And she misses her
father terribly.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.709
And so the father
decides every Saturday,

00:19:32.709 --> 00:19:34.500
he's going to come
visit the four daughters

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.333
and he's going to have
a good day with them.

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:38.050
And this happens routinely.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.170
And so it's all very copacetic.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.560
And then one Saturday
when he's visiting,

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.890
a military truck comes by
and says to her father,

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.250
you have to go.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.710
And so he zooms away.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.070
And it turns Guyana was
in the middle of a coup,

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.440
and he was on the side of
trying to repress the coup.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.990
And he had to go see if
he could repress the coup.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.240
In the course of
the coup, he died.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.080
He was killed.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.890
So now she has her
mother, her grandmother.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.420
And then what happens
is, the mother remarries.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.170
And I don't know what
the name of this man

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.500
is because he is only referred
with a capital H as Him.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.420
Sort of like Lord Voldemort,
he who shall not be named,

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.720
it's Him.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.310
And Him is abusive.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.440
I'm not sure if it's
emotional or physical or both,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.180
but he's definitely abusive.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.450
And she is very
angry at her mother

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.480
because her mother never
stands up for them.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.510
The grandmother is
a big believer in--

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.480
has a big belief in faith and
God, goes to church every week,

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.366
sings in the choir.

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:39.990
And the grandmother
says to this woman,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.770
you will find your
salvation in the Lord.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.180
You are meant to serve the Lord.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.800
You will take your
pain and all this,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.660
and that will be
where you put it.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.150
And so she goes to
church and she sings

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.470
and she loves all that.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.000
And at a certain
point, she decides

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.550
she's going to the
States because she

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.367
has to get away from Him, and
she's angry at her mother.

00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:01.200
And she's able to come
here and she actually

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.215
does become a reverend.

00:21:03.215 --> 00:21:04.590
Now when I asked
her if she would

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.020
write a story about her
mother, I didn't know all this.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.770
I just knew that she
kept on saying to me,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:09.570
"How about my grandmother?

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.986
Can I write about
my grandmother?"

00:21:10.986 --> 00:21:14.750
And I said, "Well you can,
but it's a book about mothers.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.100
But if grandmothers are what
you want to honor, fine,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.029
we can do that."

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:19.320
And then I don't hear from her.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.570
And as usually happens in "At
My Pace", you cast a big net

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.189
and you get some
eel, but some people

00:21:26.189 --> 00:21:27.480
drop out for different reasons.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.460
And I thought she was
going to drop out.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.160
And then she calls me and
she says, "I'm coming over."

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.370
And she walks into my house.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.460
She's a reverend.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.100
And she says to me, "The
Lord has brought you to me."

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.060
And I thought that I was like
in a dreamland imagining this.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.430
And she says again, "The
Lord has brought you to me."

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.960
And I went, "What did I do?"

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.130
And what I did was make
her revisit her past

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.929
and make her find
peace with her mother.

00:21:52.929 --> 00:21:54.470
And so I'm going to
read you the end.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.130
She calls her piece "Peace".

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.480
She actually called
me recently and said,

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.720
"I have some 30-somethings.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.470
Can they write in your
20-something book?"

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.854
I'm like, "Nope,
it's 20-somethings.

00:22:04.854 --> 00:22:07.020
But when I do 30-somethings,
I'll come back to you."

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.220
So here's what she writes
at the end of "Peace".

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.030
She writes, "It is
over four decades later

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.100
and today I am a reverend.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.730
I have moved my mom to the
States and Him has died.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.690
I have two children, and
while I am not their friend,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.370
I am their ear.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.220
I support and guide them,
and my second husband

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.020
is also committed to them.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.560
I thank the Lord daily
and I have forgiven my mom

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.300
for not supporting my sisters
and me after my dad died.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.630
It has taken a while, but
I have found my peace.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.780
And hopefully she
has found hers."

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.820
So that is a pure
olive-branch story.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.340
That is somebody who had
a lot of consternation,

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.940
a lot of anger, and was able
to, in the course of writing

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.630
a piece, find her peace.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:58.790
So I think what's interesting to
me is, I speak about this book

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.320
to groups--

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.790
synagogues, community
places, you name it--

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.420
but I haven't had a chance to
take it into the work setting,

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.890
even though I've wanted to.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.950
And I think that the
lessons from our mothers

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.950
applies as much to work as it
does into any community setting

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.160
you could, because we take our
lessons from our mom with us.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.400
For good or for
bad, they are us,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.090
and that's what
we bring to work.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.240
And I had this
lunch a while back

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.120
where I was telling one of
my clients about the book,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.000
and he pulls out his cell phone.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.835
Now he works in a
technology company.

00:23:31.835 --> 00:23:36.320
He has about 300 people in his
organization that he manages.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.600
And he shows me that whenever he
feels overwhelmed or just sort

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.600
of daunted by the challenges,
he looks at this note

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.780
that his mother handwrote
for him years ago.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.460
So his mother was an
immigrant from Ireland.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.610
She came over when she was 16.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:53.717
She knew nobody.

00:23:53.717 --> 00:23:55.550
There was an Irish
community here in Boston.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.600
That was helpful.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.130
She became a clerk
at Jordan Marsh

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.590
and she worked all her
way up executive buyer.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.710
And she wrote for her two kids
this thing called the ladder

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.390
of success, and he showed me.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.150
"I think I will, I can, I did."

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.190
And it has percentages by it.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.140
And so he looks at
that handwritten note

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.850
when he feels like
the world's just

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.120
a little bigger than he wants
it to be, or a little harder.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.130
And when I asked him
what that was about,

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.540
he tells me two stories.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.472
The first story is that they
went to church every Sunday.

00:24:25.472 --> 00:24:26.930
And when they went
to church, there

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.050
would be a series of
people from a halfway house

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.520
in the back of the church.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.580
And the first thing
she would do is

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.592
she would go up and shake
everybody's hand that

00:24:36.592 --> 00:24:37.800
is part of the halfway house.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.250
Evidently that was unusual,
because most people

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.230
didn't do that.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.140
And she offered people
afterwards rides home.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.547
And he said he took
from that the way

00:24:51.547 --> 00:24:53.880
she was able to extend dignity
and respect to everybody,

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.560
no matter your lot in life.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.850
And that was something he
wanted to make sure he copied.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.520
The second memory he
had was on July 4.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.490
Before they could go to the
big parade and celebrate,

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.259
she said, you have to clean up.

00:25:07.259 --> 00:25:09.050
And it wasn't cleaning
up inside the house,

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.174
it was cleaning up outside.

00:25:10.174 --> 00:25:12.907
And it wasn't just cleaning
up the lawn and the sidewalk.

00:25:12.907 --> 00:25:14.490
It was going down
the block and seeing

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.890
if there was any garbage,
any refuse to pick up.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.380
Because she wanted him to
understand that accountability

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.770
was more than just
about your area here.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.420
It was about really
extending a much bigger arm

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.370
and being able to
take responsibility

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.510
for a bigger piece of the
world than just your lot.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.550
So he looks at this
ladder of success

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.860
and he thinks about
how he treats people.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.490
And he thinks about how
he builds accountability

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.690
within his teams.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:44.766
And that's his lesson from his
mother that he takes into work.

00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:46.140
So now I'm going
to ask you guys,

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.270
is there a lesson that
anybody in this room

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.880
can imagine that you
take into work, something

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.900
that your mother has given you
that you can see a connection

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.310
to in how you behave at work?

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.600
AUDIENCE: My mother
used to always say

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.016
what her mother
said to her, which

00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:00.600
is if you can't
say something nice,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.620
don't say anything at all.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.290
And I think that's
really important

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:09.360
to sometimes be positive,
not be overly critical.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.270
And certainly think
about it before you're

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.287
negative about stuff.

00:26:13.287 --> 00:26:14.120
JILL EBSTEIN: Right.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.036
No, that's a good one.

00:26:15.036 --> 00:26:18.540
Just being positive
goes a long way.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.240
Well, there's a lot of lessons.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.420
There's a really funny story
in this book by Danny Brassell

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.820
It's called "Always Talking".

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.880
He describes his mother.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.550
Actually it's so funny, I'm
going to read you a part of it.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.520
And she's married to
a quiet librarian.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.950
He is very happy to give his
wife the run of the house.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.530
So he starts it off,
"Mom loves to talk.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.390
It can drive a person nuts.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.280
My mother has never
received a piece of mail

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.200
that she did not feel
compelled to read aloud

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.210
to anyone in the room.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.060
'So Danny, you remember Mrs.
Hefflenagle,' she'll say.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.810
'She died four years
before you were born.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.851
Well, I just received a
letter from her daughter.

00:26:54.851 --> 00:26:56.614
Let me read it to you.'

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:58.530
And then she'll read
about a letter of someone

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.050
I do not know about things
I do not care about.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.710
And like Walt Disney, no matter
what travails she describes,

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.900
she always manages to
find a silver lining

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.160
to create a happy ending."

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.550
And then he describes
being in the car with her.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.840
She's always talking.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.210
"I don't ever remember sitting
in the car with my mother

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.160
throughout my childhood
where she did not play

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.080
some sort of game with us kids.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.790
'Hey Danny, there's a Volkswagen
Bug', she pointed out while

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.207
smacking me in the arm.

00:27:23.207 --> 00:27:25.290
'Hey Danny, look at the
license plates on the car.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.210
How many different
states can you spot?

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.740
Hey Danny, what sounds
does your name start with?'

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.530
I'd make a D sound,
and she would

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.740
challenge me to find sounds
that started with that sound.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.140
'Dairy Queen,' I'd
shout, 'Dunkin' Donuts.'

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.342
Yes, I was an obese child.

00:27:39.342 --> 00:27:41.050
My poor father could
never get a word in,

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.740
nor anyone for that matter
when my mother began speaking.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.980
'So honey, tell Daddy who
was on the plane with us.'

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.497
And as my father began
to open his mouth,

00:27:48.497 --> 00:27:50.580
Mother would blurt out,
'The San Francisco Giants.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.735
And honey, tell Danny
what they said to you.'

00:27:52.735 --> 00:27:55.110
And Dad would make it another
fruitless attempt to speak.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.820
Mom would share the
rest of the story."

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.080
So he says at the end, "Now Mom
always has something to say,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.500
and I am now a motivational
speaker who gets paid to talk.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.885
Who do you think I took after?"

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:14.910
Anyway, I think it's
really interesting

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.990
and may be helpful to
think about the lessons

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.940
that-- it could also be lessons
your father has given you.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.097
But this book is for my
mom, dedicated to my mom.

00:28:22.097 --> 00:28:23.430
So that was why I chose mothers.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:28.290
But I think who we are at home
is mostly who we are at work.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.930
And the lessons from our
parents are very much

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.616
a factor in who that person is.

00:28:33.616 --> 00:28:35.149
Now I'm happy to
take any questions.

00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:37.440
I could give you more stories,
but you've got the book,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.381
so you could read it yourself.

00:28:39.381 --> 00:28:41.130
But if you have any
questions or thoughts,

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.962
I am happy to take them.

00:28:42.962 --> 00:28:45.420
AUDIENCE: I'll offer another
story, a lesson from my father

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.070
just because you
mentioned fathers.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.945
I remember being a little
kid and complaining

00:28:48.945 --> 00:28:50.590
about having to go to school.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.580
And I've got a
17-year-old daughter now

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.930
who gives me the same
thing about complaining

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.130
about going to school.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.350
But when I was a kid
and I was just so upset,

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.600
I didn't want to go to school.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.683
It was a waste of my time.

00:29:01.683 --> 00:29:03.000
I didn't like school.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.970
And my dad said to me,
"I go to work every day.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.040
I don't want to go
to work every day.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.050
You just do it."

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.550
And that kind of stayed with me.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.440
Sometimes there's
things you've got to do.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.460
JILL EBSTEIN: Right.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.960
It's not always
what you want to do.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.310
It's sometimes
what you got to do.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.640
No, that's true.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.540
Sometimes when I get
into these rooms with--

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.014
especially when I've
gotten into room, a lot--

00:29:25.014 --> 00:29:26.430
the sweet spot for
me in this book

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.867
is middle-aged women who
are contemplative and trying

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:30.450
to sort of think
back about their moms

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.800
and about their life.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.410
And it's just so
interesting to see

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.170
how their decisions were driven
by a memory of their mother

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.950
and what they take with it.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.207
And my daughter, I
was saying earlier--

00:29:42.207 --> 00:29:43.790
some people weren't
here-- my daughter

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.700
wanted to write a piece.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.200
And I was like, no, you
don't need to write a piece.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.890
It's not about me.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:47.590
It's about the world out there.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.550
No, no, no, I want
to write a piece.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.800
And she writes actually
a really good piece,

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.360
even though I
didn't want her to.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.610
And her lesson, I always
said to her, Naomi,

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.000
responsibility goes up
and credit goes down.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.950
And she works at
Boston Scientific.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.089
And she always
tells me that those

00:30:03.089 --> 00:30:05.630
are words that have always stuck
with her, responsibility up,

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:06.800
credit down.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.580
Because you're
oftentimes on teams

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.772
which don't give enough
credit to the people

00:30:10.772 --> 00:30:11.730
who are doing the work.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.830
And it's very easy for someone
who is further up in the chain

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.310
to take the credit.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.980
Not that it happens
here, but that

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.970
would be an inclination that
you could just be aware of.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:27.230
I was happy to hear that some
words that I had said as a mom

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.830
actually made it into a piece.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.130
But it's good.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.530
So I think if you
guys are thinking

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.840
about a creative
present for your mother,

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.770
you could give her a copy of the
book, or your copy of the book.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.580
And you could write her a little
note, as people have done.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.610
I had one woman who
said to me, "I would not

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.710
have been able to write
a piece for this book

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.080
because I would have been
all about dissing my mom."

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.360
So I said, "OK, tell
me about your mom."

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.500
"Well, she's 94."

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.700
"What does she do?"

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.340
"Well, she plays lots
of games, canasta."

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.770
She listed a whole bunch
of games that she plays.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.130
And I said to her--

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.630
I happened to know a little bit
about this woman, not a lot.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.010
I said, "Tell me
what you like to do."

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.139
She said, "Well,
I play games too."

00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:10.430
And she actually teaches games.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.700
That's one of her hobbies that
she gets paid to teach games.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.480
So I said to her, "And you
can't find any gift there

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.120
about your mother
in her 90s and then

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.610
you being a games
player as well?"

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.700
And then she saw me
a couple weeks later

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.210
and she said to me, "Thank
you, because I'm actually going

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.372
to thank my mom for that."

00:31:30.372 --> 00:31:32.330
And she didn't think she
had any thanks in her,

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.250
but she actually did.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.230
That has come up in
so many different ways

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.540
where people have had a
chance to thank their mother.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.210
So it's late February,
last day of February.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.100
Mother's Day is in May.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.630
And you have a couple of months.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.520
You could write your
mother a little note

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.110
and give her the
book and she probably

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.776
would think it's about
one of the nicest

00:31:49.776 --> 00:31:52.337
presents she could have.

00:31:52.337 --> 00:31:53.420
Thank you guys for coming.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.210
I know you guys are busy.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.430
I'm happy to take questions.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.180
But if you don't have
questions, then I'll

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.895
let you guys get back to work.

00:32:00.895 --> 00:32:03.390
AUDIENCE: I guess I
have one question.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.610
Did you notice the difference
between mothers and sons

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.390
versus mothers and
daughters in the pieces?

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.430
JILL EBSTEIN: Not so much
actually, I really did not.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.010
The men who stepped
up and wanted to write

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.260
were, for the most part, men
who were very comfortable

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.349
sharing their emotions
and didn't have a--

00:32:21.349 --> 00:32:23.390
so I would say that I
didn't see so much of that.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.430
I actually originally
thought this

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.770
would be a book about
mothers and daughters.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.214
And my son who is my copy
editor said, "Well, sons

00:32:31.214 --> 00:32:33.380
are going to want to write
about their mothers too."

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.080
And it was like a new idea to
me that sons would actually

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.664
speak about their mothers.

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.080
And so then I went
running around.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.030
I'm like, well I can't just
have two men in the book

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.988
or one man in the book.

00:32:41.988 --> 00:32:44.360
So then I went around
and started asking men,

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.010
do you want to write
about your mother?

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:50.675
Their biggest constraint was
just either time or people

00:32:50.675 --> 00:32:52.550
very uncomfortable with
their writing skills.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:56.150
That's a big theme I have in
these books is people will say,

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.920
well, I have ideas,
but I'm not a writer.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.010
And I always say, you
don't have to be a writer.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.590
I will help you.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.840
You have to have thoughts,
but we can take your thoughts

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.840
and we can make a piece.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.670
And they're so happy afterwards
because they wouldn't

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.753
have done it on their own.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.020
I see a difference
in age more than I

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.750
see a difference in gender.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.851
The older you get,
the more appreciative.

00:33:20.851 --> 00:33:22.475
Some of the younger
stories are angsty.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.670
AUDIENCE: I think that last
comment about the age thing

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.329
seems to me, as you get older,
you experience more of life

00:33:32.329 --> 00:33:33.620
and you bump into these things.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.440
A lot of the lessons that I
feel like I'm starting to learn

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.830
or as I understand myself and
go inside myself and learn more

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.500
about my own character and
personality and the way

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.220
I handle situations gives me
an appreciation for the way

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.950
my mum handled herself.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.340
Went through a divorce.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.560
My father's business went
bankrupt before that,

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.100
and then she went
through a divorce.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.710
But the way she
handled herself--

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.800
And the one thing that struck
me through this whole thing

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.180
was the way that she sings all
day long around the house doing

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.200
anything.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.250
In that sense I carry that
same musical sense with me.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.949
So I just catch myself
sometimes doing the dishes

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:15.949
while the kids are getting
ready to go to school

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.610
and just doing the same
kind of thing, any song.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.980
It could be one of
the kids' tunes.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.940
It could be ABBA, which
my mom used to love,

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.690
or whatever it is.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:24.398
And I'll do this.

00:34:24.398 --> 00:34:26.241
I'm like, I'm crazy.

00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:27.949
But then I turn around
and I see the kids

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:29.330
doing the same thing
walking around the house,

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.580
singing to themselves
while they're doing tasks.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.134
And it's just a cascading
like, I don't know,

00:34:34.134 --> 00:34:35.955
it's genetic or just crazy.

00:34:35.955 --> 00:34:37.580
JILL EBSTEIN: But
that's a lovely thing

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.925
to pass though generations.

00:34:38.925 --> 00:34:39.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.162
And I think the age
tie in there was just

00:34:42.162 --> 00:34:43.370
being able to recognize that.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:44.786
You get to a certain
age where you

00:34:44.786 --> 00:34:47.870
start to see all these
different pieces of your mother.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:51.949
And the things that
you hated at one time,

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.545
then you're either experiencing
it with your own daughters

00:34:54.545 --> 00:34:58.591
or sons, or you just
learn more about yourself

00:34:58.591 --> 00:34:59.840
and how you handle situations.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.214
JILL EBSTEIN:
Right, that's true.

00:35:01.214 --> 00:35:03.010
That's definitely true.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:03.767
Lacey?

00:35:03.767 --> 00:35:05.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'll
just second that.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.450
It occurred to me that right--

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.610
I was born when my
mother was almost 30,

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.850
so I haven't gotten
to the point yet where

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:19.620
I am really doing any of the
things that I saw her doing.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.650
And I've been married
almost four months now,

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.130
and I'm just starting
to see things

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.630
where I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm
doing this just like my mom.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.370
Or like all these
things she used

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.680
to remind me about
I'm like, oh, this

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.380
is where it's
useful, that I'm just

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.360
starting to be in the kind of
situations that I saw her in.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.210
JILL EBSTEIN: Right.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.410
We love that as parents.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.030
We love when we see that
our kids don't think

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.113
that what we did was just
crazy but there actually

00:35:43.113 --> 00:35:46.447
was some reason behind it all.

00:35:46.447 --> 00:35:48.905
Well keep your eyes open for
ways you're like your parents.

00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:51.590
And then if they're
all flattering,

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.860
you can let them know, because
it's always good as a parent

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.020
to have a moment of recognition.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.520
Well thank you all
for coming today.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.940
I appreciate that.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.540
Take care.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.490
[APPLAUSE]
