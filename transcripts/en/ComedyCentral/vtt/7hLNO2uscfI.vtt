00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.740
Mr. Keegan-Michael Key,
everybody.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.580
[cheers and applause]

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.020
I'm from Detroit.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.420
[scattered applause]

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.060
Good night!

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.740
No, I'm kidding.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.720
So one day in 1990,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.420
I was driving my 1976
Buick LeSabre down the street.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.100
I had a 1976 Buick LeSabre.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.000
It got 400 feet
to the gallon.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.000
And I was on the north side
of 8 Mile Road.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.620
You guys saw 8 Mile 
with Eminem?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.140
Okay, and there was a dude
standing in the parking lot,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.300
and he comes up to my car,
and this guy--

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.020
He's just looking rugged,
like, looking rough.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.480
He looked like a cross
between, like, a--

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.100
like, a beaten golden retriever
and sad Gary Busey.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.240
It was--

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.860
So anyway, something came
over me, like the angel.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.060
There was an angel
sitting on my shoulder,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.580
and the angel spoke into my ear
and said,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.360
"This is the day that you're
gonna make a difference.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.040
"You're not gonna just give him
a dollar.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.120
"You're gonna do
onto others today.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.400
Do it for this guy."
I said, "Okay, all right.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.820
"I'm north of 8 Mile.
I'm good to go.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.380
"I'm gonna help
this mother[bleep].

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.660
I'm gonna help this guy."

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.540
And the guys comes up,
and he's like,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.280
"Hey, man,
I swear, man,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.340
"if you could just help me out
for a second.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.860
"If you could just--
there's a church,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.700
"like, just a mile north
of here,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.540
"and I know some guys
at the church.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.220
"And if you could
just drop me off,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.840
"there's a shelter there, man.
I really appreciate it.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.560
That's all I'm asking you to do.
God bless you, God bless you."

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.720
I'm like, "That's good.
That's fine.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.760
He's not asking for money."

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.420
Get in the car.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.280
So we get in the car,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.480
and I'm asking him
about himself,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.500
and his name is "Jeff."

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.280
We're gonna call him Jeff.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.540
And we were driving down,
and all of a sudden,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.520
we're driving,
and I'm asking him,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.140
"How did you fall
on hard times?"

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.740
He's telling me his story.
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.900
And then I realized
we're driving south,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.600
and I was just like,
"That's another thing, Jeff--

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.800
Oh, [bleep],
I'm south of 8 Mile!"

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.040
And so I got south of 8 Mile,
and we pull over,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.540
and he's like,
"Just wait right here.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.040
"Just wait right here.
I'll be right back.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.540
I promise.
I'll be right back."

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.460
So Jeff gets out of the car,
and for like a minute--

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.320
for, like, a minute,
I just see him going,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.060
and he's walking
around the church

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.455
and back and back again.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.440
He's like,
"Just give me one second."

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.560
And then he's back around here,
and he goes into a house, okay?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.220
Right then, that's the moment
I should've driven away

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.940
as fast as possible,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.680
but that angel
deafeningly screamed in my ear,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.160
"Just help someone,
you [bleep] 19-year-old

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.320
"with your trench coat,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.480
looking like
you're in Lost Boys."

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.040
Right at that moment
is when I should've driven away,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.600
but I didn't.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.002
I didn't.
I'm gonna help this guy.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.880
I'm gonna be a Good Samaritan
if it kills me.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.160
I get out of my car--
me, Corey Feldman--

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.240
and I go, and I open up
the trunk of my car,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.540
and I get out a tire iron,
and then I close the trunk,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.060
and I'm leaning
against the trunk of the car

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.140
with my tire iron

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.640
like--like everybody
within a two-mile square radius

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.100
doesn't have a handgun.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.860
What am I gonna do
with my tire iron?

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.360
I'm gonna--

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.580
[imitating bullets ricocheting]

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.280
So he comes back.
Jeff comes back.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.300
And he's walking
towards my car.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.100
He's walking towards my car
like this,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.440
and he's really in a hurry.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.800
And he gets up to me,
and he goes,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.660
"Oh, man, what's going on
with the tire iron?"

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.160
I said, "Just, you know,
protection for myself

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.720
just in case anything--
any shit went down."

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.860
And he goes, "Oh, man, that's--
Whoo, you had me nervous there

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.800
"for a second,
'cause I was back there,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.120
and things did not go well."

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360
And so we got back
in the car,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.760
and we're driving
down the street.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.760
I said, "Did not go well.
What happened, Jeff?"

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.400
And he goes, "Oh, yeah,
I was in that house

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.120
"talking to a dude,
and then he hit me

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.840
with an aluminum
baseball bat."

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.200
So I was like,
"Oh, shit."

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.840
And so he's like,
"Oh, no, no, stop here,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.680
stop here, stop here,"
and I'm like,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.400
"Okay, this is the time
when I'm gonna"--

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.160
"Okay, Jeff,
I think it's time.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.040
It's time
to get out of the car."

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.960
But we look across the street,
and across the street,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.680
there's this house,
and there's a kid

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.240
standing on the house.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.880
He's got one of these huge,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.560
like, triple-fat
goose down jackets, a white one.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.320
He looked like
the Michelin man,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.600
like a black Michelin man.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.800
And he was standing here,
this kid,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.880
and he comes up
to the car.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.680
He looks in my window,
and he's like,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.920
"What's going on, Jeff?
What's up?"

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.120
And Jeff says--
Jeff says,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.960
"I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.640
"If you could just help me out
right now,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.960
"I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.440
I'll have four VCRs."

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.720
Now, here's me.
I'm like, "Four V--What?"

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.240
So kid goes back up
to the porch,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.920
and he's on the porch like this,
and he goes--

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.840
And then there's
a drain pipe here,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.760
and my boy
reaches down like this

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.040
and puts his hand
in the drain pipe, right,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.800
takes his hand out, comes--

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.480
saunters back
across the street to my car,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.400
presents crack cocaine
to Jeff.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.120
So, you know,
crack cocaine's, like, here.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.560
I'm like,
"I've never seen that before."

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.440
And he goes,
"So I'll be back

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.880
in about two hours
with four VCRs."

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.448
So, guys, if you ever find
a time machine

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.200
and go back in time to 1990
and you want to buy crack,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.400
the ratio from crack rock
to VCR is one to one, okay?

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.880
And as the kid backs up
from my car,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.080
he's like, "All right, Jeff.
All right, Jeff."

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.840
And he brushes
his jacket back,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.080
and there's nickel-plated
.45 caliber in his pocket,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.080
so I'm just like,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.040
"I'm the dumbest person
in the world."

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.120
And so--And then
I got really stern, guys,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.800
and I said,
"Jeff, this is it.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.080
"I have to be at play practice
in two hours.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.800
"I'm stage managing
 Early One Evening

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.080
 at the Rainbow Bar
 and Grill."

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.840
So he--So anyway,
Jeff is rummaging around

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.280
on the floor of my car,
grabs a soda can,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.320
then rummages around
on the floor of my car,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.560
grabs a paper clip, okay?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.880
Paper clip.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.920
And he starts, like,
doing a hole

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.080
in the top
of the can, okay?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.720
So he's making a hole
in the top of the can.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.480
So I'm sitting here,
and I'm just like,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.600
"Oh, man, I can't--

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.080
"If I can get
in this parking lot,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.960
I can just get Jeff
out of here."

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.920
I turn and look.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.320
My man Jeff
is scrooched down in my car,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.200
just smoking crack,
just smoking crack.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.440
[smacking lips]

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.680
This guy looks at me and goes,
"Hope you don't mind."

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.400
I get to Coolidge Road.
It feels like it took six years.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.000
And, guys, I only had two hours.
I had to get to play practice.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.640
And he gets out of the car,
and he's like,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.760
"Thanks so much, man.
I really appreciate it, man.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.760
Appreciate it so much.
God bless."

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.280
I'm like, "Get--You really need
to get out of the car, Jeff.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.080
"I need to jettison you
out of the vehicle.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.200
I need you gone."

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.840
And he leaves,
and I--

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.520
You know, I go on
with the rest of my life,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.760
and I encountered him, you know,
later in my life one time.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.320
And I saw him
walking in my neighborhood,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.320
and that little angel
on my shoulder is like,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.960
"Hey, there's Jeff.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.960
Maybe we should give him
one more try."

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.400
And I said,
"Hey, angel, f--k off."

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.720
Thank you so much, everybody.
Appreciate it.
