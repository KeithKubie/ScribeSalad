00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.984
We're asked to apply the
distributive property.

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:04.626
And we have 1/2 times the expression

00:00:04.626 --> 00:00:07.189
2a-6b+8.

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.791
So, to figure this out,
I've actually already

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:11.453
copy and pasted this
problem onto my scratch pad.

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:12.529
I have it right over here.

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.693
1/2(2a-6b+8).

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:17.193
So, lemme just rewrite it.

00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:18.751
So, I'm gonna take, and
lemme color code it, too,

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.263
just for fun, so it's going to be 1/2

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:24.430
times, give myself some space,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.430
1/2(2a-6b),

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:35.223
so, 2a-6b,

00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:38.891
minus six, lemme write it this way

00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:43.712
- 6b, and then we have plus eight.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:48.572
Plus, and I will do eight in this color.

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:51.197
+8.

00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:53.273
And so, i just need to distribute the 1/2.

00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:55.498
If I multiplying 1/2 times
this entire expression,

00:00:55.498 --> 00:00:59.025
that means I multiply 1/2
times each of these terms.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.860
So, I'm gonna multiply 1/2 times this,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.887
1/2 times this, and 1/2 times that.

00:01:05.887 --> 00:01:08.324
So, 1/2 times 2a, so this is going to be

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:12.602
1/2 times 2a, times,

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:14.058
lemme do it in that same color

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:16.061
so you see where the 2a came from.

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:19.244
1/2(2a) minus,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.445
minus 1/2(6b).

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:27.008
Minus 1/2(6b).

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:33.397
Times 6b+1/2(8).

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:38.835
1/2(8).

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.930
And so, what's this going to be?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.014
Well, let's see, I have 1/2(2a).

00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:47.229
1/2(2) is just one, so you're just

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.725
going to be left with A.

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:53.031
And then you have minus 1/2(6b).

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:53.929
Well, we could just think about what

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.150
1/2(6) is going to be.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.055
1/2(6) is going to be three, and then you

00:01:58.055 --> 00:01:59.848
still are multiplying times B.

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:01.787
So, it's gonna be 3b.

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:05.700
And then we have plus 1/2(8).

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.720
Half of eight is four.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.493
Or as you can say, eight
halves is equal to four wholes.

00:02:10.493 --> 00:02:13.293
Alright, so this is going to be four.

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:17.390
So, it's a-3b+4,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.659
a-3b+4.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.923
So, let's type that in.

00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:21.802
It's going to be

00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:26.802
a-3b+4.

00:02:27.488 --> 00:02:28.955
And notice, it's just literally half

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:29.798
of each of these terms.

00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:32.855
Half of 2a is A, half of 6b is 3b,

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.663
so we have minus 6b, so
it's gonna be minus 3b,

00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:37.459
and then plus eight, instead of that,

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.686
half of that plus four.

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:40.261
So, let's check our answer.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:41.293
And we got it right.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.647
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:45.239
So, let's say,

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:47.261
so, they say apply the
distributive property

00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:50.296
to factor out the greatest common factor.

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:52.827
And here, we have 60m-40,

00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:55.089
so lemme get my scratch pad out again.

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.564
So, I'm running out of space that way.

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:02.746
So, we have, write it like this.

00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:05.679
We have 60,

00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:09.781
60m-40.

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:12.469
Minus 40.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.459
So, what is the greatest common factor

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.194
of 60m and 40?

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:20.069
Well, 10 might jump out at us.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.650
We might say, okay, look, you know?

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.089
60 is 10, so we could say
this is the same thing

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:28.630
as 10 times six and actually, and then,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.825
of course, you have the M there,

00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:31.790
so you could do this 10 times 6m.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.222
And then you could view,
you could view this as

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:38.550
10 times four.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.029
But we, 10 still isn't the
greatest common factor.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.784
You'll say, well, how do you know that?

00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:45.922
Well, because four and six still share

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:47.295
a factor in common.

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:49.288
They still share two.

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:50.958
So, if you're actually factoring out

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.628
the greatest common factor, what's left

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:54.858
should not share a factor with each other.

00:03:54.858 --> 00:03:56.655
So, let me think even harder about

00:03:56.655 --> 00:04:00.958
what a greatest common
factor of 60 and 40 is.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.984
Well, two times 10 is 20.

00:04:03.984 --> 00:04:07.093
So, you could actually factor out a 20.

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:10.583
So, you have 20 and 30m.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.828
Sorry, 20 and 3m.

00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:17.353
And 40 could be factored out into 20 and,

00:04:17.353 --> 00:04:18.935
20 and two.

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:23.317
And now 3m and two, 3m and
two share no common factors.

00:04:23.317 --> 00:04:24.996
So, you know that you have fully factored

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:26.526
these two things out.

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:27.761
Now, if you think this is something

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.597
kind of a strange art that I just did,

00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:32.623
one way to think about
greatest common factors,

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:34.124
you say, okay, 60, you could literally do

00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:35.152
a prime factorization.

00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:39.748
You could say 60 is two times
30, which is two times 15,

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:42.697
which is three times five.

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:44.630
So, that's 60's prime factorization.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.670
Two times two times three times five.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.380
And then 40's prime factorization

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.912
is two times 20, 20 is two times 10.

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:58.762
10 is two times five.

00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:02.230
So, that right over here, this
is 40's prime factorization.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.897
And to get out the greatest common factor,

00:05:03.897 --> 00:05:06.723
you wanna get out as many
common prime factors.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:10.014
So you have, here, you
have two twos and a five.

00:05:10.014 --> 00:05:11.749
Here, you have two twos and a five.

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.139
You can't go to three twos and a five

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.467
'cause there aren't three
twos and a five over here.

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:18.487
So, we have two twos and a five here.

00:05:18.487 --> 00:05:21.218
Two twos and a five here.

00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:23.323
So, two times two times
five is going to be

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.866
the greatest common factor.

00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:28.720
So, two times two times
five, that's four times five.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.860
Four times five, that is 20.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.028
That's one way of kind
of very systematically

00:05:33.028 --> 00:05:35.121
figuring out a greatest common factor.

00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:36.696
But anyway, now that we know that 20

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:39.396
is the greatest common
factor, let's factor it out.

00:05:39.396 --> 00:05:43.184
So, this is going to be equal to 20 times,

00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:47.476
so 60m divided by 20, you're
just going to be left with 3m.

00:05:47.852 --> 00:05:49.687
Just going to be left with 3m.

00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:54.190
And then minus, minus 40 divided by 20,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.922
you're just left with the two.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.149
Minus two.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.955
Minus two, so let's type that in.

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:06.006
So, this is going to be 20 times,

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:11.006
20(3m-2).

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.924
And once again, we feel good that we,

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:16.551
literally, we did take out
the greatest common factor

00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.858
because 3m and two,
especially three and two

00:06:19.858 --> 00:06:21.886
are now relatively prime.

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:23.455
Relatively prime just
means they don't share

00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:26.236
any factors in common other than one.
