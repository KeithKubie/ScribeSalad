00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.400
Sel Ghebrehiwot:  Adderall is the brand name for a mixture of amphetamine salts

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.280
that was developed for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, a.k.a. ADHD.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.420
Since 2007, prescriptions have doubled in the U.S,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.080
and even those who don't have a prescription are using.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
An estimated 30% of university students used Adderall at some poinas a study enhancer.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.980
But, what happens to your brain on Adderall?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.580
Adderall is a combination of amphetamine salts,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.800
and therefore is, yup, a close relative of methamphetamine,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.660
commonly known as meth!

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.500
When Adderall is ingested, it takes effect on the brain within an hour of use.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.200
Adderall affects neuroreceptors in the central nervous system,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.000
increasing the effect of serotonin and dopamine.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.900
In patients with ADHD, genetic studies have indicated that these individuals

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
may have dysfunctional dopamine release.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.280
Because of the lack of dopamine, it is theorized that the brain is constantly seeking out stimulants,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640
resulting in the distractibility commonly seen in ADHD patients.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.000
The dopamine and serotonin released by Adderall overcomes this deficit in ADHD patients,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.000
causing increased focus and making you feel less distracted.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.700
Adderall also causes the release of norepinephrine,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.900
which activates the sympathetic nervous system, initiating your fight-or-flight response.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.080
This results in your body moving blood and energy towards the major organs

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.300
and away from your limbs and digestion, which essentially increases alertness.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.220
But in non-ADHD users, can it help you get better grades?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.000
To investigate this, researchers had 32 people without ADHD perform four cognitive tests.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.700
In one instance, they were given 10 milligrams of Adderall and was told it was Adderall.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.800
In the second, they were given a placebo but was told it was Adderall.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.900
In the third round, they were given 10 milligrams of Adderall,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.120
but was told it was a placebo.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.900
And finally, they were given a placebo and were indeed told it was a placebo.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.800
The two groups that did the best were those who thought they had taken Adderall,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.400
regardless of whether they had or not.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.500
In fact, the group that did the worst were those who took Adderall

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.940
but was told it was placebo.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.100
This is because although some studies have found that Adderall can increase repetitive learning tasks,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.700
it does not make a difference when it comes to most cognitive tasks

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.400
or complex learning techniques like those needed for an exam.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.200
Any increase in studying skills may be from the fact that the drug gives you energy,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.600
and can help keep you awake for a night of studying.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.440
because, as we said earlier, it is similar in chemical structure to meth.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.320
The benefits of Adderall in academic circles is still up for debate.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.900
But, the long-term detrimental effects of Adderall abuse are clear.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.900
Consistent release of serotonin and dopamine

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.920
causes the brain to stop producing them naturally over time.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.500
Therefore, you need to keep taking more and more Adderall to get the same effect,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.000
making it highly addictive.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.840
Long-term users of Adderall developed an inability to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.460
feel pleasure without a chemical stimulant,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.580
and these effects can linger even after you stop taking Adderall.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.700
Adderall is a growing problem, so much so the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.800
millenials have been referred to as "Generation Adderall."

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.200
The abuse of Adderall in our culture is following a similar pattern to the current opioid crisis.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.300
Which means, as a society, we need to put measures in place to protect people.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.560
Gregory Brown: Thanks to Sal, our editor, for narrating this video

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.860
and, wow, turns out Adderall is pretty intense!

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.720
Mitchell Moffit: But if you do need help with your exams or school,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.240
we have some scientific study tips and other advice

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.400
over in a bunch of videos we've made, I put some there and in the description below.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.491
Gregory: Thanks so much!

00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:19.080
Make sure you're subscribed for a new video next Thursday.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.085
We'll see you next week!  Mitchell: Bye!
