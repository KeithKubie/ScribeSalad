00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.370
How do we separate the different pieces of
DNA

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.920
that we've cut up and that we've joined?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.230
Now to do that, we use a technique for separating
molecules of different sizes

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.560
that is widely used in biological work, that
depends on electricity.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.009
And we've got an example of it here.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.619
You see in this box, we've got a gelatinous
surface,

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.869
you can see it, the grey material, on a glass
plate.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.439
And it's bathed in a liquid.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.579
And we've got a negative and a positive charge
here going through.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.740
So that electricity is running through that
liquid.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.399
So if we put things at one end, they're subject
to an electric current.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.519
So Nigel is going to give me this pipette

00:00:45.519 --> 00:01:01.940
and I'm going to put a little bit of the material
in just into these slots here at this end.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.589
Just a little bit in there.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.549
Now.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.909
What's going to happen is the electricity
is going to run through that.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.219
And while that's happening let's explain the
basis on which that can separate molecules.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:23.320
So you see what we've got here is, we've got
a negative and a positive,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.320
in our solution.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.649
And the current can flow from the negative
to the positive.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.170
And we put in that a mixture of molecules,
big ones and little ones.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.680
So as the current flows, what happens? The
molecules they move along.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.799
They move along.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.380
But the little ones move quicker than the
big ones.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.689
So after a period of time we've separated
them.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.470
The little ones have moved further than the
big ones.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.119
We've separated out molecules of different
size.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.340
Now we set up an experiment like this a little
earlier,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.850
so that you could see just exactly what happens.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.549
And here is the gel on this lectern.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.470
And you can see the gelatinous material on
the glass slide.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.520
And you can see the separation now of three
different dyes.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.440
The blue, the purple, and the yellow.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.040
That's what happened when we let

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.940
that electric current run through a period
of time

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.790
to separate out those molecules of different
size.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.940
And that's the principle on which we separate
out the DNA molecules of different size

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.940
that arise when we cut a DNA molecule up.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.480
So we're going to show you a picture of such
an experiment

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.160
in which we've cut a DNA molecule into several
pieces.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.560
And then we've separated the pieces according
to size using this technique.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.920
I'm putting these gloves on because we've
stained the DNA with a chemical stain

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.390
and we've got to be careful when handling
this.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.230
And that's why Nigel and I are wearing these
gloves.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.840
And we're sliding this... we'll slide this
onto here.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840
Slide it onto here.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.510
And what we're sliding it onto is a UV light.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.340
A source of UV so I'm, because I'm looking
at this from close up,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.730
I'm going to put on these spectacles to protect
myself from the ultraviolet light.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.260
Now we'll switch on the ultraviolet light.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.880
And the ultraviolet will fluoresce the samples
of DNA that have picked up the dye.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.310
Can you see that?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.090
Can you see here these three columns here?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.620
You see these three? That's the DNA that's
not being cut with the enzyme.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.520
When we cut the DNA with one of those enzymes,
we cut it into several pieces,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.580
and we separate out the pieces.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.700
One there. One there.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.510
One there. One there.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.220
Can you see those pieces?

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.520
We've separated those pieces by this technique
of electrophoresis

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.740
into their different parts, into the parts
into which they're been cut by the enzyme.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.700
Now we can take those pieces out from the
gel and use them for our experiments.
