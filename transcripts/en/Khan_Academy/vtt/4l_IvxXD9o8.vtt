00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.093
- [Voiceover] So we have two examples here

00:00:02.093 --> 00:00:04.796
of someone trying to find the
derivative of an expression.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.539
On the left-hand side, it says

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.315
"Avery tried to find the derivative,

00:00:08.315 --> 00:00:11.934
"of seven minus five x using
basic differentiation rules.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:13.589
"Here is her work,"

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:14.539
and on the right-hand side it says

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.782
"Hannah tried to find the derivative,

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.628
"of negative three plus eight x,

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:20.096
"using basic differentiation rules,

00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:21.529
"here is her work."

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.138
And these are two different examples of

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:26.818
differentiation rules
exercise on Khan academy,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.730
and I thought I would
just do them side by side,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.653
because we can kind of think
about what each of these

00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:34.380
people are doing correct or incorrect.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.307
So these are similar expressions,

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:38.989
we have a constant and then
we have a first degree term,

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.042
a constant and then first degree term.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.466
So they're gonna take the derivative,

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.883
so let's see, step one for Avery.

00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:48.324
She took, she's separately
taking the derivative of seven,

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:52.241
and separately taking
the derivative of five x.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.599
So this my spider senses
already going off here,

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:02.766
because what happened to this
negative right over here?

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:07.503
So it would've sense for
her to do the derivative

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:12.321
of seven, and she could've
said minus the derivative,

00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:16.732
of five x, that's one possibility
that she could've done.

00:01:16.732 --> 00:01:18.678
The derivative of a difference is equal to

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.402
the difference of the derivatives,

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:21.869
we've seen that property.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.274
Or, she could've said,

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:25.824
the derivative, she could've
said this was equal to

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:27.819
the derivative of seven,

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.402
plus the derivative

00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:33.717
with respect to x of negative five x.

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:36.292
These two things would've
been equivalent to this one.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:39.528
But for this one, she somehow forgot to,

00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:40.987
include the negative.

00:01:40.987 --> 00:01:45.398
So I think she had a
problem right at step one.

00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:48.877
Now, if you just follow
her logic after step one,

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:51.058
let's see if she makes any more mistakes.

00:01:51.058 --> 00:01:54.329
So, she takes the
derivative of a constant,

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.060
so constant isn't going to
change with respect to x.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.749
So that makes sense, that
that derivative is zero.

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.320
And so we still have the
derivative of five x,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.299
and remember, it should've
been negative five x,

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.702
or minus the derivative of five x.

00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:09.022
And let's see what she does here.

00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:10.719
So that zero disappears,

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.989
and now she takes the constant,

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.311
she takes the constant out,

00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.144
and that's true,

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:17.019
the derivative of a
constant times something,

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.354
is equal to the constant

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:20.681
times the derivative of that something.

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:23.995
And then, she finds the
derivative with respect to x

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:25.724
of x is one, and that's true,

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:28.405
if the slope, if you had
the graph of y equals x,

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:29.597
the slope there is one,

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:30.561
or what's the rate of change

00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:32.765
at which x changes with respect to x?

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:35.017
Well, that's gonna be one for one.

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:36.447
So that the slope here is one,

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.267
so this is gonna be five times one.

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:40.164
Which is equal to five,

00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:40.997
and at the end they just say,

00:02:40.997 --> 00:02:43.227
at what step did Avery make a mistake?

00:02:43.227 --> 00:02:46.171
So she clearly made a mistake at step one,

00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:49.148
this right of here,
should've been a negative,

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.642
that's a negative, then that
would've been a negative.

00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:53.236
And this would've been a negative.

00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:54.581
And that would've been a negative.

00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:56.773
And then her final
answer should have been,

00:02:56.773 --> 00:02:58.904
should have been a negative five.

00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:00.500
Now let's go back to Hannah.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.684
To see if she made any mistakes and where.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.933
So she's differentiating
a similar expression,

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:08.502
so first she takes the
derivative of the constant,

00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:11.312
plus the derivative of
the first degree term.

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:14.479
Derivative of constant
is zero, that looks good.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.408
So you get the zero,

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:18.775
and then you have the derivative
of the first degree term.

00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:21.072
That's what she's trying to figure out.

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:22.641
And then, let's see,

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:24.427
she's taking...

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.675
Let's see, so this seems off.

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.522
She is assuming that the
derivative of a product

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:32.535
is equal to the product
of the derivatives.

00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:34.829
That is not the case.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.783
And especially, and if
you have a constant here,

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.788
there's actually a much simpler
way of thinking about it.

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:41.804
Frankly the way that
Avery thought about it,

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:43.594
Avery had made a mistake at step one,

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:45.137
but this is actually going to be equal

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:47.868
to the derivative of a
constant times an expression,

00:03:47.868 --> 00:03:50.367
is equal to the same thing as the constant

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:52.367
times the derivative of,

00:03:53.702 --> 00:03:55.910
of the expression.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.755
So this would've been
the correct way to go,

00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:00.611
and the derivative of x with respect to x,

00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.357
well that's just going to be one.

00:04:02.357 --> 00:04:05.000
So this should've all simplified to eight.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.793
What she did is, she is assuming,

00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:09.174
she tried to take the derivative of eight

00:04:09.174 --> 00:04:10.750
and multiply that times
the derivative of x,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.310
that is not the way it works.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.792
In the future you will learn something

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:15.305
called the product rule,

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:16.810
but you won't even have
to apply that here,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.187
because one of these,

00:04:18.187 --> 00:04:19.908
one of these components
I guess you could say,

00:04:19.908 --> 00:04:20.999
is a constant.

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:22.961
So this is the wrong step.

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:25.199
This is where Hannah makes a mistake.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.032
And you could see,

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.014
instead of getting a
final answer of eight,

00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:29.960
she is getting a final answer of,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.727
she assumes well the
derivative of eight is zero,

00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:34.165
times the derivative of x is one,

00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:35.193
zero times one.

00:04:35.193 --> 00:04:38.200
And she gets zero, which
is not the right answer.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.070
So she makes a mistake at step three,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.237
and Avery made a mistake at step one.
