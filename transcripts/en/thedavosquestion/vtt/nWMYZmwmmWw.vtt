Dan: Hi YouTube.
This is Dan Shapiro from the Harvard International

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.969
Negotiation Initiative.
I'm also director of the World Economic Forums

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.619
global agenda council on negotiation and conflict
resolution.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:20.150
This council is a multi state group of former
heads of state, major actors, negotiators

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.400
working to help people deal with their differences
more effectively.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.970
At Davos we've been sharing with the community
here.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.330
Some of the major insights that we've been
working on and practical advice that we are

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.260
working to spread around the world in terms
of how to make our world a safer place.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.649
And I think this is really important information
to be sharing.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.789
Basically one year ago the world had very
little sense of the impending global economic

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.290
crisis.
And there's consensus among many within the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.809
international security realm, or at least
some that there is another insipient crisis

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.320
right around the corner.
And that is the crisis of International security.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.340
How do we keep ourselves safe from terrorism,
from nuclear proliferation and from violent

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.310
conflict?
What we've realized is that the nature of

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.800
conflict has changed significantly over the
past 15-20 years.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.521
And indeed we've found that there's a lot
more interstate conflict.

00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.690
Conflict within states, regional conflict
than interstate conflict.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.500
Additionally there's been more fragmentation,
so we're finding increasing division within

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.440
rebel movements governments, for example in
the DRC and elsewhere.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.040
And on and on.
A number of different ways that conflict has

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.921
changed in our world.
The question though is ultimately, how are

00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:42.830
we going to deal with conflict large scale
violent conflict in our world most effectively?

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.880
And this is a tough question; there are a
tremendous number of people working hard to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.430
deal with this situation.
Around the world literally.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.490
From our own perspective, a couple of key
points come out.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.180
First of all, there's something we call the
prevention principle.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.660
It's incredibly important for the international
community working in issues of crisis management,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.370
conflict resolution to focus at the smallest
level, most local level possible at the earliest

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.489
moment possible.
What can we be doing today to prevent the

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.400
immergence of violent conflict in the future?
And who can be doing what now?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.920
We should be pressuring our government leaders
to take action now.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.700
Yes the economy is critically important, but
if we only focus on the economy, then we are

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.849
leaving a very fragile world where fragile
states are going to become very chaotic states.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.700
And in this borderless world we will all be
victim to those kinds of complexities of our

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.200
world.
Secondly, we've been talking about the importance

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.989
of talk, of negotiation.
And it's in many ways obviously important

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.510
when people have differences to talk about
those differences, yet it doesn't always happen

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.909
in the international spectrum, especially
with so many different kinds of actors, non-state

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.019
actors.
And it's our belief -- I'll speak personally,

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.540
it's my belief that it's extremely important
to talk, especially to those who you consider

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.860
your enemy if your goal is ultimately peace.
And talking in today's world, we've also realized

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.819
has its great complexities.
Talking isn't simply picking up a phone anymore,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.129
well it can be, but even picking up a phone
is increasingly a part of the complexity of

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.840
negotiation when we have cell phones, when
we have rebel movements in [pause] hard to

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.150
reach locations using the cell phone.
Exploiting the use of the cell phone for example.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.909
How can we use technology most effectively
it foster talk.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.239
A third kind -- area that we've been focusing
on within our council is the importance of

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.819
bringing women into the peace making process.
There are some, but not many involved in the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.019
peace making process.
The UN has been working to promote that and

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.469
we as well are trying to promote the importance
of bringing women into the dialogue process,

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:01.279
into the peacemaking processes.
And finally, this is one that hits me very

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:06.870
close to home. It's the importance of dealing
with emotional and identity based dimensions

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.040
to conflict.
Conflict obviously involves conflict resolution

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.480
which involves many different elements.
And one of the most important when we have

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.610
interstate conflicts and regional conflicts
is how do you deal with these emotional identity

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.720
based issues?
We don't have the skills, we don't have the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.570
tools right now to deal with those complexities.
There are certainly people out there doing

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.320
good work in this realm.
Those in transitional justice, people doing

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.630
work on how to deal with trauma.
But when I look at the situation in Gaza,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.450
it frightens me, and saddens me in so many
ways.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.370
Partially because we don't as a world community
know how effectively to deal with these kinds

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.890
of situations.
And it's imperative to develop new ideas,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.350
new practical ideas to deal with them.
That's part of my work at the Harvard International

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.600
Negotiation Initiative, what we're doing.
In any case YouTube, I know this was a mouthful,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.550
but I look forward to continued conversations
with you on this subject matter.
