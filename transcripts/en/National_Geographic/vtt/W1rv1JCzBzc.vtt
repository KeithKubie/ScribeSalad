00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.333
MICHAEL WARE (VOICEOVER):
In Olympic boxing,

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.867
Cuba is a heavyweight.

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:06.734
The nation's pride often rests
upon success in the ring.

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:08.133
Oh, my god.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.967
MICHAEL WARE (VOICEOVER): And
few have known as much success

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.100
as the man who has
just walked in.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.700
What an honor to meet me.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.533
Ah.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.300
[laughs]

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.967
MICHAEL WARE (VOICEOVER): Felix
Savon is a living legend, one

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:21.667
of the world's greatest
amateur boxers,

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.967
three-time Olympic
gold medalist,

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:26.367
six-time world champion.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:29.934
But Savon has been more than
just a champion in the ring.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:33.633
He has been the face of
Fidel Castro's revolution.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.100
Time and time again, he rejected
multimillion dollar offers

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.767
to turn professional.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.066
It said he'd turned down $25
million to fight Mike Tyson.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.800
And he did it, he says,
because he believes

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.700
that much in the revolution.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.734
I know I'm supposed to be a
journalist here and objective,

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:52.567
but I'm such a fan.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.700
Yes, I was there.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.200
It was a great victory.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.233
Tell the champ I don't
know if he drinks or not,

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.100
but I'd like to have a
little drink with him.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.000
[speaking spanish]

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.834
Si.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.900
All right, let's go.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.000
[speaking spanish]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.834
MICHAEL WARE: Please, Champ.

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:17.266
Salud.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.600
Ah, y victoria.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.266
And victory.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.667
To victory.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.300
Why didn't you take the
money and go professional?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.767
[speaking spanish]

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:31.133
[speaking spanish]

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.033
Really?

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:49.533
[speaking spanish]

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:50.600
Ah, si.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.734
Really?

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:54.867
[speaking spanish]

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:55.700
A hut.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.600
A hut.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.667
A hut is better.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:58.400
Uh-huh.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.633
What?

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:03.367
-Yeah.
-No.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:04.400
That's what he said.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.333
Yeah.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.900
He went from a
hut with a candle

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.100
to being the face of his nation
and the face of a revolution.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.500
INTERPRETER: Yes, sir.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.967
Did that help shape his
view of the revolution?

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:18.667
[speaking spanish]

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:23.400
[speaking spanish]

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:29.600
[speaking spanish]

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400
Ta.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.033
Yeah?

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.033
Wow.

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:45.600
[speaking spanish]

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.266
So he was the front line of
the revolution with his fists.

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.834
[speaking spanish]

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:57.900
Yeah?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.133
[speaking spanish]

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.633
[speaking spanish]

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:06.266
Yeah.

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.166
[speaking spanish]

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:17.367
Right.

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:18.433
So there'll be an evolution.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.100
MICHAEL WARE
(VOICEOVER): Felix Savon

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
is a face of the revolution,
a nationalist, and a loyalist.
