&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.820
&gt;&gt; Abby Nolan: I am thrilled

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.050
to introduce Kate Beaton whose
web comic Hark A Vagrant began

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.830
about 2 -- 10 years ago sorry
and is widely adored by those

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.320
who love history, literature
and silliness.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.780
They have been collected
in best-selling volume

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.230
and rightly praised by NPR
as smart, charming and weird.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.290
She has recently turned her
attention to children's books.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.860
Last year was the Princess
and the Pony,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.210
which told of how Princess
Pinecone brought

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.020
out the cuddly side of
a bunch of warriors.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.540
Her new book is King Baby.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.580
This baby is loved,
adored and catered to,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.770
but spoiler alert it looks
like he will have to hand

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.830
over his crown to Queen Baby.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.890
Kate Beaton will be
signing books at 1 p.m.,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640
but before she talks I wanted

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.210 position:56%
to give her this special braille
edition from the Library of Congress

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.390
of the Princess and the Pony.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.510
And please help me welcome her all
the way from Canada Kate Beaton.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.310
[ Applause ]

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.900
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Oh my God,
this is so exciting I was --

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.190 position:56%
she was holding it and I was
wondering what it was, so beautiful.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.610
Oh and it feels amazing,
that's lovely.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.980
Thank you so much.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.740 position:56%
Yes, hi my name's Kate, I came all
the way from Canada to see you guys.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.930
I hugged my polar bear
goodbye and got in the plane.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.930
And let me see now we've
got a lot of adults here.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.850
Can I see how many kids are in the
audience, can I get some hands up?

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.430
Some kids, all right some
kids yes, perfect, perfect.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.420
Well you guys we're going to
read King Baby and I need --

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.240 position:56%
when we read King Baby and I'm sorry
there's too many adults here you're

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.540
going to have to help out.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.210
I need kids especially, but
I need a few adults here.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.940
We have to put on our
best king voice

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.570 position:56%
because King Baby narrates the book.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.700
And in the very beginning
and the very end you have

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.870
to shout out with me the lines.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.840
The last line is a surprise,
the first line is I am King Baby

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.870
and you have to say it like
you're the most regal person

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.170
that ever lived.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.470
Are you ready?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.170
I am King Baby.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.920
&gt;&gt; I am King Baby.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.160
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: That's it, you
guys sound like amazing kings.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.140
So that's where we're
going to start off.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.880
I am King Baby.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.310
&gt;&gt; I am King Baby.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.710
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Yes, come
you have been waiting

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.390 position:56%
for me I will give you many
blessings for King Baby is generous.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.640
You will have smiles
and laughs and kisses.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.930
You will have wiggles
and gurgles and coos.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.120
But King Baby looks like he's
getting a little tired there

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.420
in the corner.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.450
You know what happens
when babies get tired?

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.650
Oh-oh, but your king also has
many demands feed me, burp me,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.300
change me, bounce me, carry me.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.910
It's good to be the king.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.550
That is a direct copy of
my sister's living room,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.430
including all of their stuff.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.040
Now bring me the thing.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.340
What is King Baby really saying?

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.150
Oh honey, he wants his toy.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.450
Oh but there are two toys.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.060
Here you go champ.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.670
Not this thing the other thing,
bring me the other thing.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.310
Oh is my little baby
a cranky pants today?

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.080
These subjects are fools.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.100
King Baby must be do
something bold and new.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.670
King Baby will get
the thing himself.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.470
Yes, King Baby can do it.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.880
King Baby will get the thing.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.020
Nothing will stop King Baby.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.050
Oh he's getting there.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.610
Oh honey, look he's crawling.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.300
Crawling of course, but why stop

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.560
at crawling King Baby will
walk and talk and more.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.490
Yes, his future is glory for King
Baby is no longer a baby he must

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.970
become a big boy.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.380
But what of these poor subjects
who are they without a king

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.340
and who will lead them if not I.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.330
We've got big new.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.670
Are you ready this is where
I need your help again?

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.100
I am Queen Baby.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.000
&gt;&gt; I am Queen Baby.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.010
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Yes,
that's King Baby.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.670
He's a little tyrant,
but we love him.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.840
I dedicated that book to my
nephew Malcolm who came in

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.090
and he was our King Baby and
everything that he did was amazing,

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.390
he's just a regular baby.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.490
He's like fine, but we were
like he's a genius and like look

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.050
at the way he looks at
you he knows things.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.570
He can say my name almost and I'm
just like Malcolm just, you know,

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.670
he'll be like di-di
[phonetic], oh it's close enough.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.380
He's clearly Einstein.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.650
You know, so I thought it
was funny to think of a book

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.680
where a baby actually had
its own internal monologue

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.400
because we're always trying
to figure what they say.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.710
We're always like what's
he trying to --

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.090
what's he thinking,
what's he trying to say.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.820
And my mom was really
bad for it she was

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.480
like Malcolm is thinking
this for sure.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.400
I'm like Malcolm doesn't even know

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.060
like his two hands
are different things.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.790
But it's nice that we like ascribe
these like giant personalities

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.270
to people who haven't even
figured things out yet.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.780
So King Baby is a little tyrant.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.020 position:56%
Now what I'd like to do after I
read the books because we have a lot

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.410
of fun reading books is -- oh
there's goes somebody, goodbye.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.490
Running. I'd like to draw together.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.570
I think you guys were
drawing with Brendan,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.870
were you guys here
with Brendan as well?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.440
That was a lot of fun and I'd
like to do the same thing.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.740
So I'm going to pull this back.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.970
I'm going to tell -- do any kids
want to come up on the stage

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.270
and we could draw together?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.910
Oh please come up, there's
lots of room up here.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.240
And I'm going to need your guys'
suggestions, please come up.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.380
Anybody, anybody who likes to.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.220
On the stage is all
right depending on --

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.850
unless there's like a capacity
issue, unless we're all going

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.070
to like sink the boat which I
don't think we're going to do.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.230
I'm going to pull this
back, so we're all going to.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.530
Hey you guys.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.830
Oh my God, what an
awesome bunch of kids.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.070
Oh my God, I was so worried
I saw a lot of adults,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.820
but all the kids were just
hiding because they're small.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.300
Okay, we're going to draw
some things together.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.470
Do you guys want to learn
how to draw King Baby?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.770
It's pretty easy.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.200
I think you guys -- if you go home
after this you're going to nail it

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.530
because King Baby is
pretty easy to draw,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.970
so that'll be our first drawing

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.060
if I can figure this marker
our which is childproof.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.250
I'll pull it back even more
so that you can all see.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.780
Okay, hello you've
got a festival map.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.070
All right, so King
Baby is very easy.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.370
What shape is King Baby?

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.220
He's basically an oval,
he looks like an egg.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.510
So King Baby here we go
here's an egg, an egg shape.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.130
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:47.460
Yes, just like you know a person
without arms and legs or a body.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.840
Do you know why I don't draw arms
and legs on King Baby at first

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.000
because he's all wrapped up,
he's wrapped up in a blanket

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.630
or in his clothes or
in a sleepy sack.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.670
So then I draw a line across here.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.720
So we know where King Baby's
body stops and his head starts.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.520
And then I draw two little eyes,
one dot eye and one dot eye.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.010
Now how do babies let us
know when they're happy?

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.230
They're laughing and what
about when they're sad?

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.530
&gt;&gt; They cry.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.830
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: They're crying.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.000
Babies' emotions are
pretty black-and-white.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.930
So what should we draw King Baby --

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.450
is he happy, sad, crying,
what is it?

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.750 position:56%
What do you think what do you think?

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.050
&gt;&gt; Crying.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.350
&gt;&gt; Happy.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.650
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Happy, happy.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.950
Not many people pick sad,
which is totally fine.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.410
It might be weird, do I really
want to draw a sad baby.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:44.070
So I draw two big fat cheeks
and a big laughing mouth

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.370
and babies don't have teeth right,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.600
so I just draw a big
tongue in there like that.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.020
So that's pretty good,
that's exactly a baby

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.320
that looks like -- what's that?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.240
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.650
Yeah, oh I could give
him top teeth baby do --

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.970
okay we'll give him
one big old tooth.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.390
Because it's our drawing
and we can do what we want.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.910
And then I give King Baby
a crown and that's easy,

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.980
it's just three points,
one, two, three.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.230
That's basically he looks like
an old man with his one tooth.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.800
He looks kind of like my dad.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.710
And then I draw a little something
on the clothes just to make it,

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.640
you know, we got a baby going
on here and not just an egg.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.650
And then because he's so fancy
and regal I draw big shiny lines

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.820
because he's like a sun,
he's like the sun king

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.440
like Louis the 14th but a baby.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.660
I love that you guys love the Louis
the 14th jokes I was [inaudible].

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.300
So that's easy you guys can do
that when you go home right,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.430
maybe we should draw something
a bit more complicated.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.670
Did you guys read the
Princess and the Pony?

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.030
Whoa you did, somebody did.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.570
Well if you didn't make sure that
you find it at the library --

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.750
no you don't have to make sure
you read what you want to read.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.720
But in the Princess and the Pony I
got to design all kinds of warriors

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.130
and that was a really fun
part of making that book.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.310
And when we design a character we
have to figure out all the things.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.220
What they're wearing from
their head to their toes

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.480
and it tells us a lot
about who they are.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.380
So if you're designing
a character that's

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.020
like a warrior say first we have

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.720
to decide is this a boy
warrior or a girl warrior.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.200
What do you guys think?

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.500
&gt;&gt; Girl.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.800
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Well yeah, let's go

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.100
with someone who hasn't
answered yet.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.400
What about over here.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.700
&gt;&gt; A girl.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.000
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: A girl, a girl
okay, it's a girl, it's a girl.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.070
And so I'm going to give her --

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.350
there's her face and
eyes always have

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.180
to be looking at something right.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.260
Unless they're looking
in different directions

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.180
and then you know something
is wrong.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.470
And then I give her tough
eyebrows, tough eyebrows

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.880
because she's a tough warrior.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.910
And a real toothy smile all right.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.210
So there we go.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.760
Now what kind of -- so we got

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.440
to choose all the way
from head to the feet.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.740
What kind of hat?

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.430
&gt;&gt; A girl hat.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.200
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: A girl hat.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.500
That sounds good.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.070
Well actually you know you have
a really nice bow in your hair.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.370
&gt;&gt; With like a flower.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.810
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: With a
flower on it amazing.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.110
Okay, this warrior is looking --

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:09.960
okay this warrior has got a
flower and a bow in her hair.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.450
It's all right, warriors can
basically wear whatever they want.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.260
So that's good, so she's
got a flower and a bow.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.010

hair does she have?

whatever I am doing at the

that I liked doing it a lot.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:15.190 position:56%
So I was always writing comics and
writing stories and drawing pictures

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.760
and eventually Scholastic showed up
at my doorstep and said would you

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.720
like draw a picture book, so
I said yes of course I would.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.020
But there are a lots of different
ways that you can become an author,

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.830

do is to practice all the time.

She says I can draw better than

of people that can draw a lot
better than me and that's a fact.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.680
But you know what there
is some things --

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.830
here's my advice to
you about drawing.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.130
There are some things
that I was really good

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.430
at drawing when I was your age.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.050
I was really good at drawing cats,
I was very bad at drawing cars.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:35.550
I'll answer this -- I'll
keep telling my story

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.830
and then I will totally
listen to your question.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.760 position:56%
So I was good drawing at some things
and bad drawing at other things

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.680
and they used to make me a
little bit sad because I wanted

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.980
to be good at everything.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.500
I didn't really, you know, it
sucks to be bad at something.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.730
But then I realized after
a while that I don't mind

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.360
that I'm not very good
at drawing cars,

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.900
I'm still not very
good at drawing cars.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.220
But I do draw picture
books and I get

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.890
to draw all the pictures
that I want.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.150 position:56%
So I just focus on the things that I
like to draw and that make me happy

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:04.070
and I don't worry about the
things that I find more difficult

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.370
or that I don't like to draw.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.240

as long as you're enjoying it.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.170
of if you're doing like
parity history or literature,

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.940
anything that takes
itself too seriously.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.710
Any like overblown figures
who are too powerful

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.300
and were never really
checked in their time.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.790
It's always fun to go back
and just destroy them.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.480
Yes.

The white, the lightning,
the lightning,

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.760
color the lightning in okay.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.580
I'll do that a little
bit we're going to --

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.640
if anybody else wants to
come up to the microphone

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.750
with a question while
I'm doing this.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.050
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.350
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Hello.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.740
&gt;&gt; You write about your family
a lot, especially on your.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.040
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Yes I do.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.340
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Twitter feed.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.890
How do they react to being in
cartoons, do you ever get flack

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.190
like I don't look like
that or I [inaudible]?

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.490
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: They don't mind.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.260
I don't think my parents know how
many twitter followers I have,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.590
which is really handy for me.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.970
But they're aware of it
and they're very proud.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:39.010
They don't really understand what
I do sometimes, but they're very,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.310
very good sports about that.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.610
As long as nobody bothers them

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.350
like at the grocery store
they're totally fine.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.650
Yes.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.950
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.250
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Hello.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.550
&gt;&gt; What's your nephew
thing of King Baby?

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.650
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: My nephew he sat
on it and he bent some of the pages

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.850
and he saw where there was a
picture of a cat and that was --

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.700
he's two, he turned
two yesterday so that's

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.000
about as far as we got with him.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.340
One more question?

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.640
Yes.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.940
&gt;&gt; I love Hark A Vagrant.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.240
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Thank you.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.540
&gt;&gt; And I love how you -- am
I really close to the mic?

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.090
I love how you made some
books that are really sad

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.820
and depressing, hilarious.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.120
My question is.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.420
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: I don't
believe that.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.780
&gt;&gt; Are there any books that you
wanted to draw a comic about

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.580
or figures you want to
draw a character about,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.060
then you just realize that they
made you too sad or [inaudible]?

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.360
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Oh yeah
for sure, for sure.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.170
There's always like people that
you really admire their story

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.270
as a historical figure
or something like that.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.160
But you want to respect
their story as well.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.080
And sometimes, you know, the people

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.930
that we admire the most just
had a really, really hard life

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:45.070
and it's hard to make fun of that,
it's hard to pull something out of

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.000
that that seems disrespectful
of their struggle.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.570
So there have been times, but you
know there's always other heroes

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.870
and villains to put your focus on.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.400
So we only have a few
minutes, thank you.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.700
We only have a few minutes.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.580
You guys thank you so much
you were really wonderful.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.880
Are we happy with our drawing?

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.780
Is there any one last, is
there like a [inaudible]?

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.140
So what do you think,
what do you guys think?

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.380 position:56%
A kiss, oh that was just what I did.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.680
Yes.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.350
&gt;&gt; I think you should
put [inaudible] socks.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.650
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Some socks.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.950
Hey, that's a great idea.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.470
Cool and then we'll make
them orange so that we.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:28.090
That's very fashion forward
the socks coming out like that.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.390
Yes okay.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.210
&gt;&gt; Maybe you should
color [inaudible].

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:32.730
&gt;&gt; Maybe I should color in her bow.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.680
You guys you just out stuff
while we have a few more --

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.010
we got about one minute,
one hot minute.

[Inaudible] color?

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.550
&gt;&gt; Color that part in.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.850
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Okay,
I will color this part

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.880
in that was very frustrating
for you with OCD.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.610
&gt;&gt; Hi, I have a question for you.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:50.910
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Yes, go ahead.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.120
&gt;&gt; If you can talk.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.420
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Go ahead.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.090
&gt;&gt; So you've obviously just
accomplished King Baby,

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.790
which was a fantastic book and.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.090
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Thank you yes.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.390
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what's next?

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.690
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: What's next?

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.990
&gt;&gt; If you can even think
about what's next for you.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.360
&gt;&gt; Kate Beaton: Right now I'd
love to do another kids' book

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.660
and I'd love to do a book

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.020
where someone else wrote
and I drew the pictures.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.320
But I mean we'll see.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.140

about working

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.100
in an oil sands working
camp right now.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.400

to love that one.

we're all done here.
