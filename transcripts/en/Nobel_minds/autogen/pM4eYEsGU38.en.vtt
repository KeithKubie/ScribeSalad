00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490
deepest now so what David simply said
 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.490
deepest now so what David simply said
was it's very simple let's think about

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500
was it's very simple let's think about
 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.140
was it's very simple let's think about
the system and imagine there's some my

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150
the system and imagine there's some my
 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.240
the system and imagine there's some my
age it's a low temperatures as

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250
age it's a low temperatures as
 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.840
age it's a low temperatures as
magnetized and let's assume some some

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850
magnetized and let's assume some some
 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.490
magnetized and let's assume some some
magnetization talking to a Ferro magnet

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500
magnetization talking to a Ferro magnet
 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.800
magnetization talking to a Ferro magnet
so it's simple no anti ferromagnetic no

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810
so it's simple no anti ferromagnetic no
 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.120
so it's simple no anti ferromagnetic no
difficulties and oh by the way I should

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130
difficulties and oh by the way I should
 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.940
difficulties and oh by the way I should
mention that I am talking in purely

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950
mention that I am talking in purely
 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.640
mention that I am talking in purely
classical but for purely about purely

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650
classical but for purely about purely
 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.529
classical but for purely about purely
classical systems and the reason for

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539
classical systems and the reason for
 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.520
classical systems and the reason for
this is that

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530
this is that
 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.950
this is that
at the time when I got interested in

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960
at the time when I got interested in
 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.670
at the time when I got interested in
condensed matter

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680

I knew essentially nothing about the

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990
I knew essentially nothing about the
 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.320
I knew essentially nothing about the
subject and to me

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330
subject and to me
 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.990
subject and to me
quantum mechanics just an unnecessary

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000
quantum mechanics just an unnecessary
 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.850
quantum mechanics just an unnecessary
complication which only half understood

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
complication which only half understood
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.300
complication which only half understood
anyway so everything I I'm going to talk

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310
anyway so everything I I'm going to talk
 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.370
anyway so everything I I'm going to talk
about from now on is purely classical so

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380
about from now on is purely classical so
 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.280
about from now on is purely classical so
then so to come back to the problem

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290
then so to come back to the problem
 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.770
then so to come back to the problem

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:39.560
frequency now as you all should know the
 

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.290
frequency now as you all should know the
resonant frequency of some vibrating

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:44.300
resonant frequency of some vibrating
 

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.930

object it's inversely proportional to

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:46.940
object it's inversely proportional to
 

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.890
object it's inversely proportional to
the map mass because the mass increases

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:50.900
the map mass because the mass increases
 

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.740
the map mass because the mass increases
the arresting frequency decreases that's

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:53.750
the arresting frequency decreases that's
 

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.450
the arresting frequency decreases that's
all you really need to know at this

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:55.460
all you really need to know at this
 

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.900
all you really need to know at this
stage and so they did a set of

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:58.910
stage and so they did a set of
 

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:05.560
stage and so they did a set of
experiments and the the dots are the

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:05.570
experiments and the the dots are the
 

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.530
experiments and the the dots are the
experimental results the straight line

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:08.540
experimental results the straight line
 

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:15.840
experimental results the straight line
is what you expect assuming that all the

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:15.850
is what you expect assuming that all the
 

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.730
is what you expect assuming that all the
absorbed helium sticks to the surface

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:18.740
absorbed helium sticks to the surface
 

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.940
absorbed helium sticks to the surface
because the the film is so thin that any

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:21.950
because the the film is so thin that any
 

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.370
because the the film is so thin that any
atom of healing that gets absorbed in

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:24.380
atom of healing that gets absorbed in
 

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.840
atom of healing that gets absorbed in
the surface of the of the of the crystal

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:27.850
the surface of the of the of the crystal
 

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.390
the surface of the of the of the crystal
assuming that it's a normal forms a

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400
assuming that it's a normal forms a
 

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.280
assuming that it's a normal forms a
normal fluid like water or something

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:33.290
normal fluid like water or something
 

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.410
normal fluid like water or something
that would as the crystal moves

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:35.420
that would as the crystal moves
 

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.060
that would as the crystal moves
backwards or forwards the molecule

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.070
backwards or forwards the molecule
 

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.010
backwards or forwards the molecule
absorb more ghosts also move backwards

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.020
absorb more ghosts also move backwards
 

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.770
absorb more ghosts also move backwards
and forwards and that will increase the

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:40.780
and forwards and that will increase the
 

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.790
and forwards and that will increase the
the mass of the oscillating object and

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:44.800
the mass of the oscillating object and
 

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.970
the mass of the oscillating object and
so one would expect that as you increase

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:47.980
so one would expect that as you increase
 

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.340
so one would expect that as you increase
put more and more fluid on and the

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:51.350
put more and more fluid on and the
 

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.090
put more and more fluid on and the

so the initial data when the first few

helium suddenly stops doesn't contribute

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640
helium suddenly stops doesn't contribute
 

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:49.750
helium suddenly stops doesn't contribute
to the resonant frequency and so one can

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760
to the resonant frequency and so one can
 

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.410
to the resonant frequency and so one can
argue that the deviation of difference

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:53.420
argue that the deviation of difference
 

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.660

because the interpretation of this

00:25:16.229 --> 00:25:16.239
because the interpretation of this
 

00:25:16.239 --> 00:25:17.940
because the interpretation of this

so here is a situation where there's

so here is a situation where there's
 

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.109
so here is a situation where there's
clearly a phase transition but there's a

00:25:40.109 --> 00:25:40.119

rigorous theorem also says okay
there's no long-range order so the

00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:47.109
there's no long-range order so the
 

00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:49.409
there's no long-range order so the

problem that we were then faced with is
 

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:53.720
problem that we were then faced with is

it's obvious there's a phase transition

it's obvious there's a phase transition
that's one that's experimental side the

that's one that's experimental side the

that's one that's experimental side the
theoretical side said there's no

one can come to is that

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840
one can come to is that
 

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.670
one can come to is that
the the the theorem is correct but it's

the the the theorem is correct but it's

so what I you know I didn't know about
these rigorous theorems and so on but it

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400
these rigorous theorems and so on but it
 

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.980
these rigorous theorems and so on but it
looked like an interesting problem to

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:03.990
looked like an interesting problem to
 

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:10.940
looked like an interesting problem to
work on so I thought okay why not so we

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:10.950
work on so I thought okay why not so we
 

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.540
work on so I thought okay why not so we
started looking at it now this slide

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:14.550
started looking at it now this slide
 

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.880
started looking at it now this slide
sorry it looks so busy but I thought

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:19.890
sorry it looks so busy but I thought
 

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.980
sorry it looks so busy but I thought
that I would redraw this thing to make

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:21.990
that I would redraw this thing to make
 

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.450
that I would redraw this thing to make
to make it less busy and but of course

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460
to make it less busy and but of course
 

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:34.180
to make it less busy and but of course

overly busy slide now so what do we know

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:53.370
overly busy slide now so what do we know
 

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.280
overly busy slide now so what do we know
about what what's the situation

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:55.290
about what what's the situation
 

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.790
about what what's the situation
first thing as you can we're talking

00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:58.800
first thing as you can we're talking
 

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.160
first thing as you can we're talking
about superfluid helium or if you like

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:03.170
about superfluid helium or if you like
 

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.440
about superfluid helium or if you like

model where let's say assume that this
 

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.720
model where let's say assume that this
length of the spin is fixed so the spin

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:11.730
length of the spin is fixed so the spin
 

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.880
length of the spin is fixed so the spin

this whole system is invariant under the
phase shifted by any multiple of 2pi so

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840
phase shifted by any multiple of 2pi so
 

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.570

therefore we can say that the the global

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:52.580
therefore we can say that the the global
 

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.390
therefore we can say that the the global

called topological excitations are what

00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520
called topological excitations are what
 

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.610
called topological excitations are what
are called vortices and this is just a

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620
are called vortices and this is just a
 

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.390
are called vortices and this is just a
spin configuration where if you walk

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400

around a contour some closed contour

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120
around a contour some closed contour
 

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.900
around a contour some closed contour
then the change in the phase as you go

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:11.910
then the change in the phase as you go
 

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.180
then the change in the phase as you go
around this closed contour is a multiple

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:14.190
around this closed contour is a multiple
 

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.460
around this closed contour is a multiple
of 2pi and of course has to be a

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:16.470
of 2pi and of course has to be a
 

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.300
of 2pi and of course has to be a
multiple of 2pi because the order

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:20.310
multiple of 2pi because the order
 

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.330
multiple of 2pi because the order
parameter itself has to be the same when

you come you know if you start somewhere

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:25.410
you come you know if you start somewhere
 

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.250

go around and come back the system had

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260
go around and come back the system had
 

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.990
go around and come back the system had
better be the same thing that you

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000
better be the same thing that you
 

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.310
better be the same thing that you
started with and so this phase this

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320
started with and so this phase this
 

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.670
started with and so this phase this
order parameter which I write as

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:36.680
order parameter which I write as
 

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.430
order parameter which I write as
amplitude times e to the I theta that

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440
amplitude times e to the I theta that
 

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.980
amplitude times e to the I theta that
has to be single valued and so therefore

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:44.990
has to be single valued and so therefore
 

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.920
has to be single valued and so therefore
the change of phases go around the

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:48.930
the change of phases go around the
 

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.040
the change of phases go around the
contour come back to where you started

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:51.050
contour come back to where you started
 

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.900
contour come back to where you started

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:04.100
 
however if the change of phase as you go

well it's very big it's very simple we
say that okay we have got a vortex with

what we've done this we've walked round

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:00.350
what we've done this we've walked round
 

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:11.980
what we've done this we've walked round
a we walked round a vortex say we've

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:11.990
a we walked round a vortex say we've
 

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.370
a we walked round a vortex say we've
gone round say clockwise and we are

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:15.380
gone round say clockwise and we are
 

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.560
gone round say clockwise and we are
changing the face by two five when we

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:17.570

walk around walk around the psalm some

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:20.930
walk around walk around the psalm some
 

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.510
walk around walk around the psalm some
point in the middle and then we can say

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:22.520
point in the middle and then we can say
 

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.760
point in the middle and then we can say
the point in the middle with a blue blob

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:24.770
the point in the middle with a blue blob
 

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:29.800
the point in the middle with a blue blob
in the middle is a is the corner of the

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:29.810
in the middle is a is the corner of the
 

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.160
in the middle is a is the corner of the
vortex and so what happens in the vortex

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:33.170
vortex and so what happens in the vortex
 

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.460
vortex and so what happens in the vortex
core is let's say the magnitude of the

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:36.470
core is let's say the magnitude of the
 

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:40.120
core is let's say the magnitude of the
order parameter or the just as either

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:40.130
order parameter or the just as either
 

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.490

you know it's just zero so in other

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:42.500
you know it's just zero so in other
 

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.780
you know it's just zero so in other
words that's if you like it's a hole

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:43.790
words that's if you like it's a hole
 

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.930
words that's if you like it's a hole
it's like a topologically it's like like

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:46.940
it's like a topologically it's like like
 

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.730
it's like a topologically it's like like
a hole in in in the surface so of course

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:50.740
a hole in in in the surface so of course
 

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.070
a hole in in in the surface so of course
one can have a contour running around a

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080
one can have a contour running around a
 

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.890
one can have a contour running around a
hole where the phase change can be two

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:56.900
hole where the phase change can be two
 

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:02.680
hole where the phase change can be two

when go back okay now let's go back a

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480
when go back okay now let's go back a
 

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.540
when go back okay now let's go back a
little bit ask what's the what are the

00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640
the logarithm of the number of possible
 

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.990

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.090
positions of the vortex the vortex core
and of course the number of possible

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100
and of course the number of possible
 

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.550
and of course the number of possible
positions is just the total area of the

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:10.560

cord because that's the number of

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360
cord because that's the number of
 

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.270
cord because that's the number of
possible places you can put the vortex

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:17.280
possible places you can put the vortex
 

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:23.990
possible places you can put the vortex
and so we you then get that the free

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000
and so we you then get that the free
 

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.560

energy is e minus temperature times the

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:30.570

so again you get this logarithm the

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460
so again you get this logarithm the
 

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.420

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440
the central quantity in statistical
 

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.140
the central quantity in statistical
mechanics is the free energy so the

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:54.150
mechanics is the free energy so the
 

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.270

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.100
associate of free energy is just a minus
temperature the entropy so there's your

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:58.110
temperature the entropy so there's your
 

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.620
temperature the entropy so there's your
two formulas for the entry energy and

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:00.630
two formulas for the entry energy and
 

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.370
two formulas for the entry energy and
the entropy you just plug that in and

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:03.380
the entropy you just plug that in and
 

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.660
the entropy you just plug that in and
then you can say the probability of such

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:08.670
then you can say the probability of such
 

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.330
then you can say the probability of such

mechanics again so I assume you have to

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.010

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.550

know some of our mechanics and it's just

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.610

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.290
temperature eat the minus beta F and you
have a formula for the free energy and

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.300
have a formula for the free energy and
 

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.590
have a formula for the free energy and
so the probability of a vortex is the

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:36.600
so the probability of a vortex is the
 

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600
so the probability of a vortex is the

if it can be dissipated it's a normal

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440
if it can be dissipated it's a normal

this of dissipating the super fluid flow

this of dissipating the super fluid flow
is to create a vortex an t vortex pair

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:09.500
is to create a vortex an t vortex pair
 

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.570
is to create a vortex an t vortex pair
and see if they just simply drift

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:13.580
and see if they just simply drift
 

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.280
and see if they just simply drift
further and further apart and if we can

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.290
further and further apart and if we can
 

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.250
further and further apart and if we can
get infinitely far apart if you like

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:18.260

they go to the system edges and

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.350
they go to the system edges and
 

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.830
they go to the system edges and
disappear poof and in this process they

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:23.840
disappear poof and in this process they
 

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.040
disappear poof and in this process they
will unwind the face and and reduce the

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.050
will unwind the face and and reduce the
 

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:31.930
will unwind the face and and reduce the
super fluid velocity slightly

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:31.940
 
 

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.789
 
so this is the central question now if

00:39:35.789 --> 00:39:35.799
so this is the central question now if
 

00:39:35.799 --> 00:39:39.359
so this is the central question now if
you're at high temperatures these

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:39.369
you're at high temperatures these
 

00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:43.829
you're at high temperatures these
vortices can be produced

00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839

you know appear spontaneously and in
large numbers so this process will

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:51.500
large numbers so this process will
 

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:55.089
large numbers so this process will
easily occur because this super fluid

00:39:55.089 --> 00:39:55.099
easily occur because this super fluid
 

00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:59.069
easily occur because this super fluid
flow would simply cause the vortices to

00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079
flow would simply cause the vortices to
 

00:39:59.079 --> 00:40:02.230
flow would simply cause the vortices to
disappear to the sides and the super

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240
disappear to the sides and the super
 

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.950
disappear to the sides and the super
fluid velocity will go to zero all right

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960
fluid velocity will go to zero all right
 

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.870
fluid velocity will go to zero all right
so what does this mean this means that

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880
so what does this mean this means that
 

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.730
so what does this mean this means that
the fluid is normal because remember

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:11.740
the fluid is normal because remember
 

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.049
the fluid is normal because remember

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.590
a Coulomb interaction between charges so
one could guard the vortices as a set of

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:41.600
one could guard the vortices as a set of
 

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.960
one could guard the vortices as a set of
point charges interacting with the

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:43.970
point charges interacting with the
 

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:47.620
point charges interacting with the
Coulomb interaction and so then of

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:47.630
Coulomb interaction and so then of
 

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.090
Coulomb interaction and so then of
course once you've got this you

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.100
course once you've got this you
 

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.400
course once you've got this you
immediately think ah

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.410
immediately think ah
 

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:55.360
immediately think ah
dielectric functions etc etc etc and so

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:55.370
dielectric functions etc etc etc and so
 

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.060
dielectric functions etc etc etc and so
one could think of the system in terms

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.070
one could think of the system in terms
 

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.970
one could think of the system in terms
of an electrostatic theory and this is

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:00.980
of an electrostatic theory and this is
 

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.070
of an electrostatic theory and this is
basically what Dave and I did at least

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:03.080
basically what Dave and I did at least
 

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.930

back in 1972-73 and that paper is
 

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.690

probably the most cited paper either

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:16.700
probably the most cited paper either
 

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:23.560

either of us have ever written and it is
 

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:28.080
either of us have ever written and it is
basically a correct but in our

basically a correct but in our
 

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:32.130
basically a correct but in our
calculations we unfortunately made an

and pointed out the error that we we had

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:00.650
and pointed out the error that we we had
 

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:10.950
and pointed out the error that we we had
made but also I was bothered about the

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960
made but also I was bothered about the
 

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.539
made but also I was bothered about the
results of our calculation because the

00:44:13.539 --> 00:44:13.549
results of our calculation because the
 

00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:16.120
results of our calculation because the
results didn't look right let me just I

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.130
results didn't look right let me just I
 

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:18.730
results didn't look right let me just I
had a bad feeling about them so I

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:18.740
had a bad feeling about them so I
 

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.039
had a bad feeling about them so I
thought okay maybe I should try to do a

00:44:21.039 --> 00:44:21.049
thought okay maybe I should try to do a
 

00:44:21.049 --> 00:44:26.319
thought okay maybe I should try to do a
proper calculation here and use this

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:26.329
proper calculation here and use this
 

00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:28.930
proper calculation here and use this

what this this for this calculation says
 

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:31.059
what this this for this calculation says
is that it actually makes some

interesting about this little curve this
little diagram is that the the

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400
little diagram is that the the
 

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.440
little diagram is that the the
theoretical curve is that straight line

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:53.450
theoretical curve is that straight line
 

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:57.819

experiment the various dots are
 

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.569
experiment the various dots are
experiments and according to Mike John

00:46:04.569 --> 00:46:04.579
experiments and according to Mike John
 

00:46:04.579 --> 00:46:08.740
experiments and according to Mike John
Rafi apparently the dots were all

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:08.750
Rafi apparently the dots were all
 

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:12.060
Rafi apparently the dots were all
plotted before the without knowledge

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:12.070
plotted before the without knowledge
 

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:15.300
plotted before the without knowledge
of the theory and then when the when

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:15.310
of the theory and then when the when
 

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:17.010
of the theory and then when the when
they learned about the theory just put

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:17.020
they learned about the theory just put
 

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.140
they learned about the theory just put
the straight line in and to the great

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:19.150
the straight line in and to the great
 

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.540
the straight line in and to the great
astonishment it went basically right

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:21.550
astonishment it went basically right
 

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:25.320
astonishment it went basically right
through the the the experimental dots

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.330
through the the the experimental dots
 

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:30.870
through the the the experimental dots
and so one could guard this as excellent

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880
and so one could guard this as excellent
 

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.510
and so one could guard this as excellent
confirmation of of the of the theory so

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520
confirmation of of the of the theory so
 

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.550
confirmation of of the of the theory so
and this is basically the reason why our

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560
and this is basically the reason why our
 

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.060
and this is basically the reason why our
theory has become quite well-known which

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.070
theory has become quite well-known which
 

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:48.780
theory has become quite well-known which
actually works and has been measured and

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:48.790
actually works and has been measured and
 

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.480
actually works and has been measured and
verified in many systems none of course

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:51.490
