[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.170
SPEAKER: So you
recently published

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.125
a book titled "Trust."

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.500
Usually-- oh, there, at this
point, you hold it up, and--

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.654
available on Amazon, I'm sure.

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:17.320
"Twenty Ways to Build
a Better Country."

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.100
Of all the things you could
pick to focus on, why trust?

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.400
DAVID JOHNSTON:
Well, the book is

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.320
dedicated to children who
offer their trust instinctively

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.300
and with full
expectation of fairness.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.070
It's interesting, the children.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.230
We have five daughters
and 14 grandchildren.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.582
And I say, all the
important things in life,

00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:39.790
I've learned from my children
and I'm now re-learning

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.820
from my grandchildren.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.820
And it sounds like it's jest.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.100
It really isn't jest.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.740
When you see the world through
the lens of your children

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.720
and grandchildren, it gives
you a different perspective,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.640
including a long-term
perspective.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.880
The reason we wrote the
"Trust" book, Steve,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.530
is a bit of a history.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.490
When I was installed as governor
general in October 2010,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.990
the title of my
installation address

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.150
was, "A smart and
caring nation, a call

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.760
to service" with three pillars.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.140
Family and Children.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.610
Learning and Innovation.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.590
Philanthropy and Volunteerism.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.070
And we began to pursue
projects, outreach activities

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.890
using the office of the governor
general for that purpose

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.620
and established the Rideau
Hall Foundation in 2012

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.170
to be the institutional
focus of those activities.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.490
And I then concluded that
there is no power in the job,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.320
but you do have a platform.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.200
And you're trying to
reinforce fundamental values

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.550
of Canadians.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.670
And so we tried to
use the office, then,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.710
as a bit of a bully pulpit.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.630
And I began writing
a little differently.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.379
I'm a law professor,
so I've written

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:48.670
a whole lot of law books that
are very dull and boring,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.520
and a page of them will put
you to sleep at night if you

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.870
have difficulty sleeping.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.460
But I began to write books.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.040
And the first one was called,
"The Idea of Canada, Letters

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.650
to a Nation."

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.470
I'm a morning letter writer.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.910
I'll tell you more about
that if we have time.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.820
But it was people alive--
and some who were deceased--

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.530
that I would be
having conversations

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.780
with about the fundamental
values of the country.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.750
And then Tom Jenkins
and I decided

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.490
that we wanted to put a
spotlight in innovation.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.600
So we had created the governor
general's Innovation Awards

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.700
to celebrate
innovators in Canada.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.000
But we began collecting
stories for a book,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.539
and we thought 50 would be fine.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:27.580
And we quickly got to 50.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.640
We said 150 for our 150th year.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.846
We got to 297.

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:33.220
The publisher
says, that's as far

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.060
as you go in that
size of a book.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.160
So we stopped there.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.550
But we created a website
to post those stories

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.360
and others of innovation,
including social innovation.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.890
And then we did a
children's edition

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.410
of that book, which
we're trying to place

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.970
in every school in the country.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.380
And Amy, who is here with
me, and one of her colleagues

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.380
have been seconded from
the government of Canada

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.550
running the Innovation Program.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.400
In fact, one of the
highlights of that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.090
is Canada Innovation Week, which
is the last 10 days in May.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.410
It'll be the third
one this year.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.396
And with those books, then--

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:07.300
and I come now to
your question--

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.810
I became increasingly concerned
about the erosion of trust,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.740
particularly in our public
institutions, but beyond that,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.940
and decided that I would write
a book, which initially began

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.430
as looking at trust as a social
characteristic of countries,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.110
the rule of law, the
institutions of government,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.310
and so on.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.070
And then I realized
that that really

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.160
sprang from how organizations,
and communities,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.350
and neighborhoods
worked in a country.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.970
And then I realized
that that sprang

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.550
from how each of
us as individuals

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.530
become trustworthy people.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.830
And so out of it has
come 20 characteristics

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.200
that follow that narrative,
beginning with, make

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.850
herself a trustworthy person.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.430
Then the next part of
the narrative of the arc

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.940
is, how you build trustworthy
organizations like the ones you

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.026
serve here at Google,
or your neighborhood,

00:03:57.026 --> 00:03:58.900
or your community, or
your church, et cetera,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.949
and then how you build
a trustworthy country.

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.490
SPEAKER: That's
certainly going to be

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.080
a topic for the next time,
it seems, in our country.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.860
So in your opinion,
how bad is it?

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.190
DAVID JOHNSTON:
Well, I think trust

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.300
as we've known it classically
certainly has seen an erosion.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.170
Trust is kind of a funny word.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.250
It's a very simple concept.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.660
It is reliability.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.560
It's fairness.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.300
It's honesty.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.560
And that's the noun.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.230
And the verb is the willingness
to put your trust in something.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.420
And that's why we began
with that statement

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.620
about children who
instinctively place their trust

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.980
and have an expectation
of fairness.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.130
And I guess, as I
watch the world,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.570
particularly in the
last seven years as GG,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.490
I saw a continual
erosion of that.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.340
Edelman does a survey
worldwide, done for about 10,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.590
20 years now.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.380
And they've marked a steady
deterioration in trust.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.050
And Canada, two years
ago, for the first time

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.060
became a distruster nation.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.930
That is, less than
50% of our population

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.170
trusted their governments, their
nongovernmental organizations,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.010
the media, and,
in fact, business

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.750
to act in trustworthy ways.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.350
The good news for you in this
audience from the Edelman

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.780
survey is that of
those four sectors--

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.870
government, that is,
public institutions,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.520
nongovernmental organizations,
media, and business--

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.660
it's business leaders
who have the highest

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.400
degree of trust of those four.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.620
Used to be the lowest,
it's now the highest.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.490
And I think there's an
expectation in that somewhat

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.240
distrusting populace that
business leaders will

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.816
lead the effort to rebuild
trust in our institutions.

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:52.190
SPEAKER: That's
very interesting.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.630
We obviously talk
about these kind

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.090
of issues and our
relationships all of the time,

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.030
both as a company
and as Canadians,

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.040
largely operating here.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.110
So how do we stabilize this?

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.190
How do we revive trust?

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.780
And how do we get
going as Canadians?

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.280
DAVID JOHNSTON:
Well, I think we try

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.310
to understand why it is eroding
if you accept that it is.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.670
And then very fundamentally, we
live in an age of disruption.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.590
And when you have high
degrees of disruption,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.540
as you read history,
the moorings

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.270
of traditional practices
tend to come loose.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.770
And there's a degree of
uncertainty and uneasiness.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.370
And I think that
three big factors that

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.850
have been so dramatically
changing for us

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.710
would be the technological
disruption that we've seen,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.910
where, in fact,
the pace of changes

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.700
is a trajectory like that.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.700
It's increasing in
acceleration, and our ability

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.710
to adjust to it-- the
human capacity to adjust--

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.830
is operating like that.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.880
So we have that gap
of change coming

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.160
faster than we seem to be able
to manage in traditional ways.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.420
That creates uneasiness.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.810
The second thing, I would say,
is the rising inequalities

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.910
of wealth around the
world, but particularly

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.860
in the developed
societies, where

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.580
you have expectation levels
that are very, very different

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.810
and a sense of despair,
a sense of grievance,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.687
in those populations that
feel left out in that process.

00:07:15.687 --> 00:07:18.020
Then a third thing that I
think has been very disruptive

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.230
for us is, perhaps,
that coming to the end

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.620
of the Western consensus in
international matters that

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.110
prevailed from World War II
on, be it international trade,

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.630
be it peace and
security matters,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.849
be it dealing with conflict--

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:34.640
we have more displaced
persons in the world

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.770
today than we've ever had
with the conflicts, et cetera.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.910
And if you think of
right after World War II,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.790
the Marshall Plan was
the US-led initiative

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.280
to put Germany and Japan
back on their feet.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.290
Rarely in history have
you seen a situation

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.590
where the conqueror would
say, having conquered,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.070
we now will do everything
within our power

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.190
to help you rebuild
a civil society.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.230
World War I ended in
just the opposite way

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.400
and it led to World War II.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.619
Maybe we learned from that.

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:04.910
But out of that became the
International Monetary Fund,

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.030
the Bretton Woods Agreement,
a revived United Nations.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.080
And a consensus on international
trade is a good thing.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.880
Globalization will
be a good thing.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.100
That has been a
factor that's eroded.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.250
So we face that, and
I use the expression--

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.120
it's an 18th
century expression--

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.280
that "trust comes in on foot
and goes out on horseback."

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.890
And Mark Carney
has rephrased it.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.620
"Trust comes in on foot
and goes out in a Ferrari."

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.309
Just think of those metaphors.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:36.650
It is quick to destroy, and
it's slow to build step by step.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.450
But I guess through
the book, Steve,

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.150
we tried to write some of
the prescriptions of how you

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.030
rebuild trust step by step,
be it in your own life,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.940
in your organizations that
you lead, or in a country.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.637
And we can go into those in
some more detail as you want.

00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:55.970
SPEAKER: Well, I'm afraid
there's a lot of analogs there

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.980
that apply to
large corporations.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.230
I was once told when
I came to this company

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.940
it wasn't a large corporation.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.740
And I think that's
true to some extent,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.050
although I think we're
perceived very much as a very

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.110
large organization.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.390
And I think that's fair.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.360
If you had to put yourself in
the seat of an organization

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.480
such as ours, or another,
how do you re-earn--

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.700
earn trust again--
or re-earn trust?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.090
How would you advise the
CEO to form the organization

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.202
and move forward?

00:09:25.202 --> 00:09:26.660
DAVID JOHNSTON:
Well, first of all,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.540
I guess, you have to know who
you are and where you're at.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.372
I was just telling a story
over lunch with your colleagues

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:33.830
that I'll tell
tonight, because I'm

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.930
speaking at a gathering
at the York Club.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.980
And Mike Wilson,
some of you remember,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.890
is a minister of finance, a
guy I admire an awful lot,

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.740
is hosting, and
it'll be on trust.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.160
And Mike was Canada's
ambassador to the United States.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.180
And I said, Mike, we needed
you there in Washington

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.040
in the last year and
renegotiating the Canada/US

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.245
Free Trade Agreement.

00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:56.390
And this story is applicable.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:01.040
Allegedly, it's the transcript
of recorded messages

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.890
that took place off the coast
of Newfoundland several decades

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.850
ago.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.460
And it begins with Voice 1.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.000
Attention, you are heading
towards a collision.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.450
Recommend you alter
course 45 degrees East.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.160
Voice 2.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.650
You are heading
towards a collision.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.000
Recommend you alter
course 45 degrees West.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.970
Voice 1.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.800
In a half a mile at
your current speed,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.470
you will be in a
serious collision.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.930
Change course now.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:36.770
Voice 2.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.460
I am the USS Eisenhower
aircraft carrier of the US Navy

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.580
with 100 planes aboard, with
three destroyers, and four

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.540
cruisers, and about
2,500 military personnel.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.700
You change course now.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.580
Voice 1.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.380
I'm a lighthouse.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.395
Your move.

00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:53.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.240
Who you are and where you're at.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.450
I think if you lead
an organization,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.310
I think you act out
some of these things

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.900
that I've spoken about.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.490
Listen first.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.280
Draw from all of
the organization.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.880
Two, share the plan
as widely as possible.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.650
Give people ownership of it.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.090
Ensure that you are an inclusive
organization, not simply

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.700
a diverse organization, but
an inclusive organization.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.800
Diversity is just a
statement of fact.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.100
You can check the boxes
of what number of females,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.350
what number of males you
have, what visible minorities

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.690
you have, what cultural
groups you have.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.790
That's just a statistic.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.190
Inclusivity, of
course, is an action.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.400
And in the Deloitte study
on diversity inclusion,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.190
they call a paper "From
Optics to Outcomes."

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.620
How do you move from optics--

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.290
checking the boxes-- to
outcomes inclusivity,

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.660
where people actually are
engaged with one another?

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.770
And they use the
metaphor of a dance.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.250
It's one thing to be
invited to the dance.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.910
It's another thing to
be invited to dance.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.220
Coming to the dance and
sitting on the sidelines,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.960
I guess you're there.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.310
But so what?

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.190
But getting on the dance
floor, you become inclusive.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.470
And I like to take that
metaphor even further.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.680
From optics, to
outcomes, to ownership--

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.530
and this is the message for
the leader of the organization.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.497
And the time I was
at Rideau Hall,

00:12:18.497 --> 00:12:20.330
one of the functions
of the governor general

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.280
is to receive the
letters of credential,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.512
letters of credence, of
incoming ambassadors.

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:25.970
And they're not
allowed to function

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.580
until they've presented
those letters and accepted.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.102
And we have about
200 ambassadors.

00:12:30.102 --> 00:12:32.560
So we would-- and they served
three or four years-- so we'd

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.210
have probably 60 or 70 a year.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.880
We'd always have at least
one ceremony once a month

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.059
to receive them early.

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:40.850
And then I'd spend a
little one-on-one time

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:41.490
with each of them.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.823
And I'd say to each of them,
come to our winter diplomat

00:12:43.823 --> 00:12:44.360
party.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.740
It's really Canadian.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.650
So in February, we would have
all the diplomats in the city

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.791
come to Rideau Hall.

00:12:49.791 --> 00:12:51.290
And we have an
outdoor skating rink.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.289
We believe it's the oldest
one in North America.

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:56.420
And I want to tell you,
thanks to our $300,000 grant

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.861
that the Foundation managed to
get that we don't have skating

00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:00.860
4 and 1/2 months a year.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.090
We've got a refrigeration
plant that really works.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.600
You can make ice at
10 degrees below zero.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.430
So we get these people
on the skating rink,

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.352
and we get them on
sleigh rides if there's

00:13:09.352 --> 00:13:10.310
enough snow, et cetera.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.226
And then they come in.

00:13:11.226 --> 00:13:12.420
And there's a buffet dinner.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.160
It's [INAUDIBLE],, the
French Quebecois cuisine,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.570
and there's a square dance
fiddling group from Maniwaki.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.790
And they teach these
people how to square dance

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.190
in French and in English, and
play the spoons, and so on.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.440
And so you'll get these
people out on the dance floor.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.951
And square dance is not
kind of a nice, soft waltz.

00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:32.450
It's everybody in
action, and you're

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.930
bumping into one another.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.590
And I'll tell you, do
they ever feel inclusive.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.490
And I cannot tell you what a joy
I would get about seeing some

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.190
of the dispatches that would
go home from those diplomats

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.960
of a winter evening in Canada.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.950
And boy, did I ever
feel inclusive.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.030
So that's a long
story, but but that's,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.260
I think, how you go about it.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.270
I'll just tell one
more story, though,

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.640
because it illustrates
so much about leadership.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.020
It's the story of Vimi Ridge.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.620
How many of you know about
the Battle of Vimi Ridge here?

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.410
It was World War I. It was
Easter weekend in April,

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.110
and the Canadians
took Vimi Ridge,

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.630
an area of the plains
of northern France

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.120
that had been battled over
for about a year and a half

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.642
with over 100,000
French, 300,000 English,

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:16.100
and an equivalent
number of Germans

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.460
killed in a matter of
a few square miles.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.920
And the Canadian group
was then commanded

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.890
by Lord Bing, who became
governor general of Canada

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:31.740
from 1925 to 1930, I think.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.417
And the commander of
the first Canadian Corps

00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:36.500
was Sir Arthur Currie, a
Canadian who later became

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.420
principal of McGill University.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.480
And so Haig and
[INAUDIBLE],, the generals

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.050
from the French and
the English allies,

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.250
ordered Byng to try
to take Vimi Ridge.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.057
He said, I will, but not now.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.640
He said, we must
delay it for a month,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.799
because Currie and I
have spoken about this,

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:56.090
and we need a month to prepare.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.020
Point one.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.460
Point two, they gave the
battle plan for this battle

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.940
to every member of the
Canadian Corps army,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.410
including the privates.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.080
Of course, at Headquarters,
they were appalled.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.417
You're giving privates
the battle plan?

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:13.250
They'll probably lose
it in the local tavern

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.800
and the Germans will have it,
et cetera, et cetera, everyone.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.779
And then the Canadians, of
course, were non-transcripts.

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:22.820
They were all volunteers.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.920
And many were farm
boys from Saskatchewan

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.760
or places like that.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.466
And you know a thing or
two about life there.

00:15:28.466 --> 00:15:29.840
And they were an
irreverent sort.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.850
They had to work pretty hard
at learning how to salute

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.090
and using titles, et cetera.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.756
But they were
independent thinkers.

00:15:34.756 --> 00:15:36.380
And the reason they
had the battle plan

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.190
was when the sergeant in the
platoon was injured or killed,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.789
the corporal had to take over.

00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:43.580
And if the corporal
were injured or killed,

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.990
a private had to take over.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.990
They had to be able to
take responsibility.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.820
They had to own the plan.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.770
The next thing they did
is Andrew McNaughton

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.780
was a young professor
from McGill,

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.100
who was a scientist, who was
assigned to Arthur Currie's

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.270
headquarters.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.930
And they were three
really bright scientists

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.690
from Cambridge University
assigned to Douglas Higgs,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.190
the English headquarters.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.130
They weren't being used, because
the English and French were

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.310
fighting 19th-century warfare,
cavalry and infantry men.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.010
Tanks were not much used,
and airplanes, not at all.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.860
But these Cambridge
guys with McNaughton

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.330
said, we're going
to use airplanes

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.295
for surveillance, point one.

00:16:22.295 --> 00:16:25.370
Point two is, we're going to
use two principles of physics

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.060
and mathematics to have a
pinpoint sighting of where

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.190
the German guns are placed.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.570
So they used the fact that
sound travels slower than light.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.930
And so they would measure
the light from a flashing gun

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.910
to when the shell
landed, and they'd

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.320
measure the sound from that
gun to when it occurred

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.740
and triangulate to get the
precise location of the guns.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.470
And then they developed, through
very precise mathematics,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:56.720
what we call a creeping
barrage, creeping barrage.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.240
The custom from the
19th-century warfare

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.210
is the guns blast the devil
out of the enemy trenches

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.569
all through the night and then
just before dawn, they stop.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.220
And then the infantry rushes in.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.048
Well, by the time the infantry
gets to the enemy trenches,

00:17:11.048 --> 00:17:13.589
they're back in their trenches,
and they're waiting for them.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.450
So what McNaughton and
Currie and Byng did

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.109
is the guns would fire
right into the morning

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.335
for a five-minute period.

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:25.460
Then they would stop, and
immediately, the infantry

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.037
would follow right on for
a half a kilometer or so.

00:17:29.037 --> 00:17:30.620
And then they would
stop, and the guns

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.260
would fire again for
another, say, two minutes.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.910
And then the infantry
would go forward

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.200
for another half kilometer.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.033
On and on, the creeping
barrage, and it only

00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:42.170
worked because good sighting
of the guns, but very precise

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.490
mathematics of timing
when the guns were firing,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.170
and when they stopped, and
when the men were charging.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.130
And that, actually,
won Vimi Ridge

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.230
in three days of
very bitter fighting

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.820
which had not been won before.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.010
There were four or five
different lessons there,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.100
all of which have to do with
how you lead an organization.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.470
And what happened shortly
after that is Byng

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.590
stepped aside and
persuaded the allies

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.680
that Currie should be in command
of all of the Canadian troops.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.215
And that was the first
time the Canadians marched

00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:13.340
under their own leadership.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.080
And that was the
really beginning

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.430
of the Canadian military.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.030
Long story, but if
you want to figure out

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.129
how you lead an
organization, you

00:18:22.129 --> 00:18:24.670
could do worse than sitting down
and reading about Vimi Ridge

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.530
and some of these lessons.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.190
SPEAKER: Very interesting.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.320
So as we look at some of these
20 ways of addressing trust,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.920
we've talked, I think, just
now about sharing the plan,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.110
which I very much like.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.340
I think share some
real cultural elements

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.950
to how we try to do things--

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.010
maybe not quite a
dramatic fashion.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.046
Can you talk a bit
about something

00:18:48.046 --> 00:18:50.420
that's really meaningful task
to us right now, which is--

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.794
and you mention
it in your book--

00:18:51.794 --> 00:18:52.970
which is about listening.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.470
DAVID JOHNSTON: Yeah.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.011
SPEAKER: We've been trying to
do a bit of listening ourselves

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.540
lately, and internally
and externally as well,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.300
and do you think that
as a society, perhaps,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.940
we've stopped listening?

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.000
And how does that affect?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.833
DAVID JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:09.380
I think that's one of
those disruptive changes.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.980
We have become less listeners
and more data gatherers.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.140
And we have been much more
instantaneous, I think,

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:15.920
in our reactions.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.612
We're a more instantaneous
society, aren't we?

00:19:18.612 --> 00:19:22.280
It just takes longer in the old
days for things to get there.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.930
And I think we have
to re-cultivate

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.490
the act of listening.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.380
My grandmother used
to say, god gave you

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.050
two eyes, and two ears,
and one mouth for a reason.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.540
Use them proportionately.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.700
But the beauty of
listening first

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.570
is you are showing respect to
the other person or persons

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.190
in the group.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.190
You are establishing
a bond of trust.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.980
And bear in mind, there's
a Stephen Covey book

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.570
called "The Speed of Trust."

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.230
And his equation is, trust
equals speed plus cost.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.840
The more trust you have built
up within an organization,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.320
or between your organization
and another, the less costly

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.420
it is to do transactions
and the faster they occur.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.520
You and I shake hands.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.930
That's a handshake.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.420
And we know that
that was pretty fast

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.140
and didn't cost us very much.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.050
And we've got a
deal, and on we get.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.820
So you build that trust.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.220
By listening, what
you're also doing is

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.200
you're encouraging
everybody in the group

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.140
to own the issue, not
just your instructions.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.090
And you follow them
out, but you own it.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.700
The story I tell about that
is when I assumed the office

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.797
at Rideau Hall,
the person who runs

00:20:25.797 --> 00:20:28.130
it is called the secretary
to the office of the governor

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.060
general.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.340
We Canadians are
great for titles.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.010
The leading public servant is
called the clerk of the Privy

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.468
Council, and the person that
ran the office of the governor

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:38.210
general is the
secretary of the office.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.970
Any event, the person who
held that office retired.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.080
And we had a competition.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.110
And the guy we chose
was Stephen Wallace,

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.840
who is a consummately
marvelous public servant.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.380
And when I came
into the office, I

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.830
said, where's the
strategic plan?

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.980
Where's the plan of operations
for the next five years?

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.530
There wasn't one.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.310
I said, sure there's one.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.210
No, there wasn't one.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.085
Look in the archives.

00:20:57.085 --> 00:20:59.674
Because I'm not the first
new sheriff in town.

00:20:59.674 --> 00:21:00.332
There isn't.

00:21:00.332 --> 00:21:01.790
We couldn't find
something that was

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.470
called like a strategic plan.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.880
I said, well, we'll do one.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.700
So the assignment I
gave to the four or five

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.680
shortlist candidates
for the job is just

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.070
give me the outlines
of a strategic plan.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.560
And Stephen did something that
was beautiful, just marvelous.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.220
So I said, OK.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:17.720
Great.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.750
How long will it take you
to craft and implement

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.677
this strategic plan?

00:21:21.677 --> 00:21:23.510
He says, well, I can
do it over the weekend,

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.580
as a matter of fact.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.000
But he said, I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.833
And I said, why not?

00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:29.210
He said, you want to engage
every one of the 150 people

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.381
in the organization.

00:21:30.381 --> 00:21:31.380
So we took three months.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.480
And that's what we did.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.459
And it was marvelous.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.000
Because everyone in
that organization

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.820
owned the direction of the
operation for the next five

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.930
years and lived that.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.520
And so that's a
part of listening.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.180
And it's, again, like
optics to outcomes.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.390
It's not just producing
a strategic plan.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.360
It's a strategic plan
that must demonstrate

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.770
that you've actually listened.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.360
And if you want those
150 people to own it,

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.280
they have to find their
voice in it somewhere.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.238
And so some of the things
in the strategic plan

00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:03.110
I wouldn't have thought
of and were good.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.330
Some of the things I
didn't think were good,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.720
but we tried them, and by and
large they worked out well.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.650
But you get a sense of
ownership that is so incredible.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.690
And I-- see, leadership
is recognizing

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.850
your total dependence on
the people around you.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.670
That was Byng and Currie in Vimi
Ridge, the people around them.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.129
But the job of a
leader is not just

00:22:21.129 --> 00:22:22.920
to jump in front of
the parade and lead it,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.460
and say, look at me, I've
got a great team, away we go.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.220
The job of a leader is
to create an environment

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.980
where each person has
a sense of ownership

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.210
of the mission,
the vision, and is

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.540
operating at the very
maximum of their talents.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.040
And guess what happens?

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.110
When you operate at the
maximum of your talents,

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.420
your bandwidth expands.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.920
You become more
talented and learn

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.510
how to become more talented.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.910
And it all begins
with listening first.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.016
I could quote another book
about Sir William Osler,

00:22:53.016 --> 00:22:54.140
and I won't at this moment.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.260
But if I have another
time, I would.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.640
Osler's book, "Principles and

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.223
of 'Medicine--

00:22:59.223 --> 00:23:00.199
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:00.740
I love books.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.990
My grandchildren
call me Grandpa Book.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:07.190
He started his career at
McGill and then in the US.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.380
And then he held the
Regents Chair of Medicine

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.260
at Oxford, died in 1919.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.600
And his "Principles and
Practices of Medicine,"

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.990
his text, went through about
42 editions over 100 years--

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.150
Canada's most
influential physician.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.390
But embedded in it was,
listen to your patient.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.980
Don't come in and
read the charts.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.460
Listen to your patient.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.630
One, you're building a
trust with that patient.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.180
Two, you're getting behind
the particular symptoms

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.990
of the illness.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.100
And three, you're establishing
a relationship where, together,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.100
you can provide healing.

00:23:39.054 --> 00:23:41.220
SPEAKER: I'm going to have
to rush to get a question

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.440
or there's going to be
another story coming.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.840
DAVID JOHNSTON: So I speak
in 55-second paragraphs.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.150
SPEAKER: So as an organization,
as a broad organization,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.350
we've grown a lot.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.460
And we work hard internally
to foster and build trust.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.020
We try to listen.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.102
We tried to effect change.

00:23:59.102 --> 00:24:00.560
But some of the
things in your book

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.180
really resonate with me,
particularly this concept

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.450
that you alluded to just already
about depending on one another.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.150
And I think this is core to
our culture in many ways.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:19.740
And certainly, I believe it's
fundamental to ability to lead.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.200
Can you tell us
a little bit more

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.990
about that, about how it
affects organizational capacity?

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.540
DAVID JOHNSTON: Well, if
you depend on one another--

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.540
and you have the
suggestion box of put

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.700
in your suggestions of
how we improve things--

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.190
don't do that if you're not
really going to make it work.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.990
If it's just window
dressing, people

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.700
get cynical about
that pretty fast

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.490
and they don't see
anything happening.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.830
Also you want to give credit.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.680
The leader is the last
one to take any credit.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.960
I often say you can accomplish
anything in the world,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.760
provided you insist on never
taking any credit for it--

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.150
but also the first one
to take responsibility.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.890
I mean, responsibility,
that's an important feature

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.840
of depending on the
people around you,

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.430
that you share the
credit widely--

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.600
and you should.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.840
Because if you've done
this inclusivity right,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.370
if you shared the strategic
plan right, people own it.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.440
It belongs to them.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.240
And so when things go
well, they should feel

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.560
pretty good to get the credit.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.430
On the other hand, when things
go wrong, you, as the leader,

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.430
have the responsibility.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.650
Now, your team will
probably come along and say,

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.850
we made a big mistake.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.050
How to repair it?

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.230
But it's two different
approaches to the same.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.840
Again, to come back to Rideau
Hall, it's interesting.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.460
When Stephen came and began
with his strategic plan,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.162
we had about a 50% response
rate to the annual survey

00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:39.620
that the government
of Canada would

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.040
do of staff in a particular
section of satisfaction,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.460
job development, et cetera.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.770
And by and large, the
results were sort of average.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.040
Over the five years
of his leadership,

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.890
we had dramatic improvements
in the participation

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.990
in that survey and
dramatic improvements

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.910
in the positive and quality
responses, so much so

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.150
that in the last
year that I was there

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.450
and Stephen was there with
me, the OECD published

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.152
its annual rankings of the
performance of public servants

00:26:13.152 --> 00:26:13.860
around the world.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.800
There are 33 OECD countries.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.470
Canada was number one.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:23.590
And one of the surveys of
top employers just shortly

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.870
after that for the Ottawa
region showed our office

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.450
as top employer for the region.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:32.590
So Stephen and I sent a note
to all of the people saying,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.140
you probably are aware
of the OECD study.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.170
You are part of the leading
professionals, public service

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.080
group of these 33 countries.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.020
Pretty good.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.617
And by the way, you've just been
named part of the top employer

00:26:46.617 --> 00:26:47.200
in the region.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.780
You're the créme de la créme.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.740
And that, you know,
is in a sense sharing

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.165
credit with everyone there.

00:26:52.165 --> 00:26:56.410
It was pretty good for the
morale in the organization.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.370
SPEAKER: We met in the
context of community building

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.760
a while back.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.750
And not surprisingly, you
talk about this importance

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.600
in the book.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.430
But can you tell
us why [AUDIO OUT]

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.120
DAVID JOHNSTON: I used to
give a speech called, "What's

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.860
in the water in Waterloo?"

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.330
And it was a slide presentation.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.100
And the first slide
showed the Grand River

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.350
flowing through the community.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.580
Pretty nice to have
a river goes by.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.250
And we live just
west of Heidelberg

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.690
on a farm in Mennonite country.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.900
So our neighbors are all
horse-and-buggy people.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.650
And they were absolutely
lovely people.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.690
Couldn't imagine
better neighbors.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.740
And we would be invited to
go on barn-raising exercises.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.969
I think, a couple times
there was a barn burned down

00:27:40.969 --> 00:27:42.010
or something burned down.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:46.210
And we were so honored to
be included in the community

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.730
to go on the Saturday
to clean up the debris,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.590
and begin to rebuild
the barn, et cetera.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.150
And so the second
slide is actually

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:58.840
an overhead, aerial photo of
a barn-raising with Mennonites

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.700
rebuilding or building
a brand new barn.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.280
And men, women, boys,
girls are all there

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.840
helping with their
contribution of time

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.440
and their contribution
of also the wood

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.310
and the different materials.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.740
And so that's the second slide.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.520
The third slide is
the second slide.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.940
And the first slide is the
barn raising in the water.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.990
It's that barn-raising concept,
that collaborative concept,

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:22.570
that is so much a feature
of this community.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.750
And barn raising is a metaphor
of how we collaborate.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.260
And why do we do that?

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.560
We do it because we're
trying to make life

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.000
not only good for ourselves and
our family, but our neighbors.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.420
And the most
fundamental principle

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.003
of all of the ones
in the "Trust" book

00:28:36.003 --> 00:28:37.210
is the golden rule--

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.380
treat your neighbors as you
would have yourself treated.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.610
And I think that notion
of making life better

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.420
for everyone in your community
is a very important feature

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.237
of any healthy community.

00:28:51.237 --> 00:28:53.320
You can almost measure the
health of the community

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.780
by the degree of
collaboration there is

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.834
and how well the golden
rule is practiced.

00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:58.750
It's very interesting.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.820
I was at an economics conference
about three, four years ago.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.000
And I was speaking, I
guess, on innovation.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.940
And Robert Shiller, the Nobel
Prize economist from Yale--

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.900
he does the Shiller Case
Housing index, for example--

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.640
was speaking.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.285
And I stayed on beyond
my contribution.

00:29:16.285 --> 00:29:18.370
I was supposed to be, I
guess, back in the office.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.730
But I want to stay
on, because I wanted

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.354
to hear Robert Shiller,
the Nobel Prize

00:29:21.354 --> 00:29:23.440
winner in behavioral
economics [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.110
And to my enormous surprise,
in his half-hour address,

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.570
he didn't speak about
economics at all.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.490
He spoke about the golden rule.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.590
And he said that
if you look at all

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.300
of the great religions
of the world,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.120
they all have the golden rule
at their heart, expressed

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.005
different ways,
but at their heart.

00:29:39.005 --> 00:29:40.630
And then he said
something that I often

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.838
quote to my business friends.

00:29:41.838 --> 00:29:44.950
He says, Adam Smith would
be considered the father

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.240
of modern capitalism.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.960
In his book, "The Wealth
of Nations," in 1773,

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.280
is considered kind of the
Bible, or the early Bible

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.920
for the modern capitalistic
market-based society.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.230
People forget that
Adam Smith was not

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.590
the professor of economics
at Glasgow University.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.620
He was the professor
of moral theory.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.070
And his even more important book
than the "Wealth of Nations"

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.430
was the "Theory of
Moral Sentiment."

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.980
And the invisible hand,
which we have interpreted

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.120
that to guide the marketplace
to produce a harmonious outcome

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.120
for everyone seeking
private profit,

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.450
was not an invisible hand
that permitted that market--

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.600
free market-- to
operate smoothly.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.660
The invisible hand was
the moral framework

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.960
that oversaw and held
together the markets which,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.710
from time to time,
needed regulation.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.390
People in a free market
can move into cartels

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.330
pretty easily if you give them
a chance to conspire together,

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.370
and on and on.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.420
That's contained in "The
Wealth of Nations" as well.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.762
But it's the part that
people don't read very much.

00:30:49.762 --> 00:30:51.220
But that invisible
hand, of course,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.130
was something that was
based on the golden rule.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.760
And so to come back to
your question, Steve,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.190
why do you want a
community to function

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.810
in a collaborative way?

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.940
Because you want it to be
a good place to live in.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.130
You want it to be a place
where people have a chance

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.200
to develop their
talents to the full

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.630
and where their lives are
safe and secure, et cetera.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.930
And you want to have vigorous,
competitive enterprise that

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.110
is constantly innovating
and trying to make

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.300
not only its products
and services better,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.610
but the whole community better.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.590
And that got us, at
lunch, on to my tale

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.590
of why we need a tertiary
teaching hospital here

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.665
in this community.

00:31:27.665 --> 00:31:29.710
SPEAKER: And we're
still working on it.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.200
DAVID JOHNSTON:
And why all of you

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.650
have such a contribution to make
to the leadership of community

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.630
projects like that and
so many other things.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.700
We have something called
the Sovereign's Medal

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.200
in Volunteerism--

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.010
another story.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.390
I'm going on too much.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.672
But it was the
Caring Canadian Award

00:31:45.672 --> 00:31:47.380
that was offered by
the governor general.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.880
And it was started
by Roméo LeBlanc.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.624
Roméo was an Acadian from Nova
Scotia, very modest background,

00:31:53.624 --> 00:31:55.790
took the one-year course
to become a school teacher,

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:56.900
then journalist, then
member of parliament,

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.720
and then became
governor general.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.230
And he thought one of the
most priceless features

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.660
of Canadian society
was volunteers,

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.230
people who just let their
time and their talent

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.830
to help others.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.720
You can't put a price on it.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.167
You just look at the
volunteers you know

00:32:14.167 --> 00:32:15.500
and what a difference they make.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.410
So he said, you know, we
recognize our great Order

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.560
of Canada people and people
of bravery and military merit

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.607
and so on.

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.440
But we should recognize
those unsung heroes.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.023
So he started a
Caring Canadian Award.

00:32:26.023 --> 00:32:27.890
And we went to
different towns, they

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.800
would confer this
Caring Canadian Award.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.489
Then it got caught in budget
cuts about 15 years ago,

00:32:33.489 --> 00:32:34.280
and it disappeared.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.890
So when we came, talking about
the smart and caring nation,

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.440
we said, we should be putting
a focus on these volunteers,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.270
not because they're
looking for attention,

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.400
but to encourage others to see
how important volunteerism is.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.380
So we revived it.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.450
And then, in discussions
with Her Majesty,

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.274
we asked if it could be
a queen-sanctioned honor.

00:32:51.274 --> 00:32:52.940
So it's now called
the Sovereign's Medal

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:53.666
in Volunteerism.

00:32:53.666 --> 00:32:55.040
And through the
Foundation, we've

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.310
developed an endowment so it can
never be hurt by budget cuts.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.460
So we gave 1,000 out in
the last year I was there.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.800
And our plan was
to go to 10,000.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.080
And you say 10,000 is
a lot of certificates.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.420
Well, there are 40,000
communities in this country.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.190
Every one of those
have volunteers

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.690
that should be recognized.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.200
And why do you do that?

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.410
You do that to encourage
that volunteer spirit

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.970
in the community,
and to cherish it,

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.770
and to promote it
as much as you can.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.810
SPEAKER: Well, we could go on.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.101
And I have many more questions.

00:33:24.101 --> 00:33:27.890
But perhaps we should open
it up to any questions

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.600
that people might want to bring.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.820
There's a microphone
up here, please.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.440
DAVID JOHNSTON: Yeah, well I
was never asked, of course.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.250
I was not asked to
prorogue Parliament.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.437
But in fact, the
powers of proroguing,

00:33:40.437 --> 00:33:42.770
which is postponing Parliament
for a bit, or dissolving,

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.870
which is to stop Parliament
and have a new election,

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.500
those are powers within the
office of the governor general.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.244
But you take advice from the
elected form of government.

00:33:55.244 --> 00:33:56.660
And the elected
form of government

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.100
is the prime minister and
the cabinet, et cetera.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.620
So it would be--

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.570
only in the most
exceptional cases

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.110
would you exercise
that theoretical power

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.040
of refusing a request
to prorogue or dissolve.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.630
And I could go into a bit
of length of what was truly,

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.070
truly exceptional
cases would be,

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.929
but even if it were
an exceptional case,

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.630
you'd look for something
other than an outright refusal

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.639
of the advice you were given.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.880
You'd look for a delay.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.820
You'd look for a
public explanation.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.360
You'd look for a
statement of reasons why.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.139
And if it was something that you
thought was unconstitutional,

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.290
you probably would
consider a court reference.

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.530
And why do I say that?

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.880
It's because is the
governor general

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.420
is the representative
of the queen.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.420
And that's an unelected
institution of government.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.880
We believe in democracy
where you elect your rulers.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.909
And therefore, one must
be careful, I think--

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.500
even where a power
exists in theory

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.800
in the unelected
form of government--

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.000
to exercise that power.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.480
Because to do so means that
you are setting yourself

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.904
up as equally powerful
and more powerful

00:34:59.904 --> 00:35:01.070
than the elected government.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.740
And that goes back
to Lord Elgin in 1837

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:09.470
where he signed into law the
Lower Canada Rebellion Losses

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.890
Bill, which was passed
by a popular majority.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.170
But the Family Compact,
the Senate of the day,

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.250
said don't sign that.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.505
Exercise your powers.

00:35:17.505 --> 00:35:19.850
There you are.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.240
AUDIENCE: The electoral reform.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.990
So the last two
federal governments

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:25.135
were majority
governments of 39%.

00:35:25.135 --> 00:35:27.260
DAVID JOHNSTON: There's a
referendum actually going

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.634
on in British Columbia right
now at the provincial level.

00:35:29.634 --> 00:35:32.150
It'll be the third one, I think.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.820
I'm not sure.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.510
This was a part of the platform
of the current government,

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.760
and it appears that the
reform they were looking for

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.000
isn't going to happen.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.870
What I would say is that
the interesting thing

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.180
about our form of
government is that was not

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.650
born out of revolution.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.540
It was born out of
evolution, point one.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:56.690
Two, it's not perfect, but
it's pretty satisfactory.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.160
And there's been
a genius, I think,

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.610
of Canadians who are people of
compromise to avoid extremes

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.290
and to find forms of
government that work.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.370
And as we look at
this question, be it

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.740
forms of proportional
representation or something

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.200
else, my guess is
we'll approach it

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.930
in the same way of looking
at the alternatives

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.280
and evolving step by step.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.100
Now, some may say
that's too slow.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.842
Get some wise folks
together in a room

00:36:20.842 --> 00:36:22.550
and draw something up
and get on with it.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:27.020
But people often ask
me, you have in Canada

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.400
a constitutional monarchy with
a hereditary Monarch over there

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.900
in the United Kingdom.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.280
Haven't you outgrown that?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.540
Aren't you Canadians?

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.950
My answer is it works well.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.460
And I happen to think it's
a good system of government.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.970
Others could have their views,
and that's all being Canadian.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.200
But I say that if you
look around the world

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.560
and you said, identify
eight or 10 countries who

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.410
have pretty satisfactory
governments that

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:58.070
by and large satisfy the
desires of their people,

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:04.750
you would find on that list
probably Sweden, Norway,

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.240
Denmark, United
Kingdom, Netherlands,

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.752
New Zealand, Australia, Canada.

00:37:08.752 --> 00:37:10.710
What's common to those
eight or nine countries?

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.190
They're all constitutional
monarchies with pretty thriving

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.630
democracies.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.560
And in our case, it's
evolved over 1,000 years

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.500
and it's served us
reasonably well.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.370
So I guess that would be
my answer to any change

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.830
in our government.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.750
Do it carefully
and thoughtfully,

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.320
and do it with broad
consensus, and avoid

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.750
instant and very
polarized things

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.910
like the Brexit referendum
in the United Kingdom.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.810
I guess my view is that
that is an unfortunate

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.150
path for our friends in the UK.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.980
Others will have
different views.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.900
And by and large, I'm
not a great believer

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.110
in referenda for
fundamental change,

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.320
because referenda are
single-issue matters.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.240
They are often very emotional.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.500
They divide families.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.320
They have not gone through
the digestion process

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.430
that we have with
political parties,

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:06.390
with platforms, with
second views of things,

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.729
including a Senate, et cetera.

00:38:07.729 --> 00:38:10.020
And if you're going to make
pretty fundamental changes,

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.605
you want to proceed with
some degree of care.

00:38:12.605 --> 00:38:13.438
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:13.438 --> 00:38:14.521
DAVID JOHNSTON: Thank you.

00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:16.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.980
I have a question
about volunteerism.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.240
DAVID JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.698
AUDIENCE: So we basically have
two models in this country--

00:38:21.698 --> 00:38:22.584
most countries--

00:38:22.584 --> 00:38:23.750
for serving the public good.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.909
And one of them is
volunteers, and another is

00:38:25.909 --> 00:38:27.200
the professional civil service.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.491
And they both have their
strong points and weak points.

00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:32.310
With civil service, every
citizen has a right to things.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.560
You don't have to ask someone.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.180
You don't have to have
somebody take pity on you

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.470
or decide that you are worthy.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.251
You just get it.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.750
And for volunteerism,
of course, you

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.450
can draw from a much
broader range of people.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.075
I'm just wondering how you feel
the balance between those two--

00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:47.908
DAVID JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:38:47.908 --> 00:38:49.460
I would not see
them as either/or.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.172
I'd see them both ands for
a very practical reason.

00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:53.630
The needs are so
great that I think

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.790
you need to get at them
from different ways.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.150
And some people would say if
you're pushing volunteerism

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.750
all the time, it's because you
believe in small government,

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.240
and you don't want public
services, et cetera.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.310
I think the world is
more complex than that.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.790
And we should be
constantly redefining

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.800
what it is we expect
of governments

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.830
and what amount of taxes
we're prepared to pay to have

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:16.880
those services provided.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.280
And in the Canadian
case, contrasting

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.610
with some other societies,
we have a pretty good faith

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.110
in government in
public services.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.750
And we tend to be
more collective people

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.250
than an individualistic people.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.870
And I think that's colored
how we've made these choices.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:34.160
But at the same time, by
and large, volunteerism

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.800
thrives in this country.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.260
And I think it thrives
because we're essentially--

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.760
apart from our First
Nations people,

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.490
who have pretty good volunteer
arrangements themselves--

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:44.930
we're a nation of immigrants.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.320
And each wave of immigrants
that has come to this country

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.600
usually has come from a
very difficult background.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.800
They've come from despair, from
war, from poverty, from hunger.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.114
My case, my Scottish ancestors
were kicked off the land

00:39:57.114 --> 00:39:59.030
because sheep were more
important than people.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.770
And they settled in
Northern Ireland,

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.000
displacing poor
Catholic farmers.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.420
So Protestants were there
and then ran out of potatoes

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.120
and came to Canada always
with the determination

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.760
that life shall be
better for our children.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.550
And that has not just
been for our children.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:16.700
It's been for our community
and a sense of barn raising

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.407
that is part of the
Canadian spirit.

00:40:18.407 --> 00:40:20.240
And that's where the
volunteer is in common,

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.580
and so I think you want
both of those engines

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.460
functioning really
well, with any luck,

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.430
interacting with one another,
not duplicating one another.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.980
But I wouldn't be
suppressing one or the other

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.790
because you think, innately,
that one shouldn't happen.

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:40.912
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:40.912 --> 00:40:43.675
I Was wondering what you thought
about transparency and trust.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.850
If there's distrust
of institutions,

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:53.020
if you're transparent,
that gives them evidence

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.150
to further their distrust.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.370
DAVID JOHNSTON: Well,
in the initial instance,

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.470
that's correct.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.550
You know, get out all
the secrets, et cetera.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:04.314
But at some point, those secrets
are either going to get out,

00:41:04.314 --> 00:41:05.730
or the thing is
going to make some

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.340
so distrustful it doesn't work.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.330
So to me, the only
answer is transparency.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.730
And the beauty of
transparency is once you've

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.050
laid the problem out--

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:16.960
and the errors-- then you get
on the more difficult task

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.080
of rebuilding the trust.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.420
I began thinking
about this, actually,

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.220
when I was a young
law professor and I

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.130
was research counsel to the
Ontario Securities Commission.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.790
We were rewriting the economic
regulation for the markets.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.060
And transparency,
openness, full disclosure

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.017
were the kind of watchwords
to build trust in the markets

00:41:37.017 --> 00:41:39.350
so you could trust the markets
to make your investments,

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.640
et cetera, that we could see the
markets as reasonable measures

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.150
of value, et cetera.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.080
And by and large, that system
works pretty well in Canada.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.950
But it's based on the notion
of trust and transparency.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.650
The other thing I would say
is where something wrong

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:57.010
has gone on, then I
think you should be fully

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.480
transparent in dealing with it.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.540
So we have a chapter in
the book about apology,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.250
the importance of apology.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:07.700
And we begin by saying,
no book on trust in Canada

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.360
could be written without
speaking of the First Nations

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.760
situation in the
residential schools.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.400
And so that chapter is
almost entirely devoted

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.772
to the apology for the
residential schools.

00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:23.230
One of the few places in the
book where we quote at length,

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:25.960
one Prime Minister's Harper's
apology in the House of Commons

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.180
in 2011, and Prime
Minister Trudeau's

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.690
further reconciliation
statement in 2016, I think.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:37.330
And you have to make the apology
full, complete, transparent,

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.760
not carving it up,
and then you get

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.980
on with the steps of rebuilding
trust, the reconciliation.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.680
So transparency
is the first step,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.450
but there are others after it.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.075
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:42:48.864 --> 00:42:51.030
AUDIENCE: So almost everyone
of us here in this room

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.940
are probably
post-secondary educated

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.790
on one of the core skills
we learned at university

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.350
and that was critical thinking.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.840
And part of trust,
at least for me,

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.450
is about being one's challenge.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.650
Challenge the people.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:04.890
DAVID JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:05.730
AUDIENCE: Like you
think critically

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:06.840
about what they're saying.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.830
DAVID JOHNSTON: It's
not blind trust.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:08.070
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:09.569
DAVID JOHNSTON:
It's informed trust.

00:43:09.569 --> 00:43:11.910
AUDIENCE: And so
it seems that there

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:15.330
is a fundamental degradation
in critical thinking

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.011
in our society today.

00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.260
What's your opinion of how
critical thinking and trust

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.520
fit together and whether--

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.630
DAVID JOHNSTON: Well, I
think it's always been

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:22.830
the most important ingredient.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.871
And the question why has
been the most important.

00:43:24.871 --> 00:43:28.380
And it goes back to
Plato and Socrates.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.330
And it's especially
important now--

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.640
critical thinking-- in
asking the right questions,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.814
because we have
an ocean of data.

00:43:34.814 --> 00:43:36.480
And for the first
time, teachers are not

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.810
the fountain of knowledge.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.390
And we have to learn how to
go from data to information

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.920
to knowledge to wisdom.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.480
And we do that through
informed questions, eh?

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.030
Especially when all
the data's there,

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:50.760
you just have to know the
search paths and the questions

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.290
to bring it together.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:53.970
I'm a teacher.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.090
And Tom Friedman's
book, "Thanks for Being

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.160
Late" talks about
this age of disruption

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.430
and the very phenomenon
you've spoken about that trust

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.700
can be eroded and we get
information in different ways.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.960
So he says, what's the answer?

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.160
The answer is the three Rs.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.618
Go back to teach reading, and
writing, and arithmetic well.

00:44:10.618 --> 00:44:14.160
But then he said, we must
also teach the four Cs.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.010
And they are Creativity,
Communication, Collaboration,

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.320
and Coding.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.450
We talk about this in
the book on innovation

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:22.780
that Tom and I wrote.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.196
And I believe in
the first three.

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:26.820
I didn't believe in
the fourth, coding.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.160
But Thomas swung me
along, not because I

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.170
want every kid to be a coder.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.480
But I think it's
instructive to learn

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.000
enough about how you
code to see that that's

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.560
a new way of thinking.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.760
It's a new curiosity path.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.200
And as you understand
that system,

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.930
it helps you to see
the benefits that

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.690
come from using code but
thinking in different ways.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:50.310
And the final thing I would say
is that for me, those four Cs

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:50.989
are helpful.

00:44:50.989 --> 00:44:52.780
But there's a C that's
even more important.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.330
And that's curiosity.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:58.020
What you want to do is
enhance the curiosity.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:02.220
And so our five daughters
began international exchanges

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.210
at age 12.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.800
And it was the best
thing that could

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.175
have happened to
their formation,

00:45:06.175 --> 00:45:08.850
or their development,
as we say in French.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:12.450
Through international exposure,
exposure to different cultures,

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.300
and exposure to poverty,
four things happen to them.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.650
One, their curiosity
became enhanced.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:19.710
They had always been
kids that asked why.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:22.290
But the whys were
more penetrating whys.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.822
Secondly, they
became more tolerant.

00:45:23.822 --> 00:45:26.030
Not tolerant just sense of,
you're different from me.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.250
That's OK.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.290
Nobody gets hurt, but,
why are you different,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.620
and, what is your
background, and so

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:30.703
on, a true interest in it.

00:45:30.703 --> 00:45:33.120
Thirdly, their
judgment became better.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.860
They were quick to spot bigotry.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.780
They wanted to hear
another side of the story.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.220
They wanted to
triangulate to get

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.810
the proper measure of things.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.420
But fourthly, they became
more empathetic, not just

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.280
sympathetic, but empathetic.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.340
They could walk in the
other person's shoes.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.710
And so I guess that's
the kind of formation

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.760
that I would be seeing in how
we function in a resilient

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.430
way to this new age, that
we don't have blind trust,

00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.030
we have informed trust, and that
we work constantly to enhancing

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.100
our informed nature.

00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:07.560
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.980
So first off, as
a Waterloo alumni,

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:15.228
we first talked, probably, about
several decades ago while I

00:46:15.228 --> 00:46:16.750
was an undergrad at Waterloo.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.750
So first of all, I actually
wanted to thank you.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.625
Yes, I was that tall.

00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:21.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.135
I wanted to thank you
for all the service

00:46:23.135 --> 00:46:25.320
that you've provided
to the university,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.716
and to the region of Waterloo,
and to the country now,

00:46:27.716 --> 00:46:30.880
on behalf of the country
itself was my first thought.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.120
I actually had a question.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.244
But it's a little tradition
to start with a saying.

00:46:34.244 --> 00:46:36.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.710
So my question is
about digital trust.

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:42.150
So we have created this
world, this environment,

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.690
where we have
digitized and scaled up

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:47.900
social interaction in
the form of social media,

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.390
that every interaction you can
create in a social setting you

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.634
can now make in a
digital, social setting.

00:46:53.634 --> 00:46:55.800
But one thing that we haven't
been able to digitize,

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.216
and you can see
that this has been

00:46:57.216 --> 00:47:01.530
abused by state
actors and [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.750
is the idea of digital trust.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:04.770
How do we create--

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:08.250
how do I know that when
I engage on social media

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.590
that the information
that's being given to me

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:11.280
is trustworthy?

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.930
How do I know who is at the
other end of the computer?

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.760
And as a company,
I think, we have

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.370
an interest in thinking
about how do we

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.732
solve this general problem
of trust in the digital age?

00:47:24.732 --> 00:47:26.190
We have communities
that are small,

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.530
but we are trying
to build platforms

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.510
that can connect us globally.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.810
In order to do that, we need
some sort of digital platform.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.690
So my question to you
is how do we build trust

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:41.660
in a digital realm, and how do
we establish as an organization

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.849
that remote digital
form of trust?

00:47:45.849 --> 00:47:48.390
DAVID JOHNSTON: Well, I think
you begin with just what you've

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:49.140
done today.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.410
Get up and say, we
think we have an issue.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.810
And who better to
get at that issue

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.370
than people that
think about it a lot

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:59.010
and have the tools
to develop the rules

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.060
of the road, the service.

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.380
That'd be point one.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.960
Point two is, again,
in Tom Friedman's book,

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.495
"Thanks for Being Late."

00:48:05.495 --> 00:48:07.500
He deals with this issue.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.170
And he refers to one of
the two or three people

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.600
that have been great
mentors with him.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.440
And this individual says we're
in a kind of the second round,

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.140
I guess, of a 15-round boxing
match or the second inning

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.940
of a ninth-inning ballgame.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:24.060
The first inning was the
wonderful, remarkable,

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.534
technological development.

00:48:25.534 --> 00:48:27.450
It took three centuries
for the printing press

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.783
to reach a majority of the
population of Western Europe.

00:48:29.783 --> 00:48:32.724
It took the internet
between 1995 and 2005--

00:48:32.724 --> 00:48:34.390
less than a decade--
to reach a majority

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:35.473
of the world's population.

00:48:35.473 --> 00:48:38.950
That, in itself, is a remarkable
technological accomplishment.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.580
But he said inning
two, or round two,

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.440
is developing the
rules of the road

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.490
with these dramatically new
and different tools that

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:50.460
have great potential for
good, but also have potential

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.540
for harm.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:55.500
And I guess as the internet
came along, some of us

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.060
were of the view,
let this market be

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.280
as free as it possibly
can be so that you

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.050
don't stifle innovation.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:05.110
And then you say, mmm,
maybe there are some rules.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.440
But the rules, I think,
would be best developed

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.530
from within these
industries, from people

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.310
like yourselves who understand
not only current practices,

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.480
but the practices to come,
rather than governments

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.770
doing the whole job.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:21.690
And of course,
ideally, what you will

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:26.160
have is the thoughtful people
in the industry identifying

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.290
the problems now, and the
problems that will come,

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:29.910
and solutions, and
where government

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.720
is necessary to
have government act.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.040
But it's not it's the
government with the big stick,

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.960
and they'll come along
and do the hitting,

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.910
and meanwhile, the wrongs,
or the unfortunate practices,

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:43.560
continue to grow
and grow and people

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:48.570
develop a distrust of the
ability of the people managing

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.400
those enterprises to come up
with the rules of the road.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.850
You know, every
period in history

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.170
has these big disruptions.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:59.640
And it takes thoughtfulness
to learn how to rejig.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.849
And the changes are enormous.

00:50:00.849 --> 00:50:03.098
But you think of the printing
press in Western Europe.

00:50:03.098 --> 00:50:05.160
That was resisted
for the longest time,

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.972
because the Catholic
Church controlled religion.

00:50:07.972 --> 00:50:09.930
And the most important
thing in the Middle Ages

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.630
to anyone in Western Europe
was your relationship with God.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:16.860
But that was managed
by a bureaucracy

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:20.430
with a priest, bishop, cardinal,
and pope, and in a language

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:21.840
that people didn't understand.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.620
And you certainly wouldn't
want to have them understand

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.620
what the Bible said or
why you have the sacrament

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.429
of holy communion.

00:50:29.429 --> 00:50:30.220
You do it in Latin.

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.970
It's awe and mystery.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:37.980
And what happened with the
invention of the printing

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.880
press-- it wasn't invented
in Western Europe.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.505
It was actually
invented in South Korea

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.330
about 1,000 years before.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.780
But it didn't develop there--

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.560
was people began to read
that truth for themselves.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.690
And they disintermediated.

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.481
So they didn't need a
priest, and a bishop,

00:50:52.481 --> 00:50:54.840
and a cardinal, and
magnificent cathedrals.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.830
And what happened
from that, of course,

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.430
was not only did people
learn about the religion they

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.620
felt important, but
they then realized

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.840
how important education was.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.660
And that was the
breakdown of serfdom,

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.310
the rise of the
cities in Europe,

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:10.130
the Industrial Revolution,
the democratic institutions

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.070
of parliament and so on,
and Europe leapt ahead

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.650
of Islam, India,
and China, which

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.220
were much more advanced
civilizations until about 1600,

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.060
1700.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.391
So long story short
to say, yeah, I

00:51:22.391 --> 00:51:24.140
think we will need
some rules of the road,

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.780
and you are the people who
are best designed to do them.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.390
Just a few months ago, I was
speaking here on tech for Good

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.830
at the tech conference.

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:32.586
And we'll have a repeat
of that in a year.

00:51:32.586 --> 00:51:33.960
When is the next
conference, Amy?

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.640
AMY: June.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.030
DAVID JOHNSTON: In June?

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.530
AMY: Yes.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:36.405
DAVID JOHNSTON: Good.

00:51:36.405 --> 00:51:38.270
So that Tech for
Good speech was just

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:41.670
about what we're
talking about now.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.497
SPEAKER: Thank you [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:43.497 --> 00:51:44.580
DAVID JOHNSTON: Time's up.

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.913
SPEAKER: Thank you for the time.

00:51:45.913 --> 00:51:46.770
Thank you.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.820
[APPLAUSE]
