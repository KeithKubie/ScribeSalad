Let's pretend you go to see another doctor after this and this doctor is a little more competent.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She has purple hair, and when you asked the purple-haired doctor to repeat the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
measurement three times, she gives you the following numbers for your height.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you calculate the average, you find an average height of 1.97 meters.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now my question is--what's a better estimate of your height?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Is it the 2.00 meters measured by the green doctor

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or the 1.97 meters measured by the purple-haired doctor?
