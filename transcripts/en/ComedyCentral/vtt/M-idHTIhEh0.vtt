00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.509
I'll go first.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.211 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
You first.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.211 align:start size:38% position:63%
All right.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.247 align:start size:69% position:31%
Oh, this is a sad one.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.482 size:78% position:61%
It's gonna take a lot of,
uh, a lot of weed.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.051 align:start size:88% position:13%
I know, man.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.752
I'm gonna be emotionally torn
after this one.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.521 align:start size:22% position:78% line:85%
Yeah.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.521 size:75% position:38%
This is our first one,
too, man.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.122 line:85%
I know, I know.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.122 align:start size:97% position:3%
Super emotional.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.725 size:84% position:58%
Like, when you watch a sad,
you know, dying-dog movie,

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.326 size:59% position:70%
do you, uh,
cry every time?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
Absolutely.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.562
Not every --
I didn't --

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.730 align:start size:47% position:53%
Well, yeah,
I guess...

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:31.798
Is "Air Bud" sad?

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.499 align:start size:25% position:75% line:85%
Yeah.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.499 size:50% position:25%
"All Dogs
Go To Heaven."

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:35.468 size:75% position:38% line:83%
"All Dogs Go To Heaven."
Remember that movie?

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:35.468
No.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.470 size:59% position:70%
Yeah,
that was a sad one.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.372 size:59% position:70%
It's about
a [bleep] dead dog.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.240 size:63% position:69%
It's like
the title tells you.

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:43.142 size:63% position:69%
It's dogs in heaven,
you guys.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:45.111 align:end position:100%
We got to keep our eye
on this poor doggy.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:45.945 align:start size:94% position:6% line:85%
Oh, yeah.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:45.945
Oh, God.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:48.281 align:start size:56% position:44%
Because the doggy
is really, uh...

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.582
He's so cool.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:50.817 align:end position:100%
He's the true victim
in all of this, I think.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.951
Wait.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.821 align:end position:100%
Do you guys think that's
a legit way to solve this thing?

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.289 size:63% position:69%
See who
the dog likes?

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.523 size:66% position:33%
Absolutely.
That's justice.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.660
That's how they used to do it
back in the, uh, 17th century.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.228 size:72% position:64%
Yeah.
Well, what about the --

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.196 align:start size:69% position:31%
What does the law say?

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.431 align:end position:100%
'Cause I know you guys
went to law school.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:09.569
Well, it's her property,
so, like, it's hers.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.237 align:start size:25% position:75% line:85%
Right.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.237
Those are her rights.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.639
But, uh, she doesn't seem
to care about the dog.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start size:41% position:59%
Right?

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.510 size:59% position:70%
So what do you do
as a judge?

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:18.711 align:start size:50% position:50%
You ignore...

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:19.712
Hmm.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.347 align:start size:59% position:41%
You ignore the law?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.183 align:end position:100%
It'd be interesting to see
who the dog goes to.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.251
Yeah, see,
I feel like --

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:26.752 align:end position:100%
And do we have them both
go "Come here, come here,"

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:27.687 align:end position:100%
or do we have them
just stand there?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.554 line:85%
No, I think you --

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.554 align:start size:97% position:3%
No, no.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.256
I think they shouldn't
say anything.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.557 size:66% position:33%
I think you got
to keep it objective.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.192 size:59% position:70%
It feels like
the guy's gonna win

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:34.560 size:59% position:70%
if we let
the dog decide.

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.229 align:start size:94% position:6% line:85%
Absolutely.

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.229
Yeah.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.663
Maybe best out of three.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.665
[ Laughter ]

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:42.502 align:start size:47% position:53%
[ Coughs ]

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:42.569 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Best out of three works.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:43.535
Yeah.
