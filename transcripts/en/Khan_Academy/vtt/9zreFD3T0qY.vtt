00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:02.478
- So I have the polynomial p of x here,

00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:05.727
and p of x is being expressed
as a fourth degree polynomial

00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:09.479
times three x minus eight squared,

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:10.745
so this would actually give you some,

00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:13.090
this would give you nine x squared

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.321
and a bunch of other stuff,

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.795
and then you multiply that times this.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:16.943
It would actually give you a

00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:19.576
sixth degree polynomial all in all,

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:22.719
but our goal is to find the x values where

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:25.957
that makes p of x equal to zero,

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:27.770
or another way find the roots

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.266
or the zeros of this polynomial,

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.936
and in particular we're going
to focus on the real zeros,

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:36.221
the real roots of this polynomial,

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:39.162
and like always I encourage
you give a go at it,

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.019
and then we'll do it together.

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.900
Alright, let's tackle this.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.661
So, the way I want to solve
p of x is equal to zero.

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:50.410
I want to solve p of x is equal to zero,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.561
and figure out what,

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:52.885
and when I say solve it I want to say

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.718
well what x values will make
the polynomial equal to zero.

00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:58.339
So I just need to set this right hand side

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.942
to be equal to zero and then solve for x,

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:03.090
and the best way that I
can think of doing that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.934
is by factoring this out as much as I can,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.278
and if I can rewrite it as

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:11.482
a product of a bunch of
expressions equaling zero,

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:13.679
well a product of a bunch
of things equaling zero,

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.546
you can make it equal zero by
any one of them equaling zero,

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:18.067
and so let's do that.

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:19.599
So three x minus eight squared,

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.654
this is already factored quite nicely,

00:01:21.654 --> 00:01:23.837
let's see if we can
factor if we can factor

00:01:23.837 --> 00:01:28.430
all of this business in white,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.272
and the way I will tackle it

00:01:31.272 --> 00:01:34.465
to see if I can factor by grouping.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:38.215
So let me group together
these first two terms,

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:42.743
and then let me group together
these second two terms,

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:44.995
and essentially factoring by grouping

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.677
is doing the distributive
property in reverse twice.

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:50.672
So from these first two terms,

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:53.807
I could factor out,

00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:56.011
let's see what could I factor out?

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.730
I could factor out a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.332
let me see,

00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:02.549
I'll just factor out an
x to the third power.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.125
So I get x to the third power times

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:09.086
three x minus eight,

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:11.814
interesting we have a three x
minus eight over there as well

00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:14.788
Now these second to two terms,

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:19.067
I could factor out a five,

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:21.354
so this is going to be plus five

00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:25.259
times x, sorry, times three x.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.195
Three x minus eight, very interesting,

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:32.019
and of course I have these
parentheses around all of that,

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.177
and then I have three x minus 8 squared.

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:37.934
This three x minus eight
is showing up a lot,

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:41.554
and so and of course this is
going to be equal to zero.

00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:43.528
So we're gonna be equal to zero,

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:48.148
and now I can factor out a
three x minus eight over here,

00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:50.250
I could factor that
three x minus eight out,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.527
and I'm going to get

00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:55.380
three x minus eight times

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.492
times x to the third power,

00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:02.624
x to the third power plus five.

00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:05.526
Once again I just factor
out a three x minus eight

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:09.414
plus five, close the parentheses,

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:13.145
and then times three x minus eight squared

00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:15.488
is all going to be equal to zero,

00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:17.266
is all equal zero.

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:19.623
Now if what I just did
looks a little like voodoo,

00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:21.678
just realize I have two terms,

00:03:21.678 --> 00:03:23.652
both of them are multiples
of three x minus eight.

00:03:23.652 --> 00:03:25.254
I just factored out,

00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:29.120
I just factored out the
three x minus eight.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.523
I did distributive property in reverse,

00:03:31.523 --> 00:03:32.673
so I factored it out,

00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:33.950
and what you're left with this term

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.342
you just look for the next of third,

00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:38.438
and in this term you're
just left with a plus five.

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:41.672
Now three x minus eight times
x to the third plus five

00:03:41.672 --> 00:03:44.169
times three x minus eight squared.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.018
Well I could just rewrite this as

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.902
three x minus eight to the third power

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:49.306
times x to the third plus five,

00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:50.583
so let me do that.

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.797
So I can just rewrite this as

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:54.487
three x minus eight to the third power,

00:03:54.487 --> 00:03:56.472
that's that times that,

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.167
and then times

00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:02.010
times, do this in a nicer color,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.399
times x to the third plus five

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.920
is equal to zero,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.623
is equal to zero,

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:14.282
and now in order to get
this to be equal zero,

00:04:14.282 --> 00:04:16.778
either the three x either

00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:18.759
this thing is going to be equal to zero,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.990
or this thing over here is
going to be equal to zero.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.682
So let's first think
about three minus eight

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:29.154
to the third power equaling zero.

00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:31.291
So I can write this is as

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:35.967
three x minus eight to the
third power is equal to zero

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:42.499
or x to the third plus
five is equal to zero.

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:46.554
So to make three x minus eight
to the third power equal zero

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:48.816
well that means three x minus eight

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:51.103
is going to be equal to zero

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:54.110
or that three x is equal to eight,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.119
divide both sides by three,

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:58.037
x is equal to eight thirds.

00:04:58.037 --> 00:05:00.060
So that's one way to make
this polynomial equal zero,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.679
x is equal to eight thirds,

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:03.699
in fact just this right
over there will become zero,

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.627
zero times anything is zero.

00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:08.366
So this is a zero of our polynomial,

00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:10.036
and let's see,

00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:11.684
so x to the third,

00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:13.104
so we could say,

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.287
if we subtract five from both sides,

00:05:14.287 --> 00:05:15.551
we have x to the third is equal to the

00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:17.909
is equal to negative five,

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.382
and so if we take both
to the one third power

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:24.712
we could say x is equal to
cube root of negative five.

00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:25.792
Now at first you might say,

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.302
"Wait, can I take the square
root of a negative number?"

00:05:27.302 --> 00:05:28.788
and I would say, "Of course you can!"

00:05:28.788 --> 00:05:31.922
The cube root of a negative
one is negative one.

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:34.558
The cube root of negative
eight is negative two.

00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:37.820
In fact you could, even if
we're dealing with reals.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.457
This is going to be a negative number.

00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:42.214
This is not going to be an
imaginary number right over here,

00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:44.025
and so these are,

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:48.170
these are the two zeros of the polynomial.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.447
There's gonna be negative, I think,

00:05:49.447 --> 00:05:50.771
negative one point something,

00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:51.988
I'm sure we could figure out it,

00:05:51.988 --> 00:05:54.048
figure out it exactly.

00:05:54.048 --> 00:05:56.091
So let's raise,

00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:58.289
so let's raise,

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:03.849
five to the open parentheses,

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.819
one divided by three close parentheses,

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.326
is equal to,

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:10.606
so that's five to the one third,

00:06:10.606 --> 00:06:12.382
so negative five to the one third power

00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:16.782
is gonna be negative one
point seven one approximately.

00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:21.985
So this is approximately equal
negative one point seven one.

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:24.596
So we have two real roots,

00:06:24.596 --> 00:06:27.104
two real roots to this polynomial,

00:06:27.104 --> 00:06:30.679
or two zeros two real
zeros for this polynomial,

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:32.943
and so those are going
to be the two places

00:06:32.943 --> 00:06:36.287
where we intercept the x-axis.

00:06:36.287 --> 00:06:37.680
The two x values for which

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.269
where the two places where
we intercept the x-axis,

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:43.094
is the easiest way to say it.
