00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.350
- [Voiceover] It is given
that and they give us

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.720
the sine, cosine and tangent of 70 degrees

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.190
or at least they give us the
first few digits of them.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.690
And then they get into the
meat of this actual diagram

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.750
and the diagram above angle ABC

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.350
and angle BCD are right angles.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.620
Now they show us that right over here.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.920
This is angle ABC, angle BCD

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.490
and then they say that AC,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.640
segment AC is parallel to BD.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.920
AC is parallel to BD

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.590
and AB is parallel to CD.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.850
AB is parallel to CD

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090
and all of that looks
the way it was drawn.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.290
It looks like they're parallel as well

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.550
but it's nice that they're telling us that

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.090
otherwise we can't really assume that.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.520
Which of the following is
closest to the length of AB

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.990
and they give us some choices here.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.290
Let's think about it.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.320
They give us, we have
a 70-degree angle here

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.620
and they've given us the sine,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.350
cosine and tangent of 70 degrees.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.550
It feels like we should be
able to use that somehow.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.990
Actually if they were asking us

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.020
for the length of side CD,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.950
if they were asking us
for the length of side CD

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.390
we could immediately
apply our trigonometry.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.350
Because for this bottom right triangle,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.790
this triangle BCD we could apply

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.650
the SOHCAHTOA definition of cosine,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.720
which just remind ourselves.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.150
SOHCAHTOA.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.650
Sine of an angle is
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.710
Cosine of an angle is
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.120
Tangent of an angle is
opposite over adjacent.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.950
Well, over here for BCD,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.220
triangle BCD for this
triangle right over here,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.920
we know the hypotenuse.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.690
We know the hypotenuse,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.050
we know the angle

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.250
and if we were trying to figure out

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.750
what CD was equal to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.020
well, we would need to figure
out what the adjacent side is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.050
and I coul just call that lower case a.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.820
That would be the adjacent side.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.520
So what deals with
adjacent and a hypotenuse?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.810
Well cosine deals with
adjacent and hypotenuse

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.850
and if any of these looks
completely foreign to you,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.720
I encourage you to watch

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.510
the basic trigonometry
videos on Khan Academy.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.950
But we know that the cosine of 70 degrees

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.250
would be equal to the
length of the adjacent side

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.320
over the length of the hypotenuse.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.920
Over 8.9

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.990
or if you multiply both sides by 8.9

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.090
you have 8.9 times the
cosine of 70 degrees

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.050
is equal to the length
of this adjacent side,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.150
and they tell us what the
cosine of 70 degrees is.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.890
It's 0.3420.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.600
So you'd have 8.9

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.950
times 0.3420.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.950
If (mumbles) need to write that last zero.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.640
It keeps going on and on.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.450
Actually let me just write it there.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.590
I'll just write the
first couple of digits.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.850
That's going to be
approximately equal to a.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.720
This isn't exactly the
cosine of 70 degrees

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.850
but it's a pretty, it's
reasonably accurate.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.240
And so, if we look at this,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.050
this is roughly, this is almost eight

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.250
and this is a little bit more

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.190
or sorry, this is almost nine,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.820
and this is a little
bit more than a third.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.110
A little bit a third
of nine would be three.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.250
This should be, I don't know

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.290
I'm guessing a little bit,
you know, around three.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.950
If you look at the choices,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.590
well there is a choice.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.520
Whoops.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.250
There is a choice that looks
right around where we need.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.820
None of these other values
are even close to three.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.610
If we were trying to figure out,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.590
if we were trying to figure out

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.020
the length of CD we'd be done.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.890
I would say I would just pick,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.890
I would just pick this
choice right over here.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.020
But we're not asked just the length of CD,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.310
we're asked the length of AB

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.420
and you might say, "Hey look,
the way this figure is drawn,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.490
"AB looks to be the
exact same length as CD."

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.090
And maybe if you're under time pressure

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.520
you might be able to make that leap

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.340
and just go ahead with it

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.090
and bad things would not happen.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.190
But if you want to be a little
bit more rigorous about it,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.520
a little bit more sure,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.690
you'd probably want to
prove it to yourself

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.690
and that's where the
parallel lines come in value.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.690
Because what we're gonna do is

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.880
we're gonna prove that triangle BCD,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.350
what I've shaded in blue

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.140
is congruent to triangle ABC.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.750
We're gonna prove that they're congruent.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.990
We're gonna prove that they're congruent

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.520
by showing that they have,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.350
that their corresponding
angles are congruent

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.490
and that they have at
least one congruent side.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.510
The side that they share right over here.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.770
They both share this side.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.290
They both share that side.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.950
Let's prove that all of their angles,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.090
their corresponding angles are congruent.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.920
They both already have one right angle

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.150
and we can prove that
corresponding angles are congruent

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.250
by extending some of these parallel lines.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.350
I was thinking about
transversals and parallel lines.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.190
If those words I just
told you make no sense

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.450
I encourage you to watch the videos

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.170
on angles and transver...

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.490
Transversals and parallel
lines on Khan Academy.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.050
The first thing is I want to
see if I can establish that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.350
this thing up here, that angle BAC,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.910
that this is also 70 degrees.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.150
It looks like it but I'd like to prove it.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.220
One thing I could do is I could extend.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.900
Let me do it this way.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.590
So if I extended this line like that

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.190
and if I extend it, I'm
just doing this to help the,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.590
help you visualize the
transversal of parallel lines.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.650
And then if I extend this line,

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.690
this line like this.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.990
Now you see that if you're
thinking about line CD

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.750
it is a transversal across
these two parallel lines.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.150
When you look at it that
way you see that this angle

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.340
corresponds to this angle right over here.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.190
If this angle is 70 degrees

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.170
then this angle is also
going to be 70 degrees.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.950
Now if that angle is 70 degrees
now let's think about...

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.190
Now let's make AC into a transversal.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.320
Let me do something.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.780
Let me do it like this.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.100
Let me draw, let me extend this line.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.590
Let me extend this

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.090
just so you see how the lines intersect

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.200
and I could even extend to this one.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.650
Whoops, that's not what I wanted to do.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.540
Let me extend that one a little bit.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.790
It looks like this.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.520
And so you see, AC is a transversal

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.220
for the line AB and the line CD.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.790
Now we know alternate
interior angles are congruent

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.550
and this one is an
alternate interior angle

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.950
with this one right over here.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.520
This is 70 degrees then
this too must be 70 degrees.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.720
So now you've established.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.490
This angle is 90, this angle is 90.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.810
This angle is 70, this angle is 70.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.690
Well if two angles of a
triangle are congruent,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.070
the third angle is going to be congruent.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.490
All three of them have
to add up to 180 degrees

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.560
so this thing right over here.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.350
This thing right over, let
me just do a different color.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.950
This thing right over here,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.490
that's going to be 180 minus 90 minus 70.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.490
180 minus 90 is 90, minus 70 is 20.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.120
That's going to be 20 degrees

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.320
and by the exact same logic

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.520
this is also, this one also
is going to be 20 degrees.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.230
180 minus 90 minus 70.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.120
20 degrees.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.720
So, both of these triangles,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.790
all of their interior angles are the same.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.890
Their corresponding interior
angles are congruent.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.690
That by itself would make them similar

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.420
but then one of the corresponding sides,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.120
we know that that is congruent.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.690
Between the angles being congruent

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.920
and then the side being congruent,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.250
we know that the triangles
themselves are congruent.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.150
If the hypotenuse of this, of BCD is 8.9

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.150
then the hypotenuse of ABC
is also going to be 8.9.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.490
And now figuring out the length of AB,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.250
figuring out the length of AB

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.690
is exactly the same thing

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.920
as figuring out the length of C,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.720
is the same thing as the length of CD.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.420
These are corresponding sides.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.890
And since the triangles are congruent,

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.790
the length of AB is going
to be the same thing

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.350
as the length of CD
which is of course 3.04.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.980
This is what we started solving

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.920
at the beginning of the video.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.790
Now I wouldn't normally
suggest this to you

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.190
but you know, if you're taking a test

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.620
and if you're under time pressure,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.750
there is a, you know...

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.370
Well, this one actually was
drawn fairly close to scale.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.550
