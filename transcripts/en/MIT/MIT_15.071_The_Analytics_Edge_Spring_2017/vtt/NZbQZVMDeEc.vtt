00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.570
In this recitation
we will apply some

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.210
of the ideas from Moneyball
to data from the National

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.180
Basketball Association--
that is, the NBA.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.710
So the first thing we'll
do is read in the data

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.930
and learn about it.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.360
The data we have is located
in the file NBA_train

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.780
and contains data from all
teams in season since 1980,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.280
except for ones with
less than 82 games.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.590
So I'll read this in
to the variable NBA,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.930
NBA = read.csv("NBA_train.csv").

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.210
OK.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.550
So we've read it in.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.340
And let's explore it
a little bit using

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.460
the str command, str(NBA).

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.740
All right.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.290
So this is our data frame.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.110
We have 835 observations
of 20 variables.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.750
Let's take a look at what
some of these variables are.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.020
SeasonEnd is the year
the season ended.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350
Team is the name of the team.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.200
And playoffs is a binary
variable for whether or not

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.870
a team made it to the
playoffs that year.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.430
If they made it to the playoffs
it's a 1, if not it's a 0.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.620
W stands for the number
of regular season wins.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.680
PTS stands for points scored
during the regular season.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.610
oppPTS stands for
opponent points

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.990
scored during the
regular season.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.420
And then we've got quite
a few variables that

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.170
have the variable name
and then the same variable

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.580
with an 'A' afterwards.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:00.140
So we've got FG and FGA, X2P,
X2PA, X3P, X3PA, FT, and FTA.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.780
So what this notation
is, is it means

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.720
if there is an 'A' it means
the number that were attempted.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.090
And if not it means the
number that we're successful.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.860
So for example FG is the number
of successful field goals,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.220
including two and
three pointers.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.240
Whereas FGA is the number
of field goal attempts.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.579
So this also contains the number
of unsuccessful field goals.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.829
So FGA will always be a
bigger number than FG.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.340
The next pair is
for two pointers.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.130
The number of successful
two pointers and the number

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.610
attempted.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.980
The pair after that, right down
here is for three pointers,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640
the number successful
and the number attempted.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.370
And the next pair
is for free throws,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.380
the number successful
and the number attempted.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.900
Now you'll notice, actually,
that the two pointer and three

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.430
pointer variables have
an 'X' in front of them.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.590
Well, this isn't because we had
an 'X' in the original data.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.620
In fact, if you were
to open up the csv

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.920
file of the original data, it
would just say, 2P and 2PA,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.510
and, 3P and 3PA, without
the 'X' in front.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.180
The reason there's
an 'X' in front of it

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.360
is because when
we load it into R,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.110
R doesn't like it when a
variable begins with a number.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.870
So if a variable
begins with a number

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.790
it will put an 'X'
in front of it.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.650
This is fine.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.030
It's just something
we need to be

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.370
mindful of when we're
dealing with variables in R.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.600
So moving on to the
rest of our variables.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.970
We've got ORB and DRB.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.850
These are offensive
and defensive rebounds.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.120
AST stands for assists.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.130
STL for steals.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.020
BLK stands for blocks.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.900
And TOV stands for turnovers.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.410
Don't worry if you're
not a basketball expert

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.090
and don't understand exactly
the difference between each

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.520
of these variables.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.150
But we just wanted
to familiarize you

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.760
with some common basketball
statistics that are recorded.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.250
And explain the
labeling notation

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.060
that we use in our data.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.769
We'll go on to use these
variables in the next video.
