00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:03.937
Donald Trump's Supreme Court
nominee Neil Gorsuch--

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:07.107
or as I'm referring to him,
Blanderson Cooper--

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.177
faced his second
confirmation hearing today,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.945
and it's a very good thing
this is Comedy Central,

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.214
because he came ready to bring
with the laughs, people.

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.016
Take a look.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.452
She can teach a monkey
how to read.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.053
-I think she did.
-(chuckles)

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.722
I wrote this 800-page book on.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:25.125
Makes a great doorstop,
gift for Christmas.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.195
I cut a really bad deal
on royalties.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.130
The robe
does mean something to me,

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.567
and not just that I can hide
the coffee stains on my shirt.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.402
All right.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.938
He's already disobeying
the Constitution,

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.775
because these jokes are cruel
and unusual punishment.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.611
Comedians, he's clearly aiming
for a career as a stand-up,

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.413
so as a comedy club emcee,

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.882
I would like you to introduce
Neil Gorsuch.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.517
-(bell dings)
-Emily.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.252
Give it up
for your bar and waitstaff.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:53.954
They all just lost
their health insurance.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:54.054
-(laughter)
-Points.
