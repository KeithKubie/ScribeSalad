00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the closest thing to a correct answer here is to

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
download the set of routers from a trusted directory.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This has some pretty serious drawbacks though.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The other choice is, well, asking Alice. If Alice actually knew everything, it could work.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But not everyone can ask Alice.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Using SSL certificates would be a good way to get the public keys starting from some

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
root certificate authority to validate the public keys of the routers.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And that could be used as part of it. That doesn't tell you what the routers are though.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We need some way to identify the actual routers as well as their public keys.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We could send messages to the random nodes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This would work if a large fraction of the nodes on the Internet were Tor routers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We could also require that every router implements Tor.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This would be great, but it's not very practical.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So what actually happens is that there's a list of known routers on the network

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that can be downloaded from a trusted directory.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There's a big problem with this in that someone who wants to censor anonymous communication

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which a regime that someone is using Tor to get around might well want to do

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
can also find these nodes, and the censor can download the trusted directory as well

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and block all traffic to those nodes.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So this is a big challenge for networks like Tor to figure out ways to distribute the routers

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that is accessible and can be used by people that want to use it to communicate anonymously

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but isn't visible to a censor that would want to block all of those routers.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There's no known right solution to this, but I would encourage an open discussion

00:01:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
on the forum about ideas you might have how to solve this.
