00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
- [Instructor] Last video, we
got a little bit of practice

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.063
adding decimals that involved tenths.

00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:08.738
Now let's do slightly
more complicated examples.

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:11.905
So let's say we wanna add four to 5.7,

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:18.535
or we could read the second
number as five and 7/10.

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.223
Pause this video, and
see if you can do this.

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:25.533
The way that my brain
tries to tackle this is,

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.644
I try to separate the whole
numbers from the tenths,

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:30.846
so you can view this
as being the same thing

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:34.096
as four plus five plus 7/10.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.667
All I did here is I broke
up the five and 7/10

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:44.850
into five plus 7/10, and the
reason why my brain likes

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.003
to do that is because I can
then say okay four plus five,

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.726
that's just going to be equal to nine,

00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:54.629
and then I just have to add the 7/10.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.129
So it's gonna be nine and
7/10 which I can rewrite,

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.296
this is going to be
equal to nine and 7/10.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:08.730
Nine and 7/10 I could write as 9.7.

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.372
Even though in future videos
we're going to learn other ways

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.832
of adding decimals, especially larger,

00:01:15.832 --> 00:01:18.110
more complicated decimals, this is still

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.957
how my brain adds four plus 5.7.

00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:23.114
Especially if I need to do it in my head.

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:26.030
I say okay, four plus five
is nine, and then I have

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.197
that 7/10, so it's going
to be nine and 7/10 or 9.7.

00:01:31.627 --> 00:01:33.960
Now let's do another example where

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.856
both numbers involve a decimal.

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:38.773
Let's say I want to add

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:40.733
6.3 to 7.4.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.543
So 6.3 plus 7.4.

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:50.849
Once again, pause this video and try

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.784
to work through it on your own.

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:55.659
Well my brain does it the same way.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.880
I break up the whole
numbers and the decimals.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.516
Once again, there's many
different ways of adding decimals,

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.696
but this is just one
way that seems to work.

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:04.706
Especially for decimals like this.

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:08.784
So we could view this as six and 3/10,

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:11.623
so I'm breaking up the
6.3, the six and 3/10,

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:13.727
into six plus 3/10

00:02:13.727 --> 00:02:16.310
plus seven and 4/10.

00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:22.476
Seven plus 4/10, and then
this you can view as,

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:26.643
so you could view this as six
plus seven, six plus seven,

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:31.877
plus, plus 3/10, plus 3/10

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:38.129
plus 4/10, plus 4/10.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.857
If you add the ones here, you
have six ones and seven ones,

00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:46.024
that's going to be equal to
13, and then 3/10 and 4/10.

00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:49.040
If you have three of something
and then you add four

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.551
of that, that's going to be 7/10,

00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:54.471
and we would write 7/10 as 0.7.

00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:56.373
Seven in the tenths place.

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:59.096
Then what's 13 plus 7/10?

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:01.591
Well that is going to be 13.

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:04.424
This is going to be equal to 13.7.

00:03:06.705 --> 00:03:08.538
13.7, and we are done.

00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:15.723
Let me do one more example
that will get a little bit,

00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:17.922
a little bit more involved.

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:20.582
So let me delete all of these.

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:23.332
Let's say I wanted to add 6.3 to,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.990
and I'm gonna add that to 2 point, 2.9.

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:39.629
Pause the video and see if
you can figure this out.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.255
Let's do the same thing.

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:45.422
This is going to be six
and 3/10, so six plus 3/10,

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:49.399
plus two, plus 9/10,

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.370
or you could view this as six plus two,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.094
so I'll put all my ones together.

00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:01.241
Six plus two, and then I'll
put my tenths together,

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.739
plus 3/10, plus 3/10.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.645
Plus 9/10, plus 9/10.

00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:11.576
And so the six plus two
is pretty straightforward.

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.998
That is going to be equal to eight.

00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:17.911
Now what's 3/10 plus 9/10?

00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:20.932
This is gonna get a
little bit interesting.

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:24.543
3/10 plus 9/10, and I could write it out.

00:04:24.543 --> 00:04:28.710
I could say this is three
tenths, this is nine tenths.

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:34.178
Well 3/10 plus 9/10 is equal to 12/10.

00:04:34.178 --> 00:04:36.450
This is going to be 12/10,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.329
but how do we write 12/10 as a number?

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:43.496
Well 12/10 is the same
thing as 10/10 plus 2/10.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.488
The reason why I broke it up
this way is 10/10 is one whole,

00:04:50.488 --> 00:04:53.287
so this is going to be equal to one.

00:04:53.287 --> 00:04:56.056
When you add these two
together, it's 12/10

00:04:56.056 --> 00:04:59.930
which is the same thing as one and 2/10.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.651
So one plus 2/10 or, well let
me just write it that way.

00:05:04.651 --> 00:05:08.818
This I can rewrite as plus one plus 2/10,

00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:12.755
and then I think you
see where this is going.

00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:16.999
I could add the eight and the
one, and I get nine and 2/10.

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.332
So nine and 2/10.

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:22.668
So it's going to be 9.2.

00:05:22.668 --> 00:05:25.280
The reason why this one was a
little bit more interesting is

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.993
I added the ones, I got
six plus two is eight,

00:05:28.993 --> 00:05:30.769
but then when I added the tenths,

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:34.158
I got something that
was more than a whole.

00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:38.325
I got 12/10 which is one and 2/10,

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.474
and so I added one more whole
to the eight to get nine,

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:45.003
and then I had those 2/10 leftover.

00:05:45.003 --> 00:05:46.857
This is really good to understand

00:05:46.857 --> 00:05:48.781
because in the future when
you're adding decimals,

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.789
you'll be doing stuff like
carrying from one place

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.364
to another, and this is
essentially what we did.

00:05:54.364 --> 00:05:58.521
When we added the 3/10 plus
the 9/10, we got 12/10,

00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.239
and so we added an extra whole,

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:02.032
and then we had the leftover 2/10.

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:03.876
Hopefully, that makes some sense.
