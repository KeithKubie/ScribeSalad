ETHAN ZOU: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.880
Welcome to "Talks at Google."

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.520
My name is Ethan Zou.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.040
I'm a member of the
engineering staffing team

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.290
here in New York City.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.550
So in celebration of Asian
American Pacific Islander

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.920
Heritage Month, the
Asian Google Network

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.590
has partnered with
"Talks at Google"

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.820
to invite Christina Seid who is
the owner of the Chinatown Ice

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.730
Cream Factory.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.990
So for those of you who are not
familiar with the Chinatown Ice

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.650
Cream Factory, it is, you
guessed it, an ice cream shop.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.070
It's been in New York
for quite some time.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.700
And it's also one of the
landmarks in Chinatown.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.290
They serve some of the most
unique and authentic flavors

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.860
in New York City.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.360
It's been featured in
publications like the Times

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.720
Magazine, the New York Times,
as well as our very own Zagat.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.200
So just a little
bit about Christina.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.940
So now she is the owner of the
factory, the ice cream shop.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.106
And in addition to
her responsibility

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:10.410
in running the store and the
daily operations and planning,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.990
she is also a mother, a blogger.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.380
And she's also a very active
leader in the broader New York

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.800
City community.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.300
She serves on the advisory
board and committees

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.730
for many nonprofit organizations
like Asian Women in Business,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.340
Chinatown Youth Initiative, as
well as the coalition of Asian

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.910
Pacific Americans.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.700
So without further
ado, I would love

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.775
to welcome Christina to Google.

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:37.515
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:42.110
CHRISTINA SEID:
Thank you, Ethan,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.430
for that great introduction.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.510
ETHAN ZOU: Yeah, awesome.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.820
It's so nice to have
you here with us today.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.591
CHRISTINA SEID: I love Google.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.354
It's your food.

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:51.020
ETHAN ZOU: Yeah.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.530
The food here is
really, really good.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.346
And Google definitely takes
care of its employees.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.520
About your store, I actually
noticed that it's been around

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.280
for quite some time, right?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.896
CHRISTINA SEID: Yeah.

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:08.979
We're going on 39
years this year.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.060
ETHAN ZOU: 39 years.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.560
Wow.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.860
That is impressive.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.530
So can you just share
a little bit more

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.020
with us about the
history and what

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.814
you've seen the store going
through over these years?

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:21.230
CHRISTINA SEID: Well, my father
actually started the store

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.680
when he was a little shy of 30.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.760
In the same location,
originally, it

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.720
was a failed business-- a little
bit like a Panera or a Cozy.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.350
It was much more before
its time in Chinatown.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.370
So it eventually
went out of business.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.060
But in the late '70s, that's
when Haagen-Dazs, Carvel,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.560
Ben &amp; Jerry's-- where ice
cream was getting really hot.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.240
And that was the "in" thing.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.460
So my father wanted
to bring something

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.120
that was trendy, but more
for the neighborhood people

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.210
with more of a Asian palate.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.830
ETHAN ZOU: Yeah-- because I
was actually over at your store

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.590
not long ago.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.100
And I noticed that you guys
have some very exotic flavors

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.370
like-- well, actually in
the store on the menu,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.860
it says the original
flavors are like

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.910
lychee, mango, almond cookie.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.620
CHRISTINA SEID: The
regular flavors.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.947
It's supposed to be a joke.

00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:10.655
People are like, that
doesn't make sense.

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.321
It's supposed to be
what's regular to us

00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:14.630
is the lychee, the
red bean, the mango.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.032
And the exotic is the vanilla.

00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:18.240
That's what the tourists get.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.990
ETHAN ZOU: What do you love
about owning this ice cream

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.702
shop?

00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:26.202
CHRISTINA SEID: I
actually co-own it

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:29.020
with my father, who's still
around and very active--

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.380
knock on wood.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.970
He's 67.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.100
So I think it brings
him a lot of joy

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.450
to see that I'm
running it with him.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.380
And it's been so successful.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.740
Now, it's very "in" to
be in the food business.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.475
But back then, it was more like
a middle class or-- especially

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:50.590
in Chinatown, there
was no young people

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.880
who did restaurant work--
this was before Food TV.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.390
It was more considered
like menial labor.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.720
So people with college
degrees didn't really

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.600
do that type of work.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.320
My dad was actually
college educated.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.750
But he has the entrepreneurial
spirit for sure.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.090
ETHAN ZOU: Yeah, definitely.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.910
What inspired you to join
in this business with them?

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.090
CHRISTINA SEID: I don't know
if it was like-- it wasn't just

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.019
that one day I decided I'm
just going to join my dad.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.760
I've been working there
ever since I was 12 when

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.400
I was strong enough to work.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.010
And back then, we didn't
have many employees.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.020
And people asked me, oh,
your store is so busy.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.160
You had it so many years.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.450
Why don't you retire?

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.010
But we didn't make
money for many areas.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.730
New York wasn't what it was.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.790
Chinatown definitely wasn't
what it was-- what it is now.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.180
But as I grew older,
the store got busier.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.100
So my ambitions were always
catered around the store.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.674
When I went away
to college, my dad

00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:51.840
was forced to hire more
employees because he's like,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.910
oh, she has to college.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.467
But you have to
come home summers.

00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:55.925
And you have to
come home holidays.

00:04:55.925 --> 00:05:00.350
You can't go away because
you got to work the store.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.570
But as I got older, it
got busier and busier.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.330
So it just made sense for me to
go into a teaching profession

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.022
because I love children.

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:09.480
But also, you have
the summers off,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.230
and you have weekends
off, and nights off.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.320
And that's when
we're busy, right?

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.010
So it seems logical.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.580
So when I was teaching, I was
also working at the store.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.330
But then it just became too
much where I'm just like,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.220
I either have two jobs
or I have one job.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.580
And I just need to
focus on just having

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.420
one job because the work
life balance is just not

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.630
happening for me.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.430
So that's how it became.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.540
ETHAN ZOU: So you were
actually a teacher once.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.810
CHRISTINA SEID: I mean-- still
very active with children.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.895
I wrote a children's book.

00:05:43.895 --> 00:05:46.980
I'm on the advisory board
for the Children's Museum

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.090
of the Arts.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.060
I do different things.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.726
I work with the kids
in the neighborhood

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:52.430
depending on what's going on.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.300
But I don't think
I need to make it

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.220
my full-time job because
my full-time job--

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.764
obviously, the store.

00:05:59.764 --> 00:06:00.680
ETHAN ZOU: Absolutely.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.870
So you mentioned that
when you were younger,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.950
you were working the
store with your father

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.935
and that Chinatown was actually
much more different back then.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.030
What was it like, I guess,
working in Chinatown when

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.200
you were 12?

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.120
CHRISTINA SEID: I
really hated it.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.160
I really, really hated it.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.910
When my mom and dad got married,
people asked all the time

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.200
if I live in Chinatown.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.020
All my friends are in
Chinatown because I

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.250
have to work in Chinatown.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.490
Basically, my mom
made my dad move out

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.740
when they got married
to a suburb in Queens

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.980
called Little Neck.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.970
That's where I wanted to do
my Saturday morning cartoons

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.860
and play sports.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.830
That's what kids want
to do on the weekends.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.300
They don't want to be
dragged to Chinatown.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.990
I had a bag of fortune cookies
we had to like-- bag candy.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.040
Back then, our store used to
be more like half ice cream

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.230
store and half a candy shop.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.860
So that's where I started off.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.090
Nobody wants to scoop ice
cream and mop the floors.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.130
This is not what you picture.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.450
And this is called family help.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.640
This is not real help.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.140
So my dad gave me
$30 for 15 hours.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.570
That wasn't a good
deal back then

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.236
when I was 12, either,
letting you know.

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:17.400
It was not a good deal.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.850
Of course, I hated it.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.562
But my father
always said, if you

00:07:20.562 --> 00:07:22.020
don't like doing
this type of work,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.570
you have to study
hard in school.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.780
But then, when you work Saturday
and Sunday for 15 hours,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.210
you don't feel that
ambitious about school

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.900
because you don't
have energy to study.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.650
But I used to feel very angry at
my dad in the back of my mind.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.540
But then at the same
time, I was more

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.970
understanding because I
know my father wouldn't

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.920
make me go to work unless
he needed the help.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.820
But we weren't making
much money back then,

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.567
so it's just logical.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:48.400
ETHAN ZOU: And you
actually did both, right?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.865
You worked and
you went to school

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:52.005
completing your master's degree?

00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:52.880
CHRISTINA SEID: Yeah.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.500
I did.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.120
I did.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.578
ETHAN ZOU: That's
quite incredible.

00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:59.250
And when did you join
in on the ownership?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.420
CHRISTINA SEID: I think
it was like a little bit

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.030
after my master's degree.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.640
But even after my
master's degree,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.860
I still finished a PhD
certificate at ICE.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.910
And then I also went
to French Culinary

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.850
when it was called French
Culinary for a little bit.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.730
I think learning doesn't
stop when you just

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.870
finish a master's or
finish whatever degree.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.420
When you're learning, you have
to constantly be learning,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.461
whether it's Google
Talks or whatnot.

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:32.519
ETHAN ZOU: Reflecting
on your journey

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:35.643
as the co-owner of this
ice cream shop, what

00:08:35.643 --> 00:08:37.309
were some of the
things that you learned

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.760
and what was it like when
you initially took over

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.799
the business-- and
also your journey

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.070
from taking over to what
it is essentially, now,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.100
today, super famous--
line out the door.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.440
What was that like for you?

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.023
CHRISTINA SEID: I
think it's very cool

00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:54.520
that being an-- they called
it being an entrepreneur.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.410
When I did it,
nobody was doing it.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.070
So a lot of my
classmates from college

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.540
would say, oh, is it
because you can't get a job.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.500
Or is it like, why are you
working for your parents?

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.700
Nobody was doing food
business at that time--

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.490
because I'm dating
myself a little.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.550
But this is like-- I'm
a child of the '80s.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.090
So that's when Citigroup,
all the big corporations--

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.510
everybody wants to be a banker.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.120
Everybody wanted
to be corporate.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.227
But then, you see this
change in the shift

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.560
where everybody starts to
want to become their own boss.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.110
All these lawyers
want to quit their job

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.080
and have a food truck.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.910
And the Food TV
makes it [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.880
So now, it's like, oh,
you're an entrepreneur.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.790
You're a star.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.030
And I'm like, oh.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.330
I thought I just mopped floors.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.040
This is very cool for me.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.370
I won my first award.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.790
And Abigail Disney--
she gave me an award.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.040
And part of my speech was
this is the only award

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.290
that I've ever won in my life.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.790
I've always been
mediocre in school.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.350
This is so amazing.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.310
I think that from being a
shopkeeper that you could still

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.580
stick at something and you can
make it something great, which

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.710
is fantastic.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.910
ETHAN ZOU: Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.290
And I think when people
see success, what they see

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.414
is on the outside, which is,
oh, this is so glamorous.

00:10:05.414 --> 00:10:06.580
You're making so much money.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.740
The shop is doing so well.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.559
But rarely, do they think
about the hard work that

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:13.350
goes into the shop.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.260
So thinking back
on your journey,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.690
was there anything in
particular that was really

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.470
difficult and challenging.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.700
And how did you overcome
those challenges?

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.116
CHRISTINA SEID: I don't know
if it was just me personally.

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:26.540
But I think-- I don't
know how many of you

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.770
guys are New Yorkers or have
been in Chinatown in the '80s

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.280
or '70s or even '90s.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.838
The gangs were a very
big problem for us.

00:10:36.838 --> 00:10:38.546
But I think it's a
problem for everybody.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.990
When my family stood up to
the gangs, it was a big deal.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.015
People back then--
the Chinese people,

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:49.890
when they get their gold
for their weddings--

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.950
the gangs were so crazy that
they used to go to the weddings

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.420
and they just used to
rob and just take gold.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.205
And extortion was huge.

00:10:57.205 --> 00:10:58.700
A lot of violence.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.090
Caused a lot of disharmony
in my family actually.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.900
My mother wanted my father
to sell the business.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.030
Actually, I wanted my
father to sell the business

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.696
because, if you think your dad's
going to get killed, of course,

00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:12.260
you want dad to
sell the business.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.480
But it was against
his principles.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.660
And at that time, we also
weren't making money.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.360
It's one thing if
you get extorted

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.590
and you're making
a lot of money.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.320
But you're not
making money, why do

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.910
you want to keep the business?

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.500
But it was something that my
dad believed in, that he built.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.920
But I think as a family, as a
whole, it was very hard for us.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.900
And then sometimes,
my dad's victorious.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.750
But some days, you're dad's not
victorious and gets beat up.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.640
But I think I learned a lot
from that because you just

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.450
can't run from things.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.720
You just have to persevere.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.610
And I think after
that, slowly it

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.870
started cleaning up
after a series of not so

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.115
happy fights between my
dad and the gang kids.

00:11:54.115 --> 00:11:57.420
And there was one instance
where he stabbed one of them.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.920
And that was-- well, a
series of many things.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.170
But after a while, they
just-- it's kind of like being

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.920
bullied.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.710
It doesn't stop when
you're in school.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.250
It happens when you grow up.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.840
But after a series of
incidents, they just

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.565
started extorting
other people, not us.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.840
And slowly, New York
has been cleaned up.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.210
So luckily, everything after
that seems kind of like cake.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.547
So that's really like real.

00:12:22.547 --> 00:12:24.630
ETHAN ZOU: What was that
like for you having gangs

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.190
coming to extort you and
then building up to the point

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.380
where that incident happened?

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.440
CHRISTINA SEID: Well,
I feel fortunate.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.810
When I was about 12,
when I started working.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.110
It was bad, but they
laid off us a little bit.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.140
Because I'm a girl
and I was young,

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.040
when they try to cluster
in front of your store

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.770
to scare people away from
doing business with you

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.660
or they try to
intimidate you, it's

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.070
better that I talk to them
instead of my dad, I found,

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.470
because they could get
into more confrontations.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.520
So I try to use the girl
factor-- I'm a kid factor.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.050
It's like, oh guys,
sorry, I think

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.554
you're blocking my doorway.

00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:07.970
Usually they just
feel bad for me.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.053
So they go somewhere else.

00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:12.350
But sometimes when they get
into things with my dad,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.340
it's not that cool.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.090
ETHAN ZOU: That must
be quite challenging.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.900
I mean, at the time, I can only
imagine what that looks like.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.570
CHRISTINA SEID: It used to
be so bad that-- I remember

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.150
we used to park our car
so far by the Brooklyn

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.375
Bridge on Delancey Street.

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.500
I don't even know if that's
the name of the bridge.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.720
It's so bad.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.470
But by Delancey Street.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.150
And we have to
walk to Chinatown.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.060
And when we used
to take my sister.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.200
I remember my dad used to carry
a gun under the baby carriage.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.820
This is Chinatown in
the '80s and '90s.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.370
It just was not that great.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.670
As a shopkeeper, it
just was very rough.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.428
ETHAN ZOU: Well, I'm really
glad that New York is not

00:13:53.428 --> 00:13:55.022
like that anymore.

00:13:55.022 --> 00:13:56.730
CHRISTINA SEID: But
I feel extremely safe

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.370
now in Chinatown.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.244
People are like, how do
you walk home at 4:00

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:01.330
in the morning from your shop.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.066
I was like, dude,
this is so safe.

00:14:05.066 --> 00:14:07.780
ETHAN ZOU: I mean, it's
really hard to imagine.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.119
I go there all the time.

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:10.660
CHRISTINA SEID: It's
super safe, now.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.785
ETHAN ZOU: It's super safe.

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:16.000
So I guess, now, that
the city is much safer--

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.960
and also going
back to the growth

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.820
that your store has seen, that
your community has experienced.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.880
How were you able to, I
guess, take the business

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.110
and really grow it building
up to what it is today?

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.950
CHRISTINA SEID: I
see other families

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.900
where the second generation
tries to take over.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.360
And it's not such a
happy transition as well.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.400
I think because my dad
and I have worked together

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.870
for so long, we have
a real understanding

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.190
of where we fit with each other.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.050
I think my dad knows
where his place is.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.300
And I know where my place is.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.770
I think we have a common
goal to grow the business.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.080
And we really know the business
because I'm there all the time.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.130
You asked me earlier, do you
actually work at the store?

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.260
I was like, yes, I'm like
seven months pregnant.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.814
And I'm still moving
ice cream and scooping.

00:15:12.814 --> 00:15:14.980
One of my employees-- she
looked at me and she says,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.290
how do you even move?

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.911
How do you even scoop ice cream?

00:15:17.911 --> 00:15:19.410
Doesn't your stomach
get in the way?

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.450
I'm like, yeah, it does.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.976
But I still do it.

00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:27.320
I think physically being there,
understanding your customers'

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.620
needs, what people want.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.050
They want durian ice cream.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.170
And I mean, that was our
most requested flavor.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.210
And we were like
hedging away from it.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.250
For those of you that
don't know what durian is,

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.230
it's very stinky.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.610
It has its own preparation.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.430
We have to treat everything
separately with durian.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.990
But just being there and knowing
what your customer wants,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.890
how they feel, how
your employees feel-- I

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.790
think that's all been
really helpful with growing

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.834
the business.

00:15:56.834 --> 00:15:57.750
ETHAN ZOU: Absolutely.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.840
So interesting that you
mentioned the durian ice cream.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.910
So I was really
curious, so what were

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.650
some of the
inspirations behind some

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.550
of these very exotic flavors?

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.050
CHRISTINA SEID: Do you want to
know about the durian or just

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.927
in general?

00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:14.260
ETHAN ZOU: Well, I'd love to
hear more about the durian.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.150
But I'd also love to
hear about them all.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.240
CHRISTINA SEID:
The durian is-- we

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.890
have a lot of Southeast
Asian customers

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.230
and a lot of Chinese customers.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.170
And they all love durian.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.378
It's either you really love
it or you really hate it.

00:16:25.378 --> 00:16:28.160
It's like stinky tofu.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.870
But we were just
hedging away from it.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.160
We don't want to touch durian.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.260
It's going to stink.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.750
But then, eventually we made it.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.320
And we got used to
the preparation.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.430
My husband's Filipino.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.020
So if you know any Filipino
people, what they love to do

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.290
is that-- it's
been a huge seller.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.300
I never understood why
[? Maylaiwa, ?] the roast pork

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.580
place across the way that
was like so popular--

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.414
but they don't just buy one
quart of durian for themself.

00:16:53.414 --> 00:16:55.330
They're like-- oh, my
sister would love durian

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.770
and my cousin loves durian.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.270
So I'm going to buy like
10 quarts of durian.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.170
So this has been a huge seller
for us for the southeast

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.930
Asian population because
it's something that they love

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.660
but that they want to share
it with their family as well.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.056
So that's been fantastic
for us-- the durian.

00:17:11.056 --> 00:17:13.246
ETHAN ZOU: Do you
see lot of, I guess,

00:17:13.246 --> 00:17:16.329
non-Southeast Asians trying
out the durian flavor?

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:17.400
CHRISTINA SEID: Yeah.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.609
People, when they think that
we have exotic ice cream--

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.640
we do have exotic ice
cream in the sense

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.400
that we try to make new flavors.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.810
But whatever flavor
we decide on,

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.430
we have to make sure that--
even if you hate durian,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.100
that it tastes really
good-- that you still

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.350
would find it palatable.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.160
Andrew Zimmermann
from Food TV-- he

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.480
always talks about
how he hates durian.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.500
And he says, oh, I hate durian.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.010
It's the worst thing ever.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.830
But then he eats
crabs from the sewer.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.670
The name of the show
is "Bizarre Foods."

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.260
Durian is not that
bad compared to eating

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.061
like lamb brains or something.

00:17:52.061 --> 00:17:53.852
So when he came and he
tried our ice cream.

00:17:53.852 --> 00:17:55.770
And he's like, well, actually,
your durian ice cream

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.650
is like-- I hate durian,
but the durian ice

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:58.770
cream is pretty good.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.400
And that was a sign of a
true chef-- making something

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.015
that someone doesn't like and
making it palatable for them.

00:18:05.015 --> 00:18:05.640
ETHAN ZOU: Wow.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.692
That's very cool.

00:18:07.692 --> 00:18:09.650
CHRISTINA SEID: So that's
made me really happy.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.030
I was like straight on.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.540
ETHAN ZOU: So
perhaps, the next time

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.320
you're in the neighborhood, you
should definitely try a scoop.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.610
Also very curious on
the flavor pairing.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.790
Do you have any recommendation
in terms of maybe pairing

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.180
two different flavors or
the combination of a few

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.110
has yielded a interesting
or a good pairing?

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.800
CHRISTINA SEID: Well,
our signature cakes

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.346
are the lychee red bean mango
cakes or a variation of that.

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:40.560
Lychee, read bean, and
mango, or lychee, red bean,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.740
and green tea.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.030
We just do a tremendous
volume on our cakes.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.180
And actually, most of the
people who buy our cakes

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.250
are not from Chinatown.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.170
They bring it to Jersey.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.740
They bring it to Queens.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.430
And for any of you guys who live
a little bit outside the city.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.920
It's kind of cumbersome to
carry something so heavy.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.540
And it's perishable.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.785
But people-- we sell hundreds
of cakes a day for a small shop.

00:19:01.785 --> 00:19:04.550
And that's a lot.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.220
That's a lot.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.750
About 80% to 90% of our cakes
are the same combination,

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.070
even if people could select
their own flavors, which

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.410
is pretty interesting.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.020
You just think that, oh, if
you just make one flavor off

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.770
that people would
like that cake.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.820
But that combination seems
like it's the winner.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.090
ETHAN ZOU: That sounds
really interesting.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.600
I could talk about ice
cream and cake all day.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.072
But I'd love to
switch the subject

00:19:30.072 --> 00:19:36.090
and hear a little bit about your
involvement in the community.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.770
What's been your
inspiration to serve

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:43.100
on all of these nonprofits
and advisory boards on top

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.540
of your work at the store?

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.540
CHRISTINA SEID: I think
it's our obligation

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.760
to give back to the community.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.770
I think I've been less
active because I'm a mom

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.106
and I'm pregnant, so
obviously my energy is less.

00:19:58.106 --> 00:19:59.730
But I think it also
breaks up your day.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.515
And it makes you a
better person in general.

00:20:03.515 --> 00:20:05.640
The other day, I just got
so wrapped up in my work.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.020
And I'm like, oh,
man, it's so busy.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.310
And we all have those moments.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.100
We're like, shit,
we're having a bad day.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.201
Sorry, I said that aloud.

00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:15.200
Or like, oh, I need to
get a drink or something.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.010
And then you look
at your belly--

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.135
like, I can't have a drink.

00:20:21.072 --> 00:20:23.720
But then I was
checking my emails.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.060
And then I got an email saying
that the elementary school down

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.715
the block was
doing a fundraiser.

00:20:30.715 --> 00:20:32.590
We're very active with
the elementary school.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.960
They helped to redesign
our storefront.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.360
I work with some of the kids.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.390
And they said that they're
having a fund raiser.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.680
So then they were
asking if they could

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.570
have some gift certificates
because they're

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.600
doing this raffle.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.910
And this other organization
asked me to go to their gala.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:47.890
But I couldn't make it.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.750
And I said, oh, would you like
this for the silent auction--

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.740
just to be part of
that and to remember

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.600
that there are different
causes and involvement.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.620
I can't be as involved
physically serving on boards.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.755
But I could maybe help
through ice cream,

00:21:02.755 --> 00:21:06.690
or charitable donations,
or whether it be advice,

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.750
or whatnot, or coming to talks.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.720
I've done a lot of talks
on during APA month.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.839
My calendar's pretty packed
with events during APA month.

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.672
ETHAN ZOU: We're very
glad to have you here.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.970
What would you say was your
most memorable experience

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.934
from serving in the community?

00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:30.225
CHRISTINA SEID: Most memorable.

00:21:33.384 --> 00:21:34.250
That's a hard one.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.772
That wasn't on your list.

00:21:36.772 --> 00:21:39.090
ETHAN ZOU: Throwing
you a curve ball there.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.131
CHRISTINA SEID: Most
memorable-- This is actually

00:21:41.131 --> 00:21:43.615
one I haven't gotten before.

00:21:43.615 --> 00:21:44.490
ETHAN ZOU: That's OK.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.405
We can come back to
that later perhaps.

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:47.280
CHRISTINA SEID: Yeah.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.850
We can come back that one.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.700
ETHAN ZOU: So obviously,
you've seen a lot

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.440
of changes in the community.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.590
I'm going back to what you
were saying about how you've

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.060
seen the Chinatown change.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.220
And how the whole city has
gotten rid of the crime.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.870
Where do you think are
some of the biggest

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.970
challenges that the community
is facing now and specifically

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.099
within the API community?

00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:17.890
CHRISTINA SEID: API
community or Chinatown?

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:18.806
ETHAN ZOU: Or broader.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.130
CHRISTINA SEID: I think we're
increasing in our population,

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.400
obviously, in New York
City, which is great.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.610
I think we're doing a
pretty good job overall

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.170
with growing different
organizations, and whatnot,

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.470
and getting involved, and
creating affinity groups.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.104
But I think that
some help-- that

00:22:42.104 --> 00:22:43.520
might help from
the corporate side

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.930
would be maybe some
more matching programs--

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:51.300
corporate matching-- some
more support on their side.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.548
But I think it's kind
of a broad question.

00:22:53.548 --> 00:22:54.048
Yeah, sorry.

00:22:57.535 --> 00:23:00.040
I think voting is pretty big.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.970
I think the vote-- people
need to be more involved

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.050
with voting-- the Asian
population for sure.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.510
People need to recognize that--
will recognize a lot more

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.280
of our needs if we vote more.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.747
Doesn't matter who you vote for,
it just matters that you vote.

00:23:14.747 --> 00:23:16.060
ETHAN ZOU: Absolutely.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.180
I think that's really important
given that New York City has

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.460
really seen an increase in
Asian American population,

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.612
as well with the big
election coming up.

00:23:27.612 --> 00:23:29.070
CHRISTINA SEID:
Nobody in my family

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.690
eats until everybody votes,
even local elections.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.590
It's very important.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.270
It doesn't matter
who you vote for.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.810
We need to be recognized
as a voting bloc.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.750
ETHAN ZOU: Absolutely.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.950
Absolutely.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.707
So just in a few minutes, we'll
open up the floor for Q&amp;A.

00:23:44.707 --> 00:23:46.290
So if you have some
questions that you

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.280
would like to ask
Christina, you can

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.410
feel free to go ahead and
line up at the mic now.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:57.660
So going back to the ice cream
because I love it so much.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.320
Can you tell us more
about the process

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.470
and then the work
that really goes

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.860
into making this ice cream?

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.902
Do you guys make it in-house
or is it outsourced?

00:24:05.902 --> 00:24:07.776
CHRISTINA SEID: They
actually make everything

00:24:07.776 --> 00:24:10.020
on premises, which is pretty
impressive considering

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.000
we only have 550
square feet on top

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.200
and 550 for production space.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.570
And we have a huge volume.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.880
Each ice cream flavor has
a different preparation.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.090
So I think that's
fantastic because it's just

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.120
kind of proprietary.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.370
It's just me and my dad
that prep everything.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.730
But I think a lot of it
comes from also inspiration.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.100
Zen butter is one of
our more popular flavors

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.640
where it may be like
you wanted to go back

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.340
to like knowing where
the inspiration came from

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.610
or-- zen butter is actually
not something that's

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.810
Chinese in the sense
like-- people think,

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.580
oh, it's like zen, like z-e-n.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.110
And then butter.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.130
So it's actually peanut butter
ice cream with sesame seeds.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.754
So I grew up with this
guy when I was younger.

00:24:57.754 --> 00:24:59.920
And he always used to bug
me to make a peanut butter

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.074
flavor for him.

00:25:01.074 --> 00:25:03.240
And I can't just make a
peanut butter flavor for you

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.440
because it doesn't fit
in line with our brand.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.740
So his name was Chris
Tzen, with T-z-e-n.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.580
And then one day I
was eating at what's

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.950
[? Xi'an ?] Foods, right now.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.720
But it used to be a
restaurant owned by my friend.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.910
And she used to make
peanut butter noodles

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.300
with sesame seeds, which is
a [? cold ?] peanut butter

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.300
and sesame seed noodles.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.140
ETHAN ZOU: So good.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.220
CHRISTINA SEID: So it's
like more Shanghai dish.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.560
So I was eating.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.620
And I was like all, oh, this
is really cold and delicious.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.860
It's peanut butter
and sesame seeds.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.280
So in his honor, I decided to
create the name zen butter.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.220
But instead of a
t-z-e-n, it's z-e-n.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.690
So people think it's like
this like-- so that's

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:44.920
one of the inspirations.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.260
But whenever I eat
something, I get inspired.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.750
So I eat lot of
different things.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.000
I think a lot of
entrepreneurs-- sometimes

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.990
they just get so wrapped
up in their business,

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.790
they only eat their own food.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.456
I like to try everybody's food.

00:25:58.456 --> 00:26:00.580
ETHAN ZOU: And also you're
in a good place to try--

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:00.950
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.522
CHRISTINA SEID: Yeah,
it's New York City.

00:26:02.522 --> 00:26:03.470
ETHAN ZOU: It's perfect.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.428
CHRISTINA SEID: I love
eating out, experiencing

00:26:05.428 --> 00:26:06.450
different things.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.908
ETHAN ZOU: That's
also good to know

00:26:07.908 --> 00:26:10.390
that, I guess, for
your inspiration,

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.770
you just pick it up from
the smallest things in life.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.670
And I guess, I'm also
hearing a little bit,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.324
if I bug you enough, you'll
make another flavor in my name.

00:26:18.324 --> 00:26:19.240
CHRISTINA SEID: Maybe.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.224
Maybe.

00:26:21.224 --> 00:26:22.810
ETHAN ZOU: Very cool.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.890
So at this point, any
questions from the audience?

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.242
Oh, hey.

00:26:27.242 --> 00:26:29.200
AUDIENCE: So maybe we'll
see the next ice cream

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.540
flavor will be the Ethan.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.890
So thanks for coming in.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.630
It's really exciting to
hear from you, especially

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:37.847
from a local perspective.

00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:39.430
And I think everybody
loves ice cream.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.660
So thank you so much for
also kindly bringing it

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.390
all for us to try.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.790
My question is more
for entrepreneurs.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.030
You mentioned there's a
lot of people like-- food,

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.360
and food shops, food trucks.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.050
That's like the
thing now, right?

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.200
And I see, especially in
the LES and Chinatown,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.030
a lot of new places coming up.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.070
What would you say in terms of
what would your best advice be

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.666
for budding entrepreneurs
in the food space,

00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:02.040
especially here
in New York City?

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.510
CHRISTINA SEID: I think it's
important to make whatever

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:13.230
food that you're designing for
your business not too faddish.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.170
I feel like New York City
is like the land of fads.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.250
It's this fad or that fad.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.160
I think when my father
started the Ice Cream Factory,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.450
he was really
innovative for his time.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.090
Back then, nobody
was flavoring food.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.550
This is like the late 70s.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.980
Nobody had green tea ice cream.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.771
People didn't even know
what green tea was.

00:27:30.771 --> 00:27:32.820
This is before Snapple
made green tea cool.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.770
Now, green tea-- you
can have it anywhere.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.690
People would ask,
what's green tea?

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.270
Now everything's so faddish.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:45.520
You see on BuzzFeed, oh,
that they have a rainbow this

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.650
or like-- I just think that's
fads-- they come and go.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.270
People will line
up for like a day.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.880
These pop ups-- they come
all the time, which is great.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.740
Pop ups are great.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.140
And I've attended them.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.200
But I don't know if it's
enough to be a main business.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.929
So I think that when you make
your food in New York City,

00:28:01.929 --> 00:28:04.470
you have to make it something
that people will just generally

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.140
love and that they'll come back
for more, not something that's

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.940
just a one stop shop.

00:28:12.428 --> 00:28:13.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.071
CHRISTINA SEID: Thanks, Ashley.

00:28:19.342 --> 00:28:21.210
AUDIENCE: My name's Carlin.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:21.980
Thanks for coming.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.720
This is great.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.960
I wanted to ask, on a
lighter note, what's

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.300
your favorite ice cream flavor?

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.330
And do you eat a lot
of your own ice cream?

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.300
CHRISTINA SEID:
I love ice cream.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.530
I'm an almond cookie girl.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.140
Almond cookie is
my favorite flavor.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.260
I do eat a lot of it.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.172
The only ice cream I
have left in my house

00:28:36.172 --> 00:28:37.630
is mint chip because
that's the one

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.260
thing my husband doesn't eat.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.180
He eats everything
else in the freezer.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.280
My daughter is three, now.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.980
But she's been eating ice cream
since she was six months old.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.247
I know some people
had issues with this

00:28:49.247 --> 00:28:51.205
because you're not supposed
to start whole milk

00:28:51.205 --> 00:28:51.850
til you're one.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.980
But she's never gotten
sick and she's three.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.388
So I attributed to that all--
the ice cream is healthy.

00:28:59.388 --> 00:29:00.240
Eat more ice cream.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.480
You'll have a happy life
and healthy children.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.650
ETHAN ZOU: That's how I
feel or my justification

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:12.194
when I finish a whole tub.

00:29:12.194 --> 00:29:13.610
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming again.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.620
Quick question.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.890
You mentioned green tea.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.010
It's everywhere like
this matcha flavors.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.880
Everything.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.175
What do you think is
the next big thing in--

00:29:24.175 --> 00:29:25.784
CHRISTINA SEID:
The next big thing?

00:29:25.784 --> 00:29:27.950
I feel like in New York,
everything has kind of been

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.910
done, which is a little
bit bad because, now-- I

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.210
had this flavor that was
like strawberry rhubarb--

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.290
no, strawberry balsamic.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.469
And everyone's like raving
about it like, this is the best.

00:29:40.469 --> 00:29:41.510
It's strawberry balsamic.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.510
I was like, you cannot clearly
tell me you taste anything

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.350
balsamic in it.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.370
They just add the word
balsamic and everybody's

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.020
raving about it.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.510
So I think that-- like
what Ashley's question

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:59.045
about not making food
palatable for entrepreneurs.

00:29:59.045 --> 00:30:00.670
You have to make
something that's good.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.830
It's not just trendy.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.800
Oh, it's balsamic.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.425
Because it's just
strawberry ice cream.

00:30:06.357 --> 00:30:07.065
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:30:07.065 --> 00:30:07.480
CHRISTINA SEID: No problem.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:07.979
Thanks.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.020
AUDIENCE: I'm probably of a
slightly younger generation.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.590
So it was kind of crazy hearing
you talk about Chinatown

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.780
back in the day.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.180
I'm curious to know from the
perspective of the Ice Cream

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:29.780
Factory, how has it evolved
as Chinatown evolved.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.390
CHRISTINA SEID: I
think right now, it's

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.815
kind of cool to see-- whenever
you see like a grandma

00:30:35.815 --> 00:30:38.394
or like a papa or something,
you always just think,

00:30:38.394 --> 00:30:40.060
oh, she's going to
get lychee ice cream.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.410
But now, you see them,
like, oh, I want rocky road

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.480
or I want red velvet.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.360
So I think my father always used
to say that food is the best

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.830
introduction to culture.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.862
So back then, if
somebody ate lychee,

00:30:50.862 --> 00:30:53.070
you would feel like, oh, I
introduced them to lychee.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.400
But now, you're seeing
the reverse culture

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.940
where you're seeing people
who are real neighborhood

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.940
people trying more American
flavors or things that they

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.740
might not try outside
the neighborhood

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.845
because they feel
comfortable with us.

00:31:06.845 --> 00:31:09.210
So that's been pretty cool.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.220
The neighborhood has changed a
lot in the sense-- or New York

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.870
has changed a lot.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.570
When I took over my
family's business--

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.850
there was no young
people in Chinatown.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.030
Now, a lot of the
businesses are starting

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.083
to be owned by young people,
which is pretty cool.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:25.916
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:28.744 --> 00:31:29.666
ETHAN ZOU: Cool.

00:31:29.666 --> 00:31:30.590
This gentlemen--

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.756
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:33.800
I'm a big fan since 1990,
I think, of your store.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.240
CHRISTINA SEID: Yay.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.300
AUDIENCE: So with the
success of the store,

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.760
I'm wondering if
you feel pressure

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.970
to open other locations
like many business.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.717
CHRISTINA SEID: I knew
this question was coming.

00:31:42.717 --> 00:31:43.800
AUDIENCE: And why do you--

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.981
CHRISTINA SEID:
--which is awesome.

00:31:45.981 --> 00:31:48.570
I get requests for
this all the time.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.960
A lot of people want
to buy franchises.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.960
Or they want to
partner or whatnot.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.020
In my 20s, I felt very
pressured to feel like, oh,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.570
where's the right space
or when's the right time.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.670
I think it just doesn't feel
organic to me, right now.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.990
People think that if you
just have more stores,

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.740
you make more money or that
it's a growing business.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.770
It's growing in the sense
you have two stores.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.170
But for me, I think
I really don't

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.490
want the quality to go down.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.240
And some things are
not about money.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.080
It's just that I
really want to maintain

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.215
the integrity of the store
that my father built.

00:32:26.215 --> 00:32:28.840
And not right now.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.810
I think if it felt very organic
and everything was right.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.410
But I'm not going to open
one just because-- just

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.784
to open-- like Flushing
is the big neighborhood.

00:32:37.784 --> 00:32:39.950
Everyone's like, why don't
you have one in Flushing?

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.764
I was like, it just
doesn't feel right.

00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:48.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, Christina.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.740
Thanks for coming to Google.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.180
As Ethan said, the Google
food is really good.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.800
But we don't really
have ice cream.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.550
So you mentioned--

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.216
CHRISTINA SEID: Gotta
work on this, man.

00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:00.350
AUDIENCE: --your ice cream
make employee happier--

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.950
improve working efficiency.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.140
Do you see any possibilities
like [INAUDIBLE] in the future.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.640
CHRISTINA SEID: I
think there should

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.790
be a study done on that-- maybe
equating efficiency with ice

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.170
cream eating, possibly.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.052
Yeah.

00:33:14.052 --> 00:33:15.135
ETHAN ZOU: That's awesome.

00:33:15.135 --> 00:33:15.770
I also--

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:16.800
AUDIENCE: --happy to test that.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.840
CHRISTINA SEID: So
what's your flavor?

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.140
Have you been to the Ice
Cream Factory before?

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:19.765
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:19.765 --> 00:33:20.500
The green tea.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.390
CHRISTINA SEID: The
green tea's your flavor?

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.300
Yeah. green tea's pretty solid.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.410
ETHAN ZOU: I also hope that
our kitchen staff is here, too,

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.300
so they heard this question.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.381
We also happen to have some
flavors in ice cream here

00:33:34.381 --> 00:33:34.880
today.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.260
Thanks to Christina
for bringing it over.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:45.920
So today, we have
green tea, lychee,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.160
and, your favorite,
almond cookies.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160
CHRISTINA SEID: Oh, yes.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.020
That's great.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.686
ETHAN ZOU: Yeah.

00:33:50.686 --> 00:33:52.940
So thank you
everybody for coming.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.800
And thank you, Christina, for
our being a gracious guest.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.466
CHRISTINA SEID: Thank
you for having me.

00:33:57.466 --> 00:33:59.798
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.652
ETHAN ZOU: I hope everybody
can stay for a few minutes,

00:34:03.652 --> 00:34:07.390
maybe go with us, hang out,
and have some ice cream.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.170
Thank you.
