When we talk about
HTTPS, we are actually

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.049
talking about two
different concepts--

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.689
HTTP and TLS,
formerly known as SSL.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.619
We already know about HTTP and
TLS stands or Transport Layer

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.849
Security.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.689
TLS is not specific to HTTP,
but any protocol can use it.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.000
For example, there
is FTPS, which

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.070
is FTP with TLS to
transfer files securely.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.089
TLS encrypts
communication in a way

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.210
that can't be read by anyone
else other than the intended

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.350
recipients.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.460
In practice, it is impossible
to break a TLS encryption.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.920
To ensure that you're talking
to the server you intend

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.289
to talk to, TLS
utilizes something

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.149
called the chain of trust.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.369
A server identifies
itself with a certificate

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.099
that contains both a little
metadata about itself

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.920
and the fingerprint
of an encryption key.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.049
These certificates are issued by
one of a handful of certificate

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.159
authorities.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.009
If that certificate is
signed by such an authority,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.550
you know that if the key you are
using matches that fingerprint,

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.609
then you're talking
to the correct server.

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.379
The list of
certificate authorities

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.780
can actually be
found in the browser.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.960
You could even add your very
own authority if you wanted to.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.329
What you see here are
mostly companies that you

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.950
can buy certificates from.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.140
They cost money as they not
only validate your server,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.120
but also validate your identity
as the owner of that server.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.160
Since not every
developer can or wants

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.229
to pay money for a
certificate to offer

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.200
basic security to the
users, Let's Encrypt

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.530
has come into the market and
offers certificates for free.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.230
Let's take a closer look
at how certificates work

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.890
and the security they provide.
