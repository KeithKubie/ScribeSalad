00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.354
- [Voiceover] In a
survey of a random sample

00:00:02.354 --> 00:00:05.052
of 1,500 residents aged

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:08.583
25 years or older from
a particular county,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:12.545
399 residents had a
bachelor's degree or higher.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:16.772
If the entire county had 635,000 residents

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:19.141
aged 25 years or older,

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.613
approximately how many county residents

00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:25.456
could be expected to have a
bachelor's degree or higher?

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:27.454
All right, so we have this random sample.

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:29.705
We randomly sampled 1500 folks,

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.417
aged 25 years or older.

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:35.176
We find out that 399 of them

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:36.911
have a bachelor's degree or higher.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:40.620
So of our sample, 399/1500ths

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.571
have a bachelor's degree.

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:46.543
Now the entire county has 635,000.

00:00:46.543 --> 00:00:49.524
635,000 residents

00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:52.150
aged 25 years or older.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.278
So when they're saying approximately,

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:55.566
so we're gonna estimate in here.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.019
How many residents could be expected?

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.555
Well, since this was a random sample,

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:03.320
you would expect that the same
fraction of the random sample

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.699
that that would be
approximately the same fraction

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.974
of the general population
aged 25 years or older,

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:12.040
that would have a
bachelor's degree or higher.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.480
So we could just take this fraction

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.219
and multiply it times
the entire population

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.286
to have a good estimate of,

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:22.175
or good expectation for the total number

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:23.975
of folks with a bachelor's
degree or higher.

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:26.433
So we could just multiply this.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:27.933
Now, there's two things going on.

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.229
We really just want to
get an approximation,

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.063
and the good thing is is we have

00:01:32.063 --> 00:01:33.487
multiple choices right over here.

00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:35.159
And these are fairly spread out,

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.479
so we could round some
of these numbers here

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.942
to simplify this a little bit.

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:42.648
So this is going to be
approximately the same thing.

00:01:42.648 --> 00:01:45.841
399 is awfully close to 400,

00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:49.324
so it's gonna be
approximately 400 over 1500

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:52.327
times 635,000.

00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:54.858
635,000.

00:01:54.858 --> 00:01:58.843
And that's approximately
the same thing as let's see,

00:01:58.843 --> 00:02:01.728
four over 15.

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:04.224
I divide the numerator
and denominator by 100

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.452
times 635,000.

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.510
635,000.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.914
Let's see, I could multiply
all of this out if I want,

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:13.544
but this quantity right over here,

00:02:13.544 --> 00:02:14.543
that's gonna be...

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:18.061
So this is what we're, if I could just,

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:20.105
we could figure what that is,

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.927
but once again, we're just approximating.

00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:23.899
So this is gonna be greater than.

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.766
If I just made this at 600,000,

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:26.835
and I'm just gonna do that.

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:30.409
Just 'cause it's kinda close to 635,000,

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.020
and 15 goes into 600,000 nicely.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.676
So whatever quantity this is,

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:38.614
this is going to be greater
than four times 600,000

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.988
over 15.

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:42.892
And once again, I went
to 600,000 just to make

00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:44.830
my math a little bit easier,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.558
and because 15 goes into
600,000 nice and easy.

00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:51.872
'Cause 15 goes into 60 four times.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.798
So if you divide the numerator
and the denominator by 15,

00:02:54.798 --> 00:02:58.965
this becomes a one and
then this becomes 4,000.

00:02:58.965 --> 00:02:59.905
Or sorry, 40,000.

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:02.103
Instead of 600,000, you're at 40,000.

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:05.237
So this boils down to,

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:06.225
maybe I'll cross out this.

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:07.371
This is 40,000.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.161
So it's gonna be four times 40,000,

00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:14.262
which is 160,000.

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:17.059
So our approximation's gonna
be greater than 160,000,

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.533
and there's only one choice here

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:21.758
that is greater than 160,000.

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:23.143
And if you were to multiply this out,

00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:25.118
you would get even closer to

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:29.239
169,000.
