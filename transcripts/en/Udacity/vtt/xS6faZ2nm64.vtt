Now, we're at our final step in coming up with an equation for Grant. So, we can

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:09.024
eventually help him figure out how much it cost to make one wiper set. We have

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.561
four equations up here in our what we know section. And that may look like a lot

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:18.266
if information to handle at once, but using substitution, we can pretty easily

00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:22.810
create one equation that involves all of these things. So look at this equation

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.015
right here, the last word equation we came up with, and think about how these

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:31.145
pieces of information fit in here. Substitute them into the right spots, and

00:00:31.157 --> 00:00:33.505
then type your final equation into this box.
