00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.110
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Hello,
my name is David Plylar

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.810
and I'm a music specialist
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.050
It is my great pleasure to be here
today with Paul Lewis, pianist,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.090
who is playing at the library.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.740
Mr. Lewis, you have a long and
distinguished career already

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.170
and your focus during
that time has been largely

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.200
on two composers, Beethoven
and Schubert.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.400
Your work with Beethoven involved
recordings and performances

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.700
of all 32 piano sonatas,
as well as the concerto

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970
and the Diabelli variations.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.630
Can you just say a bit about
what that journey was like?

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.030
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: I wish I could say
something intelligent about it,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.460
but the thing is it feels
like it's still ongoing.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.730
It's hard to say what the journey
feels like really when you are kind

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.930
of still in the middle of it
in a sense, because it's hard

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.030
to step away from it and look at
it with some kind of detachment.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.540
It's -- the two years I spent
with the Beethoven sonatas,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.920
like the last two years I spent
with mature Schubert piano music,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.560
has just been the most incredible
time really musically, you know.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.130
I mean, this is music that I feel
it's the core of my repertoire.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.250 position:56%
I'm lucky enough to be able to spend
this time concentrating, you know,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.640
specifically on these two composers
or to have periods where I do that.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.540
Some people say to
me, "Don't you find

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.300
after a while you want
a bit more variety?"

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.780 position:56%
But I think this is the whole point.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.380
The range within these two
composers is really something

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.680
quite extraordinary.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.930
And the longer you spend with them
the more you realize what they

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.230
span really.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.390
The -- it's difficult to describe.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.160
The longer you spend with the music
the more you realize how much you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.460
don't know.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.770
So, the end of this two years,
for instance now with Schubert,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.590
it feels like I'm just
starting in a way.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.010
I'm just sort of getting into
it in a way, after two years.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.780
And it will feel strange to
move on and do something else.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.200
But in another sense it's
necessary to do that as well.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.650
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Well, in --

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.780
before you did this massive
Beethoven project you had been

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.260
involved with Schubert before.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.760
You had produced a few
recordings at that time.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.680
So, in a sense you are kind of
living that what you just said,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.470
that you are coming
back to it again.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.530 position:56%
How -- do you find that your playing
is informed in a different way

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.850
after that Beethoven
project, of Schubert?

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.770
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: I think Beethoven's
a great teacher in many ways.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.650
Again, it's difficult
to step away from it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.870
and see how your playing
has changed.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.170
Only -- I don't listen
to my own recordings.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.370
It's just too difficult to
listen to one's own recordings.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.510
But next month I'm rerecording
the C minor Schubert sonata,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.280
which was on my first
CD 12 years ago.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.320
So, I did listen to that and it's
quite astonishing how much it

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.620
has changed.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.760
You don't notice it much in the
process, but when you listen back,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.640
yeah, lots of things have changed.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.350
It's all about balance really, it's
all about trying to find a balance

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.600
that you think makes sense and
that you think is convincing

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.320
of all the different
elements within these pieces.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.620
And I suppose, you know, as
you play them for years and go

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.100 position:56%
through your life living with them,
that balance is constantly changing.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.260
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Almost like
a lifelong gestation process.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.730
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Exactly.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.030
Yeah.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.810
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: That makes
me think of the, you know,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.720
comparing Beethoven and Schubert,
contemporaries in many respects.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.080
Almost exactly, except for
Schubert's short lifespan,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.850
towards the ends of the lives.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.340
Schubert is often compared to
Beethoven in ways or looking

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.310
for influences in Schubert of
Beethoven on him and other things

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.390
like that, perhaps unfairly when
he has such an individual voice

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.870
and I think I -- or maybe you
could speak to that a little bit.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.950
What is unique about his --
say with the piano sonatas,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.920
versus the Beethoven sonatas?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.070
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: yeah, I think
it's true, the comparison

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.870
with Beethoven is often made,
but I think if you're looking

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.170
to compare Schubert with Beethoven
in that sense you have Beethoven

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.200
as the standard by which
Schubert is judged.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.060
Schubert comes out second, not
because the music is inferior

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.060
in any way, because
it's not Beethoven,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.460
it's completely different.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.760
And the more time I spend with both

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.170
of these composures the more
I see the differences rather

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.470
than the similarities.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.520
And I've always felt that
one of the big differences

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.910
between these two composures that
Beethoven often seems to resolve

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.410
in a way the end of a
great work of Beethoven.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.190
You feel that you've
arrived somewhere.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.110
You are at the end of a journey
that's a sense of resolution.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.100
Whereas with Schubert
it's very rarely the case.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.260
I don't think Schubert
tries to do that at all.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.100
Quite often you end up
with more questions hanging

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.990
in the air than you started with.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.800
And I think that's really
fundamental to the nature

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.680
of the music of these
two composures.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.330 position:56%
And that even for that soul reason
it's very difficult to compare them.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.290
I think you have to judge
them by their own standards.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.550
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Well, no,
that makes sense to me.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.390
With Schubert's publication
history, post --

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.200 position:56%
or not to get into it explicitly --
many of his works were not published

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.960
in his lifetime and so, the process
of dissemination was delayed,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.910
whereas with Beethoven it
was a different situation.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.800
With the piano sonatas, even
into this century, you know,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.820
you don't see them as
often on as piano recitals

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.360
as one might like to see them.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.860
Where do you see that now in terms
of his recognition among your peers

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.940
or as pianists looking
at Schubert's work?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.240
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: I think
that there's --

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.900
for sure there's been a shift

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.550
in the way we perceive
Schubert over the years.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.060
At 100 years ago these Schubert
sonatas were still very much

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.920
neglected, they were
largely unknown.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.320 position:56%
I think it was Schnabel that brought
them into the concert hall and then

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:12.370
after that Alfred Brendel
later in the 60s and so on.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.800
But even then I so -- it's
only some of the later sonatas

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.360
that really became I suppose
you could say mainstream.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.930
A lot of the others
remained neglected.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.750
I think it's different now.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.200
I think we see Schubert, the
composer, in a different light.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.490
We see that he is not this
traditional Gamucklick [phonetic

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.130
spelling] cozy composer of salon
pieces, over the, you know,

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.150
the miniatures that he wrote,
of course, still great music.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.700
But the large scales, the
sonatas and the symphonies

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.470
and the bigger pieces of
chamber music, I just --

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.070
it's just wonderful, great music.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.030
We see that he's in
many ways the darkness

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.840
of Schubert I think has come more

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.060
into our understanding
of him as a composer.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.350 position:56%
Perhaps there was also a time
recently where he was seen primarily

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.380
as a dark tormented composer
and I think that's come

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.020
into a different kind
of balance now.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.440
So, yeah, 200 years later
we're still finding a way

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.850
to understand Schubert.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.940
And it's fascinating the
way that it goes, I think.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.760
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Well, I
thought we could take a look

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.160
at a few manuscripts.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.290
We've got a couple
of small items here.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.180
The first being the
autographed manuscript

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.970
of Beethoven's Opus
109, E major sonata.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.220
When one encounters -- this is my
first time seeing this manuscript

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.460
myself and it's --
there's a certain sense

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.180
in which one feels a certain --

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.240
you can see kind of the process
of composition unfolding in front

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.440 position:56%
of you, literally with certain types

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.590
of amendments, edits,
things like that.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.770
You having performed and
recorded this particular piece,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.590
do you have any initial
reactions on seeing it?

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.240
We can take a look
at other pieces too.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.160
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, I'm
just overwhelmed basically.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.980
I saw this for the first time.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.320
I knew I was going to see it, but
then when you see it you think,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.660
"This is it, this is
the real thing."

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.140
There's just absolutely
astonishing really.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.440
I mean, it comes alive.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.280
There's such a life to it.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.000
Which it's hard to describe and
it's hard to grasp in a way.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.010
I just noticed here in the
first movement there was a bar

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.460
in the middle of a long line.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.300
He appears to have added a
bar almost as an afterthought,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.250
which changes the sense
of that line.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.950
It's, you know, of course,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.740
only seeing the manuscript you
would realize things like this.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.640
It's really incredible.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.940
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: One other
thing that starts to come

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.470
up as you look are the
different types of markings,

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.650
the different sizes of, you
have your forte written out

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.460
and very clearly here
just to make sure

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.760
that you know what is
supposed to happen.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.060
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:34.380 position:56%
Yeah, later with -- later Beethoven
he became more and more prescriptive

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:42.330
in the way he wrote and what
one can easily see that here.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.780
It's actually a lot more organized
than I thought it was going to be.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.210
It's clearer.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.170
Because I have some --
I've seen some manuscripts

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.530 position:56%
of middle period Beethoven, which
are incredibly chaotic and they sort

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.930
of scream at you in
a way off the page.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:06.270
And this somehow more detailed
and there's a clarity to this.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.180
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Now, with
this particular sonata,

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:19.840
it features the variation set at
the end, this is how -- this is --

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.950
maybe you're thinking of
this in relation to Schubert

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.560 position:56%
where you had mentioned earlier that
Beethoven tends to take the material

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.290
and win at the end
in some way, to some.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.600
This particular piece has
a different sort of ending

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.960
where the triumph is almost in
a return or a sense of calmness.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.260
I don't know.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.560
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: But maybe that's an
example of just the kind of breadth

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.800
that is there in the
Beethoven sonatas.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.100
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.700
I think the feeling of resolution
comes out in different ways

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.590
in different periods of
Beethoven's compositions.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.150
In the middle period,
of course, they --

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.340 position:56%
you often get this sense of triumph.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.780
In the later period I
think it's different.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.200
There's an intimate
introspective quality to this.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.970
But you still feel that --

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.610
especially at the end

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.280
of the variation movement
there is a sense of resolution.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.930
You feel that it doesn't
need to carry on.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.290
It's come to a conclusion.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.510
Whereas many of the Schubert's
last movements one feels

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.380
that they could -- there's more
of a story sometimes to be told.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.300
Whereas this one doesn't feel
like -- the end of 110, of course,

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:36.100
you have this euphoric
very emphatic ending.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:42.340
And then in 111 it seems to just
rise above to a different sphere.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.150
So, I suppose these last three
sonatas you get these three

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.600
different types of
resolving, of resolution.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.600
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: And maybe a good
example of Schubert's feeling

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.050
like it could be going on to
a different thing is it sort

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.830
of circular feeling that a major
sonata, where when it comes back

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.300
to that material, that
feeling of the beginning,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.600
at the very end of the book.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.900
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.470
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: It almost feels
like it could start again or move

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.840
into some different territory.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.140
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.440
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yeah.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.230
Well, that's -- maybe looking at
this work I believe is written

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:21.730
around 1820 and the
sonatas that you're playing

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.550
with as Schubert were
written around -- in 1828.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:32.270
Maybe to look at a couple of other
samples here, one thing would be

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:38.600
to look at to segue into Liszt's
as a disseminator and champion

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.880
of both Schubert and Beethoven.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:49.180
What we have here first is a just
one leaf of his transcription

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:54.960
of Gretchen am Spinnrade, which
was published as Schubert's opus 2.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.910
And it's not the first
page, but it's --

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.210
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.360
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: It's
incredibly tidy.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.190
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: That
was my reaction too.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.320
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.760
Compared to other Liszt manuscripts
it definitely has that sense

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.310
of clarity and execution.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.680
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah and
containment in a way.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.410
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yeah.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.790
And I believe that this
transcription was done

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.390
in 1837 or 1838.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:47.170
But, of course, the work itself
was written in the teens.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.460
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.360
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: But
Schubert as a vehicle --

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.460
I'm sorry, Liszt as a vehicle

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:59.310 position:56%
for Schubert I think he
transcribes close to 50 of his songs

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.670
and this was one of
the more famous ones,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.330
famous as a transcription as well.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.630
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:16.820
I think one gets a sense of Liszt's
real genuine love for Schubert,

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.850
not only with the songs, but
he also transcribed, of course,

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.460
the "Wanderer" Fantasy
as a piano concerto.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.850
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: We actually
have that too I believe.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.150
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: You have that here?

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.450
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yes.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.750
I should have thought to
have brought that out.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.050
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: You
see, I've played that.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.350
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Oh, you have?

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.200
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: I mean, I've
played the Liszt's transcription.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.040
It works incredibly well.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.050
I mean, the thing about it is

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.310
that when you hear the way he
orchestrates in a way it's sort

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.110
of what you hear in
the original, you know,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:49.270
it's exactly what you imagine
that the original piano what

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.240
"Wanderer" fantasy would sound
like if it were orchestrated.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.410
It's so -- it's just very
perceptive and tastefully done.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.710
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: I agree.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.440
And that particular
piece was of, of course,

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.000
the greatest importance
to Liszt as a composer.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.300
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.600
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: From the
standpoint of what it taught him

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.380
about thematic transformation.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.920 position:56%
And one sees that in all of his many

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.440
of his works, major
works after that.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.740
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.260
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yeah,
that's what I should have --

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.540
next time you come we will
have to show it you for sure.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.330
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Wonderful, yeah.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.860
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Of course,
Liszt's advocacy of Schubert,

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.940
along with the advocacy
of people like Schumann,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.930
who I believe was the
editor for the first edition

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.830
of the three sonatas
that you are playing at.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.240
And we have -- and we'll
have a first edition

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.510
on display tomorrow,
which will be nice.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.810
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Fantastic.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.480
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Liszt did not need
to advocate as much for Beethoven,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.160
whose reputation was pretty
much established, however,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.420
he had a very strong affinity for
his music, both in performance

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.190
as a pianist and as an
adaptor of his works.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:00.650
And just for fun we
brought out a transcription

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.530
that Liszt did I believe in 1878.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.910
So, quite late of Beethoven's
fourth piano concerto,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.420
which I understand is a
particular favorite of yours.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.720
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.170
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: And, so, I thought
we could take a look at that next.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.470
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: That's great.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.770
A particular challenge.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:25.720
And I think Liszt was
very incredibly generous

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.330
about all the composer's work.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.200
I think to an extent one
doesn't normally find

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.900
with other composers of the...

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.200
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yes.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.060
Absolutely.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:41.500
Especially and sometimes that came
back to haunt him a bit in terms

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.830
of reputation, because people would
question his spending that amount

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.920 position:56%
of time on these types of endeavors.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.220
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.340
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: However, many
of these are absolutely unique

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.950
and interesting and
viable performance works.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.250
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.550
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: I
have not heard this one

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.320
in performance, so
I was very curious.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.650
But one thing you'll notice as
we take a look a bit farther in,

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:11.280
is that the parts are divided
up amongst the two pianos.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.080
The solo part is not there.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.070
And it's interesting to
see how Liszt chooses

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.110
to make those divisions and
also how he chooses to write

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.330
about what one should be
listening for and playing.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.630
It's clearly a labor of labor.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.790
I mean, at this point, you
know, he didn't need to do it,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.060
but it was a piece that he
cared a great deal about.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.880
And I believe he did
this for the third,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.120 position:56%
fourth and the fifth piano concerto.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.840
We have the fourth and the fifth.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.140
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Right.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.650
Okay. There you have it again,
when he writes string quartets

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.530
and then indications as to
-- I mean, of course, it's --

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.070
he's transcribing it as --

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.570
from a orchestral piece
into two piano work.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.310
But still he's constantly thinking
in terms of color and what one --

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.680
the sounds one should
be or try to be making.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.980
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Right.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.280
And that was the process
that he used

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.210
for the Beethoven symphony
transcriptions was he was very

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:11.610
careful to include those
indications as to what might think

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.910
about as you're playing it in terms

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.940
of what orchestral
instruments are involved.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.240
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.540
Can I turn the page?

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.840
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.770
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Is there a way to
do it -- I'm very nervous about it.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.220
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Another
interesting thing about --

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.170
in this case, this is not as --

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.330
because it's not an original
composition there aren't as many,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:40.510
you know, paced overs or crossed
out things, but you do see

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:45.040
that he's using different colors
and this is extremely helpful

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.500
when he's been proofing or
just to show different thoughts

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.890
at different points in time.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.190
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.690
I don't know this well enough.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:06.690
Are there any modifications
to the text that he makes?

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.520
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: From what
I can tell and, again,

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.500
my first exposure to
it was yesterday.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.060
So, from what I can tell the types

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.900
of modifications really are more
occasional octave additions.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.710
But the things that are
just more for color,

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.140
as opposed to texture
-- actual text changes.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.440
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.060
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: From what I
can tell, I haven't studied it,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.910
but let's look maybe
a couple more pages.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.210
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: I'm interested,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.150 position:56%
because with the Wanderer fantasy
transcription occasionally he adds a

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.130
cadenza at a cadence point.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.850
That kind of thing.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.150
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Right.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.530
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: I'm wondering
what he does in the last movement

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.080
of this with those lead ins.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.380
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: I'm not sure.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.680
But I do know that he references

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:52.240
that one should use the Von Bulow
credenza in the first movement.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.660
I believe.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:01.060
I think we had -- we can
-- over here's actually --

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.990
just referencing the bassoon line.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:13.120
I can't quite read all
of those words, but --

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.910
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, to bring
it out against the semi-turn.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.780
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Yeah.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.710
But he wants to make sure
that this is understood.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.770
Now, I know you generally
just use Beethoven's credenza

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.080
in your performances of the
Beethoven's concertos that correct?

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.380
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.590
Where the credenza exists
I generally do play.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.700
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.500
The only one I have felt strange

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.920
about in the past is
for the second concerto.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.310
That was written much much
later and it does sound --

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.620
I mean, the big credenza

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.600
for the first Beethoven
concerto was also written later,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.020
but that's somehow seems
to feel more integrated

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.320
into the character of the movement.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.290
Whereas the one for the
second, for the B flat,

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.010
it feels like you're launching
into the Hammerklavier sonata

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.020
and then coming back
to something, you know.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.320
Much earlier.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.540
But, so, that's something I've
kind of struggled with in the past,

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.000 position:56%
but I think these days I just think,
no, you just play it as it is.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.970
You don't have to modify -- it
really I think speaks for itself.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.540
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Right, right.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.910
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Ah,
something different here.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.350
Is this the same --
no, this is a copyist.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.800
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: That's
a copyist, yes.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.490
And then just Liszt's corrections.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:33.030
And I believe it's
referring to a different spot.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:39.930
I think as we go just
a bit further is the --

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.960
-- the development.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.470
So, this point he's
still being an advocate

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.140
for his erstwhile son in law.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.440
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Absolutely, yes.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:13.190
Someone I met in Japan recently
handed me a Stenhammar cadenza

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.490
for this.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:15.790
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Wow.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.090
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:22.020
And various things, there's
a I think a fore credenza

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.730
for the third piano concerto.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:28.000
I mean, all these absolutely --
completely forgotten [inaudible].

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.580
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: That would be an
interesting compilation just to --

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.880
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.750
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: We don't have

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:45.060
as many composers today
retroactively writing these

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.740
credenzas for his earlier works,

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.170
but in some ways that's its own
tradition that he's a bit lost now.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.840
But, again, I think not
often maybe as successful

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.550
as the original composers.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:01.850
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.280
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: A fruits.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.580
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Okay.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.450
He did here.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.520
Vita hold.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:16.350
Okay, doesn't specify, he doesn't
write out a credenza there.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.160
That is wonderful.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.340
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: I thought maybe
just as one more manuscript

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.240
to take a look at, since
we've segued into Liszt,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.640
just taking a look
at a late Liszt work.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.380
Representing a wide variety
of types of pieces here.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.640
This is something from
I believe 1872

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.570 position:56%
from the third Annees de Pelerinage.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.890
Suns lacerable variorum
[phonetic spelling]

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.040
and this is actually I believe
it's an earlier version,

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.620
it's not the same as
the published version.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:04.800
But from this manuscript we have
a better sense of Liszt's process

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.000
of revision and second
thoughts, paced overs.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.080
Even at the very opening of
the piece it's paced over.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.750
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.050
Work in progress.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.500
I mean, that's what
brings it to life.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:25.520
You can almost see the
thoughts coming from the page.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.520
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: And again,
I think from the perspective

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:35.410 position:56%
of posterity it was nice of Liszt to
use these different colors and to --

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: these are later
editions, the different colors than?

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.770
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: I believe they
were there just to help to edit --

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.070
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Write.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.220
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Are there any
particular late Liszt works

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.590
that you were interested in
or considering performing?

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.450
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
for my next program

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:09.080
after the Schubert is finished I'm
playing three late Liszt pieces

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.230
in a program with --
second half with Mussorgsky,

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.530
pictures and exhibitions.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.440
So, before the Mussorgsky there's
Schaufloce [assumed spelling],

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:25.300
there's Unstern and
there's the Wagner Venetsia.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.890
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Oh, great.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.180
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: so, that's
yeah, three pieces, three weird

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.190
and wonderful pieces
to precede Mussorgsky.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.060
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: that's fantastic.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.360
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.780
You don't have the
manuscripts for --

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.080
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: I
don't have those three.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.470
We do have the five
pieces, the late pieces --

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.770
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Oh, really?

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.430
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: including
Suspire and, yeah.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.730
And we do have a few.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.950
We have the historical
Hungarian portraits.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:59.010
Some other pieces like
that are in that vein.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.900
The Toccata, real late Toccata.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.640
I'm trying to think
of some other ones.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.610
Yeah, we'd be happy to let you know
exactly what we have at some point.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:10.910
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Wonderful.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.210
Great.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.900
And what one feels with the
late works it's pure expression.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:25.750
It's just distilled expression
with nothing to dress it up.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:30.950
And I'd be very interested to see
more of those manuscripts, because,

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.940
again, having seen some
facsimiles of earlier Liszt's,

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:41.100
I have the B minor sonata facsimile
at home and some things from before

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.660
that and there is a kind
of energy that comes out.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.000
I'd be interested just to
see what kind of energy

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.370
that comes off the score
of the very late pieces.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.080 position:56%
I expect it might be very different.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.380
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: I think so.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.180
Especially when you get
there's a piece called,

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.930
"Resignation," that we have.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:03.060
So, maybe it was a
good demonstrate side.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:12.940 position:56%
Well, I think just to close, looking
ahead beyond some late Liszt,

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.500
Mussorgsky, what other interests --

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.290
I know that you feel that this is
a continuous journey that you're on

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.880
and so I'm assuming you're
revisiting certain works

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.390
or maybe even certain whole series
of works, but what other types

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.770
of interests do you
have for the future?

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.740
We're not going to
hold you to it, but?

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.040
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: No, no.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.490
Well, the next few years, so the
Mussorgsky, late Liszt, Bach,

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.650
Puccini, coming back
to some Beethoven's.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.810
Brahms' D minor concerto I played
for the first time at the end

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.840
of this month, which
I can hardly believe.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.740
Yeah, so it's a mixed bag.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:54.110
In the next few years I'm
also coming back to Haydn

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:58.790
and I'm considering maybe doing
a sort of Haydn project, because,

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:03.620
I mean, this wonderful
rich music and, you know,

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.130
there's a lot of Haydn which I
also feel can often be overlooked.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.430
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Absolutely.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.560
One doesn't find it represented
in recital programs very often.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.860
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.160
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: For sure.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Maybe just one or two

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.370
of the well-known sonatas,
but outside that...

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.890
So, that's something.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.790
I'm also considering the picking

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:28.050
up the Roibcur [phonetic spelling]
sonata, which of course he was one

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:32.550
of Liszt's favorite pupils,
died when he was in his 20s,

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.790
left just a handful of pieces.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.380
There's the organ, there's
the great organ work,

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.390
there's this piano sonata.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.690
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Should we mention

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.690
that sonata I believe is
written just a few years

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.300
after Liszt's B minor sonata.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.600
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.080
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: It's the
work of B flat minor, I think.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.500
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: that's right.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.970
And there are similiarities
for sure.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.650
It's about the same length.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.340
It's a similar kind
of form that it has.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.340
In fact, the original end
to the B minor sonata,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.110
which was this very
strong fortissimo ending.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.700
The Roibcur has that
and you feel it.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.790
It's sort of modeled a little
bit on the Liszt sonata,

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.960
but with the original end.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:23.210
But it's also it's very much
its own original thing as well.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:29.100
And it's just a wonderfully
heartfelt work and I feel

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.290
that that clearly is something

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.340
that doesn't get played
very often and deserves to.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.200
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: One gets a
sense of, even though many

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.600
of these composers, Roibcur
aside, perhaps are well-known

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.800
to audiences generally, there's
a sense of advocacy in your work

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.700
that comes through when
you're playing, I believe,

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.640
in a sense of really communing with
the work and getting to know it

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.370
and that's something

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.200
that we definitely very much
appreciate about your work.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.610
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: thank
you, thank you very much.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.780
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: So, I'd
just like to thank Paul Lewis

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.700
for coming today and
speaking with us.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.830
And best wishes for the future.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.380
&gt;&gt; PAUL LEWIS: thank
you very much, pleasure.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.930
&gt;&gt; DAVID PLYLAR: Thank you.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.590
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
