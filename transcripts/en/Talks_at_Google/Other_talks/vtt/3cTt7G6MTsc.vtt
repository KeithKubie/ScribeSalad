[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have a dream
that one day all companies will

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.100
compete not only to be
the best in the world,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.545
but the best for the world.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.100
Others share this
dream and have begun

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.960
to turn the dream
into a community.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.170
This community signed a
Declaration of Interdependence

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.790
and invited others to join them.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.510
Now more than 900
companies from 29 countries

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.820
are turning our community
into a global movement

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.170
to redefine success in business.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.540
B Corporations use
the power of business

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.000
to solve social and
environmental problems.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.580
An eyewear company that
disrupts an industry

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.290
and serves the poor.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.640
A food service company that
serves over one million meals

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.090
to low income public
school students every week.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.230
A manufacturer that goes
green and helps workers

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.030
move from welfare to a career.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.930
An online bookseller
that recycles

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.970
used books and funds local
libraries and global literacy.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.746
An outdoor apparel company
that stewards the environment.

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:26.065
An ice cream company that
maintains its mission

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:26.565
post-sale.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.290
B Corp is a certification
that helps consumers identify

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.210
these changemakers and
investors make money and make

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.900
a difference.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.320
As a community we are passing
laws across the country,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.180
creating a new kind
of company that

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.150
serves society and shareholders.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.850
We are leading a global movement
of people using business

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.760
as a force for good.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.020
Join us.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.900
Be the change.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.545
[END MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:01.780
HOST: Good afternoon.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.960
Thank you guys so
much for joining us.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.620
We have a really
exciting plan for you

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.509
to talk to some members
of B Corporations

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.280
and learn a little
bit more about B Lab

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.150
and what B Corporations do.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.840
We're thrilled to be here,
we've had a really nice morning,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.730
and we're so excited that you
took time out of your busy day

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.790
to come and hear
some of our speakers.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.720
So as the video pointed out,
certified B Corporations

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.730
are corporations that
meet higher standards

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.690
of social and environmental
performance, transparency,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.530
and legal accountability.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.480
As of January 2014 there are
more than 920 certified B

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.780
Corporations from over
60 countries, industries,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.750
and 29 countries.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.850
20 states including
Delaware have

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.130
enacted Benefit
Corporation legislation

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.240
and over 400
companies have adopted

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.070
this new corporate form.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.170
More than 15,000 businesses are
measuring what matters using B

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.200
Lab's B Impact Assessment,
and more than 100 investors

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.040
and fund managers representing
over $6 billion in assets

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.960
across 30 countries are using
B Analytics and GIRS ratings,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.690
or G-I-R-S ratings, which we
hope that Andrew here will help

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.210
explain a little bit more.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.940
So this is Andrew Kassoy.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.030
He is the co-founder
of B Lab, and he

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.640
spent 16 years in the
private equity business

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.690
prior to founding B Lab.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.090
We also have with
Mike Brady, who

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.280
is the president
and CEO of Greyston.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.510
And we also have
here Anjali Kumar,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.481
who is the general
counselor at Warby Parker.

00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:39.980
I'm going to just start off by
telling you a little bit more

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.920
about their careers and how they
came to either work at B Lab

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.880
or work for B Corporations.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.640
And then we have a
series of questions

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.580
that we've prepared
to ask them and we'll

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.700
open up the floor for any of
your questions at the end,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.130
if that's OK.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.090
So prior to founding
B Lab, Andrew

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.720
spent 16 years in the private
equity business as a partner

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.250
at Amnesty Real

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.150
is an affiliate of MSE

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.880

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.010
and as the Managing Director
in Credit Suisse First Boston's

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.240
Private Equity department--
that's a mouthful--

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.290
a founding partner of DLJ
Real Estate Capital Partners

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.620
and president of its
international business.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.420
He's a board member of
Echoing Green and adviser

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.150
to the NYU Reynolds Fellows
program and a member of the US

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.650
Working Group of the G8 Social
Impact investing task force.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.710
He's a former board member
of the Freelancers Union,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.170
and he hails from Boulder,
Colorado and graduated

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.780
with distinction
from Stanford, where

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.490
he was a Truman Scholar and
President's Award winner.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.860
He is a Henry Crown Fellow
at the Aspen Institute.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.720
Andrew is now living in New
York City with his wife Margot

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.800
and two sons, one
nine and one seven.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.456
So that is quite a busy life.

00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:54.080
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.360
We're so excited to have you.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.670
ANDREW KASSOY:
Thanks for having me.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.795
HOST: Mike Brady is
the President and CEO

00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:01.830
of Greyston Bakery
which is probably

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.750
one of the awesomest
bakeries ever--

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.295
MIKE BRADY: That's
enough, I think.

00:05:06.295 --> 00:05:06.795
That's fine.

00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:08.600
ANDREW KASSOY: That's
all you need to know.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.080
HOST: --founded the
best bakery ever.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.990
So Greyston Bakery is actually
building on its 30th year,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.930
and it is really and
truly a heritage model

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.777
for social enterprise.

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:22.110
Michael served on the board
of directors of the Greyston

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.210
Foundation before
being named president

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.800
of the bakery in January 2012.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.460
Prior to joining Greyston he
launched the first incubator

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.610
in the country dedicated
to organic food

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.920
production and distribution.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.190
He's also a founding partner
at BAO Food and Drink,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.180
a local food manufacturer
in New York City.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.090
He spent over 20 years in
strategy and management

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.730
positions identifying and
exploiting new business

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.440
opportunities in high-growth
and transitional industries,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.560
has a true passion for
social entrepreneurism,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.900
and is using the
power of business

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.305
to solve social issues that
are fundamental to his work

00:05:59.305 --> 00:06:00.590
at Greyston.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.440
Michael's also a
business adviser

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.420
to the American Sustainable
Business Council,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.970
helping to promote policies
for a more sustainable economy.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.360
He received his MBA from the

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.400
and lives in New York City with
his wife and also two boys.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.860
MIKE BRADY: Trying that, yeah.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.820
HOST: Many of you
know Anjali Kumar.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.260
She is an idea
acupuncturist, which

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.036
means that she ignites
ideas in others.

00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:30.120
ANJALI KUMAR: I'm also a lawyer.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.260
It's not as fun to say.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.520
HOST: But we decided
idea acupuncturist

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.770
is her formal title.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.755
A designer, traveler,
writer, and explorer.

00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:43.110
In more official terms, she's
currently the General Counsel

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.990
and Head of Social
Innovation at Warby Parker,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.460
a transformative lifestyle brand
that offers fabulous designer

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.930
eyewear for those of us that are
fashionable at a revolutionary

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.410
price while making sure
to lead a way for socially

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.600
conscious business.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.740
Anjali used to be Senior
Counsel at Google New

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.200
York-- we miss her-- where she
was a commercial or product

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.530
attorney on areas ranging
from Google X to advertising

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.550
technology to YouTube.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.060
She also curated the At
Google speaker series,

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.150
which is why I'm
slightly nervous,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.390
bringing Googlers
around the globe face

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.730
to face with some of today's
most prominent thinkers.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.200
Prior to being at Google,

and served as a board member
of the Issue Project Room.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.440
There's more.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.680
She's working on a book
called "From Google to God"

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.250
as well as a feature-length
documentary based on the book

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.550
and in collaboration with
Russell Simmons and Madeleine

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.620
Sackler.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.940
She is also the co-creator with
Questlove of the forthcoming

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.890
web series, "Questlove Presents
Slightly Reserved with Anjali

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.530
Kumar"-- which is awesome--
which will appear on the "Fast

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.890
Company" website.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.970
She's designed a handbag
line featured in "Vogue"

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.560

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.830
She earned her BA
Biomedical Ethics

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.880

JD from Boston University School

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.580
of Law, and she lives in New
York City with her husband

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.280
Atul and her daughter Zia.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.932
So we are psyched
to have you here.

00:08:17.932 --> 00:08:19.140
Thank you so much for coming.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.890
ANJALI KUMAR: Thanks
for inviting me back.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.470
HOST: If we could just
please welcome them all.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.197
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:27.197 --> 00:08:29.530
HOST: When you're dealing
with such accomplished people,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.340
their bios are incredible.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.179
So thank you for hanging
with us while we asked that.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.826
ANDREW KASSOY: Somebody
should go online and verify--

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:37.909
ANJALI KUMAR: It's all BS.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.956
HOST: We should live
fact check those bios.

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:43.539
All right, so I just
want to start off

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.650
talking a little
bit more in depth

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.620
about why B Corps are
important and really

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.910
opening up the discussion
to really investigate

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.320
why it is that we're
here and focused

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.650
on really promoting
B Corporations.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.170
Let's start off with Andrew.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.030
Why is being a B Corp important
to you as an individual,

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.030
and why do you think it's
important to consumers

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.642
and the broader community?

00:09:05.642 --> 00:09:07.100
ANDREW KASSOY: So
I'm going to give

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.900
a slightly different
answer than these two

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.770
because I don't actually
work at a B Corp. I work

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.220
at B Lab, which is
the nonprofit that's

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.150
kind of helping to promote
the B Corp movement.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.480
So the sort of personal
version of that

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.720
is, there were three
of us that started

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.276
B Lab about 6 and 1/2 years ago.

00:09:26.276 --> 00:09:27.900
All of us came from
the private sector.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.390
So you read my bio, I was
a pretty uninteresting

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.720
private equity investor doing
pretty traditional investing.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.210
But my two partners have
had much sexier careers.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.560
They started and built
a footwear and apparel

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.710
business called And One.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.000
They made like really cool shoes
and trash-talking t-shirts that

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.390
said "if I give you
$5 will you go home?"

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.600
and stuff like that that people
wore on-- or less politically

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.696
correct, "Your game is as
ugly as your girlfriend"--

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:01.020
that people wore like
on basketball courts.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.080
And anyway, they turned
that into a $250 million

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.720
brand that outcompeted
Nike on a lot of things.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.700
And they did it by
having a lot of passion,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.792
but also by building a business
that had a phenomenal culture.

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:16.250
And so the three
of us, at the time

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.000
that they were selling
their business,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.370
they went through a
experience of having a venture

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.586
investor who didn't really
care about much other

00:10:25.586 --> 00:10:26.960
than just making
as much money as

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.168
possible off of the business.

00:10:28.168 --> 00:10:30.560
And so the business got sold
to the highest bidder, who

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.580
was the bidder who cared
the least about all

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.380
the mission-driven things that
they did as a business, all

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.900
of the culture that
they'd created,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.700
the really high standards
for manufacturing

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.374
they had in developing world
markets, stuff like that,

00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:45.790
and saw all of
that stuff go away.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.590
And so for them, it was
about trying to figure out

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.370
how we can help businesses
that care about something other

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.470
than just making money.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.450
Entrepreneurs, people
who want to make money

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.250
but do good at the same time.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.970
And for me, it
was the experience

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.680
of being in the
traditional capital markets

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.360
and seeing the way investors
think more and more and more

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.760
short term, which
leads them to care only

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.230
about making as much money in
their investments in a business

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.940
as quickly as they
possibly can, and trying

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.100
to externalize every
other cost on to society,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.530
all the bad stuff.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.860
And thinking that there's
got to be a different way

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.517
to build a marketplace
that supports businesses

00:11:28.517 --> 00:11:30.350
so that they actually
create long-term value

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.250
both for their shareholders
and their stakeholders.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.890
So that's why I
wanted to start B Lab.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.922
A lot more interesting
is the entrepreneurs

00:11:39.922 --> 00:11:42.380
who've actually started and
built the businesses themselves

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.310
that are changing the way
we all think about success

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.742
in business.

00:11:46.742 --> 00:11:48.010
HOST: That's great.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.130
And why do you think that this
is the most effective model

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.240
for social progress?

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.710
ANDREW KASSOY: Well,
it's not by itself,

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.350
but I think what's
important to say,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.020
maybe, is that we've come
to a point in society

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.620
where we're faced with some
huge social and environmental

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.890
challenges, and a lot
of those challenges

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.340
can't be solved simply through
kind of traditional means

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.617
like nonprofits and government.

00:12:15.617 --> 00:12:17.450
It's not that those
aren't really important,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.880
they're necessary, but they're
insufficient to solving

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.810
some of our biggest challenges.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.610
And the reason for
that is that they're

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.350
inherently limited
in their ability

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.670
to scale, to attract
capital, to attract talent.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.720
And business makes
up 75% or 80% of GDP.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.650
So either business is going
to be part of the problem,

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.950
or it's going to be
part of the solution.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:44.310
And what we've seen is this
incredible-- particularly

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.760
amongst younger people--
but this incredible

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.870
outpouring of entrepreneurship,
of people wanting

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.210
to use business
to create change.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.850
And so our feeling
has been, there

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.549
are some impediments
to that, most of which

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:00.840
are just kind of like cultural.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.923
People just aren't used
to thinking about business

00:13:02.923 --> 00:13:05.874
as a tool for positive
social change.

00:13:05.874 --> 00:13:07.790
And that means that
there's not all the market

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.224
infrastructure built up.

00:13:09.224 --> 00:13:10.390
There's not the information.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.931
There's no way to
tell the difference

00:13:11.931 --> 00:13:14.240
between a good company
and just good marketing.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.120
And companies know-- you guys
know this-- companies know

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.340
that consumers care
and the people who

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.030
come to work at
their companies care

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.310
a ton about how
companies behave.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.950
And so more and more
companies market

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.750
themselves as being green
or responsible or social

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.629
or whatever it is.

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:35.170
And it's hard to
tell the difference.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.630
And so our instinct
originally was,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.837
we need some
organizing principles

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:43.420
so that everybody
knows the difference

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.370
between a good company
and good marketing,

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.720
can identify those companies,
and then support them,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.540
whether it's going
to work at them,

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.930
or starting them,
or buying from them.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.300
And there's huge power
in all of those companies

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.930
then being able to get
together and speak collectively

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:58.760
with one voice.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.970
HOST: That's a good point,
and I think specifically

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.060
the point around
it being so easy

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.480
to market yourself as being
a responsible company.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.690
We've seen a huge surge in just
marketing around sustainability

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.760
and responsibility and
renewal, and we're giving back

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.050
to the community, and
part of our profits.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.430
In starting Greyston, Mike,
why was it important for you

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.489
to make sure that you
were a B Corp versus any

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.530
of the other social programs
you could have done,

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.988
or even marketing
efforts you could

00:14:27.988 --> 00:14:31.352
have done to be good
for the community?

00:14:31.352 --> 00:14:32.460
MIKE BRADY: Yeah.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.290
I need to be clear.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.300
Greyston was started 30 years
ago by an amazing visionary

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.150
entrepreneur named
Bernie Glassman, when

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.130
and he started it with
the concept of a business

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.040
being able to
support a community

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.820
and giving back, in an
age 30 years ago when

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.220
that language and a
double bottom line

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.340
was not even thought of.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.870
And I encourage everyone
to look up Bernie.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.029
He has a long history as a
leader in socially engaged

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:59.320
Buddhism, and it's a great
story, probably a little bit

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.590
more than we can tell here.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.700
I joined two years
ago, and I think

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.760
one of the interesting
tidbits is--

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.850
it's been so long that
it's off my bio-- I used

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.492
to work at a company called
Fast Search out of Norway.

00:15:12.492 --> 00:15:14.950
There may be people in this
room that are familiar with it,

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.350
but it eventually grew
and was sold to Microsoft

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.960
as their Mindshare business.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.670
At that point I began to look
at social entrepreneurship

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.410
and the importance of it, and
the importance of our dollars

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.420
going to companies that
actually share values

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.290
with my own values.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.490
And I had the good fortune to
come across Greyston, which

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.164
is 25 minutes north on
the MTA, and I said,

00:15:42.164 --> 00:15:44.080
this is a place I'd like
to get involved with.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.550
And I find myself
now leading it.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.870
It's been two years.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.650
At the same time, New
York state had just about

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.290
passed legislation to allow
for Benefit Corporation status,

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.156
and I had been exposed
to it through other types

00:15:59.156 --> 00:16:00.530
of businesses, my
other incubator

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.890
that you had mentioned.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.640
It was at that
point that I said,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.440
this is an opportunity
for Greyston

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.620
to take another
leadership position.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.990
We had taken a leadership
position 30 years ago.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.980
We need to take a
leadership in New York state

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.570
and we need to be a voice that
says, the model must change.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.080
And there's a lot
that goes into that.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.340
Andrew hit on a
couple of the pieces,

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.760
but it's the marketplace
that we're all collectively

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.150
a part of, and how can I
support my fellow B Corps,

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.290
how can they support me, how
can we get the message out

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.580
in meetings and opportunities
like this to say,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.270
as consumers you need
to put your money

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.210
and look towards--
whether it be B

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:47.720
Corps or at least organizations
that share your values.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.290
Because if you look at the way
the economy's working today,

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.540
it doesn't take you too long
to think, something's askew.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.610
And the business that accounts
for that large portion of GDP

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.910
is contributing to it.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.095
And if we don't look
for ways to change it,

00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:04.720
we're going to continue
to spiral down.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.260
And I don't mean to
be overly depressing,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.290
but we really need to
think about the fact

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.569
that if we were all to fly to
California and those of you

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:21.040
watching from the Bay Area, and
got off the plane and everyone

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.000
there was living in
poverty, and everyone there

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.700
couldn't eat what they
wanted for food, that's

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.440
still 12 million people
less than those people

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.300
living under poverty in
our country right now,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.900
47 million people that
don't know how they're

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.995
going to afford their next meal.

00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:39.370
That seems like
a problem for us.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.824
So at Greyston we're
a small bakery.

00:17:41.824 --> 00:17:43.240
To give you context,
though, we're

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.580
not sitting around baking cakes.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.220
One of the great organizations
in this country is Ben

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:49.820
and Jerry's.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.650
For 23 years we've
been providing brownies

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:57.910
to Ben and Jerry's,
30,000 pounds a day,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.950
twelve-hour shifts of
hard work, of baking.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.780
Greyston's model
that we're known for

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.977
is called open hiring.

00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:09.060
Anyone that comes to the
front door of our bakery,

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.820
we give a job to.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.170
No questions asked.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.850
And there needs to be
more models like that.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.400
And that's what I hope,
through the Benefit Corporation

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.080
movement, through
conversations like this,

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.430
through working with Andrew
to think about employment,

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.170
that a greater impact can be
made just from the community

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.440
that we're in in Yonkers
to a much broader

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.141
community, a global community.

00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:32.140
HOST: That's incredible.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.750
As you mentioned, you've been
doing business since 1982.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.680
How do you feel, since
Greyston's been in business,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.135
that the social enterprise
landscape has changed?

00:18:45.655 --> 00:18:47.310
MIKE BRADY: There
was none, right?

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.360
30 years ago.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.440
These visionaries--
there's a handful of them

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.430
in their companies
that have survived,

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.330
the Ben and Jerry's,
the Seventh Generations,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.740
the Greyston's-- had
an amazing vision,

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.780
and they had to overcome
naysayers left and right that

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.380
said, why are you
considering this?

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.880
And then it still happens today.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.840
I just heard a conversation
10 minutes ago,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.120
like business has
a responsibility

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:09.960
to the environment.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.720
They have a responsibility to
the community they operate in.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.550
It needs to own up to
that responsibility.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.670
And that's what these
types of founders

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.140
30 years ago are doing.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.390
Everyone in this room and
watching and the people that

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.990
are interested in are now
taking note, which is great.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.900
What I hope in 30 years from
now the social enterprise term

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.270
has now disappeared,
it's run its cycle,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.252
and every organization would
think back to say, what?

00:19:34.252 --> 00:19:35.710
You weren't
considering environment

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.490
with the way you
ran your business?

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.449
You weren't considering
your employees' welfare

00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:41.906
or the welfare of the community
when you ran your business?

00:19:41.906 --> 00:19:42.830
That just seems crazy.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.516
And that's what needs to change
in some time period soon.

00:19:47.516 --> 00:19:48.360
HOST: Definitely.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.818
Well, companies
such as yourselves,

00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:52.964
and getting into some of the
work Warby Parker is doing,

00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:55.130
are really disrupting the
way that business is done,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.610
and even the way that
consumers think about the way

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.952
that business is done
and should be done.

00:19:59.952 --> 00:20:01.910
Why do you think it's
important to Warby Parker

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.110
to be a Benefit Corporation?

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.730
ANJALI KUMAR: So we are a
certified B Lab corporation.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.340
We're actually a C
Corp, a Delaware C Corp,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.209
and we haven't changed
our legal status.

00:20:13.209 --> 00:20:15.500
That option's only been
available since the summertime,

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.550
when the legislation changed.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.820
And I think, for us, a lot of
the reason it was important

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.540
was because of the community
of like-minded folks

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.330
that we found within
the B Lab family.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.340
The idea that you can do
well and do good in the world

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.470
is not necessarily
a new one, but it's

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.680
something that was really
important for our founders

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.470
to find that kind
of shared vision.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.039
And I think when they met Andrew
and the team over at B Lab,

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.080
when they first started
the company, it was like,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.350
oh, they get it, this is
what we're trying to do.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.650
And we're not crazy
for having this idea

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.130
that we can be this
transformative lifestyle brand

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.640
offering prescription
eyewear for $95

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.740
and disrupt this industry.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.150
We can do that and we can
make a lot of money doing it,

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.699
hopefully, and be
really successful,

00:20:58.699 --> 00:21:00.490
but we can also have
an impact on the world

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.710
in a really meaningful way.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.832
And so having that shared value
system with the folks at B Lab,

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:07.540
and then also just
the community of folks

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.570
that they bought
around this movement

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.294
has been really important,
I think, to Warby.

00:21:14.294 --> 00:21:17.120
HOST: So how do you
think that technology

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.100
has played a role in
Warby Parker's success,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.862
but also in just
highlighting the work

00:21:22.862 --> 00:21:25.320
that Warby Parker is doing in
giving back to the community?

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.970
ANJALI KUMAR: I think it's
been absolutely critical.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.080
Without technology there would
be no Warby Parker success,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.467
frankly, because-- I
don't know if all of you

00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:35.300
are familiar with the
story of Warby Parker,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.770
but just really
briefly, the industry

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.840
that we're out to disrupt
is a really longstanding,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.520
pretty entrenched
industry where there

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.420
is one company,
essentially, that

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.990
owns the entire ecosystem
from soup to nuts,

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.330
so they own everything from
the eyewear-only brands, things

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.420
like Persol or Oakley
or Oliver Peoples-- they

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.720
own all of those.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.840
They have exclusive licenses
on a lot of the fashion brands

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.520
that you might wear, so like
your favorite eyewear fashion

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.150
brand, whether it's
Prada or DKNY or Polo.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.950
They also own the
distribution channels, so

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.060
everything from a Pearle
Vision to a Sunglass Hut.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.375
They own the-- it
keeps going-- they

00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:21.980
own the in-store kind of optical
shops like Target Optical,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.530
Walmart, et cetera.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.680
And then they also own the
second-largest vision insurance

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.240
plan in the States.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.510
So when you look at
that entire ecosystem

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.270
and realize that's all owned
by one company, Luxottica,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.770
it's not surprising
why your glasses, which

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.990
are an 800-year-old
piece of technology,

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.802
cost more than
your Android phone.

00:22:40.802 --> 00:22:43.010
It starts becoming a little
clearer why that might be

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.480
the case, because
these are ultimately--

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.040
they're really cute, I think I
look great in these glasses--

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.820
but they are ultimately
acetate and a couple-- I know,

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.140
I look really good in
them, right?-- acetate,

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.520
a couple metal screws,
and some glass.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.980
It's really not that
advanced technology

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.110
that should be justifying
that price point.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:05.180
So when Warby Parker set out to
disrupt this massive industry,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.914
without access to those
distribution channels

00:23:07.914 --> 00:23:10.330
it would've been virtually
impossible to actually do that.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.666
So without technology, without
the Googles of the world,

00:23:12.666 --> 00:23:14.040
without the
Internet, there would

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.680
have been no way to actually
go direct to the consumer

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.340
and do that.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.430
So I think from our perspective,
social innovation really

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.624
starts with that, with
creating a high-quality product

00:23:24.624 --> 00:23:26.040
of prescription
eyewear, something

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.360
that people need in their
lives to actually function

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.787
at a competitive price
point of what it should--

00:23:31.787 --> 00:23:33.620
it's not a low-cost
price point, it's really

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.910
what glasses should cost.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.451
It's just that you've
been overpaying

00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:38.090
for them for all this time.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.507
So here's what it should
cost, and they also

00:23:40.507 --> 00:23:43.090
happen to be fashionable and all
these other wonderful things.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.560
And oh yeah, on
top of that we also

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.260
give back when we sell glasses.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.860
So that's sort of our
tertiary messaging.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.915
HOST: That's great.

00:23:50.915 --> 00:23:52.040
Thank you for that context.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.790
It's so important.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.670
I don't think many of us
realize that it's basically

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.212
one corporation that
manages every single aspect

00:23:59.212 --> 00:24:00.170
of the vision industry.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.930
That's amazing, down
to the insurance.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:09.240
So given that, that's a
lot of obstacles to face.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.022
What do you think
specifically, in terms

00:24:11.022 --> 00:24:12.730
of working with Google,
one of the things

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.240
that we've been discussing
here over the last two quarters

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.580
internally while promoting
B Corps at Google,

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.020
is how many B Corporations
are actually using Google

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.985
technology or Google apps in
order to run their business.

00:24:24.985 --> 00:24:26.610
So I'm going to start
with you and then

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.850
kind of go down the line.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.790
How do you feel that
specifically using

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.560
Google technology has
been useful to you,

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.990
and what are some areas that
you think would be more useful

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.979
or are areas for development
in terms of using technology,

00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.270
or ways that Google could help?

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.395
ANJALI KUMAR: My wish list?

00:24:42.395 --> 00:24:43.359
This is exciting.

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:45.150
I never had this access
when I worked here,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.650
so that's kind of--
I wish I'd known

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.233
I was going to be
asked this question.

00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:49.720
I would have thought
about it more.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.842
I would say, in terms
of my day to day,

00:24:51.842 --> 00:24:53.050
it's absolutely instrumental.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:58.220
We are on apps, we
use Gmail and Docs,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.420
if they had switched us
back to other products I

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.450
don't know what I
would have done.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.991
I don't think I
could have functioned

00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:06.300
after being at Google for six
years and using all the apps.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.117
It's absolutely part
of my day to day.

00:25:08.117 --> 00:25:09.450
I don't feel like I left Google.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.200
I was joking about
this with my colleagues

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.090
earlier, that I interact
with Google every single day,

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.000
constantly, whether
it's work or personally,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.750
so I don't feel
like I ever left.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.690
So I think for our
business it's been

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.655
absolutely part of the
basis of how we function

00:25:24.655 --> 00:25:26.450
and how we run our business.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.885
I need to think about
your second question--

00:25:28.885 --> 00:25:30.010
HOST: We'll go right back--

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.300
ANJALI KUMAR: I'm going
to send you guys a list.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.100
I'm collecting ideas.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.620
I think it's been
incredibly powerful,

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.260
and just being searchable,
and the ads certainly

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.810
are a huge part of how we
market to our consumers.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:47.340
So keep doing what you're doing.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.520
HOST: So obviously Warby Parker
is a very different environment

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.990
than Greyston.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.370
How have you been able
to leverage technology

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.220
to help promote the
history of Greyston

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.530
and what you're doing now?

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.890
And specifically,
are there any ways

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.422
that some of the apps that we
have running around can help?

00:26:04.422 --> 00:26:05.130
MIKE BRADY: Yeah.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.500
I think it's probably
better or easier

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.950
to answer it as what the
challenges are for us.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.989
And the challenge
ties to a lot of what

00:26:14.989 --> 00:26:16.030
Andrew was talking about.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.670
But where Greyston
will stand out

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.350
amongst our peers in social
enterprise and leading

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.080
the way is through more
transparency and more

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.620
accountability and
access to information,

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:32.040
which are all things that Google
is excellent at providing.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.980
So Andrew mentioned the impact
study and the impact analysis.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.684
We do quite well on that.

00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:40.850
Helping people to understand
how we do well and why,

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.440
and what they can do
at their own businesses

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.850
to copy what Greyston has done,
or to leverage pieces of what

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.130
Greyston has done, or to
understand parts of Gresyton.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.220
And it's somewhat
self-fulfilling, of course,

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.928
because then you'll
learn about Greyston,

00:26:55.928 --> 00:26:59.160
and by the way, online you can
buy some delicious brownies.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.650
And that's why Greyston is
really an interesting place,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.600
because we have a product
that most people like.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.800
And the keywords
around brownies are

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.970
"more than I care to spend."

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:19.050
But some keywords around social
entrepreneurship, mission,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.560
open hiring,
alleviation of poverty,

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.380
are more available to me.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.390
So there's a lot of
interest on my part

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.370
and I think around what
Google can provide around,

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.377
how do I market that?

00:27:31.377 --> 00:27:33.210
How do I get people to
be aware of Greyston?

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.759
How do more people come
in contact with us?

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:37.300
So that's on one
end of the business.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.840
And then the other end is, I
work with a population of folks

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.219
that-- it's very hard for me
prior to working with them,

00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:46.760
and I might suggest,
although I don't

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.134
want to paint with
a broad brush,

00:27:48.134 --> 00:27:50.660
that many people in the
audience who are watching,

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.330
can appreciate the
challenges of the lifestyle

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.730
that people that
work at Greyston

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:01.030
or come through the Greyston
system, have to deal with.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:05.930
And they can't afford a
phone, but they need a phone.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:11.200
And they can afford unlimited
data, but they want it, right?

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.590
I can't text my
workers and let them

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.380
know that we're down because we
had a snowstorm or something,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.020
because they don't want to
have to incur that charge.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:24.180
Tools to allow me to have access
and work with a low income

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.900
population, that are affordable
and become ubiquitous and are

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.360
easily accessible, are critical.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.820
And they're often not thought
of because there isn't money

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.430
there, and that's a problem.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.930
That's a problem.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.640
HOST: And I think, as
you started to say,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.700
some of the things that you
do, like your open hire policy,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.560
those are all part of your
model and your approach

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.800
towards the way that you
want to run Greyston.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.000
Do you think that
being a B Corporation

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.550
presents unique challenges
that non-B Corps don't face,

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:03.116
and if so, what are they
for Greyston currently?

00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:06.150
MIKE BRADY: I don't think
they're our unique challenges.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.720
I mean, the work-- it comes
up, obviously, there's

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.220
some reporting
requirements, there's

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.300
some elements to being
a B Corp, but these

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.600
are things that I believe
a business just should do.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.930
And that's my value as the
leader of Greyston now,

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.370
but I don't frankly
understand other leaders that

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.890
don't appreciate at least
bringing elements of that

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.630
to their business.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.520
It's very easy for
everyone in this room

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.710
to think about, OK, I'm buying
this product, and as a business

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.600
I'm sourcing office
supplies, let's say.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.840
Why wouldn't I source
those from an organization

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.224
that I know shares
my values and is

00:29:45.224 --> 00:29:46.640
treating the
environment properly?

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.107
It's just a small one piece
of your business to do that.

00:29:51.107 --> 00:29:53.190
Reporting on that in my
Benefit Corporation report

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.700
is not a burden.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.430
And the ROI on this,
another challenge,

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.275
but I think the long term
ROI on this-- and Ben

00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:04.400
and Jerry's is the same
way, and Ben and Jerry's is

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.030
owned by Unilever--
they are the same way.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.440
This population,
the Millennials,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.870
will be buying from companies
based on these values.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.290
So we'll have a competitive
advantage by doing this,

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.410
and leaders that don't
see that are shortsighted

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.840
and have short-termism as
one of their biggest issues.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.580
And I'm sure Andrew
can go into that.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:31.230
But I don't see any burden
from being a B Corp,

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.210
or doing a Benefit
Corporation status.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.586
HOST: I see you
agreeing on this.

00:30:34.586 --> 00:30:36.626
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah, I
think it's absolutely true.

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:39.020
I think if anything, it
helps-- the process is

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.090
so rigorous to actually
be certified as a B Lab--

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.590
it's not like you fill out a
form and then you're certified.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.180
It really is quite a
rigorous auditing process,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.640
for lack of a better word.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:52.180
And we were already
doing those things,

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.910
and it's what we want
to do, but in a way

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.260
it highlights best practices
for our company, right?

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.765
So it might point
out things that

00:30:57.765 --> 00:30:59.145
are like, oh, we didn't
think about that,

00:30:59.145 --> 00:30:59.978
that's a great idea.

00:30:59.978 --> 00:31:01.990
And that's a way for us
to be more sustainable

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.316
or for us to push a
little bit on that issue,

00:31:04.316 --> 00:31:07.290
or as we start having
damaged frames,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.290
what do we do with them?

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.373
We should think about
recycling them and coming up

00:31:10.373 --> 00:31:12.130
with an interesting
plan around that.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.290
And it just sort of
helps test our thinking

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.150
and push us to do more.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.070
But it's things that are
already within the company

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.670
ethos and the DNA
of Warby Parker.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.540
And I think of so many
companies that are B Labs,

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.920
or not-- maybe they're
not certified--

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:31.910
but they share that desire
to do good in the world,

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.020
or to not do more
harm in the world.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.440
So I don't think of it
as burdensome either.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.630
I think of it as very much just
helping us stay on our toes.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.980
HOST: That's wonderful.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.880
And I think just to kind of
transition over to Andrew,

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.270
Anjali mentioned the
certification process

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.470
and how rigorous that
vetting process is

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.750
and the auditing process is.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.291
Maybe you can talk
to us a little bit

00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:57.890
about how you find companies
and how they find you,

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.516
and what the auditing
process is like.

00:31:59.516 --> 00:32:00.307
ANDREW KASSOY: Yep.

00:32:00.307 --> 00:32:02.590
So to be clear, B Lab
is this nonprofit.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.799
We run a certification, and
the brand of the certification

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.340
is called a B Corp.
It's a little bit

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:12.900
like if you know fair trade
certification, B Corp is that,

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.490
but for whole companies.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.010
And so for a company to
get certified as a B Corp,

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.140
it has to do two things.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.960
One, it has to meet a minimum
set of social and environmental

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.450
performance standards.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.090
So we created a
rating system, which

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.810
we can get to the
technology of that,

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.040
because there's a bunch of
really great opportunities

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.180
there.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.763
But we basically
built a rating system

00:32:32.763 --> 00:32:35.430
that measures the impact
of a business on all

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.690
of its stakeholders, not
just its shareholders,

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:41.040
but the community, the
environment, its workers,

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.600
its consumers, its supply
chain, all that kind of stuff.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.490
The second thing is that the
company makes a commitment

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:54.120
to expand who it considers when
it makes decisions beyond just

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.690
considering the value for
that particular decision

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.680
on its shareholders,
but to consider

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.130
all of its stakeholders
when it makes decisions.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.330
And those two things
together allow the company

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.210
to get certified
as a B Corporation

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.790
and join this community
of like-minded companies,

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.130
and then together to speak
with collective voice.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.660
It's hard to get
certified, though.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.100
You have to do real
work, as Anjali

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.060
said, to go through
that process.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.650
And part of it,
for every company,

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.330
is a learning experience.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.250
As good as lots
of companies are,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.450
whether it's these two or
Patagonia or Ben and Jerry's,

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.339
they all, when they go
through that process,

00:33:35.339 --> 00:33:36.880
realize there are
things that they've

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.897
been focused on
that they do great,

00:33:38.897 --> 00:33:41.230
and there are lots of other
places where they fall down.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.440
And so part of that
experience of going

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.830
through the
certification process

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.700
is meant to also help
everybody meet them

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.776
when they are, and then
help lift all boats.

00:33:51.776 --> 00:33:53.150
And one of the
interesting things

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.608
that's happened as
a result of that

00:33:54.608 --> 00:33:57.460
is there are now
15,000 companies that

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.300
are using that tool that
they've used to get certified

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.990
as B Corps-- there are 15,000
companies who have just

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.150
gone online and started to use
that tool in order to measure

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:08.949
their own social and
environmental impact

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:09.802
and improve it.

00:34:09.802 --> 00:34:11.760
They might not even be
ready to become B Corps.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.290
They might not be
quite good enough yet.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.880
Or they might be good
enough but just say,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.949
you know what, we don't need
to wear it on our sleeve.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:19.110
We really just want to use
it as an internal tool.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.080
But more and more
companies are doing that.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.370
And that's a huge
opportunity to effect,

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.190
through their leadership
and their transparency,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.880
it's a huge opportunity for
them to inspire thousands

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.070
and eventually hundreds
of thousands of businesses

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:37.520
to measure and improve
their impact in the world.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.850
Google could go through
that B Impact Assessment

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.350
and probably learn
some great stuff.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.179
You'd probably see some
things that the company does

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.137
incredibly well and find
some other things that

00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:48.730
would be a great learning
experience for the company

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.650
to consider as it
continues to scale.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:57.890
So that's what's involved
in becoming a B Corp.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.350
One of the things I think
that's important to say

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.900
is when people like
Greyston started

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.660
thinking about this idea 30
years ago, of using business

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.990
as a force for good, they
were like wandering around

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.430
in the wilderness.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.390
There were only a few of them.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.212
And they were pretty
out there in terms

00:35:18.212 --> 00:35:19.170
of thinking about that.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.620
They were in your classic
model of disruptive technology.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.630
They were mostly
dismissed as oh, that's

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.860
cute, because they
just weren't that many.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:36.540
And Mike's downplaying the
impact, the actual impact

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.460
of what that business
has done over 30 years.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.762
Not just in Yonkers, New
York, in taking people

00:35:41.762 --> 00:35:44.220
who are coming out of prison
and turning their lives around

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.990
by giving them jobs
and training them

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.630
and then sending them
off to have real careers.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.120
But also the repetition of
that model by other people

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.780
who've been totally inspired
by it all over the world

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.510
changing the way they
think about work.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.710
Thirty years later
here we are, and there

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.050
are more and more
mainstream businesses

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.900
who've seen that and
recognized that they

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.490
can do business and
do well while having

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.810
a huge positive impact
in doing something

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.120
in line with their values.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.865
And so Anjali also played down
the impact of Warby Parker

00:36:18.865 --> 00:36:25.600
is not just on their practices,
and things like a new recycling

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.105
plan for glasses, or how
they treat their own workers,

00:36:28.105 --> 00:36:30.230
or how they think about
making life a hell of a lot

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.910
better for consumers
than it has been

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.030
by making glasses
cost $400 less.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.850
But it's also that every time
I sell a pair of glasses,

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.940
an organization in
the developing world

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.590
gets a pair of glasses to start
a business where they sell

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:51.260
those glasses to people who
could otherwise never afford

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.280
a pair of glasses.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.270
And so they're
changing economies

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.180
throughout the developing world
through those partnerships,

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.300
what they're giving away.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.470
And that's a mainstream
business that's got--

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:05.050
I don't know how much,
but let's say $100 million

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.160
of venture capital money
from venture capital funds

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.890
that you've all heard of.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.860
So they're not running
a cute little thing.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.710
They're at that
next stage that's

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.360
beyond people dismissing,
but people actually being

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.900
threatened because they're
taking on-- through a totally

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.460
mainstream, quickly
scaling business--

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.620
they're taking on the accepted
order of how business is done.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.377
That's pretty threatening.

00:37:31.377 --> 00:37:33.210
And I think that there's
a-- sorry to go on,

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.240
but I do think there's
a ton of power, then,

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.440
in them having a
family to lean on

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.220
in doing that, that
can tell those stories.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.160
And that's part of what the B
Corp community is all about.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.880
At some point, another five
or 10 or 25 years from now,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.500
that'll just be how
business is done.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.720
All businesses will be competing
to be best for the world,

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.820
not just best in the world.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.700
HOST: You speak and I
have to take a moment

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.140
to absorb what you said,
because it's so impactful.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.270
It's bigger, I think,
than most of us

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.670
take time to really focus on.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.510
What are some ways
that you feel--

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.310
we were talking a little
bit before the talk started

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:17.870
about privilege, and how
we're not even aware of just

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.482
how where we're born
or where we work

00:38:19.482 --> 00:38:20.690
gives us privilege sometimes.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.779
We just don't take the
time to think about it.

00:38:22.779 --> 00:38:24.320
Working at a place
like Google, where

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.230
we're surrounded by so
much beauty and food,

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.230
and we don't think about
hunger on a daily basis.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.630
I know it's not necessarily
at the forefront of my mind

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.430
as I'm passing by a
microkitchen stocked with food.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.840
What are some ways
that you think

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.150
young people such as ourselves
that work at companies

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:45.660
like Google can contribute to
the B Corporation community,

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.940
to B Lab, to B Corporations,
small businesses,

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.292
or even to just promote
knowledge around the community?

00:38:53.292 --> 00:38:54.250
I'll start with Anjali.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.740
ANJALI KUMAR: I think
there's a lot of ways.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.290
I think starting with being
a conscious consumer, that's

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.580
always a great place to start.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.080
That's a really easy way to
start, voting with your dollars

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.520
and spending money at companies
that share that value system

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.460
if that's something
that you hold dear.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.967
And I would think an audience
full Googlers, that there's

00:39:10.967 --> 00:39:13.550
a reason that you're here, and
it's beyond just the free food.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:16.469
It's really because of the core
value system of this company.

00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:18.010
It's certainly why
I was here and why

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.450
I was really proud to
be here for so long.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:23.330
So I think starting with
that is a great way.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.220
I was thinking a little bit
more about your question

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.240
about what I would
want from Googlers

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.720
and what my ask would be.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.600
And it's not really
a technology ask.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.020
It's more like a "help
me solve this problem"

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.902
ask, which is, you think
about the number of people

00:39:37.902 --> 00:39:39.860
in the world that don't
have access to glasses.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.540
It's a billion people, right?

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.470
That's like a full 15%
of the world's population

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.820
that does not have access
to prescription eyewear that

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.670
need it.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.771
And that's a staggering
statistic, right?

00:39:50.771 --> 00:39:52.270
And that's a
distribution challenge.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.520
If we could actually get
classes into the hands of all

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.420
those people who need it, they
could increase their earning

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.210
potential by 20%.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.250
What a low-cost poverty
alleviation tool.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.875
We don't need to give
them information,

00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:04.874
we don't need to give
them all this other stuff.

00:40:04.874 --> 00:40:06.490
We can, but let's
start with glasses.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.510
It's a really simple tool to
help people change their lives

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.630
in a really meaningful way.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.330
And again, it's a
distribution problem.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.288
I can't get glasses into
all these folks' hands

00:40:15.288 --> 00:40:17.220
because I can't get to them.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.420
Help me figure that out.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.820
That would be amazing.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.850
Let's get glasses to everybody.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.660
So if somebody
here wants to help

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.610
me think about
those problems, that

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.590
would be amazing, and help
me find those partners of how

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.720
we do this in a responsible
way, in a sustainable way,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.024
not just in pure charity
and just giving them away

00:40:36.024 --> 00:40:37.940
and disrupting local
economies and businesses.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.590
But really creating a
sustainable solution

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:42.780
to that problem.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.090
That would be incredible.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.690
And so I think that's sort of my
big ask, but in a smaller way,

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.393
I think it's just start with
where you spend your money.

00:40:50.393 --> 00:40:53.340
MIKE BRADY: Could I add
something real quickly?

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.645
I think buying with the dollar
is incredibly important, where

00:40:56.645 --> 00:40:57.520
you spend your money.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.920
Also we have such access
to information and policies

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.590
that are out there that
grassroots movements now

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.680
can have incredible impact.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.774
Think about how our
government is operating

00:41:09.774 --> 00:41:11.440
and how things are
passing in your state

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.940
and your local governments.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.760
I have in the back of my
mind the Minimum Wage Act.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.070
Form an opinion on that.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.630
And when you have an opinion,
go out and speak about it,

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:22.650
and try to get those
things moved forward

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.332
to support those that need help
from others that perhaps are

00:41:26.332 --> 00:41:28.290
privileged enough to have
opportunities to work

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:31.056
at an amazing place like this
after all your hard work.

00:41:31.056 --> 00:41:31.960
HOST: Thank you.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.446
It's a good point.

00:41:34.446 --> 00:41:36.552
AUDIENCE: First of all,
that blondie is probably

00:41:36.552 --> 00:41:39.010
one of the best things I've
ever had, so thank you so much.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.260
MIKE BRADY: Eat more brownies.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.820
That's another good thing.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.470
AUDIENCE: But I'm glad
that you brought up

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:47.560
something like the Minimum Wage
ACT, because I wanted to ask,

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:53.210
for B Corps, what is the stance
when it comes to dabbling

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:58.640
in the public policy realm, and
how do you constrain yourself,

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.605
or what is the most effective
model that yo've found so far?

00:42:01.605 --> 00:42:03.780
ANDREW KASSOY: Great question.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.880
So I think it's funny.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.210
Entrepreneurs run from
public policy and government

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.680
as fast as they
possibly can, and so

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.410
it's always this interesting
struggle of this huge community

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.880
of entrepreneurs who are running
these inspiring businesses

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:25.190
and, like it or not, businesses
affected in all kinds of ways

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.935
by public policy.

00:42:25.935 --> 00:42:27.810
And so there has to be
some engagement there,

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.280
and so a lot of
times they look to us

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.440
to try to help play that
role, along with some other

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.490
organizations that are engaged
in this sustainable business

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.670
space and social
entrepreneurship.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.170
The view we've
taken is, we don't

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:48.610
want to be a political
player, because we don't think

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.550
this idea of using business
as a force for good

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:54.740
is a left or a
right kind of idea.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.890
I mean, if you're a liberal
you can get behind the idea

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:03.210
that we need business to
address a lot of problems

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.010
that we have because business
creates a lot of externalities.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:08.710
If you're a free-market
conservative

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:13.340
you can get behind the idea that
what better tool than business

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.760
and free markets to solve some
of our biggest challenges?

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.900
So this is not political.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.410
And so the approach we try
to take to public policy

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.130
has been all about enabling.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.800
Let's do everything we can
to level the playing field,

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.620
to make sure that
businesses that actually

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.660
care about creating impact have
the same ability to compete.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.060
So we've gotten legislation
passed in 20 states that's

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:40.300
actually created this corporate
form called the Benefit Corp.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.026
It's basically a legal
version of a B Corp.

00:43:44.026 --> 00:43:46.150
And the reason for doing
that was because there was

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.240
a huge impediment to
businesses is being able

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.320
to scale, which was
that corporate law says

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.370
that a business's obligation
is to maximize value

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.630
for its shareholders.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:01.150
Well, if that's true, then
it's really hard for a business

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:03.400
to choose to consider
other things.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.190
It's like actual legal
liability for the directors.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:07.840
And so on the
public policy front,

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.840
we've tried to attack issues
like that, where it's not

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.680
about politics,
it's about enabling.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.430
I think there are some
great opportunities

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:18.910
to think about how you tax
companies that are creating

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.180
measurable, quantifiable
benefit for society, not just

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.210
for their shareholders,
or how you tax

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.210
the investment in
those businesses.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:33.310
It doesn't have to
be a political issue

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.920
on one side of the
aisle or the other,

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.520
but where we can support
these kinds of businesses

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.121
and incentivize more of
them to solve big problems.

00:44:41.121 --> 00:44:42.370
HOST: That's a great question.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:43.132
Thank you.

00:44:43.132 --> 00:44:43.965
You have a question?

00:44:43.965 --> 00:44:46.070
AUDIENCE: I think Andy
might have touched

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.410
upon what I was
going to ask anyways,

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:52.070
but it seems like--
I was wondering

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.600
if there are publicly traded
companies that are B Corps,

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.600
and the reason I'm
asking is it seems

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.460
there's a natural tension
between the shareholders

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.900
wanting to maximize
profits, and then

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.944
the company wanting to
meet the B Corp standards

00:45:05.944 --> 00:45:07.360
might have to give
up some profits

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.250
to get social and
environmental changes.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:13.950
And we talk about impact and
getting large players to adopt,

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.890
so have you sensed this tension,
and what are some of the things

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.006
you're doing to bridge that gap?

00:45:19.006 --> 00:45:21.190
ANDREW KASSOY: Great question.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.780
I think Anjali can obviously
speak about this a lot,

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.860
because she works at a company
that's scaling and doing really

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:33.590
well even while keeping
all these things in mind.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.700
There's no question
there's a tension there.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.070
And that said,
there's no evidence

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.730
that companies that
consider their stakeholders

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.535
do worse, particularly
over the long term.

00:45:43.535 --> 00:45:45.410
And there are some
studies that show actually

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.570
that they do better.

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:48.010
And it makes sense.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:54.440
They retain talent better,
they avoid ridiculous risks

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.930
that they shouldn't be taking,
that are irresponsible,

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.300
because they're
more transparent.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.450
They are able to
create more loyalty

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.670
with their consumers
and their supply chains.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.620
So they do a lot of things that
allow them to create maybe more

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.819
value over the long term.

00:46:10.819 --> 00:46:12.610
So I think that's a
really important thing.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:14.470
That said, there's
a lot of education

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.910
to do of investors, particularly
in the public markets,

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.610
on that issue.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:21.140
And one thing just about
technology that I think

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.680
is important to
say on this point.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.150
We have a ton of data, but
we're running a nonprofit,

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:30.270
and we are certainly not--
we're not data geeks,

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.660
we don't know anything
about big data.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.620
And one of the things that
we could really use help with

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.010
is thinking about how
to use all of the data

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.310
that we collect from
these 15,000 companies,

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.500
along with data that's out
there on other companies,

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.210
to start to make that case
in a much more powerful way.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:50.832
So if you're a big data
engineer kind of a person

00:46:50.832 --> 00:46:53.290
and wanted to spend some time
helping us try to figure that

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:55.330
out, that's one of the
most important things

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:56.960
if we want long
term growth here.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.626
The last thing I would
say on that front

00:46:58.626 --> 00:47:01.760
is, some company, some
public company someday

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.320
is going to become a
B Corp. It'll happen.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.250
So maybe it ought to be Google.

00:47:10.491 --> 00:47:11.960
HOST: That's a
really good point.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.224
Get it in, grow the idea.

00:47:17.224 --> 00:47:18.640
Thank you guys so
much for coming.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.410
We know that you're
incredibly busy,

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.430
and we really appreciate
all of the information

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.670
that you shared with us and
all of the work that you do.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:26.669
It's been an absolute
honor to have you here, so

00:47:26.669 --> 00:47:27.880
thank you so much.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:34.451
