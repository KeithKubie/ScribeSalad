You've learned that the API's explorer let's you

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.070
try out the API that your application exposes through

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.100
endpoints. Google uses the API's explorer in the

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.590
same way, to let you investigate the API that

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.050
are publicly available for the service that it

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.480
provides. For example let's consider Google's translation service. You

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.580
can go to translate.google.com to translate text from

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.270
one language to another, right in the browser. Hm,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.470
wonder what lemon cake is in Spanish? Pastel de limon. I wonder if I said that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.580
right? You can use the browser like this

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.930
to do translations. But you can also write applications

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.450
that do translations, using the translate API. You

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.180
can try out the translate API using the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.580
APIs explorer. It's easy to find the API

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.130
explore for Google's public APIs. Just search for it.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.490
Here it is, first result. When you go to the APIs Explorer. You see the list of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.450
all the APIs that Google provides for developers to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.020
use. You can search, or scroll down to the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.000
translate API, and click it. Then you see the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.160
functions that the translate API exposes. These are functions

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.595
that you, the developer, can use in your own

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:15.150
applications. 'Kay now it's your turn to try at

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.590
the translate API, using the APIs Explorer. So go to the APIs Explorer for the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.483
translation service. To find out the meaning

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.430
of the name Gundega in English. Gundega is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.350
our instructional designer for this course. You

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.610
could use the language.traslations.list function to translate text.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.460
Set the target language to en, which stands

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.630
for English. When you figured out what Gundega

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.310
means in English, write it in this text

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.540
field here. When you submit a translation, you can

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.650
tell the translation service what the source language is.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.870
Or you can let it try to figure out

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.650
the source language for itself. So, one more

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.700
thing for you to figure out, is what is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.020
a source language for Gundega. When you've figured that

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.770
out, go ahead and check the appropriate check box.
