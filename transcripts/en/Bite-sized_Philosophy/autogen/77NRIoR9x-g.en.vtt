00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.020
 And of course when the child is old enough 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.260
 to be put into the great social world, 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.740
 then all restrictions related to the playing ground become 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.305
 placed immediately on the child. 

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:13.785
 And that is a very unforgivable landscape, because 

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:15.515
 the last thing a child wants, really, the last 

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.785
 what a child wants is not to have friends. 

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.815
 Or even, maybe, just as seriously, 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 don't have a best friend. 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.240
 Ah, I recently read something so idiotic that I couldn't believe it, so 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.180
 the newest prince, 

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.655
 so Queen Elisabeth's great-grandchild, 

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.255
 is in childcare in England. 

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:37.785
 And in this daycare they don't let the children have a best friend, 

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:41.195
 because that is unfair. I thought, you know 

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:45.155
 sometimes you see something that is so stupid 

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.545
 that you can't even believe it really exists. 

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:49.525
 And this is an example of that, 

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:52.345
 because it has long been known that 

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:54.855
 one of the milestones in the development 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.000
 those children undergo, somewhere between the age 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.080
 5 and 10 is that they choose a best friend. 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.240
 * stuttering * 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.215
 The hypothesis 'but that is unfair for all other children', 

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:09.255
 Look, first of all you can't be everyone's best friend. 

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:10.625
 Because then 

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:13.725
 maybe there are 1 billion children, so every child gets 1 second. 

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:16.715
 And that is not a very deep relationship. So, 

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:19.805
 the idea that you can be just as good with everyone, 

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:23.475
 that is impossible. But even worse, the thing is, 

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:26.345
 The thing the child does is actually them 

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:29.365
 they step out of their own self-centeredness, 

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:32.325
 because their best friend becomes more important than they are. 

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:34.725
 And that is a precursor to an adult relationship 

00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:37.545
 in which, if you are married, your partner 

00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:40.135
 at least as important as you and the relationship should be 

00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:42.885
 should be even more important. But then you have children 

00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:45.845
 and they are more important than you are. That's a fact. 

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:48.405
 Unless there is something wrong with you. You come second 

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:50.105
 and your children come first. 

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:52.335
 And then very first, I mean * stutter * 

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:55.205
 you are important because without you they can't do anything, so 

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:58.455
 you have to take care of yourself. You are no longer first when you have children. 

00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:01.805
 Unless, seriously, you haven't learned the lessons from the playground. 

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.875
 And when you have a best friend you are not first, but they are. 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.540
 And thus.. 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.640
 But anyway there are these limitations that develop 

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:12.855
 in the social landscape. You must have friends, 

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.595
 and you also need a specific person like 

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.515
 particularly unique among these friends, 

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.675
 giving you a real, mutual and caring relationship. 

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:25.095
 I can't remember the psychiatrist who studied this so carefully. 

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:27.335
 Uhm, unfortunately. 

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:31.355
 He was the first person who detailed 

00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:33.705
 did analyzes of the 'best friends' relationships 

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:36.635
 that children create. It is, I want 

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.025
 gladly give him honor for his ideas, but unfortunately 

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.275
 I can't remember his name. So, 

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:44.625
 All right!
