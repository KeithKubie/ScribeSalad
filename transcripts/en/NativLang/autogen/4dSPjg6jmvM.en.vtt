welcome to the grammar of words this is

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
welcome to the grammar of words this is
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.690
welcome to the grammar of words this is
one of a number of linguistics lessons

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
one of a number of linguistics lessons
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910
one of a number of linguistics lessons
on the site and it will introduce you to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
on the site and it will introduce you to
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760
on the site and it will introduce you to
how languages build words will cover two

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
how languages build words will cover two
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.609
how languages build words will cover two
basic topics in this lesson the first is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
basic topics in this lesson the first is
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.530
basic topics in this lesson the first is
going to be the components of words and

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540
going to be the components of words and
 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.150
going to be the components of words and
the second will be a way to classify

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
the second will be a way to classify
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.760
the second will be a way to classify
types of languages based on how they do

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770
types of languages based on how they do
 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.400

build words two concepts to get you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
build words two concepts to get you
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.759
build words two concepts to get you
started the first is the morpheme this

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
started the first is the morpheme this
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.439
started the first is the morpheme this
is our basic building block in the

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449
is our basic building block in the
 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.930
is our basic building block in the
grammar of words a morpheme is the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
grammar of words a morpheme is the
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090
grammar of words a morpheme is the
smallest meaningful unit you can break a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
smallest meaningful unit you can break a
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.970
smallest meaningful unit you can break a
word down into each word has at least

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
word down into each word has at least
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.450
word down into each word has at least
one morpheme so for instance the word

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
one morpheme so for instance the word
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.180
one morpheme so for instance the word
dog is both a word and a morpheme it's

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
dog is both a word and a morpheme it's
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.940
dog is both a word and a morpheme it's
the single morpheme dog if you just

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950
the single morpheme dog if you just
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860
the single morpheme dog if you just
break it down to the duh sound or the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
break it down to the duh sound or the
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.690
break it down to the duh sound or the
Gus sound you're no longer working with

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700
Gus sound you're no longer working with
 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.560
Gus sound you're no longer working with
morphemes the word dogs in the plural

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
morphemes the word dogs in the plural
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.560
morphemes the word dogs in the plural
more than one dog has two morphemes it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
more than one dog has two morphemes it
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.560
more than one dog has two morphemes it
has the morpheme dog and it has a sound

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
has the morpheme dog and it has a sound
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.340
has the morpheme dog and it has a sound
or sound that tells you it's the plural

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350
or sound that tells you it's the plural
 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.469
or sound that tells you it's the plural
the morpheme dog and the morpheme plural

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
the morpheme dog and the morpheme plural
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840
the morpheme dog and the morpheme plural
make the word dogs which has two

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
make the word dogs which has two
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.710
make the word dogs which has two
morphemes

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720
morphemes
 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.080

a second concept to get you started is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090
a second concept to get you started is
 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.360
a second concept to get you started is
in alle morph and alle morph is a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370
in alle morph and alle morph is a
 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.460
in alle morph and alle morph is a
different way that the same morpheme can

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470
different way that the same morpheme can
 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.860
different way that the same morpheme can
show up we talked about morphemes as

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870
show up we talked about morphemes as
 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.500
show up we talked about morphemes as
being a general underlying concept I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510
being a general underlying concept I
 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.560
being a general underlying concept I
gave you the example of dog with s and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570
gave you the example of dog with s and
 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.650
gave you the example of dog with s and
that s is a plural Morphy you can see

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660
that s is a plural Morphy you can see
 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.020
that s is a plural Morphy you can see
that it makes the word plural if we add

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030
that it makes the word plural if we add
 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.870
that it makes the word plural if we add
that same plural s to another word we

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880
that same plural s to another word we
 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.220
that same plural s to another word we
sometimes see that it shows up

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230
sometimes see that it shows up
 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.770
sometimes see that it shows up
differently for example in the word hats

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780
differently for example in the word hats
 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.090
differently for example in the word hats
it shows up as an S sound and not as a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
it shows up as an S sound and not as a
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
it shows up as an S sound and not as a
sound so the Z sound in the S sound are

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890
sound so the Z sound in the S sound are
 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.219
sound so the Z sound in the S sound are
two alle morphs of a single plural as

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229
two alle morphs of a single plural as
 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.340
two alle morphs of a single plural as
morphine there are different types of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350
morphine there are different types of
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.350
morphine there are different types of
morphemes there are morphemes that can

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360
morphemes there are morphemes that can
 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.359
morphemes there are morphemes that can
stand on their own like the word dog

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369
stand on their own like the word dog
 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.150
stand on their own like the word dog
these are known as free morphemes it

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160
these are known as free morphemes it
 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.650
these are known as free morphemes it

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660
doesn't have to be attached to another
 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.680
doesn't have to be attached to another
morpheme to be used morphemes that do

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690
morpheme to be used morphemes that do
 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.240
morpheme to be used morphemes that do
need to be attached to another morpheme

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250
need to be attached to another morpheme
 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.249

take the example of plural s do you ever

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380
take the example of plural s do you ever
 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.190
take the example of plural s do you ever
say just s on its own demean plural

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200
say just s on its own demean plural
 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.070

plural s always shows up at the end of

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080
plural s always shows up at the end of
 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.070

which attaches the free morpheme dog and
 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.760
which attaches the free morpheme dog and
the free morpheme house to come up with
