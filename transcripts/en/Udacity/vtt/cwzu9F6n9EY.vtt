00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.733
We're done listing out the lexical
scopes in this program.

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.317
We've seen how to differentiate one
lexical scope from another, and

00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:08.610
we've learned the rules
that govern them.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.290
It's time to talk about a somewhat
different idea relating to a different

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.320
usage of the word scope.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.309
When a program runs,
it builds up storage systems for

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.030
holding the variables and their values.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.320
These in-memory scope structures
are called execution contexts.
