MIKE WOLFE: Can we
look around in here?

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.169
SAM: Oh, absolutely, yeah.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.337
MIKE WOLFE: Wow, this is packed!

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:05.772
Dang, man, this is crazy.
SAM: Lots and lots.

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.774
MIKE WOLFE: So you must have
bought everything gas and oil

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.042
within like a 50 mile radius.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.744
SAM: Or a 100 mile.
- No doubt.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.445
SAM: Yeah, my wife
might call it hoarding,

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.581
but I never thought that.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.883
I just thought I was
saving it from oblivion.

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.918
Because a lot of this stuff
disappeared, got scrapped.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.353
And if I could save
it by collecting it,

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.588
that's another benefit too.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.623
You know this
sign's next level?

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.125
I mean, the quality of this--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.359
- Can I pull this out?
- Absolutely, yes.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.694
Look at that!

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.662
SAM: When I was a kid, Flying
A was all over the place.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.864
MIKE WOLFE: That
was the stuff, man.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.632
SAM: Yeah, that was my
favorite to look at,

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.100
the graphics and everything.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.702
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
Up into the 1960s,

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.304
the winged A of
Flying A gas was one

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.474
of the most iconic logos and
one of the most iconic brands.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.675
MIKE WOLFE: Where
did you find this?

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:43.543
SAM: North Carolina.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.944
- No kidding?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.780
So you were on the
road looking for stuff?

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.582
I was on the road, also,
if I was on vacation.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.017
I'd vacation in North Carolina.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.519
I'd drive 200 miles
in a circle sometimes.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.486
Yeah.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.754
WOMAN: So these
kids get in the car,

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.089
they think they're
going to the beach.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.357
And all of a sudden,
their beach day

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.093
is interrupted because Dad
found a cool Coke machine.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.028
- This sign's next level.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.363
I mean, it's not
in mint condition.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.731
SAM: No, it's not, right.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.466
MIKE WOLFE: But I mean, it's
embossed, it's the Flying A--

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.667
SAM: Yeah, it is.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.301
MIKE WOLFE: --the wings
coming off of the circle.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.402
I mean, this is--

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.537
Yeah, my eyes popped
out when I saw that.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:11.604
Yeah, this is it.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.906
Yeah, so it's one
of my favorite things.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.674
It took a long time
to find that piece.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.409
I always wanted
one of those signs.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.611
I used to see them
before I could buy one.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.613
So I traveled hundreds
of miles to get that.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.116
And I really, really
like that piece.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.753
MIKE WOLFE: Is this
something you'd sell?

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.588
I've never parted
with anything,

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.989
never sold one thing, so--

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.724
- You never sold one thing?
- No, not one.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.693
I'm thinking when-- when
am I going to do it?

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.595
And I never thought
I'd come to this day.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.330
So I started thinking
about it recently,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.932
and there's no better time.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.533
This is it, you know?
- This is it for you.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.201
- Yeah, this is it.
- This is the moment.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.068
Yeah.

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:42.769
MIKE WOLFE: What
are you thinking

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.870
on something like this?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.938
I don't know.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.807
What would you--

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.642
It's a prime piece,
it's really beautiful.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.643
It is, it's awesome.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.945
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
I want to throw

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:56.382
a number out there that's
going to get his attention.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.953
$3,500.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:03.656
That was way more
than I paid for it.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.991
I didn't expect that.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.292
It's like, wow.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:11.231
I think the retail on it's
probably $4,000 to $4,200,

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.031
$4,300.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.032
Yeah.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.601
So I can just see
his brain working.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.905
Which one of your children
do you get rid of first?

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:22.075
MIKE WOLFE: I mean,
what were you thinking?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.111
Around $3,600.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.045
He knew.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.447
He knew that sign.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.282
When you're giving something to
somebody, or parting with it,

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.117
whatever, it being
monetary or not,

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.585
you want them to really like it.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.787
And I felt that.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:35.755
I love, man.
Seriously.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.124
- Wow.
- I mean, thank you.

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.959
I know-- I know what it means.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.295
I never knew what it felt
like to part with something.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.696
It felt so different.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.999
I wish I could have conveyed the
emotion I felt at that moment.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.800
It felt like to start
of something new.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.435
And it's funny it
started with that sign.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.603
I'm a collector myself.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.272
When you let something
like this go--

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.239
It's been a lot of years.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.541
I know, man, I know.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.742
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.310
- Thank you.
- What do you value this at?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.211
$1,500.

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.112
How about $900?

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.480
How about $1,000.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.215
$950.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.616
Sold.
Yes.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.684
Are we doing it?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.887
Sam is the only
collector in this family.

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:09.322
He doesn't have a
whole lot of people

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.724
to share this with, to
talk about this with.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:12.659
This one's is rough.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.426
Right.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.727
But it's still cool, man.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:15.895
I mean, how long
have you had this?

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:16.896
Where'd you get this?

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.198
20 years ago in
Hillsdale, New Jersey.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.033
So it wasn't far.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.034
Did you dig it out of ground?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.302
No, I found it
behind a gas station.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.137
A guy had it, and I saw
it from the train one day.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.505
MIKE WOLFE: Really?
- Yeah.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.473
You never know where the next
one's going to hit you, man.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.242
No.
MIKE WOLFE: You got that radar.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.643
There's the money
shot right there.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.779
Yeah, yeah.
I really wanted the Pegasus.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.581
I don't have a
Pegasus, never had one,

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.115
and they were
always out of reach.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.785
This was a way for me to
have almost a Pegasus.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:39.986
500 bucks.

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.688
Yes.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.389
OK, here we go.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.524
It's the Mobil pile.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.793
WOMAN: So to have two
people, even strangers,

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.262
come onto his property
and geek out with him

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.597
over all of his cool memories--

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:51.397
Texaco!

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.699
SAM: I took it off the pole.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.866
The pole was laying down.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.702
I couldn't take the pole
because it was too big.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:56.769
MIKE WOLFE: I know.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.570
SAM: I would have
loved to have the pole.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.705
MIKE WOLFE: I've been there.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:03:59.272
SAM: It was it the Hobo
Deli, I remember that.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.073
[laughter]

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.140
MIKE WOLFE: $800?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.342
$900?

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.176
$850?

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.410
$850.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.012
All right, you going to
help me get it out of there?

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.413
Yeah.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.681
WOMAN: That's why we collect,
so that we can talk to people

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.050
about it, so that we
can feel other people's

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.051
excitement as well.
