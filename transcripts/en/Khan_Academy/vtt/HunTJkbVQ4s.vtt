00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:01.450
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're going to try

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.104
to get a sense of what the
limit as x approaches three

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.423
of x to the third minus 3x squared

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.090
over 5x minus 15 is.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.461
And when I say get a sense,
we're going to do that

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:17.238
by seeing what values for
this expression we get

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:20.126
as x gets closer and closer to three.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:21.987
Now, one thing that you
might want to try out,

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.104
is, well, what happens to this expression

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:26.534
when x is equal to three?

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:29.362
Well, then, it's going to
be three to the third power

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.988
minus three times three squared

00:00:31.988 --> 00:00:34.571
over five times three minus 15.

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:39.257
So at x equals three, this
expression's going to be,

00:00:39.257 --> 00:00:41.719
and let's see, in the
numerator, you have 27 minus 27,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.552
zero, over 15 minus 15, over zero.

00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:47.030
So this expression is actually

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.200
not defined as x equals three.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.533
We get this indeterminate form.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.008
We get zero over zero.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.644
But let's see, even though the function,

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:57.648
even though the expression is not defined,

00:00:57.648 --> 00:01:01.902
let's see if we can get a sense
of what the limit might be.

00:01:01.902 --> 00:01:05.291
And to do that, I'm
going to set up a table.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.874
So, let me set up a table here.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.118
And actually I'm going
to set up two tables.

00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:14.868
So this is x and this is x to the third

00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:19.160
minus 3x squared over 5x minus 15.

00:01:23.373 --> 00:01:24.889
Actually, I'm going to do that again,

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:27.273
and I'll tell you why in a second.

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:31.460
So, this is gonna be x,
and this is x to the third

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.293
minus 3x squared over 5x minus 15.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.473
The reason why I set up two tables,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:39.538
I didn't have to do two tables.

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:40.917
I could have done it all in one table,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.301
but hopefully, this will make it

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.195
a little bit more intuitive
what I'm trying to do,

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:46.575
is on this left table,

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:48.307
I'm gonna, let's try out x values

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.628
that get closer and close to three

00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:54.077
from the left, from values
that are less than three.

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:57.198
So for example, we could
go to 2.9 and figure out

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.967
what the expression equals
when x is 2.9, but then

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:01.611
we could try to get even a
little bit closer than that.

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:03.278
We could go to 2.99,

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.259
and then we could go
even closer than that.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.426
We could go to 2.999, and so,
one way to think about it here

00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:16.114
is as we try to figure out
what this expression equals

00:02:16.114 --> 00:02:18.325
as we get closer and closer to three,

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:22.308
we're trying to approximate
the limit from the left.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.308
So, limit from the left.

00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:29.582
And why do I say the left?

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.028
Well, if you would think about
this on a coordinate plane,

00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:34.330
these are the x values, so
they're to the left of three,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.232
but we're getting closer
and closer and closer.

00:02:36.232 --> 00:02:37.443
We're moving to the right,

00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:40.547
but these are the x values
that are on the left side

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:42.424
of three, that are less than three.

00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:44.729
But we also, in order
for the limit to exist,

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.691
we have to be approaching the
same thing from both sides,

00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:49.438
from both the left and the right.

00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:51.120
So we could also try to approximate

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.203
the limit from the right,

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:56.896
and so what values would those be?

00:02:56.896 --> 00:03:00.449
Well, those would be x
values larger than three,

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.612
so we could say 3.1,

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:03.912
but then we might wanna
get a little bit closer.

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:06.261
We could go 3.01, but
then we might wanna get

00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:07.236
even closer to three.

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:11.403
3.001, and every time we get
closer and closer to three,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.287
we're gonna get a better approximation,

00:03:14.287 --> 00:03:16.695
or we're gonna get a better sense

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:19.887
of what we are actually approaching.

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:21.401
So let's get a calculator out and do this,

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.717
and you could keep going, 2.999999,

00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:24.550
3.000001.

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.797
Now, one key idea here to point out

00:03:28.797 --> 00:03:30.965
before I even calculate
what these are going to be,

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.518
sometimes when people say
the limit from both sides

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:35.734
or the limit from the left
or the limit from the right,

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:38.769
they imagine that the limit
from the left is negative values

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.230
and the limit from the
right are positive values.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.661
But as you can see here,
the limit from the left

00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:46.234
are to the left of the x value

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:48.471
that you're trying to find the limit at.

00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:50.177
So these aren't negative values.

00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:52.438
These are just approaching the three

00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:55.038
right over here from
values less than three.

00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:59.817
This is approaching the three
from values larger than three.

00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:00.650
So let's see.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.065
Let's calculate the
value of this expression

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:05.232
when x is equal to 2.9.

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.363
So we have 2.9

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.930
to the third power

00:04:12.113 --> 00:04:14.613
minus three times 2.9 squared,

00:04:21.203 --> 00:04:24.242
which is, close the parentheses,

00:04:24.242 --> 00:04:28.747
so that's our numerator,
and then divided by,

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:32.247
open parentheses, five times 2.9 minus 15,

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.775
that's our denominator,
is equal to, let's see,

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:39.275
I got about 1.682.

00:04:41.628 --> 00:04:42.461
1.682.

00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:48.675
So now let's keep going.

00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:49.797
So, let's see.

00:04:49.797 --> 00:04:52.464
If we do 2.99 to the third power

00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:57.661
minus 3 times 2.99 squared

00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:06.555
is equal to, and then we divide that

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.971
by our denominator, open parentheses,

00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:13.971
five times 2.99 minus 15

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:19.610
is equal to 1.78802.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.802
Well, I'll just found that to 1.788,

00:05:27.802 --> 00:05:29.469
approximately 1.788,

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:32.864
and now let's get even closer to three.

00:05:32.864 --> 00:05:34.780
Remember, we're now approaching
three from the left,

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.252
so 2.999 is even that
much closer to three.

00:05:38.252 --> 00:05:41.301
So let's get the calculator out again,

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:42.384
and we get...

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.786
Now we get 2.999 to the third power

00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:53.381
minus three times, open
parentheses, 2.999 squared,

00:05:58.018 --> 00:05:59.747
close parentheses.

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:01.342
So that's our numerator.

00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:03.759
Divided by, open parenthesis,

00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.018
fives times 2.999 minus 15

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.652
is equal to 1.7988 or
approximately 1.7988.

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:21.117
Approximately 1.7988.

00:06:23.974 --> 00:06:28.378
So it seems to be getting
closer and closer to 1.8,

00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:29.784
and you could even verify.

00:06:29.784 --> 00:06:34.077
Try 2.9999, see if it's
getting closer to 1.8.

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:37.042
So this is our limit from the left.

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:39.977
Now we could try the limit from the right.

00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:42.644
So what happens when we try 3.1.

00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:46.814
So 3.1 to the third power

00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:53.454
minus three times, open
parentheses, 3.1 squared,

00:06:55.987 --> 00:06:59.001
close parentheses, that's our numerator,

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.668
divided by, open
parentheses, five times 3.1

00:07:04.935 --> 00:07:09.102
minus 15, that's our
denominator, is equal to 1.922.

00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.164
1.922.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:15.443
All right, let's keep going.

00:07:15.443 --> 00:07:18.783
This is something
strangely fun about this.

00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:22.294
All right, so let's see when x is 3.01.

00:07:22.294 --> 00:07:26.095
So now we're approaching
x equals 3 from the right,

00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:27.729
from values that are larger.

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.315
We're getting closer
and closer and closer.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.083
We're approaching from the right,

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.810
but we're moving towards the left,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.410
towards x equals three, without
equaling x equals three.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.660
So now let's do 3.01 to the third power

00:07:42.303 --> 00:07:45.121
minus three times, open parentheses,

00:07:45.121 --> 00:07:47.871
3.01 squared, closed parentheses.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.395
That's our numerator.

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:55.145
Divided by, open
parentheses, five times 3.01

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.713
minus 15, close parentheses,
is equal to 1.81,

00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:06.578
I'll say roughly 1.812,
approximately 1.812.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:13.628
It does look like we're
approaching 1.8 from above, now,

00:08:13.628 --> 00:08:17.028
but let's just get even closer, 3.001.

00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:20.596
So we can finish at least
what I put on our tables here.

00:08:20.596 --> 00:08:22.559
If you're unsure, you can
just keep getting closer

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:26.131
and closer and closer,
3.0000001 if you're interested.

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.315
But let's just do this one.

00:08:27.315 --> 00:08:29.315
3.001 to the third power

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.407
minus three times 3.001 squared,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.528
close parentheses, that's our numerator,

00:08:41.528 --> 00:08:45.695
divided by, open parentheses,
five times 3.001 minus 15,

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:53.229
that's our denominator,
is equal to roughly 1.801.

00:08:54.824 --> 00:08:56.741
So approximately 1.801.

00:08:58.178 --> 00:09:01.174
So based on what we're
seeing here, I would make

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:05.763
the estimate that this looks
like it's approaching 1.8,

00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:07.749
so is this equal to 1.8.

00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:10.250
As I said, in the future,
we're going to be able to find

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.722
this out exactly, but if
you're not sure about this,

00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:16.477
you could try even closer
and closer and closer values.

00:09:16.477 --> 00:09:17.496
Actually, just for kicks,

00:09:17.496 --> 00:09:19.455
let's just do a super close value.

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:20.872
Let's do 2.99999.

00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:27.476
Let's see what that gets us.

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:28.786
So we're getting really close.

00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:29.660
We're approaching from the left,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.130
but we're getting really
close to three now.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.414
So let me get the calculator out here.

00:09:35.414 --> 00:09:36.316
Okay, so how many is that?

00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:37.933
That is five nines.

00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:41.350
So two point one, two, three, four, five,

00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:43.937
to the third power,

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.390
minus three times,

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.503
and we're gonna have two point

00:09:51.503 --> 00:09:54.586
one, two, three, four, five, squared,

00:09:55.469 --> 00:09:57.148
close parentheses.

00:09:57.148 --> 00:09:58.581
That's our numerator.

00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:01.164
Divided by five times two point

00:10:03.392 --> 00:10:05.887
one, two, three, four, five,

00:10:05.887 --> 00:10:09.387
2.99999, minus 15, that's our denominator,

00:10:11.584 --> 00:10:14.717
is equal to, notice, we got even closer.

00:10:14.717 --> 00:10:16.249
In fact, if we round this at all,

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:18.998
this is going to be 1.8.

00:10:18.998 --> 00:10:22.144
So yeah, if we round it
to the nearest thousandth,

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:23.381
this is going to...

00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:25.606
Yeah, if we round this to
the nearest thousandth,

00:10:25.606 --> 00:10:27.549
this is going to be 1.8.

00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:31.037
So we're getting very close here to 1.8,

00:10:31.037 --> 00:10:32.750
and if you're not feeling good about that,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.685
you could go even closer
and closer and closer

00:10:35.685 --> 00:10:39.026
to three to feel better and
better and better about it.

00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:40.071
Once again, we're approximating it.

00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:41.855
We're seeing, what is the
behavior as we get closer

00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:44.687
and closer to three from
the left and from the right.

00:10:44.687 --> 00:10:47.003
And not only is this valuable
for calculating limits,

00:10:47.003 --> 00:10:48.994
and sometimes you would have
to calculate them numerically

00:10:48.994 --> 00:10:51.649
like this, but it also
gives you an intuition

00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:54.149
for what a limit is all about.
