00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.860
To access a course,
we'll click on one from this menu.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.300
I'll use Computer Networking
as an example.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.140
Once you're into a course, you'll see
a number of pages over here on the left.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.260
The Dashboard lists all
lessons in the course.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.630
A green check mark will appear when you
have completed all of the videos and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.320
quizzes in a lesson.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.530
The orange playback icon will
appear next to the lesson

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.380
you most recently viewed.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.780
Gray circles will appear next to
any lesson you have started but

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.500
have not completed.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.100
Or you can download the entire
course's videos and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.450
transcripts over on the right.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.960
For some courses, you'll find
a materials section over on the left.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.180
Here you may find some
course information.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.270
&gt;&gt; Different courses use
these pages differently.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.460
Some courses list their
information on T-Square,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.170
others will list it on Udacity.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.970
Make sure to pay attention
to where the information for

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.720
the course you're taking is listed.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.290
But for the vast majority of time
you're working with Udacity.com,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.270
you'll be in the classroom.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.540
So let's take a look at that next.
