00:00:00.697 --> 00:00:03.148
 In biological systems is very important 

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:05.226
 to be able to 

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:06.677
 phosphorylate glucose. 

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:08.325
 Let's start with the glucose molecule 

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:10.419
 and phosphorylate it. This is important because 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.497
 once we have that phosphate group - 

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:15.039
 Let me put the charge on it. 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.396
 Once we add this phosphate group 

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:18.778
 or if we have that negative charge 

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:20.693
 in glucose-6-phosphate, 

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.829
 it becomes much harder for him to leave the cage. 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.720
 A cell wants to have as many molecules of glucose as possible. 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.032
 When glucose is not loaded, 

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:29.272
 it can pass through the cell membrane, 

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:30.909
 but once it is phosphorylated, 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.534
 will remain in the cage. 

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.659
 Additionally, glucose-6-phosphate 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.737
 is very important for 

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:40.951
 a whole sequence of processes in the cells. 

00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.956
 Unfortunately, the reaction 

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.011
 of phosphorylation of glucose 

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:49.611
 requires energy. It is endogenous 

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.527
 and will not go spontaneously. 

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:54.174
 The value of delta G for this reaction is positive. 

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:57.830
 She is 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.850
 endergonic. 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.096
 You can guess what we will need, 

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:03.187
 to be able to run. 

00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:06.321
 We will have to use the cell's energy currency, 

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.539
 our good friend ATF. 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.617
 For the glucose phosphorylation reaction to occur, you need to 

00:01:10.617 --> 00:01:12.997
 combined with a reaction that we can look at 

00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:14.924
 such as hydrolysis of ATP, 

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:16.839
 although we will not have a precise molecule of water 

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:18.035
 in the mechanism, 

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:20.566
 but functionally the reaction is hydrolysis of ATP 

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.400
 to ADP and a phosphate group. 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.524
 ATP hydrolysis is energy-efficient, 

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:25.999
 it is exergonic, 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.798
 will run spontaneously 

00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:29.307
 under the right conditions. 

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:30.480
 I will not run constantly 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.059
 in the cell solution, 

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:34.505
 it needs a little activating energy or enzyme, 

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:36.305
 which will lower the activating energy, 

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.905
 but overall the reaction is exogenous. 

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.587
 We can combine these two reactions. 

00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:44.524
 When we combine them, 

00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:45.998
 when we combine the two reactions, 

00:01:45.998 --> 00:01:48.153
 we have ATP, 

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:50.883
 ATP plus glucose, 

00:01:51.588 --> 00:01:53.732
 plus glucose, 

00:01:55.374 --> 00:01:56.303
 who respond. 

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.195
 We also use an enzyme, 

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:00.378
 the generic term for which is hexokinase, 

00:02:00.378 --> 00:02:03.872
 it helps the reaction by reducing the activating energy. 

00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:06.542
 We'll get 

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:10.512
 glucose-6-phosphate 

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:14.753
 glucose-6-phosphate 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.535
 glucose-6-phosphate 

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.266
 and ADP. 

00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:23.725
 And ADP. 

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.157
 A-D-F. 

00:02:26.157 --> 00:02:28.618
 What is the value of delta G for this reaction? 

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:30.290
 We can look at the reaction 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.774
 as a combination of two reactions, 

00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:34.481
 so we can roughly say, 

00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:36.419
 that we will collect the values ​​of delta G. 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.451
 If we collect the delta G values, 

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:39.519
 we will get - 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.901
 If we collect this negative value of delta G 

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:43.454
 of the exergy reaction and this positive value, 

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:47.471
 we will have -30.5 plus 13.8, 

00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:51.952
 which is -16.7 kJ / mol 

00:02:51.952 --> 00:02:54.019
 kJ / mol. 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.339
 Therefore, this combination of reactions will be exogenous. 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.150
 Not so exergic as hydrolysis, 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.379
 because we will use some of its energy, 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.317
 but it can go spontaneously 

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:05.709
 especially if we lower the activating energy enough. 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.276
 especially if we lower the activating energy enough. 

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:09.470
 Now let's look at the mechanism, 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.573
 in which it flows. 

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:13.232
 If we do not have an enzyme, 

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:15.774
 the mechanism of reaction is as follows, 

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:18.537
 we have 

00:03:18.537 --> 00:03:20.336
 free electron pair here, 

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:21.927
 in this hydroxyl group 

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:24.957
 and it must participate in a nucleophilic response 

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:28.312
 with this phosphor atom here. 

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.831
 But it will be very difficult without an enzyme. 

00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:32.746
 The reaction will have a very high activating energy, 

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.755
 because all these negative charges 

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:37.785
 oxygen atoms will interfere. 

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.108
 You can guess that the electrons do not 

00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:40.455
 love the negative charges, 

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:42.312
 they are repelled by negative charges. 

00:03:42.312 --> 00:03:43.972
 That is why we will need an enzyme, 

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:45.690
 to help the reaction 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.206
 and to lower the activating energy in order for the reaction to begin. 

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:52.969
 The enzyme virtually removes these electrons from the reaction path. 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.513
 The enzyme or the general term 

00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:57.949
 for the enzymes with this function - hexokinase. 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.461
 Hexokinase, I'll write it down. 

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:04.059
 Hexokinase. 

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:07.791
 Hexokinase "delivers" ions, 

00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:09.126
 we can imagine that they 

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.669
 keep these electrons "busy". 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.188
 More specifically, the enzyme has a magnesium ion, 

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:16.510
 magnesium ion 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.764
 right here, 

00:04:17.764 --> 00:04:20.631
 which is linked to the rest of the hexokinase. 

00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:22.407
 Remember, all this happens in three dimensions. 

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:24.891
 We can say that hexokinase is wrapped around molecules, 

00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.411
 to "dispel" these electrons, 

00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:29.965
 there are other ions in the hexokinase, 

00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:31.567
 who hold these electrons "busy". 

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.666
 Other positive ions "distract" these electrons. 

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:36.524
 So these electrons can slip 

00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:38.706
 and to carry out the nucleophilic reaction. 

00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:40.146
 Remember, the enzymes are 

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:42.584
 proteins. 

00:04:42.584 --> 00:04:45.811
 I will write it in the same color that I wrote hexokinase. 

00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:49.410
 Enzymes are these complex protein structures 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.906
 right here. 

00:04:51.906 --> 00:04:54.587
 We can have magnesium ion, 

00:04:54.587 --> 00:04:57.082
 I will color it in purple. 

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:02.520
 Right here and maybe the glucose molecule - 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.433
 the glucose molecule binds here, 

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:08.371
 then we have ATP, 

00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.739
 he connects here. 

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:12.829
 Obviously simple 

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.454
 I give an example, 

00:05:14.454 --> 00:05:16.196
 not everything is happening in reality. 

00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:19.794
 But in essence, the enzyme is wrapped around the molecules with its positive charges, 

00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.849
 manages to pull the electrons aside 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.276
 and to promote the nucleophilic response, 

00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:27.433
 which has to be accomplished. 

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:28.873
 Therefore, this link here, 

00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:32.251
 between this oxygen and this phosphorus, 

00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:34.236
 will be, 

00:05:34.236 --> 00:05:37.556
 this link will be here. 

00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:42.262
 When this happens, 

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:46.342
 these two electrons can be taken from 

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:48.919
 this oxygen. 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.672
 This oxygen here, 

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:53.110
 he will now have a negative charge. 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.596
 That's what we got 

00:05:54.596 --> 00:05:58.137
 glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. 

00:05:58.137 --> 00:05:59.715
 And ADP. 

00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:01.677
 This reaction is energy-efficient, 

00:06:01.677 --> 00:06:02.734
 it is exergonic. 

00:06:02.734 --> 00:06:03.871
 It will happen, 

00:06:03.871 --> 00:06:05.299
 provided that we have the enzyme, 

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:08.074
 which "distracts" these electrons 

00:06:08.074 --> 00:06:09.955
 and reduces the activating energy. 

00:06:09.955 --> 00:06:10.976
 I know what you think, 

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:12.950
 we had hydrogen here, 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.596
 this hydrogen must still be here, 

00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:17.152
 then another water molecule may come 

00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:20.356
 and grab the proton, the water proton. 

00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:22.016
 And so we get it again 

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:25.058
 glucose-6-phosphate. 

00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:26.811
 I hope this video clarified you 

00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.808
 how combinations of reactions, 

00:06:28.808 --> 00:06:32.476
 and why ATP is actually useful. 

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:33.730
 When I was studying for the ATF I first thought, 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.775
 well, 

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:36.416
 he really wants to get rid of it 

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:39.365
 of this phosphate group, it is energy efficient, 

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.698
 but how to use this, 

00:06:41.698 --> 00:06:45.424
 to trigger other processes to happen 

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:47.964
 something in the system, 

00:06:47.964 --> 00:06:49.879
 which may not be energy-efficient. 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.702
 I hope that this video explained to you how this is happening, 

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:54.836
 as well as the importance of enzymes 

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:57.048
 for this reaction.
