[Music]

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950
 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.200
is there an external reality of course

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210
is there an external reality of course
 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.880
is there an external reality of course
there's an external reality the world

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
there's an external reality the world
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.549
there's an external reality the world
exists it's just that we don't see it

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559
exists it's just that we don't see it
 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.350
exists it's just that we don't see it
these we don't see as it is in fact we

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
these we don't see as it is in fact we
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720
these we don't see as it is in fact we
can never see it at incidence in fact

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
can never see it at incidence in fact
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.599
can never see it at incidence in fact
it's even useful to not see it it is and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
it's even useful to not see it it is and
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.279
it's even useful to not see it it is and
the reason is because it goes back to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
the reason is because it goes back to
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410
the reason is because it goes back to
really Berkeley who told us we have no

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
really Berkeley who told us we have no
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880
really Berkeley who told us we have no
direct access to that physical world

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
direct access to that physical world
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.150
direct access to that physical world
other than through our senses and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160
other than through our senses and
 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.680
other than through our senses and
because our senses conflate multiple

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690
because our senses conflate multiple
 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.200
because our senses conflate multiple
aspects of that world we can never know

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
aspects of that world we can never know
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.209
aspects of that world we can never know
whether our perceptions are in any way

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
whether our perceptions are in any way
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.580
whether our perceptions are in any way
accurate and so this has always been a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
accurate and so this has always been a
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.410
accurate and so this has always been a
very deep question it's not so much do

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
very deep question it's not so much do
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.840
very deep question it's not so much do
we see the world in the way that really

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
we see the world in the way that really
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.250
we see the world in the way that really
is but do we actually even see it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
is but do we actually even see it
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.180
is but do we actually even see it
accurately and the answer is no we don't

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190
accurately and the answer is no we don't
 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.630
accurately and the answer is no we don't
so the if we remember that the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
so the if we remember that the
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.279
so the if we remember that the
information that's coming on to your eye

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
information that's coming on to your eye
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.369
information that's coming on to your eye
or onto your skin or into your ears is

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379
or onto your skin or into your ears is
 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.139
or onto your skin or into your ears is
inherently meaningless because it could

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
inherently meaningless because it could
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.590
inherently meaningless because it could
mean anything then it means that we need

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
mean anything then it means that we need
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.259
mean anything then it means that we need
another kind of data in order to be able

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269
another kind of data in order to be able
 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.930
another kind of data in order to be able
to generate behaviors that are useful

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
to generate behaviors that are useful
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.010
to generate behaviors that are useful
and that data is necessarily historical

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020
and that data is necessarily historical
 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.209
and that data is necessarily historical
which means that the functional

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219
which means that the functional
 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.429
which means that the functional
structure of your brain is really a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
structure of your brain is really a
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.319
structure of your brain is really a
physical manifestation of your past

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329
physical manifestation of your past
 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.539
physical manifestation of your past
interactions with the world and it's a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
interactions with the world and it's a
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429
interactions with the world and it's a
physical active interaction it's not a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439
physical active interaction it's not a
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.069
physical active interaction it's not a
passive receiving data like a Facebook

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079
passive receiving data like a Facebook
 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.410
passive receiving data like a Facebook
broadcast is an active engagement with

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
broadcast is an active engagement with
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.130
broadcast is an active engagement with
that world so for instance if you take

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
that world so for instance if you take
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440
that world so for instance if you take
there's a well-known experiment back in

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
there's a well-known experiment back in
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.080
there's a well-known experiment back in
the 70s where you had two kittens

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090
the 70s where you had two kittens
 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.539
the 70s where you had two kittens
recently born eyes just opened and you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
recently born eyes just opened and you
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.069
recently born eyes just opened and you
had one kitten that was effectively

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
had one kitten that was effectively
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.899
had one kitten that was effectively
running on the ground I perfectly fine

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
running on the ground I perfectly fine
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.669
running on the ground I perfectly fine
and you had another one that was in a

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679
and you had another one that was in a
 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.190
and you had another one that was in a
basket and the one in the basket was

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
basket and the one in the basket was
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289
basket and the one in the basket was
connected to one on the ground which

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
connected to one on the ground which
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.370
connected to one on the ground which
meant that wherever the one in the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
meant that wherever the one in the
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.039
meant that wherever the one in the
basket went it was because it was aware

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
basket went it was because it was aware
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.469
basket went it was because it was aware
the one on the ground also went the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
the one on the ground also went the
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.999
the one on the ground also went the
point is that they had the same visual

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
point is that they had the same visual
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.880
point is that they had the same visual
history of the world then after a period

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
history of the world then after a period
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.200
history of the world then after a period
of time you test the vision of the one

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
of time you test the vision of the one
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.760
of time you test the vision of the one
on the ground and it seems fine as you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
on the ground and it seems fine as you
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469
on the ground and it seems fine as you
would expect but the question is what

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
would expect but the question is what
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.200
would expect but the question is what
does the one in the basket see and the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
does the one in the basket see and the
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.090
does the one in the basket see and the
answer is that it doesn't see anything

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
answer is that it doesn't see anything
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.029
answer is that it doesn't see anything
it's blind because it's never been able

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039
it's blind because it's never been able
 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.789
it's blind because it's never been able
to physically engage with the sources of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
to physically engage with the sources of
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.740
to physically engage with the sources of
this meaning

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750
this meaning
 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.650
this meaning
information and make meaning from it so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660
information and make meaning from it so
 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.180
information and make meaning from it so
then when you let it run around it

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
then when you let it run around it
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.360
then when you let it run around it
learns to see you again now sometimes

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
learns to see you again now sometimes
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.470
learns to see you again now sometimes
it's really difficult for people to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
it's really difficult for people to
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.050
it's really difficult for people to
understand that the data that your brain

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
understand that the data that your brain
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.690
understand that the data that your brain
is receiving is meaningless because when

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
is receiving is meaningless because when
 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.920
is receiving is meaningless because when
they open eyes they look around and say

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930
they open eyes they look around and say
 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.300
they open eyes they look around and say
why I see everything what do you mean

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310
why I see everything what do you mean
 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.949
why I see everything what do you mean
it's meaningless so a really simple

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959
it's meaningless so a really simple
 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.140
it's meaningless so a really simple
example in fact is possibly one of the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150
example in fact is possibly one of the
 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.740
example in fact is possibly one of the
most fundamental example is color so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750
most fundamental example is color so
 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.480
most fundamental example is color so
actually if you think about the what

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490
actually if you think about the what
 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.880
actually if you think about the what
they call dress gate and the power of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890
they call dress gate and the power of
 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.300
they call dress gate and the power of
that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
that
 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.130
that
well I found really remarkable because

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140
well I found really remarkable because
 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.840
well I found really remarkable because
we're all familiar with illusions and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
we're all familiar with illusions and
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.510
we're all familiar with illusions and
we're all quite happy with the idea that

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520
we're all quite happy with the idea that
 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.060
we're all quite happy with the idea that
someone who is a French speaker has a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070
someone who is a French speaker has a
 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.770
someone who is a French speaker has a
different word different meanings than

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780
different word different meanings than
 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.330
different word different meanings than
someone who's an English speaker because

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
someone who's an English speaker because
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.800
someone who's an English speaker because
we're quite happy that things that are

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810
we're quite happy that things that are
 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.050
we're quite happy that things that are
very cultural or in our own experience

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
very cultural or in our own experience
 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.820
very cultural or in our own experience
we can experience differently we can

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830
we can experience differently we can
 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.860
we can experience differently we can
have different concepts but as soon as

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870
have different concepts but as soon as
 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.420
have different concepts but as soon as
people realize that you can have

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
people realize that you can have
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.970
people realize that you can have
different coloured perceptions that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980
different coloured perceptions that
 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.530
different coloured perceptions that
really challenge them because it means

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540
really challenge them because it means
 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.240
really challenge them because it means
if that's true what does it mean for the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250
if that's true what does it mean for the
 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.840
if that's true what does it mean for the
perception of reality right so colour is

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850
perception of reality right so colour is
 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.470
perception of reality right so colour is
a wonderful concept because it's both

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480
a wonderful concept because it's both
 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.940
a wonderful concept because it's both
very literal and abstract and what's

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950
very literal and abstract and what's
 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.590
very literal and abstract and what's
true for colour is true for everything

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600
true for colour is true for everything
 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.410
true for colour is true for everything
about what we see so take for instance

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420
about what we see so take for instance
 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.330
about what we see so take for instance
what is the source of our perception of

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
what is the source of our perception of
 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.789
what is the source of our perception of
colour it's light and it's light from

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799
colour it's light and it's light from
 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.590
colour it's light and it's light from
four to seven or nanometers which is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600
four to seven or nanometers which is
 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.259
four to seven or nanometers which is
actually a very tiny window of the

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269
actually a very tiny window of the
 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.580
actually a very tiny window of the
electromagnetic radiation right so even

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
electromagnetic radiation right so even
 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.740
electromagnetic radiation right so even
at that point we're seeing a tiny window

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750
at that point we're seeing a tiny window
 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.990
at that point we're seeing a tiny window
within the potential energy that we

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000
within the potential energy that we
 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.120
within the potential energy that we
could in theory detect what's more

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130
could in theory detect what's more
 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.550
could in theory detect what's more
that's a linear scale from four December

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560
that's a linear scale from four December
 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.940
that's a linear scale from four December
from small to large but our perception

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950
from small to large but our perception
 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.330
from small to large but our perception
of color which starts with light is

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340
of color which starts with light is
 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.970
of color which starts with light is
anything but simple in fact it's a

anything but simple in fact it's a
 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.650
anything but simple in fact it's a
three-dimensional perceptual space

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660
three-dimensional perceptual space
 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.199
three-dimensional perceptual space
inside our head so for instance you have

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209
inside our head so for instance you have
 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.229
inside our head so for instance you have
a brightness axis which is intensity you

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239
a brightness axis which is intensity you
 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.390
a brightness axis which is intensity you
have a saturation axis which is how much

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400
have a saturation axis which is how much
 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.580
have a saturation axis which is how much
gray is in the color so a fire engine is

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590
gray is in the color so a fire engine is
 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.500
gray is in the color so a fire engine is
very unsaturated or rather a very

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510
very unsaturated or rather a very
 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.560
very unsaturated or rather a very
saturated red and a pink is a relatively

saturated red and a pink is a relatively
 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.229
saturated red and a pink is a relatively
unsaturated red has gray in it and then

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239
unsaturated red has gray in it and then
 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.390
unsaturated red has gray in it and then
you have hue which is red green blue and

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400
you have hue which is red green blue and
 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.300
you have hue which is red green blue and
yellow what's remarkable is that the two

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310
yellow what's remarkable is that the two
 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.550
yellow what's remarkable is that the two
ends of the spectrum the physical

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560
ends of the spectrum the physical
 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.710
ends of the spectrum the physical
spectrum say short wavelengths which we

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720
spectrum say short wavelengths which we
 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.979
spectrum say short wavelengths which we
perceive to be violet and blue

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989
perceive to be violet and blue
 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.680
perceive to be violet and blue
and the other end of the spectrum which

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690
and the other end of the spectrum which
 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.719
and the other end of the spectrum which
we perceive to be red are actually

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729
we perceive to be red are actually
 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.370
we perceive to be red are actually
perceptually more similar to each other

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380
perceptually more similar to each other
 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.129
perceptually more similar to each other
than they are to the middle part of the

than they are to the middle part of the
 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.290
than they are to the middle part of the
spectrum which means that our

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300
spectrum which means that our
 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.900
spectrum which means that our
perceptions color is a circle which

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910
perceptions color is a circle which
 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.339
perceptions color is a circle which
means the largest and the smallest

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349
means the largest and the smallest
 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.650

even at that most basic level what we're
 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.499
even at that most basic level what we're
seeing is not what's actually even in

perception of color is categorical you

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880
perception of color is categorical you
 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.610
perception of color is categorical you
can define every color in terms of red

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620
can define every color in terms of red
 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.580
can define every color in terms of red
green blue and yellow and each category

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590
green blue and yellow and each category
 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.089
green blue and yellow and each category
is defined by what we call unique cue a

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099
is defined by what we call unique cue a
 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.499

hue in it whereas orange you can
 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.580
hue in it whereas orange you can
perceive sort of a combination of red

perceive sort of a combination of red
 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.920
perceive sort of a combination of red
and yellow but with red you only see red

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930
and yellow but with red you only see red
 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.710
and yellow but with red you only see red
yellow you only see yellow but there's

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720
yellow you only see yellow but there's
 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.140

nothing categorical about spectra
they're continuous distributions so at

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319
they're continuous distributions so at
 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.879
they're continuous distributions so at
this most basic level we don't represent

this most basic level we don't represent
 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.980
this most basic level we don't represent
even the information we're getting in

even the information we're getting in
 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.860
even the information we're getting in
any accurate way and the reason is

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870
any accurate way and the reason is
 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.249
any accurate way and the reason is
because it was useful to see it this way

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259
because it was useful to see it this way
 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.600
because it was useful to see it this way
so we've seen the utility of the data

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610
so we've seen the utility of the data
 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.970
so we've seen the utility of the data
not the data
