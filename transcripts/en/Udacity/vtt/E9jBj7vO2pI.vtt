00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.300
In lesson 3,
we looked at text field customization.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.190
We created delegate objects which
implemented the protocol that

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.080
the UI text field class
was designed to use.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.640
In this lesson,
we're going to look at table views.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.560
And, you'll see that they're more
complex, but that their architected

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.690
in a similar way, just like text views,
table views use delegates.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.430
Both view classes need view controllers
to implement delegate protocols,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.750
in order to invoke
the methods they need.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.580
Methods that would be inappropriate
to implement inside of view class.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.370
Again, with tables, you'll see that
we can customize UI kit views by

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.910
implementing their protocol
methods in our own way.
