00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
- [Voiceover] We've done
many videos on Khan Academy

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.209
on evolution and natural
selection explaining them,

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:07.688
but I thought I would do
a video going a little bit

00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:09.893
more in depth in evidence for evolution

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:11.383
and natural selection.

00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:14.147
And I started with this
quote "Nothing in biology

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.745
makes sense except in
the light of evolution."

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:19.496
This is by Theodus
Dobzhansky, who's a famous

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:22.012
biologist, he's passed
away now, and what he's

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:23.912
saying is absolutely
true and this is why it's

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:26.454
so important to appreciate
the evidence for evolution

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:28.938
and natural selection
and to understand them,

00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:32.841
because before the theory
of evolution, biology was

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.678
just about observation
and classification without

00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:38.455
having a cohesive narrative
for how all of this

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:39.667
came about.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.093
And since Darwin had
come up with this theory

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:45.989
in the mid-19th century,
we've had far more tools

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.502
to back it up beyond just
the observations we had

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:50.682
up until that point.

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:53.430
We have our tools around
dating and the fossil

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.328
record, which gives us much more evidence.

00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:57.847
We have our tools of
microbiology and genetics,

00:00:57.847 --> 00:01:00.445
which gives us even
stronger evidence, so a lot

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:02.065
of times people say "Oh,
it's a theory, evolution

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.222
"is it just a theory?"

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:06.196
Well, it's about as strong as theories get

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:09.661
and without it, as Theodus
Dobzhansky said, biology

00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:12.735
as we know it and all of
the progress we've made

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:14.551
in biology frankly wouldn't make any sense

00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:16.908
and probably would not have happened.

00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:19.719
Now I'm going to broadly
go into three types

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.696
of evidence in this video for evolution

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:24.056
and natural selection.

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:26.068
The first is structural.

00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:28.830
And these are the types
of things that folks like

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.457
Darwin would have observed,
that people have been

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.565
observing in biology for a long time

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:36.006
but evolution and natural
selection starts to make

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.202
a lot more sense of it,
and here we're talking

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:40.134
about the macro structure,
things that we can

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:41.989
for the most part observe
with our eyes or with

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:44.018
a very simple microscope.

00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:47.753
The next level is what
we've learned, really over

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.673
the last 100 or so years,
at the micro level,

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:53.560
in microbiology.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.893
Microbiology and especially in genetics.

00:01:58.512 --> 00:02:02.509
So this has really firmed
up the theory of evolution.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.927
And then the last dimension we'll look at

00:02:04.927 --> 00:02:08.975
is direct observation, direct observation,

00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:11.378
and this is really where
it goes beyond a theory.

00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:12.967
We are seeing it happen.

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.114
A lot of times people
say "Oh, it's a theory,

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:18.220
"you know, the theory
says it happened over tens

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.817
"of millions of years but
no one was around to really

00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:23.619
"observe, even if we see
a lot of evidence, no one

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:25.622
"knows if it for sure happened."

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:28.138
But if you're directly
observing things, well you

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.216
know it's for sure
happening and as we'll see,

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.762
evolution does not only
occur over time scales

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:35.025
of millions or tens of millions of years,

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:37.516
it actually can occur
and we see it occurring

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:41.217
all the time on scales well within a human

00:02:41.217 --> 00:02:43.391
observational capacity,
within just a matter

00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:45.677
of months or years.

00:02:45.677 --> 00:02:47.049
So let's go through each of these.

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.547
So first let's talk about
structural and this is

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:49.811
a very high-level overview.

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:51.441
I encourage you to do more research on it.

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:54.325
You will find loads and
loads and loads of any

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:56.077
type of this evidence.

00:02:56.077 --> 00:02:57.999
So the first thing I want to talk about is

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:02.278
homologous structures,
homologous structures,

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:06.028
that you see throughout
the biological world.

00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:10.105
Hom-ol-o-gous, homologous structures.

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:14.208
And the word homologous
means things that have

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:17.326
similar structure,
similar position, similar

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:21.620
ancestry but not necessarily
the exact same function.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.957
And here you see examples
of a, well as a human,

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:26.498
we would consider a forearm.

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.460
You see the human forearm
and wrist and then you

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.941
see the homologous
structures in dogs and birds

00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.056
and whales.

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:34.846
And even though this part
of those animals have

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:37.498
very different functions,
a human does not walk

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:40.760
on its hands for the most
part; a dog does walk

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.009
on its front legs; a bird
isn't walking at all,

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.642
it's using them to flap
its wings; and a whale,

00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:51.258
this is making up its actual fins,

00:03:51.258 --> 00:03:54.972
it's using them to propel or to control

00:03:54.972 --> 00:03:57.064
their movement inside of the water.

00:03:57.064 --> 00:03:58.830
And even though they have these very, very

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.630
different functions and
at first when you look

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.878
at a human and a bird and
a whale on the outside,

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:05.461
they might look reasonably
different, when you look

00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.470
at these bone structures,
they are eerily similar,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.285
especially color-coded the way it is.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:15.495
So these are, this is
a very strong hint that

00:04:15.495 --> 00:04:18.242
maybe humans, dogs,
birds, and whales share

00:04:18.242 --> 00:04:22.132
a common ancestor, more
recently in the past

00:04:22.132 --> 00:04:26.124
than say other animals or
organisms, I should say,

00:04:26.124 --> 00:04:30.103
that don't have, whose
structures aren't as

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.313
homologous as these are right over here.

00:04:33.313 --> 00:04:36.330
And if you were independently
trying to create

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.685
structures for what each
of these different species

00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:42.958
are doing, it's not
obvious that you would have

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.829
such homologous structures
actually be involved.

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:49.388
Now these are all
species that exist today,

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.226
these are all species
that exist on the planet

00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:53.691
at the same time, but
we also see structural

00:04:53.691 --> 00:04:57.108
evidence by going into the fossil record.

00:04:58.053 --> 00:05:00.566
In the last few hundred
years, or early in the last

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.763
hundred years is where
we've gotten really good

00:05:02.763 --> 00:05:06.377
at it, we've gotten good
at looking at different

00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:09.801
layers of rock strata and
being able to date them

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:11.716
and say "Okay, that layer
was laid down x-million

00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:13.988
"years ago, that layer
was laid down a little bit

00:05:13.988 --> 00:05:16.341
"more recent, this one
was even more recent,"

00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:18.791
and then looking at
fossils within that to say

00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:20.913
"Okay, 20 million years
ago there were species

00:05:20.913 --> 00:05:23.071
"around that looked something like that,

00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:25.132
"and then 10 million years
ago there were species

00:05:25.132 --> 00:05:26.268
"that looked like that."

00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:30.497
And one example is if you
look at a horse-like animal.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.368
So this is right over
here, we're talking about

00:05:32.368 --> 00:05:34.932
horses, zebras, donkeys,
mules, things like that,

00:05:34.932 --> 00:05:37.809
the modern ones, well this
is their bone structure

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.368
but if you look at the
fossil record from 12 to 5

00:05:40.368 --> 00:05:45.128
million years ago, you see
fossils that look like this

00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:48.024
and they're very close
so you see, it's very

00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:52.034
believable that you could
have evolution from this

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:55.254
to that, but then you
go further back and once

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:59.557
again, it draws, it seems
like a very gradual process.

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:02.218
And once again, this
happening over, these are from

00:06:02.218 --> 00:06:04.905
12 to 5 million years ago,
these are from 16 to 12

00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:06.913
million years ago, these are from over

00:06:06.913 --> 00:06:08.551
34 million years ago.

00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:12.612
And so you can see how this
is happening at a very,

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:15.414
very gradual pace and
the mechanism, and we go

00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:17.756
into some depth in other
videos in Khan Academy,

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:19.720
you have variation in species, you have

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.320
the environment selecting for it.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.556
The environment might
change or different things

00:06:23.556 --> 00:06:25.812
happen so you have different
forms of selection,

00:06:25.812 --> 00:06:28.109
different types of combinations sprout up,

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:30.066
they're more suitable for the environment,

00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:32.127
they start to reproduce
better, they become

00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.626
the dominant species or
they take over certain

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:37.127
parts of a niche or an
ecosystem, and so you have

00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:41.089
this change, this heritable
change of traits over time.

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:43.267
And so when you look at
the fossil record, it makes

00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:47.186
a lot of sense that, okay,
this is strong evidence

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:49.720
for evolution, that the
animals that we see today

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.982
weren't just put on, just
created all of a sudden

00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:55.808
and haven't changed
since then, but there's

00:06:55.808 --> 00:06:57.988
a constant change and
we can see it directly

00:06:57.988 --> 00:07:00.770
through the fossil record.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.042
Now the next point of evidence, I will put

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:06.379
a bit of a caveat because
the gentleman who first

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.018
created this, his name was Haeckel, he was

00:07:09.018 --> 00:07:11.061
a controversial figure,
he had some spurious

00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:15.111
theories, and even this
diagram that he created,

00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:17.748
it seems like he fudged a
little bit of the drawings

00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:20.917
in order to make a stronger argument,

00:07:20.917 --> 00:07:23.807
but even with modern
observations, these drawings

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:25.728
are pretty close to being correct.

00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:27.086
And it's very, very compelling.

00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:29.623
It shows the embryonic
development of a whole

00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:33.677
series of species, from a fish on the left

00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:36.427
to a reptile to birds to mammals

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:40.312
and another mammal, to non-human mammals

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:41.926
and, of course, to humans.

00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:43.789
And you can see at the early stages,

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:46.224
they look eerily similar.

00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:48.974
In fact, you see proto gill slits

00:07:52.087 --> 00:07:54.837
in all of these animals, which later

00:07:54.837 --> 00:07:57.143
differentiate into things
that are more suitable

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.773
for what that animal actually becomes.

00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:02.660
And Haeckel, he's the
guy who claimed ontogeny

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.822
recapitulates phylogeny,
which is a very fancy

00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:07.164
way of saying that your
embryonic development

00:08:07.164 --> 00:08:10.148
is telling the story of
the evolutionary path,

00:08:10.148 --> 00:08:12.587
which isn't true, but
you'll even hear people

00:08:12.587 --> 00:08:13.835
quote that today.

00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:15.841
But his drawings and his observations,

00:08:15.841 --> 00:08:19.400
this is compelling
evidence for life sharing

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.245
a common ancestry, coming
from similar origins

00:08:23.245 --> 00:08:26.980
that got more and more
different over time through

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.984
the process of natural selection.

00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:31.932
So everything I've talked
about so far has been

00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:34.123
kind of macro structure,
things we can observe.

00:08:34.123 --> 00:08:36.328
The next thing I'm gonna
talk about is, you can

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:38.423
think about as micro
structures or processes,

00:08:38.423 --> 00:08:40.554
and this is microbiology.

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:41.804
Microbiology...

00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:46.025
Biolo, biology...

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.320
Microbiology.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.406
And the more we understand
about microbiology

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:55.283
the more compelling case of evolution

00:08:55.283 --> 00:08:59.110
because when we look at
even one, all life forms

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.693
that we know, they involve DNA.

00:09:02.936 --> 00:09:05.988
How the DNA gets replicated and translated

00:09:05.988 --> 00:09:09.523
and transcribed is very similar from one

00:09:09.523 --> 00:09:11.119
life form to another.

00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:13.202
The idea of DNA going to,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.703
DNA coding for proteins, proteins,

00:09:19.169 --> 00:09:22.588
that are made up of
amino acids is something

00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:24.745
that we see throughout biology.

00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:26.998
Amino acids, which once again hints

00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:28.392
at a common ancestry.

00:09:28.392 --> 00:09:30.700
And not only are those molecular and many

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.556
of the very proteins
are very, very similar,

00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:35.569
more similar than if you
look at the macro level

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:37.696
or even at the structural
level between different

00:09:37.696 --> 00:09:41.062
species, and not just do
they share these common

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.477
microstructures and
processes, but the actual

00:09:43.477 --> 00:09:47.354
information stored in
things like DNA also are

00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:50.224
very, very strong evidence for evolution.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:53.030
So this is a picture, I got this from,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.344
I got this from the site,
I should give proper

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.011
credit, 23andme.com.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.060
But this and you'll see
other data like this

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.412
that's very similar to
this, which is how much

00:10:03.412 --> 00:10:05.310
genetic similarity do we
have between different

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.231
species, and these numbers
tell us how much genetic

00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:10.301
similarity at a high level do we have with

00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:14.472
chimpanzees, mice, fruit
flies, yeast, and plants.

00:10:14.472 --> 00:10:17.457
And the fact that we have 26% of our genes

00:10:17.457 --> 00:10:19.549
in common with yeast
is mind-blowing because

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:21.446
at a macro level it
doesn't seem like there's

00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:23.299
a lot in common with
yeast, but when you get

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:25.559
at a microbiological
level, there's a good bit

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.188
that's in common with yeast.

00:10:27.188 --> 00:10:30.714
And chimpanzees, we do
relate to them, their facial

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.767
expressions often feel
eerily human, their behaviors

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:37.106
often feel eerily human,
but their genes, so just

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:40.171
how close to human
beings they actually are.

00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:43.321
And this actually shows
that even mice are way

00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:46.183
closer, if you look at
the entire tree of life

00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:48.961
based on genetic
evidence, things like mice

00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.931
and even fruit flies are
awfully close to human

00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:54.526
beings, especially if
you were to compare it

00:10:54.526 --> 00:10:57.217
to bacteria or a plant.

00:10:57.217 --> 00:10:59.142
But once again, you
share all of these common

00:10:59.142 --> 00:11:01.777
processes and the fact
that we can now measure

00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:04.175
how far things are away
allows us to create

00:11:04.175 --> 00:11:08.110
a very accurate tree
of life, and especially

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.650
thinking about how far in the past we had

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.150
evolutionary common ancestors.

00:11:14.018 --> 00:11:16.363
Now the last thing that
I promised I would talk

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:19.298
about is direct evidence, direct evidence

00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:22.912
of evolution, and I talk
about this in the first

00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:27.239
evolution video, but the
direct evidence we see

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:30.364
all the time with things
like bacteria where

00:11:30.364 --> 00:11:33.696
you have bacteria, let's
say growing around,

00:11:33.696 --> 00:11:37.268
and we have antibiotics
that we use in our body

00:11:37.268 --> 00:11:40.909
to kill bacteria, but the reason why many

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.925
physicians and scientists
will tell you "Don't

00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:45.612
"overuse antibiotics" is
because the more you use

00:11:45.612 --> 00:11:48.352
it, it causes a very
strong natural selection

00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:52.007
process for bacteria that
are going to be resistant

00:11:52.007 --> 00:11:53.299
to that antibiotic.

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:56.167
So if you keep using an
antibiotic and the bacterias

00:11:56.167 --> 00:11:58.613
keep changing, there's
more and more variation,

00:11:58.613 --> 00:12:01.155
well you're gonna kill
a lot of the bacteria

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:04.157
but if even one of them
is resistant to that

00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:06.895
antibiotic that you use,
well then all of its

00:12:06.895 --> 00:12:09.324
competition is gonna
get killed and so that

00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:12.763
drug-resistant superbug,
it's often called, is going

00:12:12.763 --> 00:12:15.309
to be able to go nuts
and that antibiotic isn't

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:17.021
going to be able to do anything.

00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:18.976
And if you look at
science today or you look

00:12:18.976 --> 00:12:21.283
at medicine today, this
is kind of an arms race.

00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:24.700
You have this constant need to create new

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:28.555
antibiotics because more
and more bacteria are

00:12:28.555 --> 00:12:30.811
becoming drug-resistant,
they're becoming what's

00:12:30.811 --> 00:12:33.250
often called superbugs,
where they are resistant

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.328
to the existing antibiotics.

00:12:35.328 --> 00:12:37.935
And this is evolution, natural selection,

00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:40.357
happening on a human scale.

00:12:40.357 --> 00:12:43.650
You could also think about
the flu virus where every

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.052
year that vaccine for the
flu virus, you gotta get

00:12:46.052 --> 00:12:50.028
a new one every year because
the virus is changing.

00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:52.581
Your immune system's ability
to recognize it can't

00:12:52.581 --> 00:12:56.748
recognize the next year's
because it's changed so much.
