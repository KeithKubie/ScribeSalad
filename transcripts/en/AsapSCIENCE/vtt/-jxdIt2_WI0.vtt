00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
The existence of God has been fiercely debated for centuries

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.060
but regardless of what you think or feel is true

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.640
can we use math, the universal, unbiased language

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.420
to come to a conclusion?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.400
Can math prove God's existence?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.740
The most famous argument in favour of a God-made world

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.300
using logic and reasoning is the "argument by design"

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.440
Simply put, given how complex and amazing

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.940
everything around us is

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.900
can we really believe that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.520
dumb luck put it together?

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.560
Even from a scientist perspective

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.280
life is amazing

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.540
incredibly rare

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.600
and took a monumental amount of steps

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.460
chance-happenings and time to come about

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.880
So, a religious person may argue:

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.980
"Doesn't it seem much more plausible

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.160
that there was some driving force behind it all?"

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.600
This type of argument is called

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.020
reductio ad absurdum

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.840
which simply means it attempts to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.100
disprove a statement by showing

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.220
it inevitably leads to absurd

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.840
or impractical conclusions

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.460
In this case

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.800
it suggests that 1) if there is no God, humans developing is very unlikely

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.500
2) humans did develop

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.840
therefore, 3) it is unlikely that there is no God

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.360
but let's take this logic one step further

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.480
and imagine a universe before anything has been created

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.200
Here, we have a base box

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.800
where we have our two possibilities of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.220
God existing and no God existing

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.520
On the other side are possibilities are that

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.840
humans exist or that humans don't exist

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440
If no God is true

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.660
then most would agree that human existence takes a lot of specific factors to come about

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.940
so let's make up a tiny probability

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.220
and say that there's a 1/4 billion billion chance

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.060
of humanity coming into existence

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.460
in a world with no God

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.220
and if God is real

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.640
even though we don't know that God would make humans

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.200
certainly He could

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.360
so let's give it a higher probability

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.160
of 1/4 million

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.060
Of course, if we examine the evidence

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.880
we know we exist

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.640
so we can get rid of the other row

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.960
and as many of you who have used the "argument by design" point out

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.820
a human-made world with God

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.640
seems much, much more likely rationally and statistically

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.060
and while this is true in some ways

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.840
it forgets an important point

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.780
that we have assumed there are only two major theories

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.540
but we know this isn't true

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.240
many societies have believed in multiple gods

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.780
and given there are some aspects of this life that

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.000
aren't merely as beautifully complex

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220
or seemingly intentional

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.760
perhaps a variety of squabbling gods

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.680
created the world

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.940
Mathematician Jordan Ellenberg uses

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.440
the probability of 1/400,000

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.300
that universe with multiple gods would create humans

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.700
but it's important to remember

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.260
that the exact numbers don't actually matter

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.320
What does matter is that we can agree

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.240
rationally, that a universe with more gods

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.520
has a higher chance of creating humans

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.080
then one with a single God

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
or none at all

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.780
it's also important to remember that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300
we're not comparing the probability

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.340
of gods or no gods existing

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.540
we're asking ourselves

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.320
if the God option is true

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.820
what is the likelihood of Him making humans?

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.800
and then we're asking separately

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.840
if the multiple gods option is true

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.100
what is the likelihood that they would make humans?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.680
now, let's take this even further

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.480
to theories of us simply living in a simulation

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.640
like that of the Sims

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.320
Which individuals like Elon Musk

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.900
and Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom believe

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.400
as technology advances

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.840
it's almost a certainty that future humans

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.680
will make extremely realistic human simulations

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.220
based on the world that we live in

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.460
to study these humans like we study mice

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.320
scientists already use simulations

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.360
to understand nature and human behaviour

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.660
but in the future it's possible

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.240
that the human test subjects

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.220
will be conscious and think they are real

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.060
so we can give this scenario

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.740
a fairly high probability

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.760
again, the exact number doesn't matter

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.020
just that we can agree it's very likely

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.980
that advanced humans would create these kinds of simulations

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.700
compared to the probability of a God or gods

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.420
randomly deciding to make humans

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.780
when they don't need to

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.780
or could make millions of other animals

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.540
or other aspects of the universe

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.800
after all, humanity is obsessed with humans

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.100
so as you can see

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.780
while maths can, in fact, show that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.620
the existence of life is evidence that God exists

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.920
compared to no God

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.000
the same maths shows

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.400
more compiling evidence that we're simulation by much smarter people
