00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.020
One of the criticisms that some people
have of online education is they

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.740
suggest that the kind of collaboration
we can have in person is

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.240
difficult to do online.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.280
If you're taking an online class, the
teacher can say, hey, get into groups

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.910
and discuss this topic or complete this
activity, and you move your desks around

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.780
and you move around in a lecture hall,
you sit face-to-face with one another,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.040
you do something, and then you break and
go back to the regular class.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.030
And some people point out that
it's difficult to do that online.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.710
And even more so,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.950
things like group projects that are very
valuable in traditional education

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.330
can also be difficult to do
when you can't meet in person.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.230
You can't gather around a table and chat
about ideas or scribble on paper and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.680
share it with one another.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.170
So how can we develop technology that
let's people actually collaborate on

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.120
projects or learning at a distance?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.487
There's a field that tries to address
this called computer-supported

00:00:43.487 --> 00:00:44.910
collaborative work.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.550
It tries to develop tools that
allow people to collaborate,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970
even when they're not
colocated in the same room.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.020
But it's actually not just
about online learning either.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.240
It's not just focused on developing
tools that allow people to collaborate

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.309
when they're not colocated.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.380
It also tries to develop tools that
make collaboration easier in general.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.360
A very simple example that can
be considered something of

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.050
an instance of computer-supported
collaborative work is Google Docs.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.800
That's a document interface that let's
multiple people edit the same document

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.150
at the same time.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.740
If you've done anything before
Google Docs came along,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.960
you probably remember the days when you
had to pass the document around amongst

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.700
people and tell who was doing the edits
at a given time and control for

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.710
versions and
do a lot of headachy things like that.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.230
But with Google Docs, we can all log in
to the same document at the same time,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.992
collaborate on it, and move on.

00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:33.430
So computer-supported collaborative work
is not just about learning together,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.940
not just about collaborating
on learning activities.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.630
It's also about collaborating
via computers in general.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.320
But in this class, we're going to really
talk about how we can use technology to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.890
enable collaboration in
the context of education.
