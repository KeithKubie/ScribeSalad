00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.610
One announcement.
There will be Quiz 9,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.220
the weekly quiz tomorrow based on
the content of Homework 9 which is,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
I don't remember what it is, but you
know what it is.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.460
I made it up, but I am already
thinking about the next glorious

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.070
event. Now I remember.
There is chemical kinetics and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.690
glasses. That's right,
chemical kinetics and amorphous

00:00:47.690 --> 00:01:05.046
solids.
That's right. Last day we started

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
talking about diffusion which is
solid state mass transport by random

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
atomic motion.
And we were drawn to the paper that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is up on the display which was
published in 1855 by Adolf Fick

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which gave us the law that bears his
name describing how matter diffuses

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:22.300
through matter.
Fick was a very talented individual,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.920
and I want to draw attention to
something else.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.530
Remember, he was a physiologist.
He actually did some work in

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.150
medicine as well.
In 1870, he described what survives

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.760
to this day as the Fick Principle
for determining cardiac output and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.380
basically equates the amount of
uptake of oxygen by the lungs with

00:01:45.380 --> 00:02:04.093
the amount that should be
distributed in the blood.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:55.090
But you have to take arterial oxygen
pressure minus venal oxygen pressure

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.180
to get the efficiency of the heart.
And so I found this little cartoon

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.270
off the Web that just briefly
encapsulates the notion of the Fick

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.360
Principle for measuring cardiac
output. His nephew,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.450
by the way, who was orphaned as a
young child also has

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.210
the name Adolf Fick.
The young Adolf Fick,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.640
the nephew was strongly influenced
by the uncle. He went on to invent

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.070
the contact lens.
This family has been quite prolific

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.490
in ways that influence many of us.
How many in this room are wearing

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.920
contact lenses?
I think we are all thankful that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.350
there are some cardiac efficiencies.
I think we are all beneficiaries.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.780
Let's take a look,
in more detail, at what Fick taught

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.580
us.
He said that if we have ingress of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.740
species i into some solid,
the rate of ingress is given by the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.910
equation shown here which expresses
the flux which is mass per unit time

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.080
per unit cross-sectional area as
proportional to the concentration

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.240
gradient. And the proportionality
constant is the diffusion

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.410
coefficient. And what we see here
is a sketch of what that

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.210
might look like.
Some initial surface concentration

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.640
held constant with ingress of
material. And since the flux is the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.070
derivative, you can see that the
flux, but for some multiplication

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.490
factor, tracks with the
concentration.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.920
We have the steepest concentration
gradient at the surface,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.350
and deep inside the specimen there
is essentially no concentration

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.780
gradient so the flux attenuates.
Flux shown here in fuchsia and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.630
concentration shown here.
And when I say profile it means

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.900
something as a function of distance.
Profile, in this case, is the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.180
concentration profile or a flux
profile. You can see those two.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.450
And then we started looking at some
of the atomistics and reasoned that

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.720
there is some jumping involved.
And with the jumping comes the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:32.040
notion of activation.
We looked at this.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:24.260
And we concluded that there is an
activation energy associated with

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.530
jumping through that saddle point,
an Arrhenius type behavior, natural

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.790
log of d, linear in reciprocal of
the absolute temperature.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.060
Remember, this is not the Rydberg
constant, this is the gas constant

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.330
which is the product of the
Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.590
number. And units will give you a
clue as to which to use.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.860
If the activation energy is in
units per mole then obviously use

00:04:49.860 --> 00:05:09.186
the gas constant.
Otherwise, you use the Boltzmann

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.400
constant. And when we looked at the
atomistics further,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.000
we reasoned that when we have
diffusion by vacancy jump mechanism,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.600
this activation energy up here in
the equation is the sum of two

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.200
components, one being the enthalpy
of vacancy formation,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.800
which is really the negative of the
bonding energy,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.400
and then the energy associated with
the atom migration which is the

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.000
energy of squeezing through that
saddle point shown in the figure.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:23.140
In the case of interstitial
diffusion, we do not have to form

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.280
vacancies. There are enough vacant
sites, by virtue of the fact that we

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.420
have so much free volume,
even in a close-packed solid.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.560
We are really just paying for the
enthalpy of migration.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.710
Lastly, we looked at how these two
are related to the degree of

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.850
confinement. In other words,
the atom is restricted by the ease

00:05:43.850 --> 00:06:03.033
with which it can run down its
appropriate raceway.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:51.750
And we reasoned that going through
the bulk lattice is the most

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:11.400
tortuous path and has the highest
activation energy,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:59.250
lowest diffusion coefficient.
Grain boundaries have atoms with

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:18.833
fewer nearest neighbors,
lower coordination number,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:06:06.750
so the diffusion coefficient is
higher in the grain boundary and is

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:26.933
highest along the free surface.
And we saw last day that the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:06:14.250
diffusion coefficient along the free
surface of a solid approaches values

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:33.766
equivalent to that of diffusion
in a liquid state.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:23.380
What I want to do today is step back
to the continuum and use Fick's law

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.760
to describe what is going on
mathematically in the macro world.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.150
I want to first start with
diffusion across a membrane.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.530
This is a membrane of some
thickness L. And I am going to put

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.920
a gas to the left,
P1, and I am going to hold it

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.300
constant. And to the right,
I am going to have a gas at P2 also

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.070
being held constant.
And, just so that we are all on the

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.210
same page, I am going to make P1
greater than P2.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.350
That means matter will diffuse from
high pressure to low pressure,

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.490
high concentration to low
concentration.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.640
That means the flux will be left to
right. And we can use the Universal

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.780
Gas Law, pressure volume equals the
product of mole number times gas

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.920
constant times temperature in order
to convert pressure units into

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:39.440
concentration units.
And we know that the concentration

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
of a species i is simply equal to
the mole number i divided by the

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
total volume of the system.
This is moles per unit volume,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
so that is a concentration. And so
that means then that if we go to the

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Universal Gas Law that will give us
P over RT. If you take a pressure,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
divide it by the product of the gas
constant and temperature,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
it will move from pressure units to
concentration units.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And so what I would like to do is
show what this system looks like

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:56.770
after some period of time.
I am going to put the convention

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:02.330
with zero on the left surface.
This is distance moving from left

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.880
to right. X equals zero is the left
surface of the membrane.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.440
X equals L is the right surface of
the membrane. And now let's put

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:32.146
concentration c1 on the left surface
and c2 on the right surface.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:24.810
And what we know is we expect that
after some period of time,

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:30.630
if c1 is held constant and c2 is
held constant then,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.450
after some period of time,
we expect to have a profile that is

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.270
linear. And we should be able to
infer that from Fick's First Law.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:48.090
We know that Fick's First Law tells
us that J is equal to

00:08:48.090 --> 00:09:05.646
minus D, dc by dx.
If I am holding the concentrations

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
on both sides constant then it tells
me then that the gradient is going

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to be constant.
Otherwise, I have some sources or

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
sinks which we do not allow for.
After this short time we have this

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
profile which we term steady state.
And it is termed steady state

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
because it is invariant with time.
The flux is not a function of time.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The flux entering the free surface
on the left equals the flux exiting

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
on the free surface on the right.
And, therefore, the flux must be

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
constant throughout the membrane.
Because if J is constant, and I am

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
assuming that the diffusion
coefficient doesn't change with time,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
then it means that this gradient
must be constant.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The slope must be the same all the
way along, reinforcing the notion

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that we have a straight
line profile.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:55.140
Now, there is one assumption here,
of course. And that is that the

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.280
diffusion coefficient is independent
of concentration.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.420
It could be. And we will return to
that later and see what happens if

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.560
we have the concentration depend on
diffusivity. We can describe at

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.710
steady state everything we need to
know about the behavior of this

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.850
system with Fick's First Law alone.
Fick's First Law alone is

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:36.166
sufficient. What are the kinds of
things that we might want to know?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:25.810
We might want to ask how much
material diffuses over time,

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.630
mass per unit time passing through
the membrane. All we need is Fick's

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:37.450
First Law because we know that we
can say that the mass will simply

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:43.270
equal the flux,
which is mass per unit area per unit

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:49.090
time. If I know the total area of
the membrane and I know the time

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:54.420
then that is all I need.
Fick's First Law is very thorough in

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.280
describing a system at steady state.
Last thing about this concentration

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.140
profile, the operative definition of
steady state is that J does not

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.990
change with time.
In other words, if I look at this

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.850
at some later time,
as long as I maintain constant end

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:18.710
compositions, I will have this same
profile. But suppose I had a

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.570
situation like this where the
diffusion coefficient is not

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:42.373
independent of concentration.
I will give you an example.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.500
The diffusion coefficient of carbon
in iron, this is steel,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.500
as a function of the concentration
of carbon in iron.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.500
It turns out that as more and more
carbon goes into iron,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:28.500
the diffusion coefficient changes.
You would expect that because now

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.000
some of the sites are occupied.
Which is it? Do you think that the

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
diffusion coefficient,
as you get more and more carbon into

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
iron, starts to fall like this,
or do you think the diffusion

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
coefficient rises like this so that
at higher concentrations it becomes

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
more difficult to diffuse?
Well, this might sound appealing

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
because the sites are getting
blocked. It make sense.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
There are fewer empty sites.
But, in point of fact, the

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
diffusion coefficient
actually rises.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:25.570
Why? Well, I have told you that the
carbon atom is larger than the

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:30.140
interstitial site.
When the carbons go into the

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.710
interstitial sites they act as
wedges, and they actually wedge open

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.280
the system and make it easier for
the succeeding atoms to diffuse

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.850
through. In point of fact,
this is what happens. But it could

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.420
be either. Let's imagine,
suppose we have case number one,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:13:07.840
where the diffusion coefficient
falls as concentration rises.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.500
And now I have a steady state
concentration profile.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.000
I have c1 constant on the left,
c2 constant on the right, and here

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.500
is the equation we have to look at.
Minus D, dc by dx. But this is now

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:55.000
a function of concentration.
If I have case number one, when I

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.500
have the highest concentration up
here, if this is going to remain

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:06.000
constant, if the concentration
dependence of the diffusion

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.500
coefficient says D is low when c is
high then that suggests to keep a

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:17.000
constant flux, dc/dx must
be high when c is high.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:40.750
That means instead of a straight
line, we are going to see something

00:13:40.750 --> 00:14:00.000
that looks like this.
This is case number one.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:48.250
How about case number two where the
concentration dependence of the

00:13:48.250 --> 00:14:06.900
diffusivity is indicated
with a rise?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:57.090
Well, that means at high
concentration my diffusion

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:02.180
coefficient is going to be higher
than it is at low concentration.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:07.270
If this number is higher at high
concentration then this number has

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.360
to be lower so that the product will
remain constant.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.450
This is case number two.
These are all variants of steady

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.230
state. J is not a function of time.
J is independent of time.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.700
Now I want to ask what happens in
that initial moment when we first

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.170
pressurize the system.
Let's say we start off and there is

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.640
nothing inside the membrane.
Just to keep things simple, I am

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.110
going to make P equal zero on the
right-hand side.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.580
Left side is P1.
And at time zero,

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.050
we initially pressurize so we have a
concentration c1 instantly at the

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.520
surface. What is the set of events
that occurs leading up to the

00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:11.773
establishment of the steady
state profile?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:15:02.160
I would expect,
after a short time,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.330
we would see concentration profile
shown like this.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.490
And then after a longer period of
time like this.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.660
And then after a longer period of
time like this.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.830
And then finally,
of course, we establish.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:37.526
This is time is increasing from low
to high.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:27.150
This could be t1,
t2, t3. And so we can then say

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.300
let's park ourselves at some value
x1 on zero to L.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.460
And look at what is happening.
Initially, if I take the slope it

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.610
is a low number.
If I take the slope at a later time

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.760
it is a higher number.
If I take the slope at a later time

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.920
it is an even higher number.
And, ultimately, it is going to be

00:15:47.920 --> 00:16:07.240
as high as the steady state value.
I could take that data set and plot

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:39.600
the flux at x equals x1.
I am sitting here watching the

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:46.000
profile evolve with time.
Initially, it is zero because there

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:12.400
is nothing in the membrane.
And then it slowly rises and

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:30.133
reaches the steady state value.
This is J at steady state here,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:24.150
and this could be t1, t2 and t3.
You can see that coming off the

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.460
slope. Clearly,
when we are moving through this time

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.760
period, J is very much a function of
time. Because,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.070
if you close your eyes and wait,
you will see that the profile has

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.380
changed. And,
if the profile has changed,

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.690
it means that the instant value of
flux has changed.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:17:05.046
Flux is a function of time,
so this is not steady state.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:55.450
Instead it is transient.
We are in the transient regime.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:00.900
And so, as is always the case, we
can draw these curves.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:06.360
They start at a high value,
they attenuate to zero. What is the

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.810
magical question?
What is the shape?

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:17.270
That is the only reason I need math,
to tell me the shape of those curves.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:35.773
Is this an exponential decay?
Is this half of a sinusoid?

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.500
What is the shape of the curves?
I want to know c versus x at all

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.500
times because it is changing as a
function of time.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.500
That means I need to know c is a
function of x and t.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.500
I have got to solve this.
And Fick gave us the solution to

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.500
this as well. The solution to this
is the solution to an equation known

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.500
as Fick's Second Law.
Let's look at Fick's Second Law.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.500
I am going to write it in the
special case when D is independent

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.500
of composition.
D has to be independent of

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.500
composition for me to do what I am
going to do next.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.500
And it is a pretty good assumption
in many industrial settings.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.500
And so I am just going to write it.
It is a partial differential

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:22.410
equation.
What it is telling you is that the

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.240
partial, with respect to time,
is equal to the product of the

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.080
diffusion coefficient times the
partial of the gradient in

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.910
concentration.
And so, clearly,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.740
this is a partial differential
equation. And that is bad.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.580
You cannot solve this one, not yet.
But the good news is it is a linear

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.810
partial differential equation.
That is good because I can show you

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:57.450
a solution that applies for a given
setting, and then you can play with

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:03.090
the boundary conditions and use the
same solution.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:08.720
That is the good news,
it is linear, but the solution of

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.360
this is both in x and t.
And the solution looks like this.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:32.120
Let's say we have an initial
concentration c naught.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:25.380
C is a function of x.
I have an initial nonzero

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.760
concentration c naught and I have a
surface concentration fixed at cs,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.150
and this is the system that we are
trying to model.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.530
And the general solution to Fick's
Second Law is c of x and t is some

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:46.920
constant A plus Aaconstant B times a
function, which I am going to define

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.300
for you in a second,
the Gaussian error function of x

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:57.270
divided by square roots of Dt
These are both constants to be

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.810
determined. This is the Gaussian
error function.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:06.360
X is position, t is time,
and d is the diffusion coefficient.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.900
And this is nothing but a
transcendental function that varies

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.450
from zero to one.
And I could have said sine.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:34.166
If I had said it is sine x over two
roots of Dt --

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:23.640
You know the definition of sine.
It has some weird integral and blah,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.290
blah, blah. Nobody pays any
attention to it.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.930
You know it goes from zero to one.
It is linear at low values of theta.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.580
So what. We are going to learn
what the properties of this are,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.230
but I can tell you something right
off the bat. What do you think the

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.880
shape of the error function is?
What is the shape of the error

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.520
function? That is the shape.
That is what math is. Math is

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.170
finding the shape.
Otherwise, it doesn't make any

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.810
sense.
And what are these?

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.430
These are scale factors.
You have done this on a computer

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:00.060
where you take some image and you
pull it, stretch it and so on,

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.680
and you can lock the aspect ratio.
Well, that is all you are doing

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.300
here mathematically.
We are going to pull this.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.930
Why are we going to pull it?
Because at a later time it looks

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.560
like this. But the relationship
between all of these points is the

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.180
same. That is what math does.
If it doesn't fire it. Math works

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.930
for you. You don't work for math.
Let's put this thing to work,

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.810
lazy. What we are going to do is
solve for A and B.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.680
You know that when you
differentiate,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.550
you throw away information.
Every time you throw away

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.430
information we need to add some.
We need to have one time-based

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:41.300
boundary condition,
and we need to have two spatially

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.180
based boundary conditions because we
threw away three bits of information.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.060
That is what we are going to do.
And, if we go ahead and do that,

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.660
here is what A and B will solve to.
And this works for all cases,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.990
c minus the surface concentration
divided by the initial concentration

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:04.330
minus the surface concentration
equals error function of x over two

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:09.660
roots of Dt. C is what you are
looking for. This is c as a

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.990
function of x and t,
cs is surface concentration,

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:20.330
c0 is the initial concentration.
And let's take a look at what that

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:38.960
function plots out to be.
I am going to plot erf of z as a

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.500
function of z.
It varies from zero to one.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.500
And it starts off, like so many
functions, it is linear.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.500
For low values of z, erf of z
equals z. And,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.500
in fact, up to about 0.
you are good to within 1%.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:51.330
Erf of z equals z to within 1%.
And then once it gets up to 0.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:57.990
then it starts to veer off and then
asymptotically approach erf z equals

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:04.660
one. In fact,
we can write here erf of 1 equals 0.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:11.330
4. You can see now it is not linear.
And erf of 2 equals 0.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:29.326
95. Once you get out here to two,
you are practically at the asymptote.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:23.660
Here is the integral.
And it is defined erf of z is the

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:29.330
integral from zero to z of e to the
minus u squared du.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:34.990
That is this, e to minus u squared
as a function of u is the Gaussian

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:40.660
error function.
That is the bell curve.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:46.330
This is the area under the bell
curve. If we start at u equals zero,

00:23:46.330 --> 00:24:04.326
we are going to integrate as far as
we need to out here.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:55.870
And the integral from zero to
infinity of this thing is root pi

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:59.740
over two. And we want this to go
from zero to one,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.620
so we will put the factor two over
root pi out in front.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.490
That way, when we integrate this
from zero to infinity,

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.370
erf of infinity becomes one.
Erf runs from zero to one. And

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.240
that is the area under this curve.
That is why some people call this

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.120
the Gaussian error function because
the Gaussian curve is associated

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:37.973
with random statistics
in terms of errors.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
This now is the template.
If I have any reaction this is all

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I have to fit using these
multiplication factors.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Let's play "Mr. Dress Up" here.
We are going to use this function

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
to describe all of the typical
industrial processes.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
There are only two types of
processes, those that are diffusing

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
substance in and those that are
pulling substance out.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:57.900
Let's look at the two cases.
Let's look first of all at the one

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.810
that is shown right up there.
This would be for something like

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:07.720
out-gassing or drying.
Many processes involve drying which

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.630
is to get the water out of the
content of a solid piece.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.540
And so, as you can imagine,
you have some initial concentration

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.870
c naught.
And you take the surface

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.620
concentration,
whatever this is,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.370
and obviously if you want to draw
something out and move matter from

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.120
right to left then the surface
concentration,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.870
by necessity, must be less than the
initial concentration.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.620
Otherwise, why is something going
to move? This I will call effusion,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.370
something is effusing. This is
effusion. The flux is moving from

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.120
right to left,
and the determinant here is c naught

00:25:48.120 --> 00:26:07.206
is greater than cs.
The surface concentration is less

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.500
than the initial concentration.
I am going to pin the concentration

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.500
at cs. I have c0 deep inside.
And this is telling me what the

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.500
shape of the curve is.
I just write with impunity c minus

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.500
cs over c naught minus cs equals
error function x over two roots of

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.500
Dt. **C-Cs / (C0-Cs) = erf (x / (2
sqrt(Dt))** And that is the answer

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:22.280
for all such problems.
And because it is linear it doesn't

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.850
matter. If I change the initial
concentration to a new value,

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:31.420
I can just add. We can add and
multiply because it is a linear

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.990
equation, linear functionality.
I think here we looked at those.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.570
This is the tabulation. This is in
the supplemental text.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.140
There is a table of error function
values so that if you happen to get

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.710
into this regime beyond z equals 0.
you will have the values that you

00:26:49.710 --> 00:27:06.553
need.
Let's look at another case.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Let's look at driving material in.
That, for example, is something

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
like doping or nitriding,
carburizing. If we want to case

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
harden a material,
we will raise the carbon content at

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
the free surface,
have something that is soft and

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:25.750
ductile inside.
For that here is the scheme.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:33.250
We have a surface concentration cs.
We have an initial concentration c

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:40.750
naught. And in this case c naught
is less than cs.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:48.250
Surface concentration is higher so
material now wants to move

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:54.330
from left to right.
And so this is infusion.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.990
And what is the curve going to look
like? It looks like this,

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:03.660
which is simply that one flipped
upside down by subtracting it from

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.330
one, which I will show you in a
second. Again,

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.990
this same general solution applies.
The surface concentration is higher

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.660
or lower than the initial bulk
concentration, it comes

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.610
out in the math here.
Again, we write c minus cs over c

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.840
naught minus cs equals erf x over
two roots of Dt.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:33.070
And this one comes up very often.
This is the way it works in doping

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:38.300
of semiconductors and comes up so
often that it is convenient to

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:43.530
define another function where,
in many instances, c naught equals

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:48.760
zero. When we are doping pure
silicon, the initial concentration

00:28:48.760 --> 00:29:07.386
of boron or phosphorus in pure
silicon is going to be zero.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:59.270
For many of those cases,
you will end up with something that

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:04.540
if you go through the math this is a
zero, transpose,

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.810
you will end up with this as the
solution, c equals cs times the

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:15.080
complimentary error function,
erf compliment x over two roots of

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.360
Dt where the complimentary error
function, erf compliment of z is

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.630
simply one minus erf of z.
If you see that in the literature,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:30.900
that is all they are doing. Now,
the question is,

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:36.180
I have told you that there are
special conditions that validate the

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:41.450
error function solutions.
What are the conditions? When to

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:46.720
use erf? Because that is not the
only solution to Fick's second law.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:30:05.706
When these are the conditions, c of
x at time zero is a constant.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:56.760
This is boundary condition number
one. We threw away some time data,

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.530
so here is data at time equals zero.
This is called the initial

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:06.300
condition. The initial condition
must be a constant.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.070
And that is OK. There are many
systems for which the initial value

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:15.840
of the material that is being
diffused is constant throughout the

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.610
material, as opposed to bopping all
over the place or maybe already

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:25.070
having some kind of a gradient.
As long as you can make this

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.230
assumption, you are on the road.
Now, we need two more boundary

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.380
conditions. We need boundary
conditions two and three over here

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.530
because we have a double derivative.
You have some function plus

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.690
constant. When you do d by dx,
constant goes into the trash bin.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.840
We need to recover that information
somehow. Here is what I have.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:31:05.146
I have c for x equals zero at all
time is a constant.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:53.750
The surface concentration is fixed
as a constant.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:31:12.666
And you say, well,
what else could it be?

00:30:37.500 --> 00:31:01.250
Well, I could have a slowly rising
surface concentration or I could

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:21.900
have a surface concentration that
varies sinusoidally or something.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:31:08.750
Those won't work. It must be fixed
at a constant value.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:28.333
That is one. This is boundary
condition number one.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:31:16.250
This is boundary condition number
two. And then I need a third one.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:35.366
The third one I am going to get is
this one.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:24.800
It looks funny when I write it
mathematically,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.600
but you will understand what I mean
in a second. At infinity the

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.400
concentration does not change.
You say, well, duh. This really

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:53.000
has some meaning.
We know that the size of our piece

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.000
is not infinite, but here
is what we are assuming.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
We are assuming that over the time
scale of the process that,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
for all intents and purposes,
the dimension of the silicon wafer,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
for example, is so large in
comparison to the depth of the

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
diffusion profile that assuming the
wafer is semi-infinite,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
because we have it diffusing in from
both sides, but let's just assume

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
from the one side,
that we can assume that it is

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
infinite. Ultimately,
what happens? If we wait long

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
enough, we start to have a tail over
here because the system still thinks

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
that the wafer exists.
But we are saying no, it stops here.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:24.280
But this value is so small during
the time scale of the process that

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.560
we can neglect it.
And by allowing ourselves to assume

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.850
that the material is semi-infinite
it simplifies the math.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.140
If we have a finite-sized specimen,
we cannot use this simplified

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.420
solution and things get very,
very messy. But there is another

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.710
way of expressing it.
You see this relationship?

00:32:45.710 --> 00:33:05.086
It is always erf x over two times
the square root of Dt.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:56.660
Something would be infinite would
mean it is very large.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:03.330
Large dimension. Let's say large
length scale. That is a large

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:09.990
physical dimension.
That means the argument of this is

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:16.660
very, very large.
But there is another way to get the

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:22.060
same result: short time scale.
That means every diffusion

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.180
experiment initially is operating in
a material that,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.310
for all intents and purposes,
is infinite. Because when those

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.430
first phosphorus atoms start
diffusing into the silicon,

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.550
they don't know the silicon is only
a millimeter thick.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.680
As far as they are concerned it is
infinitely thick.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.810
This solution is valid everywhere.
As long as you have concentration

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:50.930
initial fixed,
concentration surface fixed at short

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:55.250
times, this solution is valid.
Valid over a short time.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.750
That means it has great utility.
Now I want to show you something

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:04.250
that takes everything we have
learned and crashes it into a simple

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.750
rule of thumb.
And these are the kinds of rules I

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.250
hope you will retain long after.
What was it Franklin said?

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.750
Education is what remains when you
have forgotten all of your schooling.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.720
This is what you will remember.
You have c minus cs over c naught

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.180
minus cs, and that is equal to over
here erf x over two roots of Dt.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.630
That is the accurate solution. If
I wanted to capture the whole

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:39.080
diffusion process in one tiny little
sentence, what would be an average

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:44.540
value? This is a normalized ratio,
isn't it? It goes from zero to one.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:35:03.013
What is an average value between
zero and one? I don't know.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:54.460
How about a half?
Suppose I just choose this as an

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.920
average value for the whole
diffusion process,

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.380
everything that can ever happen in
diffusion, well,

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:07.840
a half is less than 0.
. Since a half is less than 0.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.300
, I can approximate erf x over two
roots of Dt as simply x over two

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.760
roots of Dt. Now I have this equals
this. I will cancel out the twos

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.060
and cross-multiply.
That gives me x goes as two roots of

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.190
Dt as an overarching equation for
everything that happens in

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.330
short-term diffusion.
**x = 2 sqrt (Dt)** I cannot tell

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.460
you how many times I have been in
situations where I am in some

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.590
conference room and a bunch of
people are sitting around trying to

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.730
figure out what to do and somebody
is getting ready to do some finite

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.860
element calculation to go
mathematically model this whole

00:35:45.860 --> 00:36:06.186
process, and I sit back and go,
gee, well, I know the length scales.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:54.760
Well, why don't we do one?
Let's do one. Have you ever been

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.530
told this thing about cathedral
windows, why the glass at the bottom

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:04.300
of a cathedral window is thicker
than it is at the top?

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:09.070
It has to do with the fact that
glass is really a viscous liquid and

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:13.840
over 500 years it trickles and it
gets wider. That is nuts.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.610
And I can show you like this.
It's very simple. You already know

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:23.070
that the average --
What is the average temperature in a

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:27.210
cathedral in Northern Europe?
It is zero in the winter and 20

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:31.350
degrees in the summer.
Let's pick a number, 10 degrees C.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.490
What do you think the diffusion
coefficient of silicate glass at 10

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.640
degrees C would have to be for this
thing to go anywhere?

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.780
Here is what I did. I said let's
use this. Here is my simple model

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.920
of the cathedral window.
This is the cross-section.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.860
And I figure I need a length scale.
I chose a length scale,

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.590
if something is going to diffuse,
on the order of ten centimeters.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.330
You can quibble.
If you want to make it one

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.060
centimeter, I don't care.
I am going to blow this thing so

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.790
far out of the water it won't matter.
This is about ten centimeters,

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.530
and it is going to get thicker on
the bottom. I figure I am going to

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.260
give this a really long run time,
so I am going to make it 500 years.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:34.120
I want to show you how to put this
problem to the test.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:22.260
What I am going to do is derive a
quantity that I can say yes or no to.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.530
What I am going to try to do is
pull out a value of the diffusion

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:30.790
coefficient, so I know that x
squared equals Dt,

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.060
if I just square both sides of that
thing. That means that D,

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:39.330
the diffusion coefficient should be
x squared divided by t.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:43.590
I am going to do this in
centimeters. This is ten squared on

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:47.860
the top and time is 500 years,
so that is 500. And how many

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.280
seconds in a year?
Pi times ten to the seventh.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.850
Pi times ten million is good to
within about 1%.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:01.420
That is it. Who cares?
This is a diffusion calculation.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:05.990
You don't need anymore. You are
not going to go 365 days and how

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:10.560
many leap years were there?
Come on. Get with it. 6.4 times

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.140
ten to the minus nine centimeters
squared per second.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.710
I would need a diffusion
coefficient of a silicate glass of

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.070
ten to the minus nine.
That is the diffusion coefficient of

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:28.210
a close-packed metal at its melting
point. I went and looked up some

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:32.350
data, and here is what I found for
the diffusion coefficient of sodium

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:36.490
in a soda lime glass such as the
type that would be used in those

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:40.640
windows. And,
using those data,

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.780
at 10 degrees C, the diffusion
coefficient would be ten to the

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.920
minus nineteen centimeters squared
per second. It is off by a mere ten

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.700
orders of magnitude.
I don't care if you want to make

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.110
this one centimeter or if you want
to make it one millimeter.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.520
There is no way that is the
explanation. We know what the

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.930
reason is. This proves that it
cannot be. What I want to show you

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:06.350
is that you can come at it from both
sides. The other thing is to figure

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.760
out how they make the class.
You know how they made the glass?

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.170
They pull it out of a layer and put
it on a spinning table.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.580
That is how they could flatten it.
They didn't have the float glass

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:36.626
process where you pour silicate on
top of liquid tin.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:24.610
And liquid tin has a perfectly flat
surface, the silicate glass is less

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:29.220
dense and is insoluble,
and so it floats on the liquid tin

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.840
surface and is perfectly flat.
They did not do that back in

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.460
Medieval times.
They spun cast it.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:43.070
It was like a spin coating
technique. This is top view.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:47.690
You have some table spinning,
and you plop some glass on it and it

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:51.930
goes whoosh by centrifugal force.
Now the cross-section of the glass,

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.810
what does it look like? Let's start
from the center and go out.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.680
Guess what? Not to scale. It is
ever so slightly thicker on the

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.550
outside than the inside.
And people would actually be very

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:07.430
careful about choosing the pieces.
And then the glazers said when you

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:11.300
mount the windows,
let's put all the glass in with the

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.180
thick side down.
Wouldn't that make sense?

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.060
And that is why the glass is
thicker, because it

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:37.253
was made that way.
Simple answer.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
But you can do the calculation.
I don't know how many times, but I

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
get asked this at least once a year.
Someone says is it true that the

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
cathedrals, blah,
blah, blah. And I go does this

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
person know Fick's Law or not?
Don't know, so we have to give a

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
different explanation.
Now I want to finish the story of

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
the automobile exhaust catalyst and
show how we can bring a lot of what

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
we have been learning in the last
several days together.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:55.460
Just to review.
This is an old sketch because it

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.920
was taken from an early General
Motors publication from the ‘80s.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.380
Basically, what you have is - we
have seen the catalytic converter.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.840
And it is taking the exhaust gases
and trying to convert some of the

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.300
toxins into something less offensive.
And I had reported to you that we

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.760
need to control in order to achieve
both oxidation and reduction.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:37.386
And how do we control?
We control with the aid of an oxygen

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
sensor. Could we switch to the
document camera,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
please, for a second?
Take that input. What I am showing

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:22.000
you is an oxygen sensor.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:45.810
What you are looking at is this is
the metal sleeve on top of the

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:49.630
oxygen sensor,
and you can see veins here.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:53.450
This is inserted just past the
engine, before the catalytic

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.270
converter. And what I want to do is
to describe the solid state

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:01.090
chemistry that is going on inside
there. May we go back to

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:13.580
the computer, please?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
What I just showed you is sitting
right here just as the exhaust gases

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
leave the engine.
And what they are doing is

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
measuring the oxygen pressure in the
exhaust gases so that we can control

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:26.180
the air-to-fuel ratio.
Because it turns out that to convert

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.540
the CO and the hydrocarbons to the
desired products,

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.900
in other words, carbon dioxide,
water vapor and carbon dioxide, you

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.270
need to oxidize.
And the catalyst is pretty good at

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.630
very, very high air ratios.
And to reduce NOX to nitrogen you

00:42:43.630 --> 00:43:03.326
need to have rich fuel ratios.
And mercifully nature was kind.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And there is this tiny window at
about 14.6 to one where you get

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
fairly high yields on both catalytic
reactions. This is where you want

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
to park yourself.
Now you need to have a sensor,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
and that sensor looks like this.
It is zirconia. It is an ionic

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
oxide, and it is doped with calcium
oxide to create oxygen vacancies.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
We are going to get defects
involved and we are going to talk

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
about diffusion.
When we put calcium oxide into

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
zirconia, we have two plus sitting
on a four plus site.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
And so we need to make an oxygen
vacancy to compensate.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
As we add calcium oxide,
we make more oxygen vacancies which

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
means that the diffusion coefficient
goes up. And that shortens the

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
response time.
It is no good having a sensor that

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
responds on a time scale of minutes
when you're driving conditions are

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
changing on a time scale of seconds.
And so we dope with a subvalent

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
oxide in order to improve
the performance.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:52.260
And here is a cartoon that shows
this is what is underneath the vein.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.530
This blue that I have drawn is a
closed one end zirconia tube.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:00.790
There are electrodes on the inside.
This is the exhaust. And on the

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:05.060
outside it is open to the air.
And this measures a voltage across

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.330
the zirconia sensor.
And that voltage goes to the CPU.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.590
Every car has several computers on
it, but the first cars to have

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.860
computers had them in order to
control air to fuel ratio to make

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.060
the catalytic converter effective.
And then that goes to control either

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.180
the carburetor or nowadays the fuel
injectors, which then keeps the

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.310
fuel-to-air ratio so that this keeps
measuring 14.6 to one.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:34.430
And if you change altitude,
if you get stuck in the Callahan

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:38.550
Tunnel and the ambient conditions
are changing, this can respond to

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.680
changes in temperature.
What do you think the partial

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.810
pressure of oxygen is?
About 20% in air. But how much

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.930
oxygen per unit volume do you have
at 100 degrees Fahrenheit versus

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:55.140
zero degrees Fahrenheit?
This thing can figure all that out

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:59.420
and, thereby, run the system at the
optimum fuel-to-air ratio to

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.710
maximally get the output from the
catalytic converter.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:07.990
And so in 3.091 we have learned
about the doping of silicon to make

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:12.280
what goes into here.
We have learned about the ceramics

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.570
that go into the catalytic converter
and the catalyst that goes on it.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:20.850
And now we have learned about
diffusion and everything that goes

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:25.250
into the oxygen sensor.
That is why I tell you chemistry is

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:29.750
the central science to energy
efficiency and environmental

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:34.250
conservancy. Learn your chemistry.
It is the most important subject.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:38.850
And with that I will say have a nice
day and we will see on Wednesday.
