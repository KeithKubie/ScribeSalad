PAUL LI: Hi.

00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:03.584
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:04.710
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.730
My name is Paul Li.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.210
I'm a science administrator
at the Gladstone Institutes

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.170
and a faculty member in
the cognitive sciences

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.800
at UC Berkeley.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.460
Today we're going to kick off
our new initiative coming out

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.260
from the Gladstone Institutes
called Open Classroom

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.030
Talks, where we send our
scientists outside to Bay Area

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.120
communities, such
as Google, to share

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.760
their interdisciplinary
research.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.990
So to start off our
Open Classroom Talks,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.030
I'd like to introduce
you to our guest speaker

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.260
for today, Dr.
Katie Pollard, who

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.230
is a senior investigator
at the Gladstone Institutes

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.070
and a professor
in human genetics

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520
and biostatistics at UCSF.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.690
She received her Ph.D. from UC
Berkeley, where she developed

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.120
computationally intensive
statistical methods

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.630
for analysis of microarray
data with applications

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.310
in cancer biology.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.070
For her post-doctoral
work, also at Berkeley,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.660
she developed bioconductor
open-source software packages

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.850
for clustering and multiple
hypothesis testing.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.459
Katie was also part of the
chimpanzee sequencing analysis

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.260
consortium that published a
sequence of the chimp genome,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.060
and she used the
sequence to identify

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.020
the fastest-evolving
regions in the human genome.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.120
In 2005, she joined the faculty
at the UC Davis Genome Center

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.200
and the Department of
Statistics before moving to UCSF

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.700
in fall 2008.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.830
So without further
ado, please join me

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.782
in welcoming Dr. Katie
Pollard, everyone.

00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:32.677
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:34.010
KATHERINE POLLARD: Hi everybody.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.180
It's an honor to be here today.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.870
I thought I would start--
you just heard who I am.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.240
I thought I'd start by
asking a little bit about you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.500
guys and what brought
you to the talk today.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.800
So how many people here are
programmers in the room?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.890
All right, a bunch
of programmers.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.620
How many of you work
with big data sets?

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.650
How many have a biology
interest or background?

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.150
A few?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.164
OK, great.

00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:05.580
And how many of
you are interested

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.240
about your own microbiome,
like you came because you're

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.380
curious about yourself?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.580
OK, good.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.230
All right.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.100
So there's a lot of reasons
to be here and learn something

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.750
at this Gladstone
Open Classroom.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.730
I'm really pleased to be here.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.160
As Paul mentioned
from my background,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.370
I haven't been working
on the human microbiome

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.480
since undergrad or
a long time ago.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.130
I was working in human genetics,
and in particular asking,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.920
what's unique about
the human genome?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.140
What makes us different from
chimpanzees and other animals?

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.410
And I made some really exciting
discoveries in that realm,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.650
and I was working
really hard to use

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.820
comparative and
computational approaches

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.670
to decipher human DNA.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.260
And there's a chunk of my
lab that still works on that,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.150
and it's a great
interest of mine.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
But about a decade
ago, a colleague who's

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.480
a microbiologist said to
me, sort of prodding me,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.030
he said, you know, most of
the DNA in the human body

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.010
isn't encoded in
the human genome.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.600
And I was like, yeah, whatever.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.440
And he said, no,
really, it's not.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.550
Most of the DNA
comes from microbes.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.365
And I eventually believed him.

00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:13.740
But then I thought,
well, they're

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.680
just kind of along for
the ride on our body.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.080
This isn't really significant.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.200
And I'm studying
the human DNA, which

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.270
is going to explain
who we are and why

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.000
we're different from each
other and why we get diseases.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.770
But slowly, the more
I looked into it,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.160
I realized that the
facts really support

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.410
the idea that the human
microbiome not only is

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.930
a large contribution to
our biological makeup,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.490
but that it's not just
a passive contribution,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.800
that the microbial cells in our
bodies, which are bacterial,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.470
they're microbial
eukaryotes like yeasts.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.490
They're archaea, which are a
sort of underappreciated part

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.030
of the microbial tree of life.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.430
And they're also viruses
that don't have cells at all,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.220
but are just
molecules in our body.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.969
All of those organisms
together are not just

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:05.760
along for the ride.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.330
They're interacting
with our cells

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.670
and forming essentially
additional organs or parts

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.360
of organs in our body.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.460
And the genes encoded in
their DNA are making proteins,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.959
and they're making the majority
of the proteins in our body.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.590
And since proteins
are the things that

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.550
are the basic building
blocks of life,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.480
it would be completely
irresponsible to not

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.490
be looking at the
microbial DNA to try

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.354
to understand human biology.

00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:30.770
Now, the first
bullet point there,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.500
about cells
outnumbering by 10 to 1,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.000
there was actually,
if anyone caught

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.830
it, an article just
this week saying

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.890
that that estimate might be
off by an order of magnitude.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.580
And so maybe about
half the cells

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.160
are human and half
microbial, not 10 to 1.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.590
But either way,
there's certainly

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.160
a lot of microbial cells
in our body-- trillions.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.040
So more than the dollars
in the national debt

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.270
might be an example.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.810
So that's a very big number.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.660
And because they're not
all-- our cells in our body,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.410
all the trillions of
cells that are human,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.740
have the same DNA in
them, modulo cancer

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.680
and some occasional other
mutations that happen.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.424
But the microbial cells
are all different types.

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:14.340
They're different
organisms, different species

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.000
from one another.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.666
So they have a lot
of different genomes.

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:20.100
And that's why, regardless
of whether the cells are

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.710
approximately equal or 10 to
1, the genes, the pieces of DNA

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.000
that encode proteins, really
are primarily microbial.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.570
regardless of the cell count.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.210
So we have these
microbes in our bodies.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.100
And so why was I so
oblivious to this

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.190
when I was trotting along
looking at the human DNA,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.210
and why is this sort of a
hot topic all of a sudden

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.290
that we're seeing in the
"New Yorker" or other news

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.080
that we might read?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.390
The microbes have been there.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.380
They've been evolving
with us as a species.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.730
They're on plants.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.960
They're on other animals.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.140
So why were we kind of
not so tuned into them?

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.710
Well, it seems a bit surprising,
because people have been aware

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.320
of microbes for
hundreds of years.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.960
But until about 10
to 15 years ago,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.490
it was impossible to study
most of the microbes,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.730
because the classic
approach was to extract them

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.550
from their natural environment,
which in this case is our body,

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.040
and try to grow them in
these dishes in the lab

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.100
and try to figure out what
they are and what they do.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.160
But the vast
majority of microbes

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.480
that live in the human body, and
in fact, in most environments,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.850
can't survive in
the lab environment,

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.030
because the conditions
aren't right,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.310
and because they
can't survive alone.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.340
This approach takes
one type of microbe

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.010
and tries to grow
it in isolation,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.780
and these communities
are made up

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.640
of different types of
microbes that are all

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.440
interacting with each other.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.010
So trying to grow them in
this way just doesn't work.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.480
So they're not amenable
to this direct study

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.200
by microbiological techniques.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.470
But the advent of
two technologies

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.800
that are the absolute sort
of basis for all the work

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.380
that we do in my
lab have enabled

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.010
us to get over
this hurdle, which

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.320
is that we can footprint
or measure what's

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.020
there by looking at their DNA.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.490
And so that is possible because
of next-generation or low-cost

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.400
high-throughput sequencing
that you can extract DNA

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.670
from the community
without the cells needing

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.980
to be able to grow in the lab.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.650
You can just directly assay it.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.430
So if I wanted to study your
microbiome here in the room

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.890
today, I could pass
around a test tube

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.512
and have you spit
in the tube if I

00:07:37.512 --> 00:07:40.580
wanted to study the microbes in
your saliva or in your mouth.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.210
I could collect a stool sample
to study your gut microbiome,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.530
or I could actually go in
and take some of your skin

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.160
or take a biopsy.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.760
Some of those are more
invasive, but as you can see,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.160
it's pretty easy to just extract
some bodily fluid or tissue,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.930
and then I can extract
DNA, sequence it.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.730
And then the other
technology that's essential

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.920
for this work is
high-performance computing,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.290
which should be no surprise
to a Google audience.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.460
But the data sets from
a single saliva sample

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.780
could be up to a few terabytes.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.712
And if I want to
analyze a bunch of these

00:08:14.712 --> 00:08:16.670
and compare them to each
other and do modeling,

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.760
I need high-performance
computing.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.360
So because of low-cost
high-throughput sequencing

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.860
and advances in
computing, it's become

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.340
possible now to study microbial
communities and the human body,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.720
and also in natural
environments.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.510
And the basic
questions that in any

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.700
of these samples that one
wants to ask are, who's there?

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.450
So what types of
microbes are there?

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.300
And we call this a
taxonomic profile,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.357
or what-- and also, and
perhaps more importantly,

00:08:48.357 --> 00:08:49.190
what are they doing?

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.990
So what genes, what proteins
are encoded in their genome,

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.600
and what does that
say about how they

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.590
might be interacting
with our human cells

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.110
or affecting our health?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.820
So an example would be that
microbes in your microbiome

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.950
might encode an enzyme
that would metabolize

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.070
a drug that you take.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.010
So we are probably all aware
of the idea of personalized

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.230
or precision medicine.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.600
This has been in the
news a lot, and the idea

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.490
is that when you go into the
doctor's office and a drug

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.650
is prescribed, that the
type of drug or the dose

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.320
might depend on your
own genetic makeup,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.500
that different people
respond differently or need

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.610
different doses or have
different adverse reactions

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.220
that other people don't have.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.170
Well, your microbiome is
also involved intricately

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.239
in metabolism of a
drug, and so knowing

00:09:37.239 --> 00:09:38.780
that you had a
microbe that was going

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.420
inactivate a
particular drug would

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.320
be really helpful information.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.800
It would also be helpful to know
if your microbiome was going

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.730
to extract more energy or
less energy from your food

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.190
than somebody else's, or
make your gut membrane more

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.950
permeable or cause more
inflammation or less

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:03.360
inflammation, or just be a
signature for where you grew up

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.860
or where you came from,
or how you were raised,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.380
or how many times you've
ever taken antibiotics.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.280
Does it encode
antibiotic-resistant genes?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.590
So there are a lot of
really interesting questions

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.960
we can ask if we know who's
there and what they're doing.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.077
So I should have said
at the beginning, also,

00:10:22.077 --> 00:10:23.910
I'm happy to take
questions during the talk.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.790
If anything's not clear,
please interrupt me.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.080
I don't want this to be formal.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.110
And I will also take
questions at the end.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:36.230
So how do we do this, since
there are some data scientists

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.650
and programmers in the room.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.600
I won't go into a lot
of technical detail,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.160
but I wanted to give you
some of the detail of what

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.650
this computation looks like.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:50.360
So the data set, as I said, can
be a huge file or a database--

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.510
terabytes of data.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.150
So what is it?

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.794
These are DNA or RNA or
proteins, different kinds

00:10:56.794 --> 00:10:57.460
of biomolecules.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.350
But let's just take
DNA as an example.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.770
And we read sequences,
little fragments

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.730
from the genomes of
all the organisms

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.280
that are in the sample.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.680
And those fragments
would be typically

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.430
on the order of 100 base
pairs or a couple hundred base

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.300
pairs-- base pairs being
A's, C's, T's, and G's

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.270
that encode genetic information.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.660
So one sample, like
your saliva sample

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.160
that I would collect
in a test tube,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.970
we might obtain on the
order of, say, 50 million

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.980
of these 100-letter-long
sequences from it.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.231
So that's the file or the
database that I would create,

00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:36.230
and that's what I'm calling
the metagenome here.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.120
These little lines
represent the sequences.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.745
And there's not 50
million lines there,

00:11:39.745 --> 00:11:41.820
but it's just a representation.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.780
So if I want to
know what's there

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.120
and what functions are encoded
or what genes those fragments

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.750
came from, the basic
thing that we do, and this

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.870
is sort of-- there are
many variants of it,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.260
but the basic idea
is we compare that

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.720
to database of sequences
that we've seen before,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.660
either directly to the
sequences or to a model, which

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.740
is a more sensitive
way of comparing

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.230
the sequences-- a model of
what certain gene families look

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.730
like.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.510
So we can do a
probabilistic comparison

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.850
to the model or a
direct comparison.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.430
And my lab didn't invent
sequence alignment

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.807
or what we call here
homology search-- so seeing

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.640
if a sequence looks
like it's similar enough

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.639
to say it's the same as
one of these sequences--

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:28.650
but we spend a lot of time
tuning those algorithms so they

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.230
work with these really big data
sets of little fragments that

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.270
come-- unlike other
types of genomic data,

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.370
they come from lots of different
organisms, many of which

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.270
we've never seen the
genome of before.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.230
So there won't be any perfect
matches in the database.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.060
So since a lot of people here
probably think about search,

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.390
that's kind of the challenge.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.338
Yeah.

00:12:47.338 --> 00:12:48.286
AUDIENCE: Just a quick
question on that.

00:12:48.286 --> 00:12:48.760
When you--

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.231
KATHERINE POLLARD: Yes.

00:12:49.231 --> 00:12:51.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in
which ones, for example.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:57.440
KATHERINE POLLARD: Yeah, so for
the protein sequence databases,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.210
there is at the NCBI a
non-redundant sequence

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.120
database that has
everything that's

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:07.730
ever been publicly deposited,
and with direct exact copies

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.230
deleted.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.750
So non-redundant means
one copy of each.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.960
There's also genomes
that we can download,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.960
so we can align not to gene
sequences but to whole genomes.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.490
So we have all the genomes.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.660
There's about
30,000 genomes that

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.640
have been sequenced so far,
most of which are microbial.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.510
Those are available
through NCBI.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.077
A slightly curated
version of them

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:28.660
is available through
a database called

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.360
PATRIC that's hosted in the UK.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.370
There's data
resources in the US,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.630
mostly through
NCBI, and in Europe

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.250
mostly through the European
Bioinformatics Institute

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:39.890
or EBI.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.390
They have mostly the
same data in them.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.910
There are some smaller
sort of niche databases.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.630
And in terms of
annotation, there's

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.190
a bunch of functional
annotations

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.860
that get laid on top
of these sequences,

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.570
such as the pathways
that they're in.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.750
KEG is an example of a database,
the Kyoto Encyclopedia.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.540
We also have a
lot of annotations

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.669
that would be layered
on top of the sequences.

00:14:02.669 --> 00:14:04.460
So after we find a
match, we can see what's

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.690
known about that sequence.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.000
Does that answer?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.846
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:09.846 --> 00:14:10.660
Just one quick follow-up.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:10.970
KATHERINE POLLARD: Yeah.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.970
AUDIENCE: Is that a problem
that there's so many

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.960
databases, and is there any
effort to unify [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.710
KATHERINE POLLARD: Yeah,
it can be a problem,

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.450
because each one is quite large.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.060
And if you want to
host this locally,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.380
it can be kind of an
unbearable amount of data.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:31.190
There are differences
in results if you use

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.780
one database versus another.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.370
We had a paper this
past year showing

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.840
that the-- we studied
some ocean data

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.740
and showed that you
come to completely

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.940
different conclusions
about photosynthesis,

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.990
and it's like at
different times of day,

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.500
at different times
of year, based

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.130
on which gene database you use.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.620
So it is a problem.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.360
There is a group called the
Genomic Standards Consortium

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.864
that's attempting to establish
some standards in this field.

00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:59.280
And actually the White House
is really interested in this,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.810
so I made several visits to the
White House in the past year

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.040
to talk about data
standards for this field,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.250
because it's a little
bit Wild West right now.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] GA for GH?

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:10.630
KATHERINE POLLARD: The what?

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.303
AUDIENCE: The GA for
GH, Google Alliance

00:15:12.303 --> 00:15:13.777
for Genomics and Health.

00:15:13.777 --> 00:15:15.110
KATHERINE POLLARD: No, actually.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.880
So this is specific
to microbiome.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.040
It may be kind of
connected with that,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.030
but that would be a
broader initiative

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.490
that would cover other types of
data, not just microbiome data.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.485
This was specifically
around the microbiome,

00:15:28.485 --> 00:15:32.390
and it was called the
Unified Microbiome Project.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.130
But a lot of them
have the same people,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.254
and there's just overlapping
people in discussions.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:43.090
So yeah, the data curation
is a really important aspect.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.950
And we've spent
some time-- I think

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.560
we're one of the
only labs that's

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.630
stopped to ask if it actually
matters which database you use,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.640
or exactly what
runtime parameters you

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.950
use for these blasts search.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.837
So if you change your cutoffs or
your preprocessing of the data,

00:16:00.837 --> 00:16:02.420
we've seen that can
have a huge effect

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.677
on the biological conclusions.

00:16:03.677 --> 00:16:06.010
And that's been, I think,
underappreciated in the field.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.820
So we've been kind
of a bit curmudgeony,

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.650
but spending a lot of
time sort of figuring out

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.060
how these choices in
the analysis pipelines

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.100
affect the conclusions
that someone makes.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.739
And we can do that with either
gold-standard data sets, where

00:16:20.739 --> 00:16:22.280
we're pretty sure
we know the answer,

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.330
or we also do a
lot of simulations.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.110
So we take all the genomes
that are out there,

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.250
we create metagenomic
communities,

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:33.030
we fragment them up and simulate
the sequencing experiment

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.540
on the computer, and then
since we made the community,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.050
we know the answer and we
can see in which situations

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.230
you make false conclusions
or overestimate things.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.340
So it's not perfect, because it
doesn't capture all the noise

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.480
in real life, but
it's nice because we

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.310
can see where things
break down by trying

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.360
a lot of different scenarios.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.440
So the basic output is a
count of the number of reads

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.880
that hits a taxonomic group,
like a particular type

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.900
of bacteria or a function,
a protein family.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.859
And part of this sort of
rigorous evaluation we've done

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:10.079
has shown that you have to
normalize in a variety of ways.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.180
So a long gene, just
by chance you'll

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.550
get more sequences from it.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.420
But it doesn't mean there's
more copies of the gene.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.503
It just means it's longer.

00:17:16.503 --> 00:17:19.300
That's a really simple
example, but there

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.130
is a lot of other biases
in these experiments

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.300
that need to be accounted for,
for accurate quantification.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.930
Accurate quantification
is important

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.680
if you want to compare
across samples.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.660
Maybe within a sample
it's not so important,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.460
but if I want to
compare my microbiome

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.710
to a bunch of other
people's, or do a big meta

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.700
analysis of publicly
available data,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.340
I need these measurements
to be meaningful,

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.930
biologically meaningful and
comparable across samples.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.980
And that's a huge problem
in the field right now.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.350
And we have to point that out.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.260
So one of the more often
touted associations

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.580
between the microbiome
and human biology

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.450
is a reported association
with human body mass index.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.520
So an argument was made here
under where it says Ley,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.860
and you see the purple bars.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:11.040
That was an early study with
19 people in it, 12 of which

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.710
were obese, seven
lean, and there

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.130
was more of a particular
phylum of bacteria

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.710
called firmicutes, which
is the x-axis, proportion

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.750
of the sequencing library
that was firmicutes.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.060
There was more in
the obese people,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.480
so it was concluded that the
microbiome was associated

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.320
with obesity, and
perhaps even playing

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.500
a causal role in
obesity, or mediating

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.010
effects that would on obesity.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.090
And then in difference, we did
a meta analysis about two years

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.600
ago now where we looked
across different data sets

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.640
that either were designed
to look at obesity

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.880
or weren't, they were just
random samples of people,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.100
but they had lean and obese
individuals in the study.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.750
And what we found
was if you don't

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.350
do a careful job normalizing
the data, and even if you do,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.010
there's some unaccounted
variability that

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.940
actually results in two things.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.120
The first one is that you don't
see a consistent association

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.770
with obesity.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.520
In these data sets
there actually

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.430
isn't more firmicutes in
the obese people in general,

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.650
especially as the
study sizes get larger,

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.920
like they are on the other side,
in the pink and green bars.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.070
But more upsetting to me
was that this biomarker

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.820
for obesity, that
a lot of firmicutes

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.070
varied more between
the studies that it

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.790
did between the lean
and obese in each study.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.070
And so something-- and
this isn't a very sort

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.110
of fine resolution measurement.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.740
Firmicutes are one of the
two most prevalent phyla

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.300
of bacteria, phylum being
the highest taxonomic level.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.250
So a lot of the
sequencing-- there

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.150
were millions and
millions of sequencing

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.510
reads supporting these estimates
of the amount of firmicutes,

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.910
and yet they still got in some
studies like 20% firmicutes

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.250
on average across
lots of people,

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.040
and in other studies 80%.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.590
So there are a number
of technical reasons

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.540
why that might be.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.440
There could be also
biological reasons,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.876
like these are different
study populations, adults

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.500
living in different
parts of the world.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.460
Some of them are college
students, maybe different diets

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.600
or lifestyles.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.030
So some of this could be
real biological differences

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.460
between the populations,
and some of it I'm sure

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.740
is also technical differences
in how they did the experiment.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.310
So there is a bunch
of issues that I'm not

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.130
going to go into
in detail, but just

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.350
something that might be
interesting for you to know

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.500
is when you see a headline, the
microbiome causes this or is

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.930
associated with that, there is
I think in the field right now

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.520
a lot of bias still,
and a lot of-- I'm

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.070
afraid that a lot
of those results

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.510
aren't going to replicate when
someone does another study,

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.090
that people are
sort of overfitting

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.860
data in a particular
study or that

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.460
has a particular bias in how
the measurements were made.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.960
And this isn't so shocking.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.560
This is a new technology,
there's a lot of excitement,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.800
and there's a lot of real
promise around it as well.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.460
But with any new technology
that comes online,

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.060
I think it takes a little
while to figure out

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.589
what all the hitches are.

00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:09.130
And I think we're
still figuring that

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.290
out with microbiome
experiments right now.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.210
But I'm not totally pessimistic.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.730
Our lab and a number of
other groups around the world

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.670
are working hard to
solve these problems.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.050
So I think there is a lot of
promise for this approach.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.040
But I also think
there's a lot of sort

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.390
of noisy and contradictory
data out there right now.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.110
So luckily, yeah,
some of these problems

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.320
that we observe in the data
can be modeled and corrected

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.130
for in the analysis.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.780
So we generate a little
bit of this kind of data

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.280
in my own lab,
but the main thing

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.670
we created our research
program around is data mining.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.910
So a lot of people
deposit not only

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.130
genome sequences
for microbes, but

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.980
these metagenomic
experiments where

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.154
they've sampled people
with different traits

00:22:00.154 --> 00:22:01.570
from different
parts of the world,

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.910
and also non-human primates or
other organisms' microbiomes.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.280
And most of this data
is publicly available.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.430
So the details don't
matter, but this is just

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.165
a list of a bunch of
the larger studies.

00:22:14.165 --> 00:22:16.040
And this isn't all the
data that's out there.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.580
We have at this point close
to 2 terabytes of data

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.720
on our lab server
that we've downloaded

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.940
from public resources.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.780
But for these
particular comparisons,

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.010
we grab a certain
subset of the data sets.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.720
And this can be on
the order of sort

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.690
of tens of terabytes of data.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.280
And you can see that the
people who have been studied

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.820
are from a number of
different countries.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.910
And excitingly, and I'll show
some of this later in the talk,

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.580
like any new sort of
field of biomedicine,

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.780
at first most of the
people who are studied

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.430
are North Americans and
Europeans, and maybe

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.060
someone from Japan or China.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.320
But there have been a few
studies in individuals living

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.990
in nonindustrialized
countries that

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.510
are revealing some really big
differences in the microbiome

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.230
that I'll touch on.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:10.130
So with all the caveats
of issues of data quality

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.080
and normalization in mind,
I want to nonetheless

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.470
share with you some of the
things that our field has

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.900
discovered about the microbiome.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.690
Some of these are our work
in my lab and some of them

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.700
are work of other colleagues.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.860
So what's come to light,
and perhaps some of you

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.760
know this already, that
one of the strongest

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.510
drivers of differences
between microbiomes

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.700
between different
people is what you eat.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.390
So what we put into our
bodies is the energy source

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.620
also for our microbiome.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.160
And so depending on diet,
we see large differences.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.750
And these are pretty
massive differences,

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.690
like on the scale
of what I showed you

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.370
of those differences
between studies

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.560
in the amount of firmicutes.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.630
Someone could have
20% and someone else

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:02.530
could have 80% of their
sequencing be from firmicutes.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.240
And that can be flipped
within about 24 hours

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.550
by changing what you ate.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:12.310
So it's not what you ate 50
years ago, for the most part,

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.450
but what you literally just ate.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.940
So a friend and colleague
at UCSF, Peter Turnbow,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.920
has done experiments
where he switches

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.500
people between different diets
and sees these rapid shifts.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.890
Others have looked in
infants, and there's

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.450
some differences between
breastfeeding and formula--

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.800
also between caesarean
and vaginal birth,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.300
because you pick up--
the womb is sterile

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.460
and you get your initial
inoculate during birth.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.790
That can affect you
for several years,

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.860
and perhaps have long-term
effects on your health.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.210
Switching between a
vegan and a meat diet

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.810
has a huge effect on the
composition of your gut

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.680
microbiome.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.440
And those effects are
seen quickly, within a day

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.840
or so of shifting, and
can be shifted back

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.840
by just changing the diet back.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.240
And despite the sort
of inconsistent results

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.420
we see when we just
sample people and ask--

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.570
we see no association
if we just sample them

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.800
and ask if their microbiome is
associated with their body mass

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.270
index, so how obese they are.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.660
Yet there is some
relationship, because you

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.930
can take the microbiome
of an obese person,

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.680
or an obese mouse that
was created genetically,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.720
in the case of the
mouse, or by diet,

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.400
you can transfer fecal
matter to a mouse that

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.370
doesn't have a microbiome
that's been raised germ-free,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.650
and you can induce
some of the aspects,

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.430
like some weight gain and
some metabolic differences.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.170
So these shifts
in the microbiome

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.240
that I'm describing
in response to diet

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.510
can have physiological
effects and could

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.380
in theory effect
something like obesity,

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.550
even though we don't see a
simple signature for that when

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.990
we look at the whole data set.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.000
So there may still
be-- I'm not proposing

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.330
that there's no
relationship with obesity,

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.810
because in an experimental
system we can control it.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.670
But out in the
population, there's

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.594
too many other things
going on to see

00:26:08.594 --> 00:26:09.635
that kind of association.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.510
The microbiome isn't
just responding

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.770
to our diet for its
own sake, but it's also

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:22.770
producing a lot of
molecules from our diet

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.370
to help us to harvest
energy, synthesize vitamins.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.330
So a bunch of things that
happen during digestion,

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.900
or as I mentioned earlier
in metabolizing a drug,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.260
a bunch of those things cannot
happen without the microbiome.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.780
So we're working on
a study right now

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:43.760
where a very toxic metabolite
that causes liver damage,

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.190
it can be eliminated
by just changing

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.720
the microbiome, essentially.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.680
So there are a lot of
not just their genes,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.300
but the byproducts
of those genes,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.150
of the pathways that
those genes encode--

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.920
a lot of the
molecules in our body

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.090
that cause health
or disease are being

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.710
produced by the microbiome,
sometimes multiple microbes.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.890
So to make that end
product, that, say,

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.570
anti-inflammatory might take
several different microbes

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.420
contributing, and maybe
some human genes too.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.090
So it can be quite
complicated-- not as

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.780
easy as remove this
one microbe or add

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.745
this other one, in many cases.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.680
And the gut microbiome,
which is the main source

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.550
that-- we have microbes
all over our body,

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.060
on our skin, in our ears, in
our noses, and pretty much even

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.510
parts of our body we thought
were sterile previously,

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.040
like the heart.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.140
But the biggest chunk of
the microbes in our body

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.430
is in our gut.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.060
By weight, most of us
have about six pounds

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.680
of microbes that
are in our body,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.650
and like four pounds or so of
that is the gut microbiome.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.980
But it's not only
important for digestion.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.820
The gut microbiome
is also communicating

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.550
with your immune system,
hormones, and in some work

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.950
I find really fascinating,
through the vagus nerve, which

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.946
is how our brain controls
how our gut works,

00:28:08.946 --> 00:28:11.140
and communication between
our gut and our brain.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.780
Through the vagus
nerve, the microbiome

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.540
can communicate with our brain.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.000
And that communication
is associated

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.560
with things like
mood, depression,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.870
and certain behaviors,
and perhaps, there's

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.280
some new evidence, also autism.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.440
So the gut microbiome
isn't just about the gut.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.470
It's also affecting a lot of
other systems in our body.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.840
And so not surprisingly,
there is every week

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.170
a paper coming out now
showing that the microbiome's

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.730
associated with a
different disease.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.530
As I mentioned, I'm
fearful that some of those

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.190
may not replicate.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.330
But nonetheless,
there are a number

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:54.290
of associations that have been
observed in large data sets

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.720
and have replicated.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.380
Associating the
microbiome-- so saying, OK,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.980
sick people tend to have
these types of microbes

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.850
or these types of
microbial genes,

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.280
is interesting, but it doesn't
really get at cause and effect.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.520
So one of the big
pushes in my lab right

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.010
now is to ask why
the microbiome's

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.930
different in disease.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.540
Was that a response
to the disease state?

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.310
Or was it actually
playing a causal role?

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.720
And to do that, we have
to do longitudinal studies

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.300
and look at people over time,
or do studies in the lab,

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.040
for example, with mice or
other models of disease,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.950
and ask whether the
microbiome changes first

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.640
and then you start
seeing the disease,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.690
or if it's the other way around.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.510
And can you cause
the disease just

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.410
by changing the microbiome,
or alleviate it?

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.420
And the same thing
with metabolism

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.200
of a drug or any other trait
that you might want to look at.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.440
The promise here,
which I think is

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.530
really interesting
and really amazing,

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:55.040
is that because the microbiome
can change so easily--

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.400
I mentioned going from
a meat to a vegan diet

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.900
can change the microbiome
within 24 hours--

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.320
because it's so
easily manipulated,

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.250
it could be a much
better therapeutic target

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:10.050
than trying to target a human
genetic cause of disease.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.040
So gene therapy has
had some success,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.340
and perhaps will have
more in the coming

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.150
years with genome
editing techniques

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.520
that have recently
been developed,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.640
but it would still be pretty
challenging to go in and edit

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.010
someone's human genome to
fix a genetic disposition

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.300
to a disease.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:34.890
But if you could just take a
particular yogurt or probiotic

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:38.470
or change your diet and have an
effect on the microbiome that

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.070
would change your
disease risk or alleviate

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.240
a bad response to a drug, that's
something that can much more

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.680
easily be manipulated.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.310
That's not very invasive.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.610
So there's a lot of promise.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.350
And also, just traditional
drug development,

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.840
like taking a
protein and have it

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.110
change how some protein
in the human body works,

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.826
we can also do that to
target microbial proteins.

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.450
So without even
changing the community,

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.300
we could also drug the
microbiome, essentially.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.950
So I think there's
a lot of potential.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.680
But what I want to talk about
for the next part of the talk

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:19.810
is a different idea, which is
that the microbiome isn't just

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.670
causing disease, but is
actually protecting us

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.230
from disease-- that
there's a lot of components

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.670
of the microbiome
that are healthy,

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.930
and that disease might be
caused just by losing microbes,

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.610
not by gaining bad ones,
but losing good ones.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:38.240
So there's a hypothesis that's
been around for a long time.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.000
I didn't come up with this,
but I'm very interested in it.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.320
And the idea is that we
evolved over millions

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.750
of years with a lot more
microbes than most of us

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.920
have in our bodies now, because
modern life has eliminated

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.290
a huge component
of the microbiome.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.830
So it's like removing an organ
from our bodies, essentially.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.000
And we're all living
still, but there

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.110
are a number of diseases
that have sort of

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.180
rapidly and unexplictitly
risen in abundance

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.670
in industrialized countries.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.740
And the strongest example
are the autoimmune diseases,

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.440
including things like
allergies and asthma,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.800
inflammatory bowel
diseases, MS. So all

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.330
these autoinflammatory
diseases, it's hypothesized,

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:27.720
could be the result of
losing a big component

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.100
of our microbiome.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.060
And I'm really interested
in this scientifically,

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.580
but also personally, because I
have two autoimmune diseases.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.820
I'm a patient.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.640
And there aren't really any
good explanations for my disease

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.754
or any-- there are sort of
things to help me get by,

00:32:43.754 --> 00:32:45.170
but there aren't
really any cures.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.630
And so I'm really also
as a patient excited

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.300
about this line of research.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:58.160
So we've started to
do some work looking

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.380
at the microbiomes
of people who aren't

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:05.850
exposed to as much antibiotics
and such a clean lifestyle.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:11.120
So this is a picture of students
who went to South Africa,

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.910
and we actually piggybacked
on a project that

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.790
was there to study the human
genetics of KhoeSan hunter

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.360
gatherers.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.610
So these are people living in
South Africa in a lifestyle

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:24.530
like our ancestors had thousands
and thousands of years ago.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.410
They don't have routine access
to medical or dental care.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.300
They eat a really
different diet than someone

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.530
in an industrialized
country, they

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.070
don't brush their
teeth, et cetera.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:40.120
So this team from
Stanford, friends of mine,

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.100
were-- Carlos Bustamante's
lab and others were going over

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.490
to study the human
genetics of these people,

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.300
and the student who was
sort of shared with my group

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.950
came to lab meeting and
said, it really sucks,

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.860
we have all this bacterial
contamination in our samples,

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.530
and some of them it's like
85% of our DNA isn't human,

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.580
it's bacterial.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.130
And I said, don't
throw that away.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.530
I want to look at it.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.830
So a postdoc from my lab got
busy with the contamination.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:12.260
And what we found was that
some of the most abundant--

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.960
not surprisingly, but
we found that some

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.850
of the most abundant organisms
in these KhoeSan people,

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.850
and I'm sorry the data
isn't really easy to see,

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.350
but the result is
stated in words there.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.110
We found some of those
most abundant organisms

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:29.300
in these hunter-gatherers
are rare or completely absent

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.670
from people in the study I
label HMP as Human Microbiome

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.170
Project.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.639
That was hundreds of individuals
living in the United States.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.699
So this was our initial foray.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:42.405
And then as I noted
earlier, there

00:34:42.405 --> 00:34:45.110
have been some other
people, friends,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.370
who've studied people in
other parts of Africa.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.679
And there's been a
great study in Peru

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.010
of two different groups,
one of hunter-gatherers

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.700
like these KhoeSan people, and
another of agriculturalists,

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.720
neither living a very
modern lifestyle,

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.730
but different lifestyles
from each other.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.490
And they've generated
a ton of data.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.660
And at this point
there's over 3,000

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.730
of these shotgun
metagenomic experiments

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.770
from people from different
parts of the world.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:15.110
The majority are from China,
North America and Europe,

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.750
but we're now getting some data
from other parts of the world.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.810
And what my lab has done
is a big meta analysis,

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.570
so we downloaded or
mined all this data

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:29.492
and then analyzed
it together, not

00:35:29.492 --> 00:35:30.950
the way it was
necessarily analyzed

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.630
in the original
studies, but in bulk

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.540
to deal with a lot of
the confounding issues

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.350
that I talked about
earlier, and then

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.840
asked how the microbes look.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.910
Are they the same
in different people,

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.720
or do they look different
depending on where in the world

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.790
you are from?

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:50.400
And we did this for each
of every common microbiome

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.250
constituent.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.810
So here's one example.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.910
This is eubacterium rectale.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.520
It's common in the
human microbiome.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.470
And there's a map there
showing the sampling locations

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.260
with the little
Google dots on it.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.690
And there's a phylogenetic
tree that I just

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.206
overlaid on the map.

00:36:08.206 --> 00:36:10.080
The exact position on
the map doesn't matter.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.660
This is just a visual
representation.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.910
But the colors of
the dots represent

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:18.670
where the person came from
whose microbiome was sampled,

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.030
and the tree is showing
how related they are.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.090
So if things are close
together in the tree,

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.960
then those two
people's microbiomes

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.430
were really similar, and not
overall, but specifically

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.620
for this species of bacteria.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.030
So for this species, we
see a lot of structure.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.990
For example, the
yellow dots over there,

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.410
which are all
Chinese individuals,

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:41.380
form their own
clade in the tree.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.410
So everyone in China has
a eubacterium rectale

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.420
that's more similar to
other people in China

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.680
than to anybody
in another place.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.210
The individuals from
the southern hemisphere

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:53.390
are pretty different
from everybody else.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:57.060
And the North American
and European clades

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.470
are mixed together.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.090
So there's a lot of exchange
of the different strains

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.350
between Europeans
and North Americans.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.900
There's sort of different
groups there, but if you look,

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.950
they're kind of a mix
of people from Europe

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:10.530
and people from North America.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.627
So that's what this
microbe looks like.

00:37:12.627 --> 00:37:14.210
But then we go to a
different species,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.560
this is bacteroides
uniformis, and it

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.350
wasn't found at
all in the people

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.240
in the southern hemisphere.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.850
So the African or
the South Americans,

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.700
it was wasn't present as far
as we could tell in them.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.510
But if you were from North
America, Europe, or China,

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.410
you just had kind
of a random strain.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.750
So these strains were all pretty
closely related-- not that

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.090
closely related, but they didn't
form any geographic-- there was

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.770
no geographic pattern at all.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.260
This thing gets around,
this particular species,

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.827
and a new strain
arises in it, at least

00:37:46.827 --> 00:37:48.910
in the northern hemisphere
is spreading all around

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.810
to different peoples.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.490
So if you're living
here in California,

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.992
your strain could
look the most--

00:37:53.992 --> 00:37:56.450
the person in the world with
the most similar strain to you

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.570
could be in China.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.625
But that isn't the case
for this other microbe.

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:02.750
That would be highly unlikely
that someone in China

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.520
would have the same
rectale as you.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.270
So we thought this was
really interesting,

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.950
that there was a geographic
signal for some microbes

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.410
and not for others.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.990
And we're also now looking
at non-human primates.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.177
So sort of back to my
original research program

00:38:17.177 --> 00:38:18.760
of humans versus
chimps, we're looking

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.560
in chimps and gorillas and
baboons to see how they fit in.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.120
And so far it looks
like they have

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.600
pretty different
microbiomes than we do,

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.410
and that the people in the
non-industrialized countries

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.360
look more like than
non-human primates.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.980
So that's probably like
our ancestral microbiome.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.580
And then those of us in the
more industrialized countries

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.040
have a divergent
microbiome that's

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.870
changed from an ancestral state.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.600
So that's our
hypothesis right now,

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.450
and we're continuing
to work on that.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.460
So just the last thing
I wanted to mention

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.640
is that our main focus
is the human body,

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.950
but microbes are the
major constituents of most

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.860
ecosystems.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.590
And there is some
work in my lab that's

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.080
looking in natural
environments as well.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.010
And even less is known about
the microbes that are there.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.990
So actually, saying that 1% of
the microbes in the human body

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:13.470
have ever been studied by
traditional microbiological

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.430
techniques, it's less than that
if you go out and sample out

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.640
in the San Francisco
Bay or on the windshield

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:25.070
wipers of your car, or out
in the desert somewhere.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.650
And yet the microbes are
playing really important roles

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:31.820
in ecosystem services,
in global warming,

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.180
and also they help to mediate
things like oil spills.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.640
Some microbes can
eat toxic things

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.810
and totally help out with
these natural disasters.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:45.730
There's microbes that
are still chewing away

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.070
at all the mercury that's
up in the Sierra Nevada

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.260
from mining during the gold
rush and slowly degrading

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.520
a lot of the mercury
and other heavy metal

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.070
toxins that are up there.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.650
So it would be helpful from
an ecological perspective

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.030
to also know who is there
and what they're doing.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.200
So these same tools
are being applied

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.000
to natural environments.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.090
And just really briefly,
I wanted to show you,

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.390
I won't talk too much
about the modeling,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.230
but the challenge--
the human body

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.520
is complicated enough to sample.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.840
Something like the
world's oceans is massive.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.720
Microbes are tiny.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.240
The oceans are massive.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.835
If there's trillions of
microbes in each of our bodies,

00:40:21.835 --> 00:40:24.000
imagine how many are
in the world's oceans.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.560
So we have sort of sparse
sampling of what's out there.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.450
And one of the approaches
my lab has used

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.970
is to try to build
models to predict

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.060
what's going on in places
where we haven't sampled yet.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.580
So a couple years
ago we had a paper

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.890
where we used this technique
to reconstruct an essentially

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:44.170
extinct ecosystem called
tall grass prairie, which

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:49.470
used to cover the Midwestern
United States before

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.800
so many people were there, and
before agriculture, monoculture

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.400
basically destroyed
this ecosystem.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.000
And we did that by sampling in
graveyards where the tall grass

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.280
prairie hadn't been disturbed,
and in some nature preserves,

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.490
the only places where the
tall grass prairie still

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.420
exists, built a model for
which kind of microbes

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.890
you find in which
kinds of soil, and then

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:13.770
used what we think that the
climate and other properties

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.990
of the soil were
before agriculture,

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.350
and predicted what microbes
you would find where.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:23.900
And this is just a heat map
that's showing the diversity.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.934
So the warmer colors would be
like a more diverse community

00:41:27.934 --> 00:41:30.350
of microbes would be found in
certain parts of the Midwest

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:31.141
compared to others.

00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:34.100
So we did this modeling.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.590
We're also thinking forward.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.270
So if you can build
a model like this,

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.280
you can predict for soils
or air or the oceans what

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.930
the microbes will look like
in future climate scenarios.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:44.870
So we've been doing
a lot of that.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.086
And it looks like
as the Earth warms,

00:41:47.086 --> 00:41:48.460
the microbes are
going to like it

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.710
and we're going to get
more diversity across most

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:56.540
of North America, Tibet, a
lot of the world's oceans.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.060
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.040
And one particular
health consequence

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:06.740
is that particular microbes
that have effects on humans,

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.270
such as fungal allergens in air,
may change as climate changes.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:16.070
So this is a study where
we sampled on the doorsills

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.100
of people's houses.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.300
It's sort of a great
passive collector for what's

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.790
in the environment, because
most people don't clean

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:24.590
on the top of their door sills.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.637
And it was called the
1,000 Homes Project.

00:42:27.637 --> 00:42:28.970
We had a bunch of collaborators.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.360
But anyway, it was a
citizen science project.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.920
People sampled
their own doorsill

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.010
and then sent the samples
in and we sequenced them.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.820
And a lot of things were
discovered in that data,

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.660
but this analysis focused
on fungal allergens.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.480
So you can see if
there is DNA from fungi

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.750
that are known allergens.

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.470
And so we mapped where
the allergens were

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.400
found across the United States.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.960
And then in these pictures,
what we did was we

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.970
plugged in values for
future climate scenarios.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.027
And what this is
showing is the change

00:43:00.027 --> 00:43:01.110
in the amount of microbes.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.485
So for this particular-- I'm
just showing a few examples,

00:43:03.485 --> 00:43:06.470
but for this epicoccum
nigrum, which

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.750
is a pretty wicked
pathogen and can

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.350
kill immunocompromised
people, we

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:16.310
see in red-- red would be an
increase in the amount of it.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:20.180
So California is going to get
a lot more nigrum in the future

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.150
than it has now, as
well as the South.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.990
Other places might get
less, as shown in blue.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.890
And then this other
species, alternaria,

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.670
is mostly decreasing,
but it looks

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:33.600
like Florida is going to
get pretty hit by this one.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.990
So we can make those kind
of predictions as well.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:41.880
So to wrap up, getting
back to the human health

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.260
angle and our own biology,
just a couple summary

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.580
points about what the
field has learned so far.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.346
I feel like it's
just very early days

00:43:49.346 --> 00:43:50.470
for this field of research.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.011
There are a lot of
technical problems

00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:53.650
we're still trying to overcome.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:58.780
But we've already observed that
we can't explain human biology

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.980
completely by just looking
at our own human DNA

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.790
and that our individual
microbial communities are

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:09.000
certainly playing a
complex role in our health

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.120
and our normal day-to-day life.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.590
And what makes us human
or makes us who we are

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.350
isn't just our own
DNA, but also the DNA

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.530
of the particular microbes
we are carrying around

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.150
at any given time.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.289
This is not fixed.

00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:24.080
We're not stuck with
it for our whole life.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.720
It's manipulatable.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.450
And so it's likely that
health care in the future

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:33.000
will actually be leveraging this
to diagnose you and potentially

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.180
treat you as an alternative to
more invasive things like drugs

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.600
or surgery.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.485
So that's where we're
looking towards the future.

00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:43.860
I think there's
a lot of promise,

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.734
but I also think there's
a lot of challenges.

00:44:45.734 --> 00:44:49.750
So I'll be really
excited for collaboration

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.430
with anyone here who has ideas
about how to work on the field,

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.400
and I'm very happy to
take any questions.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.510
So thanks.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:04.969
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:04.969 --> 00:45:05.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.051
Is there a certain aspect of
the data that is less confounded

00:45:08.051 --> 00:45:11.580
or has less technical
problems in current days?

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.060
Like if I would go
read papers now,

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.790
what would I believe
more than not?

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.581
KATHERINE POLLARD:
That's a great question.

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:20.750
So let's see if I can't
explain what I think

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.120
one of the biggest problems is.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.310
It's pretty technical,
but let me give it a shot.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.460
So the common thing
that someone does,

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.440
let's say to say how
much of bacteroides

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.280
uniformis do you have,
to quantify that,

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.990
is that they look
at the 50 million

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:41.680
sequencing reads and see
how many of those align

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.170
to uniformis, maybe you
normalize that count

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:48.140
a little bit, and then divide
by the total sequencing library.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.280
So it's the proportion
of your sample

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.420
that came from that bacterium.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.880
And unfortunately, what
we really care about

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.830
is something about
the community,

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.590
like what proportion of the
cells were of that type.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:05.970
And it turns out the
proportion of the sequencing

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.980
reads isn't a very good estimate
of the proportion of the cells.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.170
And I'll try to explain a
couple of the reasons why.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.670
One is that different
organisms will have

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:16.260
genomes of different sizes.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.940
So something with a really
big genome, like a yeast,

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.212
like a fungal
allergen, could take up

00:46:21.212 --> 00:46:22.920
a whole bunch of your
sequencing library,

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.200
but there might only
be a few cells there.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.066
The human DNA is in there.

00:46:27.066 --> 00:46:28.690
So I mentioned that
the student thought

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:32.150
the bacteria was a contaminant
of his human genetic study.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.620
We think of the human
DNA as a contaminant

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.260
of the microbial study.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.160
And it can be up to
half of the sample.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.660
So if half your library
just went to human,

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.300
that can kind of
skew the ratios.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.580
So as the genome sizes of the
organisms change, the amount

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.780
of contamination from human
or from the lab process--

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.930
unfortunately, one
of the kits that's

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:58.160
used for extracting
the DNA biases

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.440
the ratios of different
types of organisms.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.150
So what can you trust?

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:05.370
I would say if
you see in a paper

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:08.460
that something measured the
actual cellular abundance

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.130
or cellular relative
abundance of an organism,

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.770
I would believe
that as something

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.960
really quantitative
and comparable,

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.610
but not the sort of proportion
of the sequencing reads.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:23.920
And so that's not sort of
like a field of inquiry

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.260
that's reliable, but a
statistic that I think

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.985
is really reliable.

00:47:28.985 --> 00:47:30.610
You would have to
dig down a little bit

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.660
to find that, obviously.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.740
But I wish I could say that,
say, high level things were

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.390
easier to estimate, like the
amount of a particular phylum--

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.220
you might not get a
specific species right,

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.946
but you might get the phylum.

00:47:43.946 --> 00:47:45.570
You know a higher
taxonomic resolution.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.570
I actually don't
think that's the case.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.020
And I actually think
studies that drill down

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.640
on one specific thing and
quantify it very carefully

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.080
probably do better than the
ones that are sort of trying

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.740
to get everything right.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:06.260
I also think that
right now, studies

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.610
that do this experiment
of sequencing

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.890
just all the random sequences
are-- still a lot of them

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.710
are problematic.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:16.090
But some people are going in
and targeting specific things

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.300
and sequencing those.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.520
In general, that's
probably more reliable,

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.090
like more targeted studies.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.210
I think that the unbiased
approach has a lot of promise,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:28.144
but we're not quite there yet on
a lot of the analytical tools.

00:48:28.144 --> 00:48:29.435
Does that answer your question?

00:48:29.435 --> 00:48:29.900
AUDIENCE: Oh, definitely.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.570
KATHERINE POLLARD:
Yeah, OK, great.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:33.200
Any other questions?

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.560
AUDIENCE: You were just
talking about a lack

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.080
of analytical tools.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.038
KATHERINE POLLARD: Yes.

00:48:38.038 --> 00:48:40.620
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to know
where are the biggest gaps,

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.140
and what kinds of
technologies are

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.004
you guys currently developing
or would like to develop?

00:48:47.004 --> 00:48:48.670
KATHERINE POLLARD:
Yeah, great question.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:56.060
So we're developing a lot of
tools for these normalizations

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.719
that I mentioned, adjusting
for the size of the genome,

00:48:58.719 --> 00:49:00.260
so trying to estimate
and then adjust

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.060
for the size of the
genomes in the sample

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:06.060
and the amount of contamination
and other sorts of biases.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.490
Those are kind of
under the hood.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.450
And they require someone to be
like a command line programmer

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.450
to run them.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:18.582
But actually what I wanted to
show you was something that I

00:49:18.582 --> 00:49:19.790
thought might be interesting.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.290
We're basically trying
to make this research

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:26.014
accessible to other people,
because my lab can't think

00:49:26.014 --> 00:49:27.680
of all the interesting
questions to ask,

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.870
or have time to ask all
of them of the data.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:35.880
So we've downloaded
every microbiome study

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.020
that's ever been done.

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.490
There's over 3,000 now.

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:43.070
And we've, we think as
accurately as currently can,

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.410
quantified the amount
of every protein family

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:46.930
and every microbe in them.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:50.570
And then we've compared them
across these 3,000 samples,

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.210
some of which have
diseases or are

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:53.730
from different
parts of the world,

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:57.450
or different aged individuals
or males versus females.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:00.490
We've computed all that
as like a pre-compute,

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.350
and then we've built this tool
so people can search the data

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:06.480
and just pull out the answers.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.780
And so, let's see.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.780
It's a search tool.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.572
You can search right
here by a gene,

00:50:12.572 --> 00:50:15.030
and we're adding something that
would be more like a Google

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:20.175
search, where you search by a
word, like obesity or enzyme,

00:50:20.175 --> 00:50:22.090
or ABC transporter.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:23.120
So we're still working.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.850
That will be out in
another month or two,

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.360
expanding the
search aspect of it.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.400
And then here, I think if
I'm online I could show you,

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.570
these are just jobs
that have run recently.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:36.580
So I can pull up a
job and show you--

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.490
this is in development right
now, so it's not beautiful.

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:44.410
But someone searched
a gene sequence,

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:48.860
and then these are things
that we think it might be.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.210
So these are like possible
annotations of it.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.550
This is a quantification
of how common

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.520
it is in the human microbiome.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.610
So people-- some people
have no copies of this

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.520
in their microbiome,
some of the samples,

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.030
and the sample with
the most of this gene

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:10.330
had 2.3 copies per organism
in their microbiome.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.940
So they had organisms that had
multiple copies-- on average

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:15.430
had more than two
copies of this gene.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.420
So people vary a lot.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.480
These are some of
the taxa that have

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.470
the gene, some of the
bacteria that are carrying it.

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.180
And then you can
look at associations

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.290
with different traits.

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.610
So let's see if I can find one.

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:29.330
This is statistically
significant--

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:30.930
what country you're from.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:33.680
So I can click on it.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.000
And it looks like
this gene is more

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.550
common in the
microbiomes of people

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:42.630
from North America
compared to Europe or Asia.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:45.610
So we've precomputed
all of these,

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.610
and these can just be
queried by somebody.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:51.840
So that's one of the tools
that we're working on,

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.380
as well as under-the-hood
tools for making

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:58.300
sure the numbers that go
into these tests are accurate

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.220
qualifications.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.120
Well, I'm happy to
stick around if anybody

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.340
wants to shout afterwards.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.923
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

00:52:04.923 --> 00:52:05.840
[APPLAUSE]
