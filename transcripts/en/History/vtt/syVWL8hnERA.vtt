00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:06.881
This, to me, looks like
the side of a turtle shell.

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:10.468
This is just pretty incredible.

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:12.846
NARRATOR: On a remote
mountain in the Philippines,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.974
the team is hunting for a
possible tunnel entrance that

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.017
could lead to a
fortune in treasure

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.061
that the Japanese Army
is believed to have

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.605
buried during World War II.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:26.943
Now they have discovered a rock
that John thinks may have been

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.821
carved to resemble a turtle.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.198
I think we have found
what we're looking for.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.909
The tunnel entrance could
be up right under here.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.036
NARRATOR: To verify
the find, John

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.080
brings in Peter and Martin.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.208
You look like you've
got something now.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.252
This is the best thing
we've found so far.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.799
This is a turtle.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.593
Yeah, I'm a little
excited now, finally.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.722
[laughs] We're
getting somewhere.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.224
What do turtles
signify anyway?

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.810
Well, a turtle can signify
a bunch of different things.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.147
Now, if he's got legs on
him, and they're all even,

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.858
and his tail is turned to the
left or right, that's the way

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:07.734
you go.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.694
Now, he's a marker too.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.155
If his head is up and
sitting at an angle,

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.825
then out in front of him,
probably within 50 to 100 feet,

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.203
will be something buried there.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.913
Of all the things
that we've seen so far,

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.624
this really stands out.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:23.750
We're on the right trail.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.753
This is a really good marker.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.548
Maybe the turtle itself
is not the way to get in.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.550
Maybe that's not the entrance.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.969
The fact that the head
is lifted like this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.972
and it's pointing in
a certain direction,

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:39.974
maybe it's a directional marker.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.601
That's possible.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.812
Now we have to figure out
where that's leading us to.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.605
Maybe looking where
the head is looking

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.940
is the way you're
supposed to be going.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.566
And that's what we should do.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.568
I'll take Brad, and
we'll follow where

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.278
the head may be pointing to.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:55.782
If it is pointing somewhere,
then we'll see where that goes.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.909
We need to get more
information before we know

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.537
what this turtle is telling us.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.372
One way or the other, we're
getting into this mountain.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:02.956
I agree with you.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.753
[metal detector whines]

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.672
NARRATOR: On the
mountain, Peter and Brad

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.591
continue searching along the
line of sight of the turtle

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.846
rock's head, looking
for any signs

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:23.059
that may lead to a
possible tunnel entrance.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.727
Look at this.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.604
NARRATOR: Peter and Brad have
discovered what they think

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:30.149
is a golden lily symbol and
called the rest of the team

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.361
down to determine if it
is a clue to the location

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.654
of Yamashita's treasure.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:35.697
Wow.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.491
That thing is pretty awesome.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.287
It is hand-carved.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.330
Is this anything that
you've ever seen before?

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.086
This could be a
golden lilies symbol

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.882
showing us the back door.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.634
NARRATOR: Based on
Martin's research,

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.637
it is believed that Yamashita
strategically constructed

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.515
his tunnel systems with a
main front door entrance where

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:06.561
the treasure was loaded
and a smaller, more

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:10.315
concealed back door
where the Golden

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.108
Lily could access the tunnels.

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:19.991
So you're saying
that this symbol is

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.951
telling us about a back door?

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.578
Exactly.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.122
When the Japanese and the
Golden Lily would come back,

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.957
they wouldn't want to use
the front door because they'd

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.169
have blasted it shut and loaded
up with all kinds of trip

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.837
wires, all this kind of stuff.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.380
Because so many people saw.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.466
Too many trucks coming
in and out, too many people

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.884
seeing what was going on.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.552
So the imperial
family would have

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.429
needed a different way to
get into the treasure tunnel.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.139
Exactly.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.266
They needed a backdoor to get
in where not a lot of people

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.851
could see them.
- All right.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.269
I don't think that it's going
to be that easy to find.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.938
The Japanese were smart, so--

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.941
Exactly, so they probably
would've put cover stones in it

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.984
or put rocks together
to close that up

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.694
so they could get
in and out easy

00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:58.821
and seal it back
all at one time.

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.407
This could very easily tell
us where the back door is.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.410
I think, guys, all we need to
do is go back to this marker.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.330
Everything so far has
led us to this point.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.624
Grandpa tells us to go look
for the pyramid of rock.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:10.625
We find that.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.668
Holy crap.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.127
Now that's a frickin' pyramid.

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.337
We find breach 6.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.838
Holy cow.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:17.423
We go up to the waterfalls.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.549
We find the gorilla head.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.218
That's the one, Manny.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.011
We find the plunge pools.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.388
We find the turtle.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.181
This is the best thing
we've found so far.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.266
Everything that
we've done so far

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.811
has brought us to
this one point--

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.229
to the back door.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.232
This could be our entrance
into the mountain.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.401
If we can find
it, we can open it.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.193
Now I'm excited.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:38.736
Today I'm excited.

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:41.197
Let's go find the back door.
