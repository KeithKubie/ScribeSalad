00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:11.506
&gt;&gt;The whole point of the fact that
it's not permanent or easy to edit is

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:13.596
that you're supposed to
experiment with ideas.

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:14.116
You're supposed to--

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:15.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Exceptional teachers

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.576
who are continuously
learning are critical

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:19.446
to the success of High Tech High.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.336
&gt;&gt;Randell: You're supposed
to be stretching out.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:23.816
I would I love it if you're on
the edge of what you understand.

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:26.406
&gt;&gt;Larry: What I like to see
in a teacher is somebody

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:29.276
who has deep content knowledge
of their subject matter.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:31.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: 'Cause even if nobody
reads your words, they say, "Gee,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:33.226
what a nice balanced
document that looks like."

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:33.746
&gt;&gt;Student: Right.

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:37.686
&gt;&gt;Larry: Somebody who is passionate
about their subject matter.

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:39.906
&gt;&gt;Teacher: No, no no, I like
how it bounces back and forth.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:43.756
&gt;&gt;Larry: And people who are
very dynamic in their ability

00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:45.976
to infect kids' curiosity.

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:48.716
&gt;&gt;Jay: And you wanna check it
out, write down some observations,

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:50.396
what it smells like,
what it looks like.

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:52.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers like
these are hard to find,

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:56.576
so High Tech created an onsite
credentialing program, and later,

00:00:56.576 --> 00:01:00.516
a graduate school of education to
train its own teachers and leaders.

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:01.886
&gt;&gt;Stacey: Finish
up in a couple minutes

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:03.116
and switch to the other person.

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:06.886
&gt;&gt;We started about four years ago,
credentialing our own teachers,

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:10.456
and offering an intern program
so that we could hire teachers

00:01:10.456 --> 00:01:13.356
who we wanted and then they could
pursue their credential through us,

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:17.536
rather than going to a local
university and kind of having things

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:19.346
that weren't quite as
relevant to what we do here.

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:22.906
&gt;&gt;Rob: This is a silent
exercise and when it is over,

00:01:23.096 --> 00:01:26.206
we'll look at what we've got
and make some comments about it.

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:28.296
What I'm looking for, and I
think what we're all looking

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:32.496
for is an adult who's interested
in what and how kids think.

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:34.266
&gt;&gt;Randell: What else did you
notice about Anna's writing?

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.146
Mariah, take it away.

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:39.296
&gt;&gt;Student: Each topic she has is, if
you like look at it all, it's a lot,

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.816
but because she spaces
it out, it doesn't seem

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:43.286
as much when you're reading it.

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:46.916
&gt;&gt;Rob: So when we see teachers
doing a demonstration lesson here,

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:49.766
and they're engaging kids in
dialog in some way or another,

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.256
and they're asking kids the questions
and probing and trying to get

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:56.216
at what they're thinking,
I at least think, "Wow,

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:59.416
this is someone who
we can work with."

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.546
&gt;&gt;Randell: Was there anything
good out there in those blogs?

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.306
Little bit?

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:03.136
&gt;&gt;All right, a lot.

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:05.036
Okay, Isaac, get us
started, what you see, man?

00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:09.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Eleventh grade teacher
Randy Scherer is earning his master's

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:11.256
degree at High Tech's
graduate school?

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:13.536
&gt;&gt;Randell: A traditional approach
might be to spend eighty percent

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:17.536
of your time researching theory,
and then only at the end, "Oh,

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:18.766
now take this to the world."

00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:21.066
&gt;&gt;The grad school has been really
an interesting place to be,

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.936
because we start in the world,
and then we go find out, "Well,

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:25.516
what are the theories
that really support this?"

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:27.696
&gt;&gt;Anthony: How do we
visualize debt, Samantha?

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:28.396
&gt;&gt;With money.

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:29.376
&gt;&gt;Anthony: With money.

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.966
So like, debt is like money you owe.

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:34.736
So when you're in debt, is that
a good thing or a bad thing?

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:36.176
&gt;&gt;Everybody: Bad thing.

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:36.976
&gt;&gt;That's a bad thing.

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:38.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Anthony
Conwright has spent a third

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:39.876
of his life at High Tech.

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:42.306
&gt;&gt;Anthony: It started
when I was fourteen.

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:45.126
I went to a really bad
school, and my mom heard

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:47.696
of this crazy school
called High Tech High.

00:02:47.696 --> 00:02:48.846
&gt;&gt;So you got it?

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:51.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: He was among the
school's first two hundred students,

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.476
and graduated in 2003.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.766
&gt;&gt;Anthony: And right after
high school, I started working

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:57.666
at High Tech Middle, 'cause
it had just opened up,

00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:00.496
and I've been here ever since.

00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:02.616
&gt;&gt;Anthony: -- four plus five.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:05.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now twenty two, Conwright
is pursuing a teaching credential.

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:08.806
&gt;&gt;Anthony: We'll work our
way to find four plus five.

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:11.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Video recordings are
made of his work in the classroom

00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:14.226
and are used in evaluation
meetings for feedback

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:16.746
from his peers and from students.

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.896
&gt;&gt;Does anybody have
clarifying questions?

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:22.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you have a separate
lesson for subtracting integers?

00:03:22.726 --> 00:03:26.766
&gt;&gt;I have them do each-- this
page in their table groups,

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:28.796
and I went around to each table
group and just checked in--

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:31.856
&gt;&gt;As a teacher, I don't feel like
any of what's going on is about me.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:36.556
It's completely about the students,
and that's what I love here, is like,

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:39.516
everything is about the students,
the students first, their needs.

00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:41.406
How can we make learning
more efficient?

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:42.256
How can we make it fun?

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.976
&gt;&gt;Student: So there's seven money
slips, with the negative sign,

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.446
so it's like to negative seven.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:51.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The graduate school
of education is fully integrated

00:03:51.826 --> 00:03:55.286
with the life and work of High Tech
High's K through Twelve schools.

00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:56.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Point one,
which is that line--

00:03:57.126 --> 00:03:59.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Helping to make this
an environment where everyone,

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:01.856
no matter their age, is a learner.

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:04.756
&gt;&gt;Student: And you go
seven feet up from the top.

00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:06.726
&gt;&gt;Anthony: Yeah, see that, nice.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.526
