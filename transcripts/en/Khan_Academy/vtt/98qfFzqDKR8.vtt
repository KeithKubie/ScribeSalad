00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:02.273
Voiceover: Let's talk a
little bit about what it means

00:00:02.273 --> 00:00:06.068
to own shares or stock in a company,

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:07.812
so shares or stock.

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:09.405
I think we all have a general sense,

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:10.352
but what I want to do in this video

00:00:10.352 --> 00:00:11.669
is make it a little bit more tangible

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.102
to really understand
exactly what you're buying

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:16.809
when you buy a share of stock.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:17.956
So the general sense,

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:19.951
and this is exactly what it really is,

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:22.136
is when you buy stock or you buy shares,

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:23.952
you're essentially becoming a partial

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:26.470
or a part owner of the company.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.254
Part owner of company.

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:33.543
Just to contrast this with bonds

00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:35.597
because they're often kind of used

00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:36.874
in the same phrasing,

00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:38.697
"Oh, I'm gonna go buy
some stocks or bonds,"

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.258
or "I deal with stocks and bonds."

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:41.722
Bonds.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.877
Bonds, you become part
lender to the company.

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:53.425
Part lender to the company.

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:57.945
So, for example, if you buy a,

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.743
well, I'll just say a face value bond

00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:03.214
of, let's say, it's $10.

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:04.597
Let's say it's $1,000,

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.546
and there's 1,000 people who do that.

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:10.089
Each of you all are lending
$1,000 to the company

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:11.803
and since there's 1,000 of you,

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:14.009
you're lending $1 million to the company.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.348
I'm not going to go into detail in that

00:01:15.348 --> 00:01:17.844
because the focus of this
is going to be stock,

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.014
but it's good to keep in mind

00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:20.490
that they're very different things.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.097
Here, you're owning the company.

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:23.946
Here, you're lending to the company.

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:26.099
So just to make this a
little bit more tangible

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.803
of exactly what we're owning,

00:01:27.803 --> 00:01:29.348
let me draw a simple balance sheet

00:01:29.348 --> 00:01:31.347
for some company X.

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:33.101
So this is Company ...

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.471
Let me do a new color.

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:41.764
Let's say we're dealing
with Company X right here,

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:44.269
and let's say if we looked
at Company X's assets,

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:45.404
and when we talk about assets,

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:47.345
it really is the same thing that we mean

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:48.919
in the real world, or in our everyday life

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:50.144
when we talk about assets.

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:51.650
The things that have value.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.255
Things that are going to give us

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:54.838
some type of future benefit.

00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:56.392
A house is an asset because it gives us

00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:58.450
the future benefit of
being able to live in it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.184
and protecting us from
cold weather and rain.

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:03.485
Cars are assets because they give,

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:05.320
provide us some transportation.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.864
Cash is an asset because
it can be exchanged

00:02:07.864 --> 00:02:09.661
for things we need in the future.

00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:10.303
All of these ...

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:12.896
A loan to someone else is an asset

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:13.943
because in the future,

00:02:13.943 --> 00:02:15.319
they will pay us back.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.060
A loan to me is a liability,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.394
which we'll talk about in a second,

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:21.591
but anyway, let's just in
the very abstract sense,

00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:24.013
say this is Company X's assets.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:27.390
Let's say that they're worth $100 million.

00:02:28.143 --> 00:02:30.841
$100 million,

00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:32.233
and I'm not going to go into exactly

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:33.520
how this number is determined

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.653
or who's determining it,

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.386
or who's saying this is 100 million,

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.869
but let's just say this is,

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.790
we agree that this is how much their land

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.154
and their patents and their copyrights

00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:46.024
and their cash and their buildings

00:02:46.024 --> 00:02:47.724
and everything else they have is worth.

00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:50.154
All of the things that
will generate future value.

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:51.165
Now, let's say that Company X

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:53.500
has also borrowed some money,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.924
and maybe they borrowed
it by issuing bonds,

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:58.072
which I will not go into detail on.

00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:00.451
Let's say they borrowed some money,

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.862
and so they owe some people collectively

00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:05.919
$80 million.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.522
$80 million.

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:10.534
This could have been a straight debt

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:11.185
from a bank,

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:12.952
or this could have been via a bond issue.

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:14.837
They might have issued,

00:03:14.837 --> 00:03:16.807
maybe they issued a million bonds,

00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:18.727
where each of those essentially represent

00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:20.901
a debt of $80.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.063
I won't go into that too much,

00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:23.318
but I think you get
the idea of what I mean

00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:24.479
of part lender,

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.475
but this is debt.

00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:28.071
$80 million of debt right here.

00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.818
Let's say that's all of their liabilities.

00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:32.452
There are other liabilities
other than debt,

00:03:33.343 --> 00:03:34.527
but for simplicity,

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:36.567
let's say that's their only liability

00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:38.787
and debt tends to be the biggest.

00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:41.410
Now, what's left for the owners?

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.333
A good way to think about that is

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:47.043
what would happen if
this company were sold

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:48.413
and the debt paid off.

00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:49.612
So, if the company were sold

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:51.813
and these assets really
are able to be sold

00:03:51.813 --> 00:03:53.490
for $100 million,

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.014
you get $100 million.

00:03:55.014 --> 00:03:56.989
You'd have to pay the debt holders,

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.728
you'd have to pay off the debt first,

00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:00.687
so you'd have 100 minus 80,

00:04:00.687 --> 00:04:03.790
you'd have $20 million
left for the owners.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.682
I'll do that in this other green color.

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:08.499
So you'd have $20 million left.

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.418
$20 million left,

00:04:10.418 --> 00:04:11.590
and this is called the equity,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.662
or the owner's equity.

00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:18.396
Owner's equity.

00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:20.072
This is completely the same idea

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.273
as when people talk about
having equity in a house.

00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:24.652
If I have a $300,000 house,

00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:28.063
and I still have $200,000
left on the mortgage,

00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:30.585
then I have $100,000 in equity.

00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:32.065
It's completely analogous.

00:04:32.065 --> 00:04:34.588
You can see, very simply, that assets.

00:04:34.588 --> 00:04:35.323
I'll write this down.

00:04:35.323 --> 00:04:36.424
You're getting a little bit of

00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:38.470
an introduction to accounting right here,

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.274
but assets are going to
always be equal to liabilities

00:04:42.274 --> 00:04:44.320
plus equity.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.519
Because essentially, or
you can view it this way:

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.553
If you subtract liabilities
from both sides,

00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:51.801
assets minus liabilities
is equal to equity.

00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:53.657
This might be a little bit more intuitive.

00:04:53.657 --> 00:04:56.203
What we have leftover
is always what we own

00:04:56.203 --> 00:04:57.523
minus what we owe.

00:04:57.523 --> 00:04:59.811
That is what the owners have.

00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:03.132
Now, when we say that I'm
part-owner of a company,

00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:06.888
that means that I have a
piece of this pie right here.

00:05:06.888 --> 00:05:10.324
This is what I am a
part-owner of, the equity.

00:05:10.324 --> 00:05:12.998
So, for example, if we have,

00:05:12.998 --> 00:05:14.560
if there are 2 million shares,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.941
so Company X, let's say
they have 2 million shares,

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.815
and let's say that the equity

00:05:22.815 --> 00:05:25.330
is really worth $20 million.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.660
How much is each share worth

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.733
if we believe all of these numbers?

00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:30.946
Well, we have $20 million of equity,

00:05:30.946 --> 00:05:40.393
20 million of equity
divided by 2 million shares,

00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:42.648
divided by 2 million shares,

00:05:42.648 --> 00:05:51.899
which gets us $10 of equity per share.

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.922
If we believe all of these numbers,

00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:57.119
and we know that Company
X has 2 million shares,

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:59.793
then we would say that
each share is worth $10,

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:00.897
and if we like these numbers

00:06:00.897 --> 00:06:02.768
and if someone is willing
to sell us a share

00:06:02.768 --> 00:06:04.595
for less than that, we would buy it.

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:06.989
If someone was willing
to pay more than that,

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:08.244
maybe we would sell it.

00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:11.071
Just to make all of this a
little bit more tangible,

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:12.858
let's look at an actual
example of a company

00:06:12.858 --> 00:06:15.599
to show you that I'm not
making all of this stuff up.

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:18.459
I got this off of your
traditional financial sources.

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:19.927
This is actually from the filings

00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:21.816
of this unnamed company,

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:23.145
and you'll get extra bonus points

00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:24.653
if you figure out what this company is,

00:06:24.653 --> 00:06:27.174
and this is their actual
stock-trading activity,

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:29.161
and I just want to draw the same diagram

00:06:29.161 --> 00:06:30.742
that I drew up here,

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:33.086
the same diagram that I drew up here,

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:34.588
to really, on this company,

00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:35.922
so you can kind of see that this

00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:37.530
actually happens in the real world,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.585
so first let's draw their assets.

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:42.819
Let's say this is Company X,

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.989
and let's say these are
its assets right there.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.213
Its assets.

00:06:47.213 --> 00:06:48.921
Let's go to its balance sheet.

00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.383
This is actually what they reported.

00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:52.144
This is June 30th,

00:06:53.174 --> 00:06:56.209
well, we want to take
the more recent date.

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:57.533
They're just trying to compare to

00:06:57.533 --> 00:06:59.852
what they had before.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.590
Let's look at these,

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.924
this is some time ago,

00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:03.655
but it doesn't matter.

00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:04.326
We're learning.

00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:05.354
This is, we're not trying to decide

00:07:05.354 --> 00:07:07.072
whether we want to
invest in this right now.

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.041
This is a very old financial statement,

00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:11.452
but let's just look at
what they're saying.

00:07:11.452 --> 00:07:13.324
They have our total assets here.

00:07:13.324 --> 00:07:15.806
30 million, I'll just do in round numbers.

00:07:15.806 --> 00:07:18.049
$30 million right there,

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:20.794
so $30 million.

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:21.823
You might be curious about,

00:07:21.823 --> 00:07:23.879
"Hey, what's all this
current asset business?"

00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:26.794
Those are things that are either cash

00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:28.474
or that can be turned into cash

00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:29.708
within the next year.

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:31.996
So, for example, accounts receivable.

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:35.070
That's money that other
maybe vendors owe them,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.302
that they're going to pay very soon.

00:07:36.302 --> 00:07:38.730
Inventories, these are
things that they have

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.206
maybe in the warehouse that they can sell

00:07:40.206 --> 00:07:41.703
and turn into cash very quickly.

00:07:41.703 --> 00:07:44.133
Other current assets, maybe that's stock

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:46.210
or some other type of
investment that they could sell

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.393
and turn into cash.

00:07:47.393 --> 00:07:50.484
So they have 18 million of current assets,

00:07:50.484 --> 00:07:52.919
that's things that they can
turn into cash very easily

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:53.629
and very quickly,

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:56.126
definitely within the next year.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:57.887
Then you have some property,
plant and equipment.

00:07:57.887 --> 00:08:02.600
this is kind of that land
and buildings and machinery

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.405
that I talked about,

00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:05.123
and then who knows what
these other assets are.

00:08:05.123 --> 00:08:07.391
Maybe those are trademarks or patents,

00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:08.736
or who knows what they are?

00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:12.099
But all in all, they have
$30 million of assets.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:13.573
Now let's go to the liabilities.

00:08:13.573 --> 00:08:16.857
They have some current liabilities,

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:18.294
16 million.

00:08:18.294 --> 00:08:19.727
Current liabilities, just so you know,

00:08:19.727 --> 00:08:20.828
those are liabilities.

00:08:20.828 --> 00:08:22.953
These are things that
they have to pay in cash

00:08:22.953 --> 00:08:23.843
within the next year.

00:08:23.843 --> 00:08:26.061
It could be debt, it could be payables.

00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:27.725
They have to pay some other vendors.

00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:28.885
Who knows what it is?

00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:31.277
But you can kind of view
it as debt on some level,

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:33.282
maybe debt that you have
to pay in the next year.

00:08:33.282 --> 00:08:37.220
Then the have long-term
debt of 5.5 million.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.680
If you add these two up,

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.475
you get pretty close to about 22 million,

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:46.793
so just for simplicity, I'll
put it over here as 22 million.

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:52.281
So this company has 22
million in liabilities.

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:57.284
22 million liabilities.

00:08:57.284 --> 00:08:58.532
These are their assets,

00:08:58.532 --> 00:09:00.469
just to get all the labeling right.

00:09:00.469 --> 00:09:01.731
So what's left for equity?

00:09:01.731 --> 00:09:04.397
We'll just draw it on this simple diagram.

00:09:04.397 --> 00:09:08.225
We have 8 million left for equity.

00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:09.326
8 million left for equity,

00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:11.397
and actually, they did the
calculation here for us.

00:09:11.397 --> 00:09:16.760
The exact number is 8.39
or 8.4 million in equity,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.529
but this is a nice round
number for us to show.

00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:21.421
This is real-world stuff
that we're dealing with,

00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:23.009
and if you wanted to know, kind of,

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:24.529
if you believe these numbers,

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.489
if you believe that this company's assets

00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:29.062
really are worth $30 million,

00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:30.525
what should you pay for it?

00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:31.865
Well, then you're going to divide by

00:09:31.865 --> 00:09:33.565
the total number of shares,

00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:35.471
and you'll see this in
some financial statements,

00:09:35.471 --> 00:09:36.813
and I won't go into the details

00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:38.727
of the difference between
basic and diluted,

00:09:38.727 --> 00:09:40.815
but the numbers are very, very close,

00:09:40.815 --> 00:09:43.414
so we don't have to
worry about it too much.

00:09:43.414 --> 00:09:47.057
But let's just say that
this company has 2.7,

00:09:47.057 --> 00:09:51.330
looks like 2.78 million shares.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.733
So if the book value is 8.396.

00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:56.257
I mean, I wrote 8 here,

00:09:56.257 --> 00:09:58.329
how much should each of these shares,

00:09:58.329 --> 00:09:59.723
how much should each of these,

00:09:59.723 --> 00:10:00.726
and when I say book value,

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.727
I mean these are their books.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.326
According to their books,

00:10:04.326 --> 00:10:06.987
the equity is worth 8.4 million.

00:10:06.987 --> 00:10:10.468
If we really believe that the
equity's worth 8.4 million,

00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:12.605
how much should each share be worth?

00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:16.474
Well, we'll just divide 8.4 million,

00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:19.464
we'll just have to divide 8.4 million,

00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:20.808
8.4 million.

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:22.725
This is actually an 8.4.

00:10:22.725 --> 00:10:23.966
I wrote 8 there for simpicity.

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:27.727
Divided by the number
of shares, 2.78 million.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.009
So that's a million, and that's a million,

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:34.664
and I'll get a calculator
out for this one right here.

00:10:34.664 --> 00:10:41.859
So, let's see, we're
here doing 8.4 million

00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:46.476
divided by 2.78 million shares.

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:47.067
So according,

00:10:47.067 --> 00:10:50.056
if we believe these numbers,
if we believe the books,

00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:51.724
the book value of the shares is about

00:10:51.724 --> 00:10:55.327
$3.02 per share,

00:10:55.327 --> 00:11:02.407
so this is $3.02 per share,

00:11:02.407 --> 00:11:04.221
book value per share.

00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:06.470
That's what we should be
willing to pay for this,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.377
or what we think a fair price per share

00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:09.551
of this company is

00:11:09.551 --> 00:11:12.928
if we think these assets are
really worth $30 million.

00:11:12.928 --> 00:11:14.654
Now, what are people actually paying

00:11:14.654 --> 00:11:15.995
for these shares?

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:16.929
Well, that's,

00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:20.077
we look at this information right here,

00:11:20.077 --> 00:11:23.977
and we see that the last
trade here was for $2.58,

00:11:23.977 --> 00:11:25.826
so people are paying a discount

00:11:25.826 --> 00:11:27.478
to the number we just calculated,

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:28.999
so the only reason why people are paying

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:30.077
less than that,

00:11:30.077 --> 00:11:32.723
or someone's willing to
sell for less than $3,

00:11:32.723 --> 00:11:34.259
is that someone out there,

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:35.802
especially the person selling,

00:11:35.802 --> 00:11:37.638
thinks that this company really,

00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:38.731
the assets of this company

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.660
really aren't worth $30 million.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.991
He or she thinks of the
assets of this company

00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:44.587
are worth less than $30 million,

00:11:44.587 --> 00:11:46.475
and maybe they think that
the company's prospects

00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:47.556
aren't as good.

00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:49.135
They're product isn't,

00:11:49.135 --> 00:11:50.317
the sales are going to go down.

00:11:50.317 --> 00:11:51.128
Who knows?

00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:52.396
Maybe the person buying it,

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:54.192
maybe they think it is worth $3 a share,

00:11:54.192 --> 00:11:56.658
and that's why they're
willing to pay $2.58 for it

00:11:56.658 --> 00:11:58.327
because they think it's going to go up.

00:11:58.327 --> 00:12:00.977
Just so that we get some
of the other details

00:12:00.977 --> 00:12:04.259
that we see here, this bid,

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:05.135
this bid right here.

00:12:05.135 --> 00:12:07.662
This is what someone has explicitly said

00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:10.139
that they're willing to pay for a share.

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:12.475
The ask is what someone
has explicitly said

00:12:12.475 --> 00:12:15.075
they're willing to sell a share for.

00:12:15.075 --> 00:12:17.674
This 52-week range is the range of prices

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:18.553
that the shares have sold,

00:12:18.553 --> 00:12:19.923
so in the past year,

00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:23.096
these shares sold for as low as $1.20,

00:12:23.096 --> 00:12:24.333
and that was actually a great deal

00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:26.726
because they went up, even now,

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:29.225
where they're selling at $2.58.

00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:31.400
the average volume right here,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.660
this is the number of shares sold per day,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.891
exchanged per day.

00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:38.890
The market cap, right here,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.393
you've probably heard that word before.

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:43.192
That's essentially the market's sense

00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:45.636
of what this number really is.

00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:47.868
We're saying that the
books of this company

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.998
are saying this company
is worth $8 million,

00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:51.476
but the market cap is saying

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:53.673
what the equity of the company is worth

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:55.327
in the market's mind,

00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:56.261
and to get that number,

00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:58.928
they're taking the $2.58.

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:02.996
they're taking the $2.58
times the number of shares.

00:13:02.996 --> 00:13:07.394
Times the 2.78 million shares.

00:13:07.394 --> 00:13:09.673
If we do that, we're going to get,

00:13:09.673 --> 00:13:17.073
let's see, 2.58 times
2.78 is equal to exactly,

00:13:17.073 --> 00:13:18.596
well, it's a little
different than what they had.

00:13:18.596 --> 00:13:20.025
Maybe it's a little round-off error,

00:13:20.025 --> 00:13:24.224
but roughly 7 million in market cap.

00:13:24.224 --> 00:13:26.995
Like I said before, the
market is not paying $3.

00:13:26.995 --> 00:13:28.930
It's paying $2.58,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.139
and so the market is
saying that the equity,

00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:33.328
this piece right here
is closer to 7 million,

00:13:33.328 --> 00:13:34.526
even though the books are saying

00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:37.659
that this number right
here is above 8 million.

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:40.070
Well, anyway, hopefully
that was a little bit useful

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.324
and gives you a little bit of a sense

00:13:41.324 --> 00:13:45.074
of what it actually means to buy shares

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.525
in a company.
