ELIZABETH CHOE: We were
talking about like,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.550
what is digital media
literacy exactly, because we

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.990
talked about this a lot.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.710
And I think what it really is,
is not so much being proficient

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.370
in scripting and
filming and editing,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.250
it's just the self awareness
to know what you're good at,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.820
and what you're not good at.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.950
And just the
appreciation for what

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.020
goes into things,
and the knowledge

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.920
of who to tap into to
help you create a project

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.140
or help you
communicate something.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.852
Go ahead.

00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:37.310
JOSHUA GUNN: I just
have a question

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.460
because I'm not plugged
into the MIT community,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.730
or even into the scientific
community, for that matter.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.060
But is there a culture
of sort of individuality

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.220
wherein this notion that
basically, my intellectual work

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.850
is to be done sort of in a
silo, versus the kind of,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.900
like, I know I'm
not good at this,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.990
so I need to build a
team where we can build.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.470
GEORGE ZAIDAN: At MIT, it's
pretty interdisciplinary.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.780
What I would say, is
not siloed, but there's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.880
an ingrained culture of is
this idea that real science--

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.470
and I'm doing it now by saying
real science-- that science

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.132
and engineering is work, and
communication is not work.

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:27.090
JOSHUA GUNN: Oh, I see.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.590
ELIZABETH CHOE: Or even
that it a separate thing.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.990
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.650
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.774
CHRIS BOEBELThat's a pretty
good way of putting it.

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:35.560
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So that's-- it's
not that people are like siloed

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.280
within themselves, it's that
communicators don't have street

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.626
cred with scientists, period.

00:01:42.626 --> 00:01:44.500
CHRIS BOEBEL: And that
part will just happen,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.820
it will take care of itself.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.650
I'm not going to worry
about it too much.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.170
JOSHUA GUNN: I
see, so that sounds

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170
like the real meat
of what you guys are

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.861
trying to work on, in a way.

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:55.110
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, I guess.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.020
I mean it's interesting because
I gave a survey to the students

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.940
at the end of the class,
and they were all like,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.270
I probably wouldn't make
another video again.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.009
A couple of them said they
would, but most of them

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.539
are like, I probably
won't make a video,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.270
but, I have so much more
appreciation for what

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.170
goes into it.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.010
Now I can't watch a
movie without thinking

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.770
about how much,
you know, how much

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.570
work it took to just
light the scene.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.920
So even just having
the appreciation

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.500
for what goes into it,
I think, is a big step.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.710
But, again, with the
whole literacy thing,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.500
just the awareness of how
important these skills are.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
Because, like you
said, I mean, it's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.040
just crazy that we think
of them as separate things.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.280
There's science and
there's communication,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.480
and you're trained
separately on these things,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.140
if you happen to be a
science communicator.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.806
CHRIS BOEBEL: One of
things that I think

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:53.430
is really interesting about
media is that video or media,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.715
films, they're really
interesting in that when

00:02:57.715 --> 00:02:59.700
they're well made,
they're so accessible.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.620
They're so immediately
graspable by those of us

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.670
in the last 100
years who's really

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.650
literate at unpacking video
and understanding the medium.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.000
They're so kind of
intuitively open

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.630
that people who don't have
any appreciation or awareness

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.770
of how they're made
assume that there isn't

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.250
any kind of effort behind them.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.730
That they just kind of happen.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.350
And I can remember as a
kid kind of thinking that.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.040
Never really
thinking about movies

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.380
and how they were made until, I
was probably, God, in college.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.280
I just kind of assumed
that they just kind of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.080
happened out there.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.120
JOSHUA GUNN: Our clients
think you just hit a button.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.036
CHRIS BOEBEL: Exactly.

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.330
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.760
And that's because if things
are well made, it's like,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.304
didn't that just
always exist that way?

00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:44.220
You mean somebody actually
had to create that?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.150
It seems so natural.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.080
And I think that
one of the things,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.029
a key of media literacy,
is breaking that myth.

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:51.820
JOSHUA GUNN: Right.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.402
Or, gasp, it would cost
money to hire people.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.610
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And take time.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.690
JOSHUA GUNN: You would have
to hire professionals to do it

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.600
that are trained and pay them.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.100
ELIZABETH CHOE: So
the biggest thing

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.230
in teaching this
literacy, though, I think,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.380
is making them go through
the experience themselves.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.530
Because it's one thing if
you watch like a series of

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.340
lectures.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.160
Like it's one thing if you
watch this on OpenCourseWare,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.050
and you can take
the notes on, like,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.990
this is good framing if
you use the thirds rule.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.850
Write a script like
you would say it.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.180
We go through all these sort
of tangible, take home points.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.940
These sort of plastic
elements, like you mentioned.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.820
But I don't think
you'll have the same,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.030
you won't draw the same value
from it as if you actually

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.000
go through and try
to do the projects

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.810
that these students did.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.490
And that's a big issue, I think,
especially in media teaching.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.130
That it's easy to
first establish

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.320
a sort of theoretical
principles.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.900
Like, this is sort of
what makes a good story.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.180
And then it's another
thing to actually give

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.910
hard, tangible
examples to students.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.610
Like, look at this script.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.680
They're able to point out
issues in the scripts.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.610
They were able to critique
them, but then it's

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.734
a whole other step for them
to be able to integrate

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:17.020
it themselves into a script.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.542
So you'd have a student who
understood the principles,

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:21.250
they took the notes,
they could reiterate

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.810
everything you said to them.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.000
They were able to look at
the examples you gave them

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.990
and say, oh you know,
this is unclear here,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.450
this is awkward wording.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.960
And then they would write the
script, and you'd be like,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.480
there's this disconnect
to the third step.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.040
And it wasn't until
they tried it,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.630
and then we were able to
critique them directly

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.280
that they were able to come
to this final self awareness

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.830
conclusion.
