hope that through this course you learn

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
hope that through this course you learn
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.140
hope that through this course you learn
how to much more quickly and efficiently

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
how to much more quickly and efficiently
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.180
how to much more quickly and efficiently
get your machine learning systems

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
get your machine learning systems
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.670
get your machine learning systems
working so what is machine learning

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
working so what is machine learning
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.519
working so what is machine learning
strategy let's start with a motivating

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
strategy let's start with a motivating
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.920
strategy let's start with a motivating
example let's say you are working on

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
example let's say you are working on
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.920
example let's say you are working on
your cat crossfire and after working for

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
your cat crossfire and after working for
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.170
your cat crossfire and after working for
some time you've gotten your system to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
some time you've gotten your system to
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.870
some time you've gotten your system to
have 90% accuracy but this isn't good

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
have 90% accuracy but this isn't good
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299
have 90% accuracy but this isn't good
enough for your application you might

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
enough for your application you might
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.860
enough for your application you might
don't have a lot of ideas for how to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
don't have a lot of ideas for how to
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780
don't have a lot of ideas for how to
improve your system for example you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
improve your system for example you
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430
improve your system for example you
might think well let's collect more data

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
might think well let's collect more data
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.069
might think well let's collect more data
more training data or you might say

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
more training data or you might say
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.840
more training data or you might say
maybe your training set isn't diverse

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
maybe your training set isn't diverse
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.940
maybe your training set isn't diverse
enough yet you should collect images of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
enough yet you should collect images of
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400
enough yet you should collect images of
cats and more diverse poses or maybe a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
cats and more diverse poses or maybe a
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.520
cats and more diverse poses or maybe a
more diverse set of negative examples

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530
more diverse set of negative examples
 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.900
more diverse set of negative examples
well maybe you want to train the album

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
well maybe you want to train the album
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970
well maybe you want to train the album
longer with gradient descents or maybe

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
longer with gradient descents or maybe
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650

when trying to improve a deep learning
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.090
when trying to improve a deep learning
system you often have a lot of ideas but

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
system you often have a lot of ideas but
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.090

things you could try and the problem is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
things you could try and the problem is
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.310

that if you choose poorly it is entirely

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
that if you choose poorly it is entirely
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109

possible the you end up spending six

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
possible the you end up spending six
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090

to realize after six months that that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
to realize after six months that that
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.300
to realize after six months that that
didn't do any good

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
didn't do any good
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910
didn't do any good
for example I've seen some teams spend

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
for example I've seen some teams spend
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950
for example I've seen some teams spend
literally six months collecting more

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
literally six months collecting more
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.469
literally six months collecting more
data only to realize after six months

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

that it barely improves the performance

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
that it barely improves the performance
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.090
that it barely improves the performance

have six months to wait on your problem

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
have six months to wait on your problem
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.020

won't it be nice if you had quick and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
won't it be nice if you had quick and
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120
won't it be nice if you had quick and
effective ways to figure out which of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

will help you become much more effective

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739
will help you become much more effective
 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.890
will help you become much more effective
at getting your deep learning system to
