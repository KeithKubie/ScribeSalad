00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.300
So we've completed discussing the lock-based synchronization

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.300
algorithms for a multiprocessor. So how about

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.540
we close this section of the lesson with a quiz? What I want you

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.000
to do is, we've talked about several different algorithms, spin on test and set,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.960
spin on read, spin with delay. TIcket

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.590
lock, Anderson's queue lock, array based, MCS link

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.030
based queue lock. So these are the

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.660
different algorithms that we've looked at. And along

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.010
the way, I mentioned some of the attributes that we look for latency for getting

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.440
the lock, contention when locks are released,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.420
fairness whether the spin is on a. Private

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.720
variable or a shared variable. How many

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.780
read modify write operations are required for acquiring

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
a lock? And what are the space overhead associated

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.510
with the lock? And when the lock is released, are

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.780
we signaling one guy or are we signaling everybody?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.180
So all of these are different attributes that you can

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.480
associate with these different. Block algorithms, and what I

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.780
would like you to do is take your time and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.110
read the algorithms by filling this table, and of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.360
course, you should go back and look at these algorithms

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.090
to get a clearer understanding if you find yourself not

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.280
ready yet to fill out this table, so take your time.
