00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.435
- [Voiceover] So up
here, we are multiplying

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.436
two rational expressions.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.438
And here, we're dividing
one rational expression

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.639
by another one.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.641
Now what I encourage you
do is pause this video

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.977
and think about what these
become when you multiply them.

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:12.979
I don't know, maybe you
simplify it a little bit,

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.749
and I also want you to
think about what constraints

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.984
do you have to put on the x values

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.286
in order for your resulting expression

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.883
to be algebraically equivalent
to your original expression.

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:26.426
So let's work it out
together just so you realize

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.094
what I'm talking about.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.296
So this is going to be, in our numerator,

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:34.367
we are going to get six x to
the third power times two,

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.804
and our denominator,
we're going to have five

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.106
times three x.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.609
And we can see both the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.713
are divisible by x, so let's
divide the denominator by x.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.714
We get one there.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.849
Let's divide x to the third by x.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.851
We get x squared.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.587
And we can also see the both
the numerator and denominator

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.257
are divisible by three,
so divide six by three,

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.258
you get two.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.293
Divide three by three, you get one.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:05.063
And we are left with
two x squared times two,

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:08.535
which is going to be four x squared

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.638
over five times one times one over five.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:16.476
And we can also write
that as 4/5 x squared.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.678
Now someone just presented
you on the street

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.680
with the expression 4/5 x squared and say,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.015
for what x is this defined?

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.017
I could put any x here, x could be zero

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.453
because zero squared is zero times 4/5

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.521
is just going to be zero, so
it does seems to be defined

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.123
for zero, and that is true.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.092
But if someone says, how
would I have to constrain this

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.962
in order for it to be
algebraically equivalent

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.531
to this first expression?

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.533
Well then, you'd have to say,
well, this first expression

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.936
is not defined for all x.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.605
For example, if x were equal
to zero, then you would be

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.607
dividing by zero right over here,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.609
which would make this undefined.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.811
So you could explicitly
call it out, x can not be

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.079
equal to zero.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.882
And so if you want this to
be algebraically equivalent,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:59.052
you would have to make
that same condition,

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.855
x cannot be equal to zero.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.090
Another way to think about
it, if you had a function

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.894
defined this way, if you
said, if you said f of x

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:11.364
is equal to six x to the third over five

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:15.969
times two over, times two over three x;

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.771
and if someone said,
well what is f of zero,

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.774
you would say f of zero is undefined.

00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:24.911
Undefined.

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:25.912
Why is that?

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.537
Because you put x equals zero
there, you're going to get

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.916
two divided by zero and it's undefined.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.951
But if you said, okay,
well, can I simplify this

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.220
a little bit to get the
exact same function?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.291
Well, we're saying you can
say f of x is equal to 4/5

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.894
times x squared.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.963
But if you just left it at
that, you would get f of zero

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.298
is equal to zero.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.001
So now it would be defined
at zero, but then this would

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.002
make it a different function.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.004
These are two different
functions the way they're written

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.005
right over here.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.475
Instead, to make them, to make it clear

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.077
that this is equivalent to
that one, you would have to say

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:01.381
x cannot be equal to zero.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.616
Now these functions are
equivalent because now,

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.486
if u said f of zero, you'd say all right,

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.621
x cannot be equal to zero, you know?

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.524
This would be the case if x
is anything other than zero

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:15.395
and it's not defined for
zero, and so you would say

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.130
f or zero is undefined.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.033
So now, these two
functions are equivalent,

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.303
or these two expressions are
algebraically equivalent.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.705
So thinking about that,
let's tackle this division

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.140
situation here.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.175
So immediately, when you
look at this, you say, woah,

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.910
what are constrains here?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.746
Well, x cannot be equal to
zero because if x was a zero,

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.716
this second, this five x
to the fourth over four

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.218
would be zero and you'd be
dividing, you'd be dividing

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.219
by zero.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.791
So we can explicitly call
out that x cannot be equal

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:45.792
to zero.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.208
And so if x cannot be equal to zero

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:49.098
in the original expression, if the result,

00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:50.894
whatever we get for the
resulting expression,

00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:53.089
in order for it to be
algebraically equivalent,

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:57.203
we have to give this same constraint.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:59.739
So let's multiply this,
or let's do the division.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.543
So this is going to be
the same thing as two x

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:07.614
to the fourth power over
seven times the reciprocal,

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.015
times...

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:13.953
The reciprocal of this is
going to be four over five

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.522
x to the fourth, which
is going to be equal to

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:21.094
in the numerator, we're going
to have eight x to the fourth.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.730
So we're going to have
eight x to the fourth,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.732
four times two x to the fourth,

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:29.102
over seven times five
x to the fourth is 35

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.803
x to the fourth.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:31.804
And now, there's something.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.773
We can do a little bit
of simplification here,

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.190
both the numerator and the
denominator are divisible

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.777
by x to the fourth, so let's
divide by x to the fourth

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.680
and we get eight over 35.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.052
So once again, you just look at eight 30,

00:04:42.052 --> 00:04:44.751
Well, this is going to
be defined for any x.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.886
X isn't even involved in the expression.

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:50.390
But if we want this to be
algebraically equivalent

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.625
to this first expression,
then we have to make

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:56.868
the same constraint, x does
not, cannot be equal to zero.

00:04:57.196 --> 00:04:58.729
And to see, you know, this
even seems a little bit

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.234
more nonsensical to say
x cannot be equal to zero

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.236
for an expression that
does not even involve x.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.672
But one way to think about
it is imagine a function

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:08.557
that was defined as g of x

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:12.712
is equal to, is equal to
all of this business here.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:15.581
Well, g of zero would be undefined.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:20.053
But if you said g of x is equal to 8/35,

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:22.522
well now, g of zero
would be defined as 8/35,

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.524
which would make it a different function.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:27.160
So to make them algebraically equivalent,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.495
you could say g of x is equal to

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.616
8/35,

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:35.300
as long as x does not equal zero.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.004
And you could say it's
undefined if you want.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.239
Undefined for x equals zero.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.241
Or you don't even have to
include that second row,

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:45.373
and that will literally
just make it undefined.

00:05:45.373 --> 00:05:48.281
But now, this expression,

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.435
this algebraic expression, is equivalent

00:05:50.435 --> 00:05:54.085
to our original one even
though we had simplified it.
