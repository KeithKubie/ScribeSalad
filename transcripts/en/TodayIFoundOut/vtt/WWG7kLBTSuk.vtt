00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.000
Why Do People In Asia Use Chopsticks

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.590
Created roughly 4,000-5,000 years ago in China,
the earliest versions of something like chopsticks

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.320
were used for cooking (they’re perfect for
reaching into pots full of hot water or oil)

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.460
and were most likely made from twigs.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.220
While it’s difficult to nail down a firm
date, it would seem it wasn’t until around

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.370
500-400 AD that they began being used as table
utensils.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.090
One factor that contributed to this switch
was a population boom across the country.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.510
Consequently, resources, particularly for
cooking, became incredibly scarce.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.870
As a result, people began cutting their food
into tiny pieces so it would cook faster.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.960
The bite sized morsels rendered table knives
obsolete, as there was very little left to

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960
cut.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.680
However, they were now perfect for eating
with chopsticks, which were also made from

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.760
cheap materials and easily made.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.240
Thus, a trend was born.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.790
The table knife’s decline in popularity
in these regions at this time can also be

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.940
attributed to the teachings of Confucius,
who was a vegetarian.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.290
He believed that knives weren’t appropriate
to eat with.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.100
As Confucius supposedly said,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.190
The honourable and upright man keeps well
away from both the slaughterhouse and the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.190
kitchen.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.450
And he allows no knives on his table.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.680
It was due to this that it’s believed that
Chinese chopsticks are traditionally blunt

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.580
at the tip and thus somewhat poor choices
to try to spear food as you would with a fork.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.970
Within about a century of this, chopsticks
had migrated to other Asian countries, such

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.610
as Japan, Korea and Vietnam.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.190
One distinct difference between Japanese and
Chinese chopsticks was that the former were

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.630
made from a single piece of bamboo that were
joined at the base.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.409
In addition, Japanese chopsticks were originally
used solely for religious ceremonies.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.030
Regardless of their differences, chopsticks
remained popular in both countries and are

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.560
still the primary utensil of choice.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.759
While the early chopsticks were more often
than not made of some cheap material, such

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.859
as bamboo, later silver chopsticks were sometimes
used during Chinese dynastic times in order

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.549
to prevent food poisoning.

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.549
How?

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.209
It was believed that silver utensils would
turn black if they came into contact with

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.049
any life threatening toxins.

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.040
Unfortunately for those engaging in this practise,
silver doesn’t turn black when it touches

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.189
the likes of cyanide or arsenic, among other
poisons.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:41.620
However, it most definitely can change colour
if touched by garlic, onion or rotten eggs

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.680
– all of which release hydrogen sulfide
which reacts with the silver causing it to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.739
change colour.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.319
For anyone that has ever had difficulty eating
rice with chopsticks, you may have wondered

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.680
why anyone would choose this particular utensil
for consuming such food with.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.489
Perhaps one of the earliest of table utensils,
such as the spoon, would work better here.

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.010
But you see, in Asia, the majority of rice
is either a short or medium grain variety

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.829
often with starches that are particularly
gummy or clumpy.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.669
As such, it sticks together and is quite easily
picked up by chopsticks.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:21.919
In comparison, many Westerners eat long grain
rice (often highly processed) with is much

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:27.560
fluffier and the individual grains are more
distinct and for the unpracticed hand, difficult

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:42.879
to eat 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:57.010
with chopsticks.
