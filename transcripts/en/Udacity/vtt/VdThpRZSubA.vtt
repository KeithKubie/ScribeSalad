00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.640
When you implement the OnLocationChange
callback, you can write the latitude and

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.720
longitude that you receive from
location services to your UI.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.980
This is essentially the same as
in our old OncConnected method

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.730
before we switched to
continuous updates.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.610
If you remember there we had
location.getLatitude that we

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.526
converted to a string
loaded into mLatitudeText.

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:24.460
And similarly location.getLongitude,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.540
that we converted to a string and
loaded into an longitude text.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.200
Now, we had done this previously in
On Connected so we would just get it

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.640
once whenever we connect, but now that
we're using the fuse location API and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.960
we're requesting location updates from
that, those location updates will be

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.330
called back to us in the on
location change function.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.440
And as a result,
we'll get continuous updates.
