00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: The second
part of our day today.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.000
Happy to kick off this broader
discussion on issues of gender

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.600
equality empowerment,
falling on a conversation

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.520
that Aimee and I started
here, and I honestly

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.880
can't imagine a more
qualified group of women

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.290
to be having this
conversation with.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.600
It's a pleasure to
welcome you all to Google.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.506
I thought rather than trying
to have everyone introduce

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:27.130
themselves, I'll run through and
just give a quick introduction

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.530
of who we have here on stage.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.640
All of their bios
are available online

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.550
at makemyvoicematter.org.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.300
So if you want to read
any more about them

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.930
or hear more about
their work, that's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.300
the place you can check it out.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.330
So you've obviously
already met Aimee here,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:48.750
Aimee Mullins, with a few
labels-- actress, athlete,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.000
advocate.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.460
But none, really just Amy we
already talked about that.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.020
To her left we have Hala Kazim.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.750
Hala is a counselor,
artist, author,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.044
and the founder of Journey
Through Change, which

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:05.710
is a new concept that she's been
working on that provides people

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.690
with support, advice, and
help through tailored services

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.000
and walking and hiking
destination tours.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.340
She features regularly
as a guest speaker

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.530
on challenges facing women,
particularly in the UAE.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.660
So Hala, so glad to
have you here today.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.580
Thanks for traveling
to be with us.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.960
To her-- the other
side of her-- I'm

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.210
going to not do the directions
correctly for the stage

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.200
directions.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.887
We have Oisika
Chakrabarti, and she

00:01:30.887 --> 00:01:32.470
is the Senior
Communications and Media

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.890
Specialist at the UN Women.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.510
UN Women is dedicated to
gender equity empowerment,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.770
and she has been with the
United Nations for 11 years

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.700
guiding media partnerships,
engagement, public information

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520
around the UN.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.680
And prior to that was herself
a filmmaker and broadcast

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.770
journalists in South Asia.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.440
So obviously brings all those
qualifications to her role.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.880
Down the line from her,
we have Arlette Nkurayija.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.320
Arlette is the
President of Women

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.630
and Children Embassy
Foundation based

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.550
in Canada, where she advocates
and focuses on issues

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.460
of African women both
in Africa, as well as

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.400
people who have
immigrated to Canada

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.770
and helping them to settle.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.250
She's obviously
an expert in that,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.180
because she herself
was born in Rwanda,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.920
and after the 1994
genocide chose a path

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.290
to creating a better future.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.240
She moved to Italy, Montreal--
fluency in five languages.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.400
She's now able to
use her law degree

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.040
and is currently working as
a lawyer for Talk Enterprises

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.240
and Talk Marketing.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.110
Arlette, thank you
for being here.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.370
And then finally on the end,
we have Melissa Goodman.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.050
Melissa is the Director
of the LGBTQ Gender

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.290
and Reproductive Justice
Project at the ACLU

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.050
of Southern California.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.280
She has been with the
ACLU for quite some time,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.930
and I was very
excited to meet her,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.450
because she led New York's
successful effort to pass

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.630
Marriage Equality Statute.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.150
And then served
as the co-counsel

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.780
on the Windsor
versus United States

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.340
case, which eventually was
the case that the Supreme

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.550
Court held in determining that
the Defense of Marriage Act

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.800
was unconstitutional.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.050
So Melissa, pleasure
to have you here today.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.070
Well, let's get this
conversation started

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.160
with a relatively broad
question for someone

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.420
who I think thinks a lot
about issues globally.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.800
Oisika, could you
just talk a little bit

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.690
about what do we mean
by gender equality,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.330
and when we think about where
we are today in the world what

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.010
progress still needs to be
made, and why are we talking

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.757
about this issue still today?

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.840
OISIKA CHAKRABARTI: Sure,
that's a great question.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.020
And firstly, thank you
for hosting this panel.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.490
This is a great
conversation to have,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.530
and of course a topic very,
very close to my heart

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.220
and all our hearts, I guess.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.230
So what do we mean
by gender equality?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.290
We mean a world
where men and women

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.560
are equal whether it's
politics, whether it's sports,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.810
whether it's economy, whether
it's access to health care,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.380
in all aspects of life.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.510
For some people, let's say
for my four-year-old daughter,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.240
she thinks gender
equality is a given.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.706
It is something
that she completely

00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:15.330
believes that she's
in no way different

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.050
from my six-year-old
son, because she's not

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.920
treated differently.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.250
And she doesn't believe she has
anything up the road where she

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.490
will be treated differently.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.590
She's having a ball imagining
everything is equal.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.110
And as a parent, I hate
to think of that day

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.660
when it will suddenly click
in her head that it's not so,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.170
that gender inequality is
entrenched in our society

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.990
no matter where
you look-- economy,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.240
politics, sports,
access to health care,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.320
the amount of leaders we have.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.040
And it's not to
say that we haven't

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.980
had progress there has been a
lot of progress over the years.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.830
Today there are many more women
and girls in primary education

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.990
than ever before
in the world, there

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.980
are many more women in
politics today than ever

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.120
before in the
world, and there are

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.580
many more women in the economy.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.090
They're working, and
they're in paid employment.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.580
But the progress
that has happened

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.840
over the last few decades
is too slow, uneven,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.570
and just not enough.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.510
I say that, because
today one in three women

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.060
are going to be subject to
violence in their lifetimes.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.430
Across the world there
are only 25 women

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.740
who are prime ministers
and presidents.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.040
In the corporate sector, since
we are in the Silicon Valley,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.090
we can't refute the fact
that there are only 25 women

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.630
CEOs in the Fortune
500 companies.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.610
There is a 24% wage difference
between men and women.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.170
And even as we speak
right now women are dying.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.050
Women are dying
every single day.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.570
800 women die every
single day just trying

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.110
to give life, as in childbirth,
from preventable diseases.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.390
That is unacceptable,
and that is

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.480
why we say gender inequality
is still entrenched,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.632
and every single day we have
to work towards changing that.

00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:11.090
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Melissa, I think it

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.880
would be interesting to hear--
I think sometimes here in the US

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.150
we think, oh, we've
made so much progress,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.480
and these are
perhaps issues that

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.600
are more prevalent in
other parts of the world.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.720
Could you talk a little bit
about the US perspective,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.820
at the ACLU, some of the
things that you'll really

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.080
are focused on right now?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.190
MELISSA GOODMAN: Sure
it's such a big question,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.820
too, because there's
so many things.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.495
And one of the things I have
the privilege of working on

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.010
at the ACLU is our
gender equity work.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.710
And I guess much
like Oisika, there

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.950
has been tremendous
progress, but there

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.800
are areas where there are still
just structural differences

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.470
and problems.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.200
So I'll give you my top six.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.200
The first I would say, and
it has a few components,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.730
is really that the continuing
structural barriers,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.050
stereotypes, and
unconscious bias

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.270
that really still hold
women back in the workplace

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.874
and translates into
less economic power.

00:07:07.874 --> 00:07:09.290
This is a global
problem, but also

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.030
a problem in the United
States, and there's

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.946
a lot of pieces to it.

00:07:11.946 --> 00:07:16.110
We are largely far from the
time where women are officially

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.545
treated differently or
shut out of jobs altogether

00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:19.420
in the United States.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.640
Though I will note, the ACLU
actually does have such a case.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.940
We are actually
still challenging

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.640
the exclusion of women from
combat positions in the US

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.250
military.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.530
So it does still
happen, but largely

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.900
now you what you really see is
unequal employment opportunity,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.170
and in particular
a real difference

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.090
between who enters
the workforce and who

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.590
elevates to management
and to leadership.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.990
And it's really
about stereotypes,

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.840
assumption about women's
abilities and interests,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.460
what an ideal worker or
success really looks like.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.470
In our mind when
we close our eyes,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.800
we think of a man for
a lot of these things.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.180
And it's been proven that traits
that really make men powerful,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.010
and strong, and respected
in the workplace,

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.830
are the very same traits
that make women less

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:12.240
likable and subject
actually to poor evaluations

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.160
in the workplace.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.240
So there's that.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.240
There's continuing systemic
pay inequity, as Oisika noted,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.830
in the United States.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.830
A big thing for us
that we're working on

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.680
is, and I'm only still
on the employment part,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.600
is the fact that in
the United States

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.440
we literally have no
supports for working parents.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.530
And that is not
just a female issue.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.320
That is a male and female
issue, but the cultural reality

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.320
in our country is that
the burden of that

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.860
falls disproportionately
to women.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.680
And we have no
paid family leave.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.390
In fact, only 12% of workers
in the entire country

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.600
have access to
paid family leave.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.140
I was just looking up the
statistics again today,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.150
and was horrified when I read
again that 33% of new mothers

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.980
takes zero time whatsoever
after their child is born.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.040
And that's terrible
as a cultural reality.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.050
43 million workers
in the United States

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.760
don't even get paid sick days
to take care of themselves

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.320
or their child when they're ill.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.824
And we have no system
of affordable daycare.

00:09:12.824 --> 00:09:14.990
So that's just a few of the
things in the employment

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.656
sector.

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:17.530
Just a couple more things
that we work on-- I

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.520
agree that the gender
gap in politics

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.930
is a tremendous problem and
it exists the United States,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.790
and not just other
countries that we often

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.290
think we're better than.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.480
Not true.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.856
There's a tremendous amount
of gender-based violence

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:32.480
and harassment.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.700
I just heard last week that
domestic violence calls

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.180
are the single largest
category of calls

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.930
that the police in the
United States get every year.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.500
Women are losing their ability
to make personal decisions

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.016
about whether and when to
have a child at alarming

00:09:50.016 --> 00:09:51.140
rates in the United States.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.810
Politicians remain completely
obsessed with interfering

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.480
with that highly personal
decision about whether to have

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.120
a child or have an abortion.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.770
And that is something
we're seeing all the time.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.560
We're seeing girls are still
often getting education that's

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.120
full of gender stereotypes.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.861
And finally, I would be remiss
if I didn't also point out

00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:11.610
problems with our
criminal justice system,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.040
and the gender impact that has.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.800
In the United States our
criminal justice system

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.120
over-incarcerates women for
low-level, nonviolent, often

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.800
petty, poverty related offenses
at much higher rates actually

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.640
than men.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.900
And this just creates
a continuing cycle

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.900
of economic dis-empowerment,
and it separates families.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.320
There's 1.3 million children
living in the United States

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.550
right now with
incarcerated mothers.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.899
So these are just a few of the
things we think need fixing.

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:42.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: It
sounds like you'll

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.884
have a job for a while Melissa.

00:10:43.884 --> 00:10:45.800
MELISSA GOODMAN: Yes,
and for better or worse,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.440
that is the truth

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think one of
the really interesting things

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.523
that we have represented
in this panel

00:10:52.523 --> 00:10:54.700
are just these different
perspectives on this issue.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.240
Hala, I think your
perspective would

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.470
be particularly interesting.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.510
How do you think
about empowerment

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.000
in the context particularly
of the UAE in the Middle East,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.670
and how might perception
of that context

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.650
perhaps differ from
reality in your experience?

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.210
HALA KAZIM: First thank
you for having me well

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.220
I think one of the main
thing I want to clarify

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:21.860
is the media has given a very
negative idea to the world

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.410
about the Arab world.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.240
And I'm not defending
it, I'm just

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.420
saying that the reality
in some countries

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.140
are very different than
what is it really shown.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.760
The gender equality is
one of the main things

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:43.830
now UAE has-- I think six
months back [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.810
has [INAUDIBLE] has
announced a law that there

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.030
is gender equality
between men and women

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.530
at work in the
society and [? all. ?]

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.950
And does it's really
apply in reality?

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.080
Well it's around the world.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.830
When we really think, if I
will be very frank about it,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.100
it's a man's world.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.660
And that's reality is, and
I think we women did that.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.200
We have a part of that
giving them so much power.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.490
Now it's nothing wrong.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.830
We are not in a competition.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.830
I always say, it's not
like I have to be equal,

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:24.865
like everything.

00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:28.660
There are things I know I'm
not able to do like a man,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.750
and a man cannot
do like a woman.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.790
That there are a lot of things
that we can do the same.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:40.310
Like in our countries,
the salaries for example,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.470
we are equal.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.100
In America, it's 50%.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:49.590
So if a man takes
$10,000.00 a month,

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.750
exactly the same
$10,000.00 for a woman.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.210
It doesn't matter
the age, or whatever.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:03.830
It's very much equal
in that positions.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.240
Mostly I would talk about
yes, you know Arab world,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.020
but you have to understand
that Arab world are not

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.850
as everybody sees it
that it's one country.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.930
It's so many different.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.010
The Egypt is thousands
of years of history.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.440
Well, when we come to UAE, we
have done the UAE United Arab

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.050
Emirates in 42 years only,
and whatever we're doing,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.270
I think it's miracle.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.100
Lately [INAUDIBLE] and
they have made a law

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.990
that a divorced
woman, a single woman,

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.600
gets a free land like a man.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.690
And we do get, all
of us, I mean I'm

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:53.400
an example of having a free
land and an interest free loan

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.390
for 25 years.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.530
Now this goes to all the
nationals of our country.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.190
So different countries
have different laws,

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:08.170
but I'm not saying we are
living in a la-la-land.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.220
There's no perfect
country, but we are trying.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.190
And I think I would give
that at least to our country,

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.850
that we are trying
our best, or we're

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:26.670
doing our best to at least
take care of some shortcomings

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.540
of what this reality is.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.640
So I think women's
empowerment is

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.520
getting stronger and stronger.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.230
I think people like all of
us, there are thousands of us,

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.080
that can do some changes.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.290
And if I can, I'm an example
of a woman that from UAE

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.330
from Dubai, and
I'm sitting here.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:56.290
And that shows that we
are given the chance

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.360
to do a lot of things.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.010
So it's, you know I don't want
to compare Arab countries,

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:08.820
because I always say like when
an Egyptian grandmother was

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.460
going to the university, my
grandmother was illiterate.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:20.830
It's so different I cannot
compare, but we're catching up,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.940
and I think it's around
the world everybody's doing

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.874
their best.

00:15:25.874 --> 00:15:27.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hala,
you touched on something

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.160
that I think is interesting,
and something that we've

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.560
seen more conversation about
this year in particular

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.570
with the HeForShe campaign,
which is the role of men

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.272
in this movement.

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:39.980
You mentioned you know
women in some ways

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.610
have put ourselves
in this position,

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.109
or men have put us
in this position,

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.600
and I think it's interesting
as we talk about empowerment.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.600
Aimee and I earlier spoke
about self-empowerment

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.970
versus being empowered
by some other entity.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.050
Open to anyone's
thoughts I think really,

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:58.130
but just what is the role,
and should be the role of men

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.020
in this movement?

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.460
And then I think that
the next question is--

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.100
what should we as
women be doing more

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.540
to support each other in
achieving the goals that we all

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.840
have for gender equality?

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.945
Anyone want to-- Arlette?

00:16:11.945 --> 00:16:18.440
ARLETTE NKURAYIJA: I will say
just to start where you are.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.270
And that means everyone.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.340
It doesn't have to
be a big speech,

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.530
or some panel like
we doing right now.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:36.710
It helps, but I think it's
better to just keep it simple,

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.770
and start where you are,
and look around you.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:46.330
Look at the women
around you, and it

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.080
could be a little conversation.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.170
It could be to ask how they are.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:17:01.050
It could be to just understand
what they are going through.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:06.970
And in that way
small things that

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.637
make a difference in
every woman's life,

00:17:11.637 --> 00:17:17.879
and to be able to tell
them that they matter.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.690
Then you can go and
do bigger things,

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:29.460
like education and
talking about it.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:35.400
Then that's OK too but I think
sometimes we think that we just

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.960
need to do things, and we are
thinking I should do this,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.470
I worked with this.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.180
And it doesn't materialize,
because you are thinking

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.740
and you are planning.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.940
But you can just start and do
something small, but effective.

00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:57.940
OISIKA CHAKRABARTI:
Just to add onto that,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.670
and I completely resonate
with what Arlette said.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.760
So you mentioned the
HeForShe campaign.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.090
So that was an initiative
that came from you

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.650
and women, the campaign itself.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.190
Last year, one if our goodwill
ambassadors, Emma Watson,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.070
the supremely
talented actress, she

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.670
launched this HeForShe
campaign which

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.450
is exactly what
Arlette was saying.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.020
It's a call to men
and boys to engage,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.300
not through an
organized movement,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.760
but in their everyday.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.900
I mean as a father, as
a brother, as a son,

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.890
as a supervisor at
work, at an artist

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.340
who is doing an exhibition.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.750
So just engage in
your everyday life,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.510
I mean to bring up your children
on a foundation of equality.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.320
That's what every father can do.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.070
To stand up for discrimination
against your colleagues

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.840
when you see that
in your office.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.491
So it was a way to make every
man and boy across the world

00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:49.990
sort of stand up,
and take a pledge,

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.160
and say OK, so I'm
going to do this.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.080
I'm going to make
sure that the women

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.579
and the girls
around to me are not

00:18:55.579 --> 00:18:56.745
subjected to discrimination.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.660
HALA KAZIM: I think if we
talk about how do we do it,

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.810
it's from inside.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.330
You have to believe
that you can.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.110
A woman should
believe in herself.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.450
And I think one of
the very main thing

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:17.450
to help this is when
you raise your children.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:22.260
I have five sons, and they
have no issue with women

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:27.140
to be even better than
them, or equal to them.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:35.315
So I think it all starts with
us, not really from outside.

00:19:35.315 --> 00:19:36.940
AIMEE MULLINS: I
would echo that, Hala.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.670
I think for all
of us, we'd become

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:48.080
aware of where we have
little prejudices,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.440
or we act in discriminatory
ways without even realizing it.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.485
I think it's incredible to
just wake up and understand

00:19:58.485 --> 00:20:02.970
that even if you think you are
as progressive as you think

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.670
you might be, there's
always a place where

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:12.332
you're holding onto a pattern
that is probably outdated.

00:20:12.332 --> 00:20:13.840
It doesn't serve you anymore.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.990
It definitely doesn't
serve the person

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.580
who is being boxed or
limited or categorized

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.020
and in a limiting
way, because of that.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:28.060
So I think the most exciting
thing about that HeForShe

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.050
campaign, and similar
awareness campaigns

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:37.796
about it, that you know
when feminism started,

00:20:37.796 --> 00:20:40.740
there was a component of
it that I think necessarily

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.080
was rooted in anger at
a sense of injustice.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.890
And not just a
sense of injustice,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.900
but real, experienced injustice.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:57.510
And now that we're a
few generations on,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.990
I think the idea
that to be a feminist

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:10.470
is to want equal treatment
of the sexes, you know,

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.209
all of them.

00:21:13.209 --> 00:21:14.417
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's right.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.280
Sorry, did you want
to add something?

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.412
Hala you mentioned
women and violence,

00:21:21.412 --> 00:21:23.870
and I think Oisika you mentioned
some of the numbers there.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.360
And I think for people,
women especially,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.400
but people, anyone who's in
those challenging situations,

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.700
finding empowerment in
those really tough moments,

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.420
in people experiencing
daily violence or abuse--

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.510
What messages, and how have you
thought about- or in your work

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.350
as you are all
interacting potentially

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.480
with people in those
situations- how

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.420
do you think about people
there who are in that really

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.270
low place of subjugation?

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.390
Helping them to find
moments of empowerment,

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.410
what advice would you have?

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.960
ARLETTE NKURAYIJA:
It is to go back

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.180
to every single person
as an individual.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.670
Everyone is unique,
and it will be

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:20.300
pretentious to think that
because you have an experience.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.140
Or you have been
through so much,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.010
that it's going to
help someone else.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.100
It could, but it's not.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:35.690
So it has to be always
about the other person.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.880
And it has always to
be also about you,

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.490
because-- I will
give an example.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:50.080
I am a survivor of
genocide, and I really

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.150
don't like to say
that about myself,

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.590
because that's how people
sees me: as a survivor.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.300
That I feel like
I am human being.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.490
What happened was hard.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:11.220
It was a situation that I didn't
cause, but that helps me now.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.230
When it was happening,
I couldn't get it.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.020
And if someone
would have come then

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:23.590
and told me because they
went through something,

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:28.340
it will help me, I will
have not resonated then.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:35.950
So I feel like every time
someone needs, whatever

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.930
they need, help, inspiration.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:45.330
You can always go from where you
are and tell them your story,

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:50.010
and tell it in a way
that is true to you,

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:54.760
and sometimes going to resonate
with them, sometimes not.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.890
But you have to understand
that it's not about you,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.220
it's about them.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.010
And if you are able
to help someone

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:13.530
you really have to remember
that the uniqueness has to come

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.870
from them back from you.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.500
But sometimes you need
also to be practical

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:26.110
because there is some situation
when needs active action.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:33.940
And I'm thinking of
a woman in my work

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.580
that I come across
that are very sick.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:44.500
And you need to treat the
physical disease first

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.950
to be able to have
that conversation.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:52.600
So I think as I said
before, to start where

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.950
you are is the most
important thing,

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.130
and to see what's going on.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:02.430
Not to feel like
you have, of course

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:09.065
you have to make a difference,
but in someone others life.

00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:14.316
MELISSA GOODMAN:
I was just going

00:25:14.316 --> 00:25:18.400
to add though, that was
very powerful, Arlette.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.990
I think the thing that I
like to try to remind people

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.980
in that situation,
is that no matter

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.490
how powerless they feel
in a particular situation

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.990
or in that particular moment,
to know that they still

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.350
have power.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.090
And they still have
ownership over themselves.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.830
And that they very simply
they are not alone.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.040
Often it can help
to talk to others,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.540
but unfortunately
we live in a world

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.880
where over a million women are
sexually assaulted every year.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.350
Myself, also, as survivor of
some form of sexual violence.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:00.590
I think that it's important
to say that, to own that,

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.880
and to tell people
that it's very hard,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.470
but there is another side.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.270
You get through
to the other side,

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.990
and there could be an
enormous amount of power

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:15.090
on the other side, and
that you're not alone

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.800
HALA KAZIM: I think
to me, what I really

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.030
would always say to any woman,
to learn to love herself.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.180
And I think that's
where we don't know.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:32.290
I think we abuse
ourselves, and we

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.660
don't take care of
ourselves, because we're

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.800
programmed that we should
always do something for someone.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.030
And I think if you really
learn to love yourself--

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.170
like loving yourself, it
doesn't mean you're selfish.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.660
It means you can
give people more,

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.030
because you take
care of yourself.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:58.305
And when I meet people with
problems, they get puzzled.

00:26:58.305 --> 00:26:59.800
What do you mean
I love yourself?

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.515
Of course I love myself.

00:27:01.515 --> 00:27:03.820
And I'm like, "OK let's talk."

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.870
Then in the end she says,
"I know now, I don't."

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.910
And I say, "Loving
is not a handbag.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.210
It's not a trip.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.130
It's how you take care
of your well-being."

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.780
And that's all my company,
or my program I would say,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.680
is all about: taking
care of yourself

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.240
in this journey of life.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.540
And when you know how to
take care of your well-being

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:38.000
emotionally, physically,
this is spiritually,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.980
and intellectually, everything.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.800
And I'm not saying
going to be perfect.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.880
None of us are perfect.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.380
There are no perfection;
we would not be human.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.630
But at least you
have the stability

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.230
of living a good life.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.650
Then you really can put this
person with anyone, anywhere,

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.200
and they can do good, because
they're good to themselves.

00:28:04.994 --> 00:28:06.680
AIMEE MULLINS: I think
this programming,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.330
we've all touched on this,
starts very, very young.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.460
I know that I've
become very aware

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.970
now that my friends
and peer group

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.780
are starting to become parents.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:24.570
That I don't say to a little
girl "Oh, you're so beautiful!"

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:28.110
That will not be the
first thing I say to her.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.670
It's a little rule
for myself, because I

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:36.300
find it interesting to hear the
things that were said to me,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:41.776
or I would easily say
if I was babysitting.

00:28:41.776 --> 00:28:43.630
You say things to
girls that you don't

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:47.560
say to boys in the sense
of be sweet, smile.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.810
These things start from
a very young age where

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.870
it's about being palatable.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.510
And I know from my
experience as an athlete.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:29:00.400
Every year, a number of the
greatest female athletes

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.330
in the world gather in New York
City for the women's sports

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.440
foundation, which
Billie Jean King, who's

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.280
a wonderful advocate in many
areas, founded in the '70s.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.470
And the athletes
do their own dinner

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.930
the night before, like at a
bowling alley kind of thing.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.239
Really not competitive, right?

00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:22.405
But we get together and we
go around the room first,

00:29:22.405 --> 00:29:25.909
and it's sort of the
opportunity for the rookies,

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:27.450
the people never
been to that dinner,

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.110
to introduce themselves.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:33.370
And it's extraordinary
how people, we're

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.820
talking about Olympic and
world record setting athletes

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.400
or professional
athletes, and how we've

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.500
been taught to dumb it down.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.050
To not be threatening.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:49.440
So it has become a little
ritual at this dinner

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.620
to be ridiculous.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.570
Because it would start
by saying, "Yeah,

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.432
I play softball."

00:29:55.432 --> 00:29:58.040
Oh OK, that's what
the rookie says,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.790
and the next person
says, "Well, you know,

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.590
I set three world records."

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.890
And then the rookie goes,
"Well, I actually I am,

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.910
I do have the record
for the most--".

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:09.600
It's become, like in
this safe environment,

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.960
can you be wildly
celebratory of yourself,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.180
and not have it equate to a
derogatory feeling of shame

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.035
or you're not being humble?

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.530
And it is sometimes these
little steps of that.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.900
It just happened for me in
the bathroom here at Google.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.519
A woman said to
me that she was--

00:30:34.519 --> 00:30:36.060
we were talking
about sports, and she

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.250
said this she was doing
Olympic weightlifting.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.800
And then she spent the next
five minutes telling me, "Well,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.930
but for fun.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.600
Well, more for fun,
not just for fun,

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.815
because you have to
work at it, but you

00:30:45.815 --> 00:30:47.314
know I don't really
do it the way--"

00:30:47.314 --> 00:30:49.985
And I listened to her
and I said at the end,

00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:51.360
"You know, if you
were a guy, you

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.651
wouldn't have said any of that.

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.144
You would've just said, yeah,
I do Olympic weightlifting."

00:30:55.144 --> 00:30:56.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
be very proud of it.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.018
AIMEE MULLINS: And that's it.

00:30:58.018 --> 00:31:03.190
Own it, and not have to
couch it so that you could

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.410
make it more palatable for me.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.580
I think it's amazing.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.580
But it's something I've become
aware of, because I do it too,

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.040
and we all do it.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.670
And I just think that
becoming aware of, and having

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:23.480
little reminders to ourselves
and to our friends, I think

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.410
is just how we do start
to make that change.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.370
HALA KAZIM: I think we're
brought up in the Cinderella

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:37.610
syndrome, that we have to
always wait for someone,

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.820
or we won't be complete.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:45.420
Are programmed in a way
that you don't ask for much,

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.970
because you're not supposed to.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.010
You should, you know,
in different culture

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:56.200
a woman should not raise
her voice or laugh loud,

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.164
because it's not proper.

00:32:00.164 --> 00:32:02.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: I want to touch
on just one of the themes,

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.038
and this is really
interesting kind

00:32:04.038 --> 00:32:05.550
of interplay the
conversation we're

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.800
having between really personal
choices that people make,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.880
and then the structure in which
those choices kind of manifest.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.000
And the interplay that I
think we're in a lot as women,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.520
you feel empowered
one day and then

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.130
maybe you bump up against a
decision being made about pay

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.181
scale, or a decision
about leadership that

00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:26.680
doesn't go your way, and all
of a sudden that's a step back.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.110
That's a setback.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.154
It does seem like a couple of
you touched on the leadership

00:32:32.154 --> 00:32:33.820
imbalance, that there's
some things that

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.450
could be done by getting more
women into those leadership

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:41.070
decision making positions,
such that those norms

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.040
and cultures can start to
shift from a much higher level.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.210
How do you think about the
right ways of going about that?

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.650
I know, Melissa, you're
working hard on this

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.275
in the film industry right now
with directors and producers.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.410
I know Aimee is also working in
a different vein in that way.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.790
So obviously that's one
particular industry,

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.219
but we see this
across government

00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:03.260
across corporate America.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.490
All the stats that
Oisika started this with.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.547
How does that play
into this conversation?

00:33:07.547 --> 00:33:09.130
MELISSA GOODMAN:
Sure, well I'll start

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:13.280
and try to be very brief about
it, because your question also

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.180
I think relates to
the last question,

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.870
and what we were all
saying about what

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:17.890
we're taught so early.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.190
So I have been recently,
relatively obsessed

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:23.350
about gender bias in
Hollywood, in particular

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.539
looking at women directors.

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:27.330
And a lot of people
sort of asked me, like,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.380
why is this something the
ACLU is paying attention to?

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.120
Why is this a civil
liberties problem?

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.020
And I think this
conversation is actually

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.650
the explanation of why.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:40.390
One, it's a huge leadership
position in Hollywood.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.260
But most importantly,
TV and film

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.560
are two of our most
important cultural products.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.120
And the fact that literally
women are essentially

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.840
excluded from directing big
budget studio feature films,

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.480
and are seriously
under-represented in directing

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.480
television, it's not just
a civil rights problem.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.870
Because you know,
note to Hollywood,

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.860
you do have to comply
with civil rights laws.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.820
You are not exempt, even though
the culture is otherwise.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.750
What we see on those screens has
a tremendous cultural impact.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.230
And that's one of
the reasons we're

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.130
devoting so much time
and energy to this,

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.420
because our biggest cultural
product is overwhelmingly

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.210
being made by men.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:29.960
The stories are male stories,
told from a male eye.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.649
Women are depicted
through a male eye.

00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:33.190
And I'm not saying,
you know, there's

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.289
not-- there's plenty of feminist
film and TV makers out there.

00:34:36.289 --> 00:34:37.830
But studies have
shown, when you have

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.909
more women behind
the camera, not

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.480
only are more women depicted,
but the way in which they're

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.370
depicted, and the reduction in
stereotypes, the more speaking

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.250
lines literally that women have.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.630
It's tremendously important.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.880
So a lot of people think
like, why are you doing that?

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.389
That's one of the reasons.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:57.580
So we look at industries where
women really are effectively

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.330
shut out from leadership.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.200
And I guess the last thing
I'd say about that, only

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.720
because I'd be remiss, because
I'm sitting in Google, most

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.010
of our very powerful industries
here in the United States

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.000
do have tremendous
gender bias problems.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.729
And tech is, as I'm sure many of
you know, you know one of them.

00:35:16.729 --> 00:35:18.645
And when you were saying
leadership positions,

00:35:18.645 --> 00:35:20.990
you know unfortunately, that
this stat I read recently

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.550
is only 9% of senior
management positions

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.050
in Silicon Valley
are held by women.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.660
And we have to start
examining the disconnect

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.700
between the equality that we
have at the educational stage.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.330
Women are generally in college
and even in graduate school,

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.089
you know, graduating
at equal rates.

00:35:37.089 --> 00:35:39.380
But somehow when you look at
those leadership positions

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.230
the numbers drop
dramatically and we

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.069
need to start working on that.

00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:44.610
OISIKA CHAKRABARTI:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.700
And UN Women also works
on this area of media,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.790
because there's
this huge challenge

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.734
as Melissa was saying.

00:35:51.734 --> 00:35:53.650
And we work in the news
rooms trying to expand

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.150
the dialogue on media.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.990
But speaking about
leadership as a whole,

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.590
I think the challenge
is here in the US.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.430
But it's also a challenge
across the world

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.990
where what's considered the
cohort of how many people

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.340
you need in Parliament to make
a move towards a different law

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.550
is 30%.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.630
And most countries haven't
got anywhere close.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:17.090
United States is 75th on that
scale, and it has about 20%,

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.492
whereas Rwanda has 67%.

00:36:20.492 --> 00:36:22.200
So Rwanda is one of
those countries which

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.630
came after the reconstruction
where women became leaders,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.560
because the men were
not there in government,

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.952
and politics, and everything.

00:36:29.952 --> 00:36:31.660
But I also want to
come back a little bit

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.580
to the last question about
choice and self identification

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.600
and empowerment.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.490
But what do you do when there
are no services to turn to?

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.232
Across the world, I might be
a domestic violence survivor.

00:36:42.232 --> 00:36:43.940
I might think this is
dangerous, and it's

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.660
dangerous for me and my
children to stay in this house,

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.110
but where do I go?

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.829
And I think that also comes
from what Aimee was saying

00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:54.120
earlier, how you're brought up.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.560
For a person like me, I
would know that I have a job,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.430
or I would know that I have
a father's household where

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.020
they would say just come back.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:02.730
He's abusive?

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.020
Come back, it's fine.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.539
But most people don't have
that luxury of choice.

00:37:06.539 --> 00:37:07.330
So what do they do?

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.690
They look for an NGO
or a shelter to go to,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.990
and there are none.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.080
So when there are
more women leaders,

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.090
they also look for
these kind of services.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.960
They try to move policy
towards having more shelters,

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.140
of having a place where domestic
violence survivors can go.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.950
So in India where
I'm from, there

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.660
is a whole democracy movement
happening at the grassroots

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.240
level.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.420
And the national parliament?

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.850
No, there are not many
women in politics,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.140
and we are a very
long way to go to get

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.160
to the 30% I was talking about.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.157
And the 30% is a benchmark that
was talked about 20 years back

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:40.240
at the Beijing conference.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.660
So that's what I was saying,
the progress is too slow.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.180
But at the grassroots level,
at the [INAUDIBLE] level.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.720
What we called the
Village Council.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:54.040
There is about a billion--
there is a huge movement where

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.861
women are becoming leaders.

00:37:55.861 --> 00:37:57.110
And what are they looking for?

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.270
They looking for
the water should

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.950
be close to the
household, so that women

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.741
don't have to walk for
hours trying to get water.

00:38:03.741 --> 00:38:05.990
They're looking for a primary
school in their village,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.720
so that little girls
and little boys

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.760
can go to school in
a sustained basis.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.270
Not just go one day and
then drop out the next day.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.270
So when women
become leaders they

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:17.310
are also looking for
societal change, and not

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.110
just cosmetic changes
many of the time.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.710
So we do need more
women in leadership

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.260
here in the STEM industry,
in politics, in government,

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:24.760
everywhere.

00:38:28.546 --> 00:38:30.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I think
we are close to the time

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.128
that we should be
wrapping this up,

00:38:32.128 --> 00:38:34.560
but we could obviously
keep this conversation

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.470
going for many hours.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.550
I think it would be great to get
some final thoughts from some

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.890
of you on what change
you think is actually

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.387
possible in our
lifetime on this issue.

00:38:45.387 --> 00:38:47.720
I think you've talked a little
bit about progress that's

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.120
been made, and sitting
here in Silicon Valley

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.800
we're always at the
nexus of the future.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.520
And thinking about what with
all of the energy that we have,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.290
and all of the leadership
roles that people have taken,

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.790
what change do we
really think could

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:03.998
be possible in this lifetime?

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.890
MELISSA GOODMAN: I feel like
everyone turned this way.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.880
Oh my goodness,
so much pressure!

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.700
I feel like I'm
talking too much.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.912
I'll just say I always sound
like a cynic on these panels,

00:39:17.912 --> 00:39:19.370
but I'm actually
truly an idealist.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.869
I wouldn't be able to kind of
wake up and do what I do every

00:39:21.869 --> 00:39:23.080
day if I wasn't.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.872
I really think, and
this is not necessarily

00:39:24.872 --> 00:39:26.329
just through suing
people, it's not

00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:27.540
the only thing the ACLU does.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.320
But I feel confident
that, and I'll only

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.720
speak from a US
perspective at the moment

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.420
because I don't feel
qualified to speak otherwise.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.869
I feel like we can
get-- I don't remember

00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:39.910
the time period you said.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.040
But I think some
of the changes we

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.730
need to make in the
workplace are attainable.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.560
We're not, in a
cultural way, going

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:54.320
to erase eons of the way
we view gender roles.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.130
We're not going to eliminate
unconscious bias tomorrow.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.900
But I think we can
make practical changes

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.040
in the workplace that neutralize
people's unconscious bias

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.770
in the way that
we conduct hiring.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.390
In the way that we evaluate
candidates for jobs.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.720
In the way that we structure
our workplaces to be,

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.480
not only more supportive of
working families, but moving

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.240
towards a culture,
as Google does

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:23.380
espouse of kind of treating
workers as whole people.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.150
That is something that is like
a radical, important gender

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.760
equality idea as well,
and very important.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.310
And I think if we seriously
devoted time to doing that,

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:38.780
and thought about things like
family needs, and pay equity,

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.105
and the needs that workers
have outside of work,

00:40:42.105 --> 00:40:43.480
I think we could
come a long way.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.160
ARLETTE NKURAYIJA:
To me, I think

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.850
removing limitations one by
one, because there's so many.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:41:01.860
And it's a matter of just
taking one at a time.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:10.940
When you asked me
the question before,

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.750
it was after everyone
spoke, thinking

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:22.150
about the labeling of people,
and how you see someone

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:27.900
and you just want to
define that person.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:34.580
And I was thinking
when also Aimee

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.610
was speaking about
when you see a girl,

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.070
and you want to say something.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:48.380
And most of the time it's
about beauty or physics traits.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:42:01.100
And then I remember when someone
that is very important to me

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:06.070
told me once, because you are
talking about liberating women,

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:10.680
and he said that
you are priceless.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:16.840
And to me it was
empowering, and I'm

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:25.390
sharing, because when I
heard that it wasn't about--

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:30.310
and then it resonate because
it's not about what we do,

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:36.870
how much we own, it's
just being ourselves.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.730
And when you are yourself,
you can go and ask that price

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:47.280
that you feel it's
fair or not, that to be

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:53.670
able to remove limitation, to
be able to see yourself, and be

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.380
true to yourself.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.110
I think it's the
way to go to start

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:05.615
changing the empowering
one person at a time.

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:10.310
OISIKA CHAKRABARTI:
I mean I think,

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.010
and not just because
I work at UN Women,

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.450
but I'm very optimistic
about change.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:18.034
I think the very fact that
we're having this discussion, ,

00:43:18.034 --> 00:43:20.450
I mean, decades back, gender
equality wasn't on the public

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.949
agenda.

00:43:20.949 --> 00:43:22.591
It wasn't in the private agenda.

00:43:22.591 --> 00:43:25.090
But now we're talking about it,
we are all talking about it.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:27.360
So I think that's
a huge change that

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.990
has happened over the years.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.050
And then the other
part of this movement,

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.160
a disorganized movement,
unconscious movement,

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.200
is that all of us
can be part of it.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.490
If 10 people from this room
went up to 10 people and say,

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.740
guess what I was at
Google and I was listening

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.780
to this talk about
gender equality--

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.090
I mean is it a question
mark, or should be a given?

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.340
Can we do it in our household?

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.430
And everybody can be
part of this movement.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.840
And those 10 people
talk to other people.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.840
So it's like little drops, but
that can create a whole change.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.140
I mean just changing
that conversation

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.550
can have a huge impact
for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:02.390
household, or in the
community, or society.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.320
But structurally also,
there are problems.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.780
And that can only change
when it laws change,

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:11.220
implementation happens, and
when also attitudinally,

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.410
people change their
attitudes and mindsets.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:17.530
For example it's 95 years
since women got the right

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:18.780
to vote in this country.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.640
Isn't it time for
a woman president?

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.050
It's a matter of
changing attitudes that

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.720
has to happen for
society to change,

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.900
but I think there's a
lot of cause for optimism

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.390
HALA KAZIM: Well,
for me, I always

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.820
believe you should be
an example of a change.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.240
And people could listen
to so many things,

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.240
and if they don't see
it, it's just talk.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:47.740
And I talk about it personally
from what I have done.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.930
I have changed so much
through so many years,

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:57.640
from a little girl in Dubai,
to a depressed, very depressed

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.070
woman, to a very
different journey

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:05.070
of self discovering,
and bringing Hala back,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:11.140
and then looking at things, and
changing what's inside of me.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:18.180
Now I think if every woman
talks from her heart,

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:23.400
and acts from her heart, we
are not fighting with men.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.760
We are not in a race with men.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.530
We are working with men.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.510
I can't live without a man.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.180
A man cannot live
without a woman.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:34.930
They are my sons.

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.070
I have my father,
I have brothers.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:44.200
So I wish we stop, like
you know, who takes more?

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.680
I have to take your
place, you have

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.550
to take-- I think there are
so many plenty of places

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:51.220
for all of us.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.780
And I think if
they see it in you,

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:59.300
if they see the change in you,
in your mind, in your behavior.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.280
And that's what I did in
Journey Through Change, telling

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.260
women: take care of yourself.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.300
Take care of your inner
self inside of you.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.990
Feel that you are worth it.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.590
You don't need to
prove to anybody.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.660
You know I always say it's so
good to have a man in my life,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.260
but that's a bonus.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.990
There are so many
things in life to do,

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.820
and yes, some people
say it's easy for me

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.300
to say because I have a husband,
and I have my sons, and all.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.550
But I worked for them.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.430
I worked to get that,
but even if I didn't, I

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:41.240
wish woman were raised to be
fulfilled, and a man to add

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.140
to it.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.570
And I think I will
repeat and repeat,

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.570
it all starts with action.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:52.380
If every woman
teaches herself first,

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:57.070
her children, her community, by
example, by spreading the word,

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.340
by awareness.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:03.610
I truly believe, because
I did it in my community.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:04.990
I did it.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.930
I get hundreds and
thousands of messages

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.450
from women saying, because
we see how you did it,

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.050
we are doing it.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:18.780
Because you are an example
of an action woman.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.300
That's why when they
gave me the question,

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.950
I said I don't want
to prepare, I just

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.880
want to talk from my heart,
because I really want

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.410
to show what's inside of me.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:37.700
And I think we are really, like
I'm talking about Arab women,

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.860
I've done more than
20 trips and I'm

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:47.110
done in this program for four
years, the most strongest women

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.530
I have ever seen.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.780
And I'm not just saying that
and I know people think,

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.110
oh we are indulged, and we
have a very comfortable life.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.780
Yes, we do.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.470
I mean we do, what can
I say, I don't want?

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:01.550
You can't say that.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:05.860
So if I have been given a
good life, I am grateful.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:10.800
But what I have seen
in my trips from women

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.220
that is living a very
comfortable life, to stay

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.720
in three stars or
bed and breakfast,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.390
and carrying their
own suitcases,

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:24.700
and walking 20 kilometer a
day, and come in Santiago.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:28.340
That's where it all started
it for me, in Spain.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.470
I think really,
really the change

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:36.740
it could be amazing for all
of us, for the new generation.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.280
I mean, who would've thought
that all these different women

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:44.240
from all over the countries
can meet, and say what

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.240
they can say, and exchange?

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.030
We will never have
a perfect life,

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.780
but we will do our best
to have a good life.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.140
AIMEE MULLINS: I
support and agree

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.570
with what all of these
incredible women have said.

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:07.215
I'm astounded by how much change
we can see in our lifetime.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.410
And just yesterday
flying here, the person

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.360
in front of me in the
aisle in front of me

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:23.840
was watching the most
recent "Mad Max" film, and I

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.072
was excited.

00:49:26.072 --> 00:49:28.530
And I didn't put my headphones
on, I didn't know the sound,

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:33.970
but I just watched for longer
than I thought I would.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:38.430
Charlize Theron being
the lead of the film,

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:42.050
with a prosthetic hand,
and absolutely carrying

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:51.640
an action movie, and absolutely
it being, I don't know.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.410
I just thought about, wow,
from "Terminator", "RoboCop",

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.490
to this.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:02.740
It's absolutely happening
in our lifetime,

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.570
and I'm sure we could
say this across the board

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:10.050
when it comes to identity
with transgendered persons.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:12.710
It's the rate at which
progress is happening,

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:15.590
and I think acceptance
and awareness, awareness

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:19.490
to acceptances is getting
faster and faster.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:24.910
But with regards to women's
empowerment and equality,

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:30.050
it'll happen a lot
faster with men also

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:33.800
make it their priority.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.335
I think men make
fantastic feminists.

00:50:40.389 --> 00:50:42.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Let's all thank
our panelists for being here.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:45.582
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:49.740
GARY CATONA: OK, now
the excitement begins.

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.470
Aubrey Logan is going to
sing our hit song, "My Voice

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:53.430
Matters".

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.050
And as I said before,
these charities will

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.510
receive the benefit
of your generosity,
