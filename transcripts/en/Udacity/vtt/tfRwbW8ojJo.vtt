00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.370
URL building is a helpful feature
in Flask to create URLs based on

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.870
the functions they execute.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.240
This is really helpful when you want
to create links to other pages inside

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.300
your application.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.440
To build a URL to a specific function,
we can use this url_for() method.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.760
This is one of the many helper functions
that Flask makes available to us.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.835
The documentation for

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.890
url_for() can be found on
the Flask documentation page here.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.520
I want you to open up
the menu.html template and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.780
add some new hyperlinks to edit and
delete each menu item.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.970
Remember that this URL for helper method
returns a complete URL stream, so

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.410
place it where it belongs
inside of an anchor tag.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.140
If your code works you should have edit
and delete links now on every menu item.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.000
Read through the documentation for
reference.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.080
Consult your fellow students
if you have any questions.
