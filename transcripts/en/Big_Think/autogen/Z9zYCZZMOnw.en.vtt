00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.760
I think the most exciting part of what I

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:08.770
I think the most exciting part of what I
 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.580
I think the most exciting part of what I
do right now is exactly the fact that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590
do right now is exactly the fact that
 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.940
do right now is exactly the fact that
what we are doing is giving patients new

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950
what we are doing is giving patients new
 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.310
what we are doing is giving patients new
hope that we're looking at a disease

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320
hope that we're looking at a disease
 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.650
hope that we're looking at a disease
which is brain cancer that people have

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660
which is brain cancer that people have
 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.980
which is brain cancer that people have
looked at for hundreds of years and we

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990
looked at for hundreds of years and we
 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.930
looked at for hundreds of years and we
have not been able to understand and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940
have not been able to understand and
 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.320
have not been able to understand and
we're finally perhaps beginning to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330
we're finally perhaps beginning to
 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.630
we're finally perhaps beginning to
scratch the surface we're beginning to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640
scratch the surface we're beginning to
 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.060
scratch the surface we're beginning to
look at an old asees with new eyes and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070
look at an old asees with new eyes and
 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.069
look at an old asees with new eyes and
what new eyes are those is the fact that

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079
what new eyes are those is the fact that
 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.099
what new eyes are those is the fact that
within brain cancer there may be a small

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109
within brain cancer there may be a small
 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.649
within brain cancer there may be a small
population of cells that have the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:40.659
population of cells that have the
 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.410
population of cells that have the
ability to recreate the same type of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420
ability to recreate the same type of
 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.470
ability to recreate the same type of
cancer which means that despite the fact

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480
cancer which means that despite the fact
 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.630
cancer which means that despite the fact
that we can actually do a perfect

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640
that we can actually do a perfect
 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.639
that we can actually do a perfect
surgical resection we can take a lot of

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649
surgical resection we can take a lot of
 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.250
surgical resection we can take a lot of
these tumor out these patients

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
these tumor out these patients
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.040
these tumor out these patients
eventually continue to progress perhaps

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
eventually continue to progress perhaps
 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.379
eventually continue to progress perhaps
because we're leaving those small little

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.389
because we're leaving those small little
 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.259
because we're leaving those small little
cells back there that are able to

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269
cells back there that are able to
 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.259
cells back there that are able to
recreate the whole tumor so our role now

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269
recreate the whole tumor so our role now
 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.390
recreate the whole tumor so our role now
is to understand those small cells we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400
is to understand those small cells we
 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.710
is to understand those small cells we
don't look we're not looking at the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720
don't look we're not looking at the
 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.840
don't look we're not looking at the
whole tissue that we're leaving behind

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
whole tissue that we're leaving behind
 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.850
whole tissue that we're leaving behind
but we're looking at a special subset of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860
but we're looking at a special subset of
 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.860
but we're looking at a special subset of
population of cells that we can

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870
population of cells that we can
 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.350
population of cells that we can
potentially affect that we can

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360
potentially affect that we can
 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.100
potentially affect that we can
potentially damage their ability to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110
potentially damage their ability to
 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.920
potentially damage their ability to
recreate that cancer and I think to me

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930
recreate that cancer and I think to me
 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.990
recreate that cancer and I think to me
that's absolutely dynamite because it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000
that's absolutely dynamite because it
 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.180
that's absolutely dynamite because it
may actually change the paradigm in the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190
may actually change the paradigm in the
 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.870
may actually change the paradigm in the
way that we treat brain cancer

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.730

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.210
in the future the way that I use in my

are categorized in brain cancer is in

are categorized in brain cancer is in
different categories and we lump all

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720
different categories and we lump all
 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.999
different categories and we lump all
patients together in different

patients together in different
 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.919

categories when in reality we are
 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.630
categories when in reality we are
beginning to understand that every

beginning to understand that every
 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.609
beginning to understand that every
patient is different just like we're all

tumors are probably the same way and no

one single treatment can be tailored for

many patients you probably going to

many patients you probably going to
individualize treatment and that excites

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
individualize treatment and that excites
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.059
individualize treatment and that excites

will we do in the operating room and in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620
will we do in the operating room and in
 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.590
will we do in the operating room and in
a laboratory is the fact that we're

a laboratory is the fact that we're

a laboratory is the fact that we're
probably open doors for other fields to

probably open doors for other fields to
 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.289
probably open doors for other fields to
conceive the way to unleash the
