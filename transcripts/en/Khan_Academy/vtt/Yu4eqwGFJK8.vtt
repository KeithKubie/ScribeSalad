00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.942
Construct a regular hexagon
inscribed inside the circle.

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:06.400
So what I'm going
to do, first, I'm

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.169
going to draw a
diameter of the circle.

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.210
And actually, I'm going
to go beyond the diameter

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.793
of the circle.

00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:12.730
I'm just going to
draw a line that

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.930
goes through the center of the
circle and just keeps on going.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.510
And I'm going to make it flat,
so it goes directly through,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.410
so this one right over
here, goes directly

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.621
through the center.

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:25.120
And now, what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.870
going to construct
a circle that's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.350
the exact same dimensions of
this circle that's already

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.950
been drawn.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.400
So let me put this
one right over here.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.952
And let me make it
the same dimensions.

00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:39.410
And now, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to move it over,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.970
so that this new
circle intersects

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.430
the center of the old circle.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.960
And these circles
are the same size.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.360
So notice, this center
intersects the old circle.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690
And the new circle
itself intersects

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.550
the center of the old circle.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.630
Now, the reason why
this is interesting,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.630
we already know that this
distance, the distance

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.740
between these two centers,
this is equal to a radius.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.989
We also know-- we have a
straight edge-- we also

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.200
know that this distance right
over here is equal to a radius.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.570
It's equal to the radius of
our new circle right over here.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.340
We also know that this
distance right over here

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.274
is equal to a radius
of our old circle.

00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:23.940
And that they both
have the same radius.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.460
So this is a radius
between these two points.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.310
Between these two
points is a radius.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.690
And then, in between these
two points is a radius.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.034
So now, I have constructed
an equilateral triangle.

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:36.200
And essentially, you have
to just do this six times.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.650
And then I'm going to
have a hexagon inscribed

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.400
inside the circle.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.910
Let me do it again.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.360
So we'll go from here to here.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.010
This is a radius of
my new circle, which

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.215
is the same as the
radius of the old circle.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.848
And I could go
from here to here.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.306
That's the radius
of my old circle.

00:01:57.306 --> 00:01:58.930
So I have another
equilateral triangle.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.932
Radius, radius, radius.

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:02.140
Another equilateral triangle.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.430
I've just got to do this, I
have to do this four more times.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.461
So let me go to my original.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.169
Let's see, let me make
sure I can-- well,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.418
it's actually going to be
hard for me to-- let me just

00:02:11.418 --> 00:02:14.750
add another circle here,
to do it on the other side.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.300
So if I put the
center of it right-- I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.470
want to move it a
little bit, right over--

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.480
I want to make it the same size.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.310
So oh, that's close enough.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.820
And let's see, that
looks pretty close.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.010
That's the same size.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.450
Now, let me move it over here.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.350
Now, I want this center to be
on the circle, right like that.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.815
And now, I'm ready to draw some
more equilateral triangles.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.370
And really, I don't have to
even draw the inside of it.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.900
Now, I see my six
vertices for my hexagon,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.760
here, here, here,
here, here, here.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.980
And I think you're satisfied
now that you could break this up

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.320
into six equilateral triangles.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.740
So let's do that.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.670
So this would be the base of one
of those equilateral triangles.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.890
And actually, let me move these.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.810
Let me move this
one out of the way.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.610
I can move this one
right over here.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.930
Because I really just care
about the hexagon itself.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.887
And I can move this
right over here.

00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:20.220
But we know that these are
all the lengths of the radius

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.230
anyway.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.650
Actually, I'm not even having
to change the length there.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.590
Then, I have to just connect
one more right down here.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.010
So let me add another straight
edge, connect those two points.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.230
And I would have done it.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.930
I would have constructed my
regular hexagon inscribed

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.750
in the circle.
