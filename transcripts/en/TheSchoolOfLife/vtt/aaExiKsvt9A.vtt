00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.420
What's the point of travel?

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.020
It's to help make us into better people.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.120
It's a sort of therapy.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.940
Without anything mystical being meant by this,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.060
all of us are, in one way or another, on what could be termed "an inner journey."

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.320
That is, we're trying to develop in particular ways.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.840
In a nutshell, the point of travel

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.920
is to go to places that can help us in our inner evolution.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.540
The outer journey should assist us

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.680
with the inner one.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.840
Every location in the world

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.180
contains qualities that can support

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.120
some kind of beneficial change inside a person.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.620
Take these 200 million year old stones in America's Utah Desert.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.260
It's a place, but looked at psychologically.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.640
It's also an inner destination,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.180
a place with perspective,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.700
free of preoccupation with the petty and the small-minded.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.260
Somewhere imbued with calm and resilience.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
Religions used to take travel much more seriously than we do now.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040
For them, it was a therapeutic activity.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.340
In the Middle Ages,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.060
when there was something wrong with you,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.980
you were meant to head out for a pilgrimage

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.320
to commune with relics

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440
of a saint or a member of the holy family.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.100
If you had toothache,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.620
you'd go to Rome, to the Basilica of San Lorenzo

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.740
and touch the arm bones of Saint Appolonia, the patron saint of teeth.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.360
If you were unhappily married,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.560
you might go to Umbria

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.880
to touch the shrine of Saint Rita of Cascia,  patron saint of marital problems.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880
Or, if you were worried about lightning,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.920
you were sent to Bad MÃ¼nstereifel in Germany

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.820
to touch the skull of Saint Donatus,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820
believed to offer help against fires and explosions.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.440
We no longer believe in the divine power of journeys

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.200
but certain parts of the world still have a power to change and mend the wounded parts of us.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.900
In an ideal world,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.140
travel agencies would be manned by a new kind of psychotherapist.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.960
They'd take care not just of the flights and the hotels,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.660
they'd start by finding out what was wrong with us

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.800
and how we might want to change.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.900
The anxious might be sent to see the majestic, immemorial waves crashing into the cliffs on the west coast of Ireland.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.100
People a bit too concerned with being admired and famous

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.080
might be sent to contemplate the ruins of Detroit.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.420
Someone out of touch with their body

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.800
might be recommended a trip to Porto Seguro in Bahia in Brazil.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.700
Nowadays, too often,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.360
we head off without fully knowing what's wrong with us

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.600
or precisely understanding how our chosen destinations meant to help us.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.100
We should become more conscious travellers

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.840
on a well articulated search for qualities that places possess,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.680
like calm or perspective,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.940
sensuality or rigor.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.480
We should follow old-fashioned pilgrims

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.500
in striving to evolve our characters

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.140
according to the suggestions offered up by the places we've been to.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.700
We need to relearn how to be ambitious about travel,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.820
seeing it as a way

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.540
of helping us to grow into better versions of ourselves.
