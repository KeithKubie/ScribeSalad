10 Comic Book Characters That Need Their Own
Movies ASAP

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.350
Comic book movies are incredibly popular right
now and some of the most iconic characters

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.660
in Marvel and DC history have been given the
Hollywood treatment.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.580
Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Hulk, Iron Man,
Captain America and Thor are just some of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.180
the characters to have starred in their own
movies, while the likes of Wonder Woman, Doctor

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.350
Strange, the Flash and Black Panther will
be following suit soon.But there are still

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.630
countless characters - both heroes and villains
- who haven't yet been considered for a solo

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.390
movie outing that definitely deserve one.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.931
It seems a shame that the Man of Steel, the
Dark Knight, the Webbed Wonder and the Green

00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:41.430
Goliath have been given multiple opportunities
while other equally deserving characters miss

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.460
out completely.With that in mind, here are
ten comic book characters that deserve their

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.780
own movies ASAP.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.620
Black Widow
If there's one existing comic book movie character

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.490
who hasn't had their own movie yet, but who
definitely deserves one, it has to be Black

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.490
Widow.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.450
Scarlett Johansson has portrayed the character
brilliantly since 2010's Iron Man 2 and has

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.930
subsequently appeared in four more movies
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.280
Natasha Romanoff has such an interesting history,
but it's only briefly been touched upon in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
the movies.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.210
A solo movie would give audiences the opportunity
to see more of it, while getting more kick-ass

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.440
Black Widow action - something nobody would
complain about (especially not the guys).

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.850
The Joker
As far as comic book characters go, there's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.049
really nobody more interesting than the Joker.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.150
He's undoubtedly the most popular villain
in comic book history and he always garners

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.900
a lot of interest when he's portrayed in a
movie - so why not give him one of his own?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.570
The likes of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger
have already played the character, and Jared

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.891
Leto is set to do so in Suicide Squad, but
a movie that focuses solely on him as the

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.410
lead character could potentially be exceptional.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.549
A detailed look into his twisted mind and
what drives him to torment Batman would really

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.600
immerse fans.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.720
And seeing him put his intricate but totally
crazy plots together is always a real treat.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.090
If Leto proves popular as the Clown Prince
of Gotham, DC and Warner Brothers should definitely

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.280
consider making him the lead in a future movie.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.070
Doctor Fate
DC movies are yet to truly delve in to the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.070
world of magic.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.259
And although Suicide Squad will introduce
the Enchantress to the DCEU, she is hardly

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.690
a flagship character.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.890
Doctor Fate is exactly that - he's the biggest
magical gun in the DC universe - and it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.170
a shame he hasn't been considered for a movie
to date.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.739
With his Marvel counterpart Doctor Strange
getting a movie of his own, it's only right

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.400
that the character who wears the powerful
Helmet of Nabu gets one too - whether it be

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.840
the Kent Nelson version, the Hector Hall version,
or otherwise.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.680
It would surely be a visual treat - just like
the Doctor Strange movie looks like being

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.209
- and Fate would definitely be a welcome addition
to the live action Justice League.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.819
Namor the Sub-Mariner
Namor the Sub-Mariner is a classic Marvel

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.840
character who has been around for as long
as the company itself.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.760
If anyone deserves a movie of his own, it's
Namor - and it's unforgivable that he hasn't

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.760
been given one yet.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.810
Of course, he was hinted at back in Iron Man
2, when a S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.120
map appeared to show his home kingdom of Atlantis,
but the Easter egg hasn't been followed up.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.650
However, now that his DC counterpart Aquaman
is getting his own movie, Marvel Studios should

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.650
undoubtedly follow suit.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.560
He's interesting because he's incredibly powerful
and his moral alignment is unclear.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.069
A movie with him as the star would undoubtedly
be unique and well worth a watch.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.350
Martian Manhunter
The Martian Manhunter, J'onn J'onzz, has long

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.409
been a key member of the Justice League in
the comic books - but it would appear that

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.650
he is missing from the DC live action movie
universe, which is a complete travesty.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.300
He's an awesome character who absolutely deserves
a movie of his own - just like Superman, Batman,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.470
Wonder Woman, the Flash and Cyborg are getting
in the DCEU.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.519
The character's backstory differs from timeline
to timeline in the comics, but he is always

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.049
from Mars, always has the physical attributes
to match Superman, can always shapeshift,

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.440
always has telepathic powers and can always
phase through objects.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.409
He's incredibly interesting and it would be
truly great to see him given a solo movie.

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.000
Doctor Doom
As far as Marvel supervillains go, there are

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.060
none more versatile and interesting than Doctor
Doom - and he definitely deserves his own

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.060
movie.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.670
Fox Studios have adapted the character twice
on film already - as Fantastic Four movie

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.720
villains in each instance - but both adaptations
were awful, and Julian McMahon and Toby Kebbell

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.840
have a lot to answer for as a result.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.260
Setting a movie in Doom's fictional home country
of Latveria and following his evil exploits

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.390
as he tried to take over the world would make
fantastic viewing.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.950
He's an iconic comic book character who is
a scientific genius, a mystical expert and

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.900
a very underrated physical threat, and a movie
focusing on a faithful adaptation of the character

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.260
would be most welcome.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.550
She-Hulk
The comic book movie world is desperately

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.710
lacking in female-led movies - especially
female-led movies starring extremely powerful

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.520
characters - so a She-Hulk solo movie would
be a fantastic idea for Marvel Studios to

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.520
produce.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.220
She-Hulk is Jennifer Walters - cousin of Bruce
Banner - who developed similar powers to the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.960
Hulk when Banner provided his blood for her
for a transfusion after she was shot.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.180
It would be seriously cool to see a muscular
green female character displaying the kind

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.020
of strength we've seen from Hulk so often
on the big screen.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.970
That's really all the reasoning needed to
make such a movie a reality.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.370
Nova
If Guardians of the Galaxy proved one thing,

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.310
it's that Marvel Studios can nail movies based
on space-based heroes - so a Nova movie would

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.710
surely be fantastic.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.550
The Nova Corps were already introduced in
the aforementioned Guardians of the Galaxy

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.470
movie, but seeing their most famous human
member - Richard Rider - starring in his own

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.500
movie would be great.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.150
Such a movie has long been rumoured, but it
has yet to either be produced or scheduled.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.120
The likes of Nathan Fillion have been linked
to the titular role, but it would be a brilliant

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.340
space-epic no matter who took it on.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.110
Think DC's Green Lantern movie, but if it
was actually in capable hands.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.050
A truly exciting prospect.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.490
Lobo
2016's Deadpool movie was absolutely fantastic

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.960
- and the closest thing DC could do to replicate
the tone is produce a movie based on Lobo.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.080
The space mercenary and bounty hunter is also
known as The Ultimate Bastich, The Main Man

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.280
and The 'Bo Master Frag - all because of his
bad-ass attitude and huge personality.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.590
A Lobo solo outing would be gory, funny and
irreverant - just like Deadpool - and he would

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.039
be an awesome addition to DC's live action
line-up.

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.890
The best thing about this is that it's rumoured
to be in the pipeline.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.750
Can you imagine The Scourge o' the Cosmos
going toe-to-toe with Henry Cavill's Superman

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.210
or Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman?

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.449
It would be incredible!

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.919
Harley Quinn
Why should superheroes get all the glory?

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.020
This year's Suicide Squad will see a supervillain
team headlining a comic book movie for the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.100
first time ever, but supervillain solo movies
don't really happen - and that's a crying

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.100
shame.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.389
Early reactions from screenings of the Suicide
Squad movie suggest that Margot Robbie's Harley

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:16.919
Quinn is the standout star.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.889
If that's really the case, she should definitely
be given a movie of her own.

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.270
She's a quirky, fun, sexy and interesting
character with a fantastic ongoing comic,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.360
so there's definitely an audience for her,
and Margot Robbie's star has never shone brighter.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.660
A movie that looks into her origins - in which
she was driven insane by the Joker, but also

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.050
became his lover and accomplice - would be
awesome.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.590
