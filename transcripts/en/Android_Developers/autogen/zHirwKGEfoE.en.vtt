we just launched some some quality

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
we just launched some some quality
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.590
we just launched some some quality
guidelines on how to make a high quality

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
guidelines on how to make a high quality
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.320
guidelines on how to make a high quality
tablet application and for me having an

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330
tablet application and for me having an
 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.320
tablet application and for me having an
application which scales well on the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
application which scales well on the
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.540
application which scales well on the
huge variety of devices that is the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550
huge variety of devices that is the

Android landscape is you know a big big

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
Android landscape is you know a big big
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.070
Android landscape is you know a big big
part of that quality so I think this is

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
part of that quality so I think this is
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.650
part of that quality so I think this is
a really important topic and one quick

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
a really important topic and one quick
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.449
a really important topic and one quick
thing I wanted to mention was I really

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459
thing I wanted to mention was I really
 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.400
thing I wanted to mention was I really
believe if you sort of think about these

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
believe if you sort of think about these
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.229
believe if you sort of think about these
these are responsive web design or

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
these are responsive web design or
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.660
these are responsive web design or
responsive Android development from the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
responsive Android development from the
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.910
responsive Android development from the
beginning of your development cycle when

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920
beginning of your development cycle when
 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.410
beginning of your development cycle when
building Android apps it can help you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420
building Android apps it can help you
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.039
building Android apps it can help you

practices we do have several training
sessions on developer.android.com on how

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820
sessions on developer.android.com on how
 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.240
sessions on developer.android.com on how
to actually implement these concepts but

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250
to actually implement these concepts but
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.729
to actually implement these concepts but
we will do is we will look into existing

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
we will do is we will look into existing
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.800
we will do is we will look into existing
apps that are out there and see how they

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
apps that are out there and see how they
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.650
apps that are out there and see how they
treat or how they implement these

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660
treat or how they implement these
 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.569
treat or how they implement these
responsive designs how they kind of

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579
responsive designs how they kind of
 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.849
responsive designs how they kind of
scale fluidly across the different

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859
scale fluidly across the different
 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.170
scale fluidly across the different
device types so let's jump in first

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
device types so let's jump in first
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.259
device types so let's jump in first
we're going to take a look at calendar

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269
we're going to take a look at calendar
 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.940
we're going to take a look at calendar
so this is the built-in calendar

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950
so this is the built-in calendar
 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.580
so this is the built-in calendar
application that comes with many devices

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590
application that comes with many devices
 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.009
application that comes with many devices
like the Galaxy Nexus the Nexus 7 the

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019
like the Galaxy Nexus the Nexus 7 the
 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.460
like the Galaxy Nexus the Nexus 7 the
Motorola Xoom and this is an example of

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470
Motorola Xoom and this is an example of
 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.800
Motorola Xoom and this is an example of
the of the screen that lets you create a

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
the of the screen that lets you create a
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.289
the of the screen that lets you create a
new calendar entry so on the phone here

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299
new calendar entry so on the phone here
 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.180
new calendar entry so on the phone here
you see that and I'm gonna go she's zoom

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190
you see that and I'm gonna go she's zoom
 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.430
you see that and I'm gonna go she's zoom
in for a second on the phone you see

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440
in for a second on the phone you see
 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.710
in for a second on the phone you see
that you know you have kind of a done

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720
that you know you have kind of a done
 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.900
that you know you have kind of a done
cancel bar at the top which is basically

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
cancel bar at the top which is basically
 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.129
cancel bar at the top which is basically
replacing the action bar

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139
replacing the action bar
 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.809
replacing the action bar
and you know the different entry fields

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:18.819
and you know the different entry fields
 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.659
and you know the different entry fields
like the calendar event title the the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669
like the calendar event title the the
 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.420
like the calendar event title the the
date time things like that pretty

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
date time things like that pretty
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.760
date time things like that pretty
typical stuff and then on the Nexus 7

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
typical stuff and then on the Nexus 7
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.830
typical stuff and then on the Nexus 7
you'll see that it's switched over into

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840
you'll see that it's switched over into
 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.439
you'll see that it's switched over into
a kind of like a multi-column layout

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449

application is that how hollow really
 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.210
application is that how hollow really
really helps out this up to scale across

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220
really helps out this up to scale across

we zoom in here so you can see on the

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230
we zoom in here so you can see on the
 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.290
we zoom in here so you can see on the
phone you've got some white space on the

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300
phone you've got some white space on the
 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.730
phone you've got some white space on the
left and right and then if you go up to

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740
left and right and then if you go up to
 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.710
left and right and then if you go up to
the Nexus 7 you'll see there's a

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720
the Nexus 7 you'll see there's a
 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.020
the Nexus 7 you'll see there's a
slightly more white space and then if

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030
slightly more white space and then if
 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.050
slightly more white space and then if
you go across to the landscape zoom

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060
you go across to the landscape zoom
 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.360
you go across to the landscape zoom
you'll see they've actually got more

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370
you'll see they've actually got more
 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.040
you'll see they've actually got more
white space here that sort of makes it

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050
white space here that sort of makes it
 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.800
white space here that sort of makes it
makes everything you know fill out fill

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810
makes everything you know fill out fill
 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.290
makes everything you know fill out fill
out the larger screen size there it's

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300
out the larger screen size there it's
 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.969
out the larger screen size there it's
important to know that when you're you

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979
important to know that when you're you
 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:13.950
important to know that when you're you
know creating or defining these margins

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960
know creating or defining these margins
 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.080
know creating or defining these margins
that you still stick to a grid and as

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090
that you still stick to a grid and as
 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.120
that you still stick to a grid and as
you can see in our design guide under

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130
you can see in our design guide under
 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.700
you can see in our design guide under
the metrics and grids section we have

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710
the metrics and grids section we have
 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.520
the metrics and grids section we have
this concept of a 16 Dib grid and a 48dp

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530
this concept of a 16 Dib grid and a 48dp
 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.490
this concept of a 16 Dib grid and a 48dp
rhythm so you know using increments of

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.500
rhythm so you know using increments of
 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.700
rhythm so you know using increments of
16 dips so like you know 32 dip or 48 or

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710
16 dips so like you know 32 dip or 48 or
 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.520
16 dips so like you know 32 dip or 48 or
64 that can kind of still introduce

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530
64 that can kind of still introduce
 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.870
64 that can kind of still introduce
structure into your layouts without kind

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880
structure into your layouts without kind
 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.850
structure into your layouts without kind
of constraining you to just using you

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:38.860
of constraining you to just using you
 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.940
of constraining you to just using you
know very small margins so so 32 dips 48

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:41.950
know very small margins so so 32 dips 48
 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.040
know very small margins so so 32 dips 48
dips that's great kind of to use for

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.050
dips that's great kind of to use for
 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.760
dips that's great kind of to use for
larger devices such as tablets yeah so a

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.770
larger devices such as tablets yeah so a
 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.159
larger devices such as tablets yeah so a
naive implementation that this kind of

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:50.169
naive implementation that this kind of
 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.750
naive implementation that this kind of
screen might have just stretched the

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:51.760
screen might have just stretched the
 

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.219
screen might have just stretched the
input fields all the way across which

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:53.229
input fields all the way across which
 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:54.450
input fields all the way across which
would look pretty ungainly on the

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.460
would look pretty ungainly on the
 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.100
would look pretty ungainly on the
10-inch so I think it's you know

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.110
10-inch so I think it's you know
 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.540
10-inch so I think it's you know
approaching your screen design when

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.550
approaching your screen design when
 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.070
approaching your screen design when
you're when you're designing app and if

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080
you're when you're designing app and if
 

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.300
you're when you're designing app and if
you see something which is like fill

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310
you see something which is like fill
 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.390
you see something which is like fill

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400
parent and thinking about hey how that's
 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.310

going to is that going to look on a much

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320
going to is that going to look on a much
 

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.779
going to is that going to look on a much

introducing these margin points yeah all

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080
introducing these margin points yeah all
 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.810

right so let's move on to the next app

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:15.820
right so let's move on to the next app
 

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.490
right so let's move on to the next app
so this will be the first third-party

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:17.500
so this will be the first third-party
 

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.070
so this will be the first third-party
app that we look at and this is pattern

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080
app that we look at and this is pattern
 

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.510

searches so it's kind of one tap away

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.410
searches so it's kind of one tap away
 

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.930

rather than having to tap into the

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940
rather than having to tap into the
 

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.370
rather than having to tap into the
search field and then get shown the

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380
search field and then get shown the
 

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.720
search field and then get shown the
recent history it might prompt you to

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:35.730
recent history it might prompt you to
 

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.220
recent history it might prompt you to
click on a recent search which is really

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.230
click on a recent search which is really
 

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.160
click on a recent search which is really
great and the other thing if you look at

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.170
great and the other thing if you look at
 

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.660
great and the other thing if you look at
the difference between say the phone and

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:41.670
the difference between say the phone and
 

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.829
the difference between say the phone and
the seven-inch tablet is they've

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839
the seven-inch tablet is they've
 

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:45.470
the seven-inch tablet is they've
actually hinted the text size and

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480
actually hinted the text size and
 

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.750
actually hinted the text size and
padding's to be slightly larger to just

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760
padding's to be slightly larger to just
 

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.250
padding's to be slightly larger to just
feel more comfortable at that certain

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260
feel more comfortable at that certain
 

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.880
feel more comfortable at that certain
size and and then the second sorry it

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:52.890
size and and then the second sorry it
 

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.800
size and and then the second sorry it
looks like on a tablet they have just a

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:54.810
looks like on a tablet they have just a
 

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.810
looks like on a tablet they have just a
slightly wider margin I don't know if

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820
slightly wider margin I don't know if
 

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.300
slightly wider margin I don't know if
it's an increment of 16 dips like we

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310
it's an increment of 16 dips like we
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.170
it's an increment of 16 dips like we
talked about but it's definitely

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:00.180
talked about but it's definitely
 

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.180
talked about but it's definitely
noticeably larger to the left and to the

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.190
noticeably larger to the left and to the
 

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.970
noticeably larger to the left and to the
right of the patterns yeah and then just

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980
right of the patterns yeah and then just
 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.350
right of the patterns yeah and then just
lastly I can say when you step up from

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360
lastly I can say when you step up from
 

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.910
lastly I can say when you step up from
the 7 to the 10-inch and have even more

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920
the 7 to the 10-inch and have even more
 

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.370
the 7 to the 10-inch and have even more
space available they break out into this

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380
space available they break out into this
 

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.810
space available they break out into this
kind of grid view where they show you

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820
kind of grid view where they show you
 

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.150
kind of grid view where they show you
more more potential wallpapers on screen

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160
more more potential wallpapers on screen
 

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.060
more more potential wallpapers on screen
at once so it's kind of reimagining the

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.070
at once so it's kind of reimagining the
 

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.950
at once so it's kind of reimagining the
the content like show it a

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:18.960
the content like show it a
 

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.600
the content like show it a
representation of the contents it's the

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:20.610
representation of the contents it's the
 

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.829
representation of the contents it's the
same content but laid out in a

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839
same content but laid out in a
 

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:23.300
same content but laid out in a
completely different way to just make

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.310
completely different way to just make
 

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.050
completely different way to just make
much better use of the space yeah I

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060
much better use of the space yeah I
 

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.390
much better use of the space yeah I
think I just want to comment one on one

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:29.400
think I just want to comment one on one

missed opportunity and this is very

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:31.530
missed opportunity and this is very
 

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.740
missed opportunity and this is very
minor but if you look at the handsets

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:33.750
minor but if you look at the handsets
 

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.329
minor but if you look at the handsets
version in landscape we don't have a

00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339
version in landscape we don't have a
 

00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:37.910
version in landscape we don't have a
screen shot here but they also Lucas

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920
screen shot here but they also Lucas
 

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.130
screen shot here but they also Lucas
also uses a single column for the

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.140
also uses a single column for the
 

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.870
also uses a single column for the
patterns so since he's already got

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880
patterns so since he's already got
 

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.519
patterns so since he's already got
multi-column implemented it seems like

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:43.529
multi-column implemented it seems like
 

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:45.500
multi-column implemented it seems like
it would be fairly trivial to switch

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:45.510
it would be fairly trivial to switch
 

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.710
it would be fairly trivial to switch
that over to a

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720
that over to a
 

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.780
that over to a

two-column like a two-column layout in
 

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.410
two-column like a two-column layout in
landscape that might work really well

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420
landscape that might work really well
 

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.910
landscape that might work really well

just one question I haven't actually
 

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.900
just one question I haven't actually
used this app that much but what's under

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:00.910
used this app that much but what's under
 

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.690

one so so I guess it's just interesting

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.390
one so so I guess it's just interesting
 

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.730
one so so I guess it's just interesting
to note how they definitely change the

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:17.740
to note how they definitely change the
 

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.920
to note how they definitely change the
structure just a little bit on the

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:19.930
structure just a little bit on the
 

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.170
structure just a little bit on the
handset version just so they can fit it

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.180
handset version just so they can fit it
 

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.910

look nice yeah okay let's move on so you
 

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.750
look nice yeah okay let's move on so you
should do a time check okay so the next

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760
should do a time check okay so the next
 

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.170
should do a time check okay so the next
app is pocket and pocket is actually I

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.180
app is pocket and pocket is actually I

it up to a seven inch tablet they have a

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680
it up to a seven inch tablet they have a
 

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.890
it up to a seven inch tablet they have a
two column grid and if you turn it over

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:13.900
two column grid and if you turn it over
 

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.360
two column grid and if you turn it over
into landscape you'll see that there's a

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.370
into landscape you'll see that there's a
 

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.340
into landscape you'll see that there's a
three column grid and you'll notice that

three column grid and you'll notice that
 

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.440
three column grid and you'll notice that
it's it's completely different but it's

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:19.450
it's it's completely different but it's
 

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.510
it's it's completely different but it's
the same content right it's more like a

tile view rather than a simple you know
 

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.900
tile view rather than a simple you know
horizontal linear layout and then if you

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:27.910
horizontal linear layout and then if you
 

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.220
horizontal linear layout and then if you
look at the 10 inch tablet they

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:29.230
look at the 10 inch tablet they
 

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.800

larger than on the seven inch tablet and
 

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.540
larger than on the seven inch tablet and
then the fact that they have basically

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:56.550
then the fact that they have basically
 

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.600
then the fact that they have basically
implemented this layout three times you

00:12:59.600 --> 00:12:59.610
implemented this layout three times you
 

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.670
implemented this layout three times you
know once is a list another is a grid

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680

of the things I should know is they may

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:13.649
of the things I should know is they may
 

00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:14.900
of the things I should know is they may
have cheated a little bit they may be

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:14.910
have cheated a little bit they may be

know it's perfectly awesome the only
issues that there's you know some minor

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:24.089
issues that there's you know some minor
 

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:25.790
issues that there's you know some minor
performance penalties well maybe not

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800
performance penalties well maybe not
 

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.230
performance penalties well maybe not
minor but there are some performance

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240
minor but there are some performance
 

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.930
minor but there are some performance
penalties involved but overall it looks

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940
penalties involved but overall it looks
 

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.800
penalties involved but overall it looks
just just wonderful yeah so that's a

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:33.810
just just wonderful yeah so that's a
 

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.480
just just wonderful yeah so that's a
nutshell the other thing I wanted to

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:35.490
nutshell the other thing I wanted to
 

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.100
nutshell the other thing I wanted to
mention is that they kept the action bar

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.110
mention is that they kept the action bar
 

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.810
mention is that they kept the action bar
the same and this is you know totally

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820
the same and this is you know totally
 

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.970
the same and this is you know totally
fine it's you don't necessarily have to

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980
fine it's you don't necessarily have to
 

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.949
fine it's you don't necessarily have to
you know switch the action bar and make

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959
you know switch the action bar and make
 

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.810
you know switch the action bar and make
it taller make things wider the

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.820
it taller make things wider the
 

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.400
it taller make things wider the
framework actually does all of those

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.410
framework actually does all of those
 

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.850
framework actually does all of those
things for you it'll you know make your

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:48.860
things for you it'll you know make your
 

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.740
things for you it'll you know make your
icons slightly wider the action bar

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:51.750
icons slightly wider the action bar
 

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.360
icons slightly wider the action bar
slightly taller I'm so it'll do all

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.370
slightly taller I'm so it'll do all
 

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.740
slightly taller I'm so it'll do all
those things for you in this case I

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:54.750
those things for you in this case I
 

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.480
those things for you in this case I
think that they've probably implemented

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:56.490
think that they've probably implemented
 

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.680
think that they've probably implemented
a custom action bar so it's not

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:57.690
a custom action bar so it's not
 

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.170
a custom action bar so it's not
happening there but note that the action

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180
happening there but note that the action
 

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.880
happening there but note that the action
bar is pretty much the same across

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:01.890
bar is pretty much the same across
 

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.370
bar is pretty much the same across
tablet and phone in terms of a behavior

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380
tablet and phone in terms of a behavior
 

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.569
tablet and phone in terms of a behavior
in rough proportions I think one of my

00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579
in rough proportions I think one of my
 

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:10.040
in rough proportions I think one of my
favorite things they've done on here as

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.050
favorite things they've done on here as
 

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:10.340
favorite things they've done on here as
well

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.350
well
 

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.500
well
sorry it's a you can see on the phone

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:12.510
sorry it's a you can see on the phone
 

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.910
sorry it's a you can see on the phone
and tablet they've prioritized that

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920
and tablet they've prioritized that
 

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.130
and tablet they've prioritized that
search bring it out right at the top of

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:16.140
search bring it out right at the top of
 

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.380
search bring it out right at the top of
the content view so you can search and

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:18.390
the content view so you can search and
 

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.990
the content view so you can search and
filter whereas on the tablet they have

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000
filter whereas on the tablet they have
 

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.510
filter whereas on the tablet they have
kind of demoted that so less important I

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:23.520
kind of demoted that so less important I
 

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.370
kind of demoted that so less important I
think it's under the the action overflow

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380
think it's under the the action overflow
 

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.350
think it's under the the action overflow
there which I think is really

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360
there which I think is really
 

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.210
there which I think is really
interesting I think it's it's it's

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220
interesting I think it's it's it's
 

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.680
interesting I think it's it's it's
showing that they fought about how

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:30.690
showing that they fought about how
 

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.819
showing that they fought about how
someone's going to use this application

00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:31.829
someone's going to use this application
 

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.470
someone's going to use this application
slightly differently on a tablet that

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480
slightly differently on a tablet that
 

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.150
slightly differently on a tablet that
there's you know they have the same

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160
there's you know they have the same
 

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.620
there's you know they have the same
content available but it's a different

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:36.630
content available but it's a different
 

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.060
content available but it's a different
representation they're kind of a super

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.070
representation they're kind of a super
 

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.730
representation they're kind of a super
like designing for a different use case

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740
like designing for a different use case
 

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.199
like designing for a different use case
where someone might have more time and

00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:42.209
where someone might have more time and
 

00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:44.000
where someone might have more time and
might have being more of an explorative

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.010
might have being more of an explorative
 

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.760
might have being more of an explorative

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:47.770
mode yeah
 

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.100
mode yeah
any comments yes okay so let's move on

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.110
any comments yes okay so let's move on
 

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:54.210

about that Adam yeah so the Ted app
 

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.199
about that Adam yeah so the Ted app
hopefully some of you are familiar with

00:14:58.199 --> 00:14:58.209
hopefully some of you are familiar with
 

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:00.600
hopefully some of you are familiar with
with the Ted Ted app and all the great

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:00.610
with the Ted Ted app and all the great

content video talks that they have so I

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:04.360
content video talks that they have so I
 

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.329
content video talks that they have so I
like this example just because it's

00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:06.339
like this example just because it's
 

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:08.579
like this example just because it's
fairly simple like you know you don't

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:08.589
fairly simple like you know you don't
 

00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:10.560
fairly simple like you know you don't
have to do anything crazy complicated in

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:10.570
have to do anything crazy complicated in
 

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.970
have to do anything crazy complicated in
order to support different form factors

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:11.980
order to support different form factors
 

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.470
order to support different form factors
and have it look nice and feel nice

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480
and have it look nice and feel nice
 

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.540
and have it look nice and feel nice
still so if you look at the three

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:15.550
still so if you look at the three
 

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.769
still so if you look at the three
different form factors that were posted

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:16.779
different form factors that were posted
 

00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:18.990
different form factors that were posted
up here you've got the the handset in

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000
up here you've got the the handset in
 

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.660
up here you've got the the handset in
portrait mode where they have this sort

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:21.670
portrait mode where they have this sort
 

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.280
portrait mode where they have this sort
of big thumbnail at the top and then

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.290
of big thumbnail at the top and then
 

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.350
of big thumbnail at the top and then
three sub tabs down the bottom to show

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360
three sub tabs down the bottom to show
 

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.120
three sub tabs down the bottom to show
the sort of different views related to

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.130
the sort of different views related to
 

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.500
the sort of different views related to
that video and then you move to Nexus 7

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.510
that video and then you move to Nexus 7
 

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.150
that video and then you move to Nexus 7
which looks fairly similar they've added

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160
which looks fairly similar they've added
 

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.610
which looks fairly similar they've added
some extra whitespace um let's just zoom

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:35.620
some extra whitespace um let's just zoom
 

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.800
some extra whitespace um let's just zoom
in here a little bit they've added some

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:37.810
in here a little bit they've added some
 

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.710
in here a little bit they've added some
extra whitespace are notably around the

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720
extra whitespace are notably around the
 

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.010
extra whitespace are notably around the
tabs as well which is interesting but

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:44.020
tabs as well which is interesting but
 

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.660
tabs as well which is interesting but
otherwise it's it's fairly similar extra

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:45.670
otherwise it's it's fairly similar extra
 

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.139
otherwise it's it's fairly similar extra
rights I slightly bumped up font size

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:48.149
rights I slightly bumped up font size
 

00:15:48.149 --> 00:15:51.030
rights I slightly bumped up font size
and then if you move to the landscape

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040
and then if you move to the landscape
 

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.280
and then if you move to the landscape
10-inch let me zoom across here you'll

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.290
10-inch let me zoom across here you'll
 

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.900
10-inch let me zoom across here you'll
notice that they've moved from the sort

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:57.910
notice that they've moved from the sort
 

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.290
notice that they've moved from the sort
of stacked stacked layout of their

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:01.300
of stacked stacked layout of their
 

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.620
of stacked stacked layout of their
fragments to two being side by side but

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:04.630
fragments to two being side by side but
 

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.810
fragments to two being side by side but
essentially it's the same fragments you

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:06.820
essentially it's the same fragments you
 

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.400
essentially it's the same fragments you
know you can clearly tell their views

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:08.410
know you can clearly tell their views
 

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.190
know you can clearly tell their views
reuse the same fragments there one

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:11.200
reuse the same fragments there one
 

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.810
reuse the same fragments there one
interesting thing for the sort of video

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:12.820
interesting thing for the sort of video
 

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.460
interesting thing for the sort of video
thumbnail here is they've moved the

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:14.470
thumbnail here is they've moved the
 

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.920
thumbnail here is they've moved the
title from being a sort of transparent

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:16.930
title from being a sort of transparent

overload overlay to beneath the actual
 

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.660
overload overlay to beneath the actual
video because there's more room and they

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:21.670
video because there's more room and they
 

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.920
video because there's more room and they
can really bring out the sort of nice

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:22.930
can really bring out the sort of nice
 

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.990
can really bring out the sort of nice
video thumbnails and allocating a little

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000
video thumbnails and allocating a little
 

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.110
video thumbnails and allocating a little
bit more space for that guys you have

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120
bit more space for that guys you have
 

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.910
bit more space for that guys you have
any comments I just wanted to mention

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920
any comments I just wanted to mention
 

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.329
any comments I just wanted to mention
one thing about the overall I guess the

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:33.339
one thing about the overall I guess the
 

00:16:33.339 --> 00:16:35.160
one thing about the overall I guess the
overall structure of the screen it

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.170
overall structure of the screen it
 

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.920
overall structure of the screen it
reminds me of the YouTube YouTube

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:37.930
reminds me of the YouTube YouTube
 

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.769
reminds me of the YouTube YouTube
playback screen on Android and I think

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:40.779
playback screen on Android and I think
 

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:42.449
playback screen on Android and I think
that's actually a good thing I think

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:42.459
that's actually a good thing I think
 

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:44.430
that's actually a good thing I think
that users you know when they buy their

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440
that users you know when they buy their
 

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.170
that users you know when they buy their
Android device they pop open YouTube

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.180
Android device they pop open YouTube
 

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.340
Android device they pop open YouTube
they instantly become familiar we

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:48.350
they instantly become familiar we
 

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.140
they instantly become familiar we
is you know how it behaves and I'm

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.150
is you know how it behaves and I'm
 

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.360
is you know how it behaves and I'm
guessing if you rotate into landscape it

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:52.370
guessing if you rotate into landscape it
 

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.730
guessing if you rotate into landscape it
starts you know at full screens they're

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:54.740
starts you know at full screens they're
 

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.800
starts you know at full screens they're
very familiar with how it behaves you

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:56.810
very familiar with how it behaves you
 

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.260
very familiar with how it behaves you
know the the kind of the tab structure

00:16:59.260 --> 00:16:59.270
know the the kind of the tab structure
 

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.780
know the the kind of the tab structure
at the bottom on the phone that lets you

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:01.790
at the bottom on the phone that lets you
 

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.760
at the bottom on the phone that lets you
switch between the different pieces of

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:03.770
switch between the different pieces of
 

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.190
switch between the different pieces of
detail information about the video and

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:06.200
detail information about the video and
 

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.950
detail information about the video and
then in in tablet they basically do

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:08.960
then in in tablet they basically do
 

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.480
then in in tablet they basically do
something again very similar to YouTube

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:10.490
something again very similar to YouTube
 

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.490
something again very similar to YouTube
they pop that over to the right and this

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:12.500
they pop that over to the right and this
 

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.430
they pop that over to the right and this
is almost like a natural you know way to

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:15.440
is almost like a natural you know way to
 

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.160
is almost like a natural you know way to
you know take up the new amount or to do

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:18.170
you know take up the new amount or to do
 

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.960
you know take up the new amount or to do
something with the new space that you

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:19.970
something with the new space that you
 

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.000
something with the new space that you
have but I think that just like that

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.010
have but I think that just like that
 

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.310
have but I think that just like that
added extra bit of similarity to the

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:24.320
added extra bit of similarity to the
 

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.410
added extra bit of similarity to the
YouTube app makes it instantly familiar

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:26.420
YouTube app makes it instantly familiar
 

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.560
YouTube app makes it instantly familiar
to users Nick anything else before we

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:29.570
to users Nick anything else before we
 

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.390
to users Nick anything else before we
move on actually they've done a great

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400
move on actually they've done a great
 

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.220
move on actually they've done a great
job of playing with the spacing as well

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:33.230
job of playing with the spacing as well
 

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.410
job of playing with the spacing as well
I think you could see that they

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:35.420
I think you could see that they
 

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.730
I think you could see that they
definitely hinted the spacing when you

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:36.740
definitely hinted the spacing when you
 

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.410
definitely hinted the spacing when you
go from phone up to seven-inch to make

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.420
go from phone up to seven-inch to make
 

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.520
go from phone up to seven-inch to make
it just feel that much more comfortable

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:39.530
it just feel that much more comfortable
 

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.310
it just feel that much more comfortable
on that size device so it's the kind of

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320
on that size device so it's the kind of
 

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.450
on that size device so it's the kind of
thing where you might have just tried

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:43.460
thing where you might have just tried
 

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.160
thing where you might have just tried
the phone layout one on the 7-inch

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.170
the phone layout one on the 7-inch
 

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.630
the phone layout one on the 7-inch
device and for hey that's good enough

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640
device and for hey that's good enough
 

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.800
device and for hey that's good enough
but they've actually gone the extra mile

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:47.810
but they've actually gone the extra mile
 

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.350
but they've actually gone the extra mile
to say actually it feels a little bit

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360
to say actually it feels a little bit
 

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.060
to say actually it feels a little bit
cramped or would benefit from a little

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.070
cramped or would benefit from a little
 

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.740
cramped or would benefit from a little
bit more spacing here so they've gone

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:53.750
bit more spacing here so they've gone
 

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.240
bit more spacing here so they've gone
the extra mile to really optimize this

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.250
the extra mile to really optimize this
 

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.410
the extra mile to really optimize this
for these for the different device sizes

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:56.420
for these for the different device sizes
 

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.110
for these for the different device sizes
which is great yeah it's worth noting as

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120
which is great yeah it's worth noting as
 

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.160
which is great yeah it's worth noting as
well that they don't they don't have a

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.170
well that they don't they don't have a
 

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.630
well that they don't they don't have a
landscape layout for this particular

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640
landscape layout for this particular
 

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.570
landscape layout for this particular
screen on handset devices actually I'm

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:04.580
screen on handset devices actually I'm
 

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.250
screen on handset devices actually I'm
not sure if they if they support if they

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:06.260
not sure if they if they support if they
 

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.750
not sure if they if they support if they
if they actually have landscape for any

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760
if they actually have landscape for any
 

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.210
if they actually have landscape for any
of this their screens on handset but for

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.220
of this their screens on handset but for
 

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.920
of this their screens on handset but for
a video app especially for video details

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:11.930
a video app especially for video details
 

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.150
a video app especially for video details
screen like this I think that's that's

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:13.160
screen like this I think that's that's
 

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.670
screen like this I think that's that's
ok sometimes um you know because people

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:15.680
ok sometimes um you know because people
 

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.200
ok sometimes um you know because people
should expect that when they rotate the

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.210
should expect that when they rotate the
 

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.820
should expect that when they rotate the
the video will be playing full screens

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:18.830
the video will be playing full screens
 

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.110
the video will be playing full screens
that um there's not really enough room

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120
that um there's not really enough room
 

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.190
that um there's not really enough room
to do much else there yeah sorry that's

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200
to do much else there yeah sorry that's
 

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.770
to do much else there yeah sorry that's
Ted okay so let's move on to I believe

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:26.780
Ted okay so let's move on to I believe
 

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.140
Ted okay so let's move on to I believe
the last step so we're kind of cheating

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:29.150
the last step so we're kind of cheating
 

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.090
the last step so we're kind of cheating
here because this is an app that we all

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:31.100
here because this is an app that we all
 

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.450
here because this is an app that we all
worked on this is the Google i/o 2012

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:34.460
worked on this is the Google i/o 2012
 

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.150
worked on this is the Google i/o 2012
application so basically this app if you

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:37.160
application so basically this app if you
 

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.700
application so basically this app if you
attended the conference it lets you you

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:39.710
attended the conference it lets you you
 

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.190
attended the conference it lets you you
know see what what sessions are playing

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200
know see what what sessions are playing
 

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.600
know see what what sessions are playing
lets you create a schedule a

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:43.610
lets you create a schedule a
 

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.550
lets you create a schedule a
personalized schedule it also syncs

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:45.560
personalized schedule it also syncs
 

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.960
personalized schedule it also syncs
across your different devices which

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:46.970
across your different devices which
 

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.240
across your different devices which
again is very important for a multi

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.250
again is very important for a multi
 

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.700
again is very important for a multi
device

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:49.710
device
 

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.010
device
you know user that has multiple devices

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020
you know user that has multiple devices
 

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.850
you know user that has multiple devices
having a seamless sync across those so

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860
having a seamless sync across those so
 

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.130
having a seamless sync across those so
what we've done here is basically you

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140
what we've done here is basically you
 

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.480
what we've done here is basically you
know on phone there's there isn't that

00:18:59.480 --> 00:18:59.490
know on phone there's there isn't that
 

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.330
know on phone there's there isn't that
much horizontal space so we have three

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340
much horizontal space so we have three
 

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.019
much horizontal space so we have three
tabs for the different core pieces of

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:06.029
tabs for the different core pieces of
 

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.789
tabs for the different core pieces of
functionality that's a kind of the

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799
functionality that's a kind of the
 

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:09.470
functionality that's a kind of the
interaction side where you interact with

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480
interaction side where you interact with
 

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.510
interaction side where you interact with
other people on Google+ they're also

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520
other people on Google+ they're also
 

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.630
other people on Google+ they're also
telling the conference the my schedule

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640
telling the conference the my schedule
 

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.190
telling the conference the my schedule
or my agenda area and then the

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200
or my agenda area and then the
 

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.080
or my agenda area and then the
exploration phase where you can look at

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.090
exploration phase where you can look at
 

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.909
exploration phase where you can look at
the map or you know take a look at

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919
the map or you know take a look at
 

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:23.630
the map or you know take a look at
individual tracks so the interesting

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640
individual tracks so the interesting
 

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.799
individual tracks so the interesting
thing that we've done here is we've

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:24.809
thing that we've done here is we've
 

00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:27.310
thing that we've done here is we've
split it up from tabs to multiple panes

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320
split it up from tabs to multiple panes
 

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.250
split it up from tabs to multiple panes
across tablets so in portrait actually

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260
across tablets so in portrait actually
 

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.139
across tablets so in portrait actually
both of these devices 7-inch and 10-inch

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:33.149
both of these devices 7-inch and 10-inch
 

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:36.019
both of these devices 7-inch and 10-inch
device in portrait they would show this

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:36.029
device in portrait they would show this
 

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:38.600
device in portrait they would show this
kind of three column or two column

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:38.610
kind of three column or two column
 

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.279
kind of three column or two column
layout where two of the panes are

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:40.289
layout where two of the panes are
 

00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:42.560
layout where two of the panes are
stacked in one column and then a

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:42.570
stacked in one column and then a
 

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.820
stacked in one column and then a
landscape they switch to a wider three

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:46.830
landscape they switch to a wider three
 

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.490
landscape they switch to a wider three
column layout one of the key differences

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500
column layout one of the key differences
 

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.909
column layout one of the key differences
between the 7-inch and 10-inch layouts

00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919
between the 7-inch and 10-inch layouts
 

00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:55.070
between the 7-inch and 10-inch layouts
here is that the margins here on a

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080
here is that the margins here on a
 

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.159
here is that the margins here on a
7-inch are 16 dip and here on a on a

00:19:58.159 --> 00:19:58.169
7-inch are 16 dip and here on a on a
 

00:19:58.169 --> 00:20:00.680
7-inch are 16 dip and here on a on a
tablet that's 10 inches they're 32 dip

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:00.690
tablet that's 10 inches they're 32 dip
 

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.330
tablet that's 10 inches they're 32 dip
and that actually gives a little bit

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340
and that actually gives a little bit
 

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.090
and that actually gives a little bit
more breathing room for the for the

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100
more breathing room for the for the
 

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.730
more breathing room for the for the
content on this 10-inch device you'll

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740
content on this 10-inch device you'll
 

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.960
content on this 10-inch device you'll
notice this on the next screen as well

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:08.970
notice this on the next screen as well
 

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.090
notice this on the next screen as well
once we get to it that this kind of adds

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100
once we get to it that this kind of adds
 

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.330
once we get to it that this kind of adds
a sense of you know spacing and the

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340
a sense of you know spacing and the
 

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.190
a sense of you know spacing and the
separation of the two pieces of content

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200
separation of the two pieces of content
 

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.990
separation of the two pieces of content
or the in here the three different

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000
or the in here the three different
 

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.330
or the in here the three different
pieces of content any thoughts guys

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:22.340
pieces of content any thoughts guys
 

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.549
pieces of content any thoughts guys

thing I forgot to mention is that you

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.030
thing I forgot to mention is that you
 

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.700
thing I forgot to mention is that you
can't see this in the screenshot but

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:34.710

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.060
can't see this in the screenshot but
these tabs on phone as you swipe across

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.070
these tabs on phone as you swipe across
 

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.250
these tabs on phone as you swipe across
them there's actually a sixteen dip

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260
them there's actually a sixteen dip
 

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.040
them there's actually a sixteen dip
divider that has it's actually just

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.050
divider that has it's actually just
 

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.200
divider that has it's actually just
empty space that divider is the same

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.210
empty space that divider is the same
 

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.740
empty space that divider is the same
gray background as is on the tablets so

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:48.750
gray background as is on the tablets so
 

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.230
gray background as is on the tablets so
like in this area so if you have

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240
like in this area so if you have
 

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.940
like in this area so if you have
multiple devices there's a subtle hint

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:52.950
multiple devices there's a subtle hint
 

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.890
multiple devices there's a subtle hint
that these are actually you know part of

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900
that these are actually you know part of
 

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.100
that these are actually you know part of
the same screen so as you slide on a

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.110
the same screen so as you slide on a
 

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.870
the same screen so as you slide on a
phone like I said you see that grey

00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880
phone like I said you see that grey
 

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.250
phone like I said you see that grey

background giving you that again that
 

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.419
background giving you that again that
sense of separation yeah one last thing

00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:04.429
sense of separation yeah one last thing
 

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.710
sense of separation yeah one last thing
one one thing I really like personally

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720
one one thing I really like personally
 

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.260
one one thing I really like personally
is on the tablet layout the sort of

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:09.270
is on the tablet layout the sort of
 

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.180
is on the tablet layout the sort of
alignment of the headings of each of the

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:11.190
alignment of the headings of each of the
 

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.650
alignment of the headings of each of the
different fragments it just it just

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660
different fragments it just it just
 

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.840
different fragments it just it just
makes the app feel really nice and Ezra

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:14.850
makes the app feel really nice and Ezra
 

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.430
makes the app feel really nice and Ezra
was saying it's got the sort of padding

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440
was saying it's got the sort of padding
 

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.010
was saying it's got the sort of padding
the equal padding there between the

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020
the equal padding there between the
 

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.660
the equal padding there between the
different sections here and also the

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:20.670
different sections here and also the
 

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.700
different sections here and also the
little ticker which came from what it's

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:22.710
little ticker which came from what it's
 

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.580
little ticker which came from what it's
called the what's what's agnya that but

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:25.590
called the what's what's agnya that but
 

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.710
called the what's what's agnya that but
what sun fragment it's just sort of the

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720
what sun fragment it's just sort of the
 

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.870
what sun fragment it's just sort of the
alignment there looks really nice makes

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880
alignment there looks really nice makes
 

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.580
alignment there looks really nice makes
everything look really consistent and

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:31.590
everything look really consistent and
 

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.010
everything look really consistent and
one thing that we haven't done here is

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020
one thing that we haven't done here is
 

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.930
one thing that we haven't done here is
user Roboto thin or Roboto light which

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940
user Roboto thin or Roboto light which
 

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.049
user Roboto thin or Roboto light which
we probably should have so in case you

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059
we probably should have so in case you
 

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:40.669
we probably should have so in case you
want to you know make the titles stand

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679
want to you know make the titles stand
 

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:42.230
want to you know make the titles stand
out even more get even more attention

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240
out even more get even more attention
 

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.400
out even more get even more attention
and I'm not convinced that it's

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.410
and I'm not convinced that it's
 

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.860
and I'm not convinced that it's
necessary here but it could use a large

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:45.870
necessary here but it could use a large
 

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.020
necessary here but it could use a large
point size and Roboto thin to kind of

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.030
point size and Roboto thin to kind of
 

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.580
point size and Roboto thin to kind of
give an elegant header at each of these

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:49.590
give an elegant header at each of these
 

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.750
give an elegant header at each of these
panes okay so let's move on to the the

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760
panes okay so let's move on to the the
 

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.020
panes okay so let's move on to the the
second screen in this app and this is

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:57.030
second screen in this app and this is
 

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.780
second screen in this app and this is
basically the the session detail screen

00:21:59.780 --> 00:21:59.790
basically the the session detail screen
 

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.049
basically the the session detail screen
so once I get into a specific session

00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059
so once I get into a specific session
 

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:06.350
so once I get into a specific session
like in this case the session that Chris

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360
like in this case the session that Chris
 

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.510
like in this case the session that Chris

multi-pane layouts is kind of the very

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:48.730
multi-pane layouts is kind of the very
 

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:53.490
multi-pane layouts is kind of the very
common master detail layout that's used

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:53.500
common master detail layout that's used

in almost all of our system apps you'll

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:56.350
in almost all of our system apps you'll
 

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.530
in almost all of our system apps you'll
notice that in portrait the it's not

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:58.540
notice that in portrait the it's not
 

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.730
notice that in portrait the it's not
really visible here we kind of need

00:22:59.730 --> 00:22:59.740
really visible here we kind of need
 

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.900

it's it's kind of a sliding screen so

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.030
it's it's kind of a sliding screen so
 

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.120
it's it's kind of a sliding screen so
that left pane collapses once you start

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:09.130
that left pane collapses once you start
 

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.880
that left pane collapses once you start
interacting with the right detailed pane

in 10-inch tablets on landscape we have
 

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.410
in 10-inch tablets on landscape we have
all that space available so we don't

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:22.420
all that space available so we don't
 

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.300
all that space available so we don't
need that kind of that collapsing

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.310
need that kind of that collapsing
 

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:29.190
need that kind of that collapsing

thoughts guys and other things we should
 

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.870
thoughts guys and other things we should
point out now I already like the

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880
point out now I already like the
 

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.640
point out now I already like the
treatment on the 7-inch here where it's

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:35.650
treatment on the 7-inch here where it's
 

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.190
treatment on the 7-inch here where it's
not quite wide enough to you know have

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200
not quite wide enough to you know have
 

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.840
not quite wide enough to you know have
the same displays you have on the 10

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:39.850
the same displays you have on the 10

the same displays you have on the 10
inch to have all that information

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:40.680
inch to have all that information
 

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.960
inch to have all that information
permanently on-screen so it's a nice

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:42.970
permanently on-screen so it's a nice
 

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.820
permanently on-screen so it's a nice

there's this sort of concept of links

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:02.680
there's this sort of concept of links
 

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.770
there's this sort of concept of links
related to a particular session so these

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:04.780
related to a particular session so these
 

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.360
related to a particular session so these
are so dynamic links related to a

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:06.370
are so dynamic links related to a
 

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.460

one of the natural points here is is

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:29.230
one of the natural points here is is
 

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.620
one of the natural points here is is
really just about texts text length and

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:31.630
really just about texts text length and
 

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.330
really just about texts text length and
whitespace right you really want to

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:33.340
whitespace right you really want to
 

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.330
whitespace right you really want to
optimize for you know to minimize large

along one of the edges of the screen or
the corners and then like I said about

00:24:46.409 --> 00:24:46.419
the corners and then like I said about
 

00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:48.149
the corners and then like I said about
the line lengths you want to really

00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159
the line lengths you want to really
 

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:50.249
the line lengths you want to really
optimize around you know a certain

that's one of the optimization points is

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:13.779
that's one of the optimization points is
 

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:15.299
that's one of the optimization points is
to make sure that the text itself is

00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:15.309
to make sure that the text itself is
 

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:17.009
