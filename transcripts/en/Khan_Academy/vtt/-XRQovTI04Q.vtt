00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.970
I made a claim that for
this sequence-- and this

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.980
was in a previous video--
that for this sequence

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.060
right over here that can
be defined explicitly

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.530
in this way, that the
limit of the sequence--

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.390
and so I can write this as
negative 1 to the n plus 1

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.400
over n.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.580
That's one way of defining
our sequence explicitly--

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.060
the limit of this as
n approaches infinity

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.020
is equal to 0.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.060
And it seems that way.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.764
As n gets larger and
larger and larger,

00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:30.055
even though the numerator
oscillates between negative 1

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:32.060
and 1, it seems like
it will get smaller

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.060
and smaller and smaller.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.434
But I didn't prove
it, and that's

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.180
what I want to do in this video.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.310
In order to prove it, this is
going to be true if and only

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.190
if for any epsilon
greater than 0,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.190
there is a capital
M greater than 0

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.140
such that if lowercase n, if our
index is greater than capital

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.820
M, then the nth
term in our sequence

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.600
is going to be within epsilon of
our limit, within epsilon of 0.

00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:17.220
So what does that say?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.650
That says, hey, give
me-- our limit is 0.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.900
Let me do this in a new color.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.940
So our limit right
over here is 0.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.220
That's our limit.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.090
So our limit right
over here is--

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.050
we're saying the sequence
is converging to 0.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.210
What we're saying is, give
us an epsilon around 0.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.330
So let's say that this right
over here is 0 plus epsilon.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.770
That is 0 plus epsilon.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.620
The way I've drawn it here
looks like epsilon would be 0.5.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.240
This would be 0 minus epsilon.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.880
Let me make it a
little bit neater.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.800
So this would be
zero minus epsilon.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.440
So this is negative epsilon, 0
minus epsilon, 0 plus epsilon.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.840
Our limit in this case, or
our claim of a limit, is 0.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.450
Now, this is saying
for any epsilon,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.780
we need to find an M such
that if n is greater than M,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.486
the distance between our
sequence and our limit

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:04.860
is going to be
less than epsilon.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.330
So if the distance between
our sequence and our limit

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.780
is less than epsilon,
that means that the value

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.800
of our sequence for
a given n is going

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.450
to be within these two bounds.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.970
It's got to be in this
range right over here

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.510
that I'm shading
above a certain n.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.640
So if I pick an n
right over here,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.370
it looks like anything
larger than that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.070
is going to be the case that
we're going to be within those

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.780
bounds.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.830
But how do we prove it?

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.960
Well, let's just
think about what

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.440
needs to happen for
this to be true.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.220
So what needs to be happen
for a sub n minus 0,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.530
the absolute value
of a sub n minus 0,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.710
what needs to be true for
this to be less than epsilon?

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.580
Well, this is
another way of saying

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.180
that the absolute value of a sub
n has to be less than epsilon.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.080
And a sub n is just this
business right here,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.510
so it's another way of saying
that the absolute value

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.180
of negative 1 to
the n plus 1 over n

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.590
has to be less than epsilon,
which is another way of saying,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.020
because this negative
1 to the n plus 1,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.310
this numerator just swaps
us between a negative

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.322
and a positive
version of 1 over n.

00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:14.030
But if you take the
absolute value of it,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.550
this is always just
going to be positive.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.250
So this is the same
thing as 1 over n,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.570
as the absolute value of 1 over
n has to be less than epsilon.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.400
Now, n is always
going to be positive.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.860
n starts at 1 and
goes to infinity.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.250
So this value is always
going to be positive.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.510
So this is saying the
same thing that 1 over n

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.380
has to be less than epsilon
in order for this stuff

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.840
to be true.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.327
And now we can take the
reciprocal of both sides.

00:03:40.327 --> 00:03:42.910
And if you take the reciprocal
of both sides of an inequality,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.310
you would have that
n-- if you take

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.640
the reciprocal of both
sides of an inequality,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.260
you swap the inequality.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.870
So for this to be true, n has to
be greater than 1 over epsilon.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.780
And we essentially
have proven it now.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.880
So now we've said, look, for
this particular sequence,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.950
you give me any
epsilon, and I'm going

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.030
to set M to be 1 over epsilon.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:22.760
Because if n is greater than
M, which is 1 over epsilon,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.880
then we know that this right
over here is going to be true.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.680
That is going to be true.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.380
So the limit does
definitely exist.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.810
And so over here, for
this particular epsilon,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.200
it looks like we've picked
0.5 or 1/2 as our epsilon.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.250
So as long as n is greater
than 1 over 1/2, which is 2,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.630
so in this case we could
say, look, you gave me 1/2.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.464
My M is going to be a
function of epsilon.

00:04:48.464 --> 00:04:50.630
It's going to be defined
for any epsilon you give me

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.030
greater than 0.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.530
So here, 1 over 1/2
is right over here.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.170
I'm going to make my
M right over here.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.290
And you see it is
indeed the case

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.600
that my sequence
is within the range

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.240
as we passed for any
n greater than 2.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.970
So for n is equal to
3 it's in the range.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.553
For n is equal to 4
it's in the range.

00:05:08.553 --> 00:05:10.620
For n equals 5-- and it
keeps going and going.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.370
And we're not just
taking our word for it.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.410
We've proven it right over here.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.710
So we've made the proof.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.510
You give me any
other any epsilon,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.000
I said M is equal to
1 over that thing.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.080
And so for n greater than
that, this is going to be true.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.990
So this is definitely the case.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.220
This sequence converges to 0.
