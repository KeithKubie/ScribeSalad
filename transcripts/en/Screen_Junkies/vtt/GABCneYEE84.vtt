00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.269
Somewhere between the awful Suicide Squad, and the excellent Wonder Woman, a new DC movie

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.059
will get it sorta down the middle, but when the best comic book characters EVER unite for a film that's just okay...

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.760
YOU BLEW IT. AGAIN.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.490
AHH

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.480
How does this keep happening???

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.520
In the midst of a production beset by tragedy,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.200
Warner Brothers bravely forged ahead so executives could keep their bonuses.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.380
Mixing Zack Snyder's trademark gloom with the optimism of Joss Whedon,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.640
and the priorities of Brett Ratner's production company.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.640
"Oof, you're gorgeous"

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.040
that results in its own signature blend, of orange.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.160
Lots and lots of orange.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.600
Man, I wish they'd release the Snyder cut.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.700
Also, man, I wish the Snyder cut wasn't a made-up fanboy pipe dream.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.399
Witness a film that looks like it's being rendered right before your eyes,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.040
where this CGI villain steals these CGI boxes from their CGI hiding places

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.800
Uniting these CGI heroes in a big CGI fight on a CGI

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.000
battlefield until this CGI hero merges with this CGI box while this CGI villain gets punched in the mouth

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.740
by the hero with a mouth made out of CGI.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.820
"Yes, ma'am"

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.400
Ughh

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420
That just looks... wrong.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.100
Meet the Justice League: a bunch of sad losers

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.140
"I wanna be left alone"

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.540
- "If you stay up here brooding..."
- "I'm processing"

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.840
"You know I wouldn't count on the tribes of men."

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.280
"I need... friends."

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.260
Who occasionally make jokes now.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.120
"Dostoyevsky!"

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.960
There's Wonder Woman, the three-dimensional hero turned into girl hung up on her ex.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.520
"I lost someone I loved"

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.140
"I once knew a man who would have loved to fly it"

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.280
"When it's your fault, they're all Steve Trevor."

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.900
Broseidon, King of the Brocean.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.800
"My man!"

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.227
Cyborg, who's... there?

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:00.120
"Booyah."

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.900
Spider-Man, who in this movie goes by The Flash.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.400
Superman, eh, agh, uh

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.160
God, mouth is so distracting!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
Poor Henry Cavill worked out for months for this role,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.780
but all I can look at his weird fake baby mouth.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.800
They really couldn't just shave his mustache? Or grow a beard?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.480
Or, you know, delay the movie?

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.580
And of course the Batman.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.180
He may not be that tough,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.080
Or that smart.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.140
"So your genius move is dying?"

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.440
Or that careful with his secret identity.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.640
"Just like a Bat"

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.060
"You're outta your mind, Bruce Wayne!"

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.800
"Bruce Wayne"

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.160
"You're The Batman?"

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.420
"That's the Bat-signal! That's your... oh shit, sorry. That's your signal"

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.700
But, wait, there's no but?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.900
That's a shame. He was the best part of the last one.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.180
Prepare for the arrival of Steppenwolf,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.320
DC's scariest horn-helmeted minor God villain with the giant bladed weapon since the movie

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.100
right before this one. He's got a generic look, a generic motivation,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.580
"He lived only to conquer"

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.640
And super generic dialogue.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.500
"Find the last one!"

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.720
"Its power will cleanse this world"

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.660
"You're all too weak to (some generic villain talk)"

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.800
"I am, the end of worlds!!"

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.040
But no characters since Buster Bluth has ever been this much of a mother lover.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.240
"Mother"

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.420
"I know, mother"

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.240
"Praise to the mother"

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.120
"I see, mother"

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.340
- "What the hell is that?"
- "These are my awards, mother"

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.320
"From army"

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.960
How was it possible they ripped off EVERYTHING from the Avengers EXCEPT the good villain?

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.160
Come on, Joss. It's not stealing if you do it from yourself.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.580
After all the intricate plotting of Batman v Superman,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.020
check out a sequel that says:

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.580
Whoops, never mind.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.600
Pretending Batman knew Clark Kent for more than 15 minutes,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.960
"Our team needs Clark"

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.740
"pretending the world didn't hate Superman before he died, "

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.960
"So much bitterness,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.080
of course I think it's all because he's gone."

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.000
and pretending that bizarre Flash nightmare sequence never happened.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.980
"TOO SOON, you have to find us!!!"

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.240
I mean, that was clearly meant for when this movie was gonna be a two-parter, right?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.860
So where the Avengers felt like the end of the beginning for the MCU,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.280
Experience DC's big team up movie that, just kind of feels like the end.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.520
Where they emptied out their easter egg cupboard,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.920
united all their biggest superheroes,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.520
and tried everything they could to make it look like they still cared.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.109
- "You know you can't do this forever."
- "I can barely do it now."

00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:24.020
It's a shame, too.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.600
They were just starting to take some real steps toward heroism.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.920
"Save one."

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.060
"One?"

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.240
"Save one person."

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.680
Okay, baby steps.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.880
"We might not have thought this through."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.440
"I know, mother"

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.180
"Care for a glass of (insert beverage brand here)?"

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040
Aquaman consumed by water,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.380
Cyborg as a human in a letterman jacket,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.060
the "I didn't think you were real" scene,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.620
- "Didn't think you were real."
- "I'm real when it's useful."

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.740
Cyborg fighting a tank and talking to a cop,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.000
"You should probably move"

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.600
Flash fighting a parademon,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.440
Cyborg is a human playing football,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.020
the original blue color palette end sequence,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.000
Bruce looking at holographic Superman,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.620
Barry breaking glass,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.700
Alfred talking to a mysterious visitor,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.980
"You said you'd come."

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.540
and Lois and Clark discussing their engagement.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.140
"I'll take that as a yes"

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.820
"What?"

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.840
So, uhhh,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.580
Why does everyone in this movie have super smelling?

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.540
"Fear, I could smell it."

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.640
"The demons must have caught the scent of the Mother Box"

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.380
"His scent is on you"

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.060
"You, could smell a story"

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.080
"Recognize that smell?"

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.480
"You smell good"

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.660
"Did I not before?"
