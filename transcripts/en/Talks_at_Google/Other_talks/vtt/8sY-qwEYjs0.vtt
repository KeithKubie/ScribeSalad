00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.280
My name is Alana Weiss.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.210
And today, it is my pleasure
to welcome Robert Steven

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.109
Kaplan to the Leading
at Google series.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.850
Rob is the Martin Marshall
Professor of Management

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.180
Practice at the Harvard
Business School.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.890
And prior to joining HBS, Rob
served as vice-chairman of the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.170
Goldman Sachs Group.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
In 2011, he joined us to speak
about his last book, "What to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.140
Ask the Person in the Mirror."
And today, he will speak to us

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.790
about his recently published
book, "What You're Really

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.460
Meant to Do, a Road Map for
Reaching Your Unique

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.210
Potential." Please join
me in welcoming Rob.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.694
Thank you.

00:00:34.694 --> 00:00:37.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:39.050
Thanks, Alana.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.780
You hear me all right?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.020
I guess you can hear
me all right.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.360
OK.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.630
So thanks for having me here.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.110
Here's what I'm going
to talk about.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.540
What are you really
meant to do?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.650
This is a fancified title, but,
basically, the point of

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.580
this is, how do you reach
your potential?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.780
Great companies, in my
experience, work with their

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190
people to reach their
potential.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.910
OK?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.800
And I think this company
is a great example.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
Google is a great example.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.490
And I'm going to talk about
today, what it means to reach

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.740
your potential.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.410
And basically, every company and
everybody here is trying

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.180
to do-- and this is what
my last book was about.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.520
I scribbled a few
things up here.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.790
Every company articulates a
clear vision about how you add

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.860
value, and what you need
to be great at.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.970
So how you add value to
customers, people using your

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510
service, and what you
need to be great at.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.600
And then the rest of your life
is spent trying to update that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.420
vision, set priorities.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.480
And the rest of your time is
executing, trying to align so

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.010
you achieve that vision.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.090
That's what great
companies do.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.040
But they do one other thing.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.150
Within that, they try to help
people that work there be the

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.230
best that they can be.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.520
And that means, in a company of
many thousands of people,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.590
each person is unique.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.950
And the best that you can be,
is going to be something

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.330
different, depending
on who you are.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.700
And to build a great company,
you need as many people as

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.690
humanly possible, being the best
that they can be and not

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.030
trying to be like
everybody else.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.360
And that's been my experience
in business.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.570
And I think that's been key to
building a great company.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.330
It's also the key, in
my opinion, to you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.190
reaching your dreams.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.180
So what do I mean by reaching
your potential?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.440
Reaching your potential, to me,
means creating your own

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.630
definition of success.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.760
What is success to you?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.440
Now, you say, OK, of course,
it means creating my own

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.830
definition of success.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.810
My experience is most
people don't.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.610
And most very smart people
often don't.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.880
And why?

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.590
Because we grew up in an
education system and a society

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.640
that is constantly defining
success for us.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.190
When you go to school, if you're
majoring in something,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.910
you have a bunch of tests
and things you're

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.440
trying to do to excel.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.890
And you're worried about
metrics, grades.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.570
Once you get in a
job, same thing.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.360
You're worried about metrics,
the next promotion, trying to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.220
achieve whatever the metrics
are of the business.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.950
And in every magazine,
newspaper, television program,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.920
society is constantly defining
what success is.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.020
Usually, based on money, it may
be based on other-- power

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.550
may be another one.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.120
And then you've got your friends
and your family and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.500
your loved ones who are
constantly trying to beat in

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.770
your head what they'd
love to see you do.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.420
Now there are exceptions
to this.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.380
But conventional wisdom, and
peer pressure, and other

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.430
people defining our success, is
so pervasive that most of

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.760
us are not even aware that
it's influencing us.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.970
We're not even aware
we're doing it.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.710
And the reason I see this, is
I have people come visit me

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.790
from age 20 to 30 to 50 to 70 to
85, who are struggling with

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.800
this problem.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.130
It may be that there's somebody
who's thinking about

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.380
their first job and trying to
figure out what they really

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.390
want to do.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.090
It may be somebody who's 20
years into their career and

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.430
wonders how they got into this
situation that they're in, and

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.930
trying to figure out
how to get out.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.350
Better yet, I get people who are
70 years old come to me,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.730
who's had great career, been
CEOs, achieved the dream,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.910
everything society
could say is--

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.480
and they don't feel that way.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.050
And now they're trying
to figure out what

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.240
they're going to do now.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.860
So what I've learned from this
is, the key is not necessarily

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.710
to reach somebody else's
definition of success.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.450
It's to reach your
unique potential.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.500
And let me explain
what that means.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.610
What that means to me is,
how do you add value?

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.520
What competencies do you build
that are meaningful to you?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.990
And here's the reason it's so
damn hard to reach your

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.950
potential, you never
get there.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.790
OK.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.650
In any given job, when you were
in college, you probably

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.730
reached your potential
to get a job here.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.770
That's fine, but college
is over.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.440
Now you've got to go to work.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.810
OK.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.420
So now you're a junior
person or a

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.280
mid-level person at Google.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.260
You may be reaching your
potential now.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.570
But it's still not over.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.460
The company is changing,
you're changing,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.680
you might get promoted.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.650
You've got to try again to
reach your potential.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.460
You may get bored.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.940
There may be other changes in
the world and needs in the

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.170
world that you believe
you want to attack.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.430
And what I've learned is, you
always think, oh, if only I

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.780
could get to here, then--

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.330
And it never works that way.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.720
Because once you get to here,
you say, uh, now what?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.640
Now what?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.100
You know, maybe it's
my personal life.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.770
If I were married and had

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.050
children, and then my children--

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.160
that's what's missing.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.120
And you get that, and you
realize, well, that's good.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.360
But now what?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.500
It's always a question
of now what.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.220
So what I'm going to
describe today is a

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.070
little bit of a process.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.790
And the best way I would liken
reaching your potential, is

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.370
the same as losing weight
or getting in shape.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.410
Because if I told you, lose
20 pounds and you're done.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.570
You never have to worry about
what you eat again.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.200
You'd say, that's stupid.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.570
OK.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.070
Or if I said, get in shape and
then you don't have to

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.000
exercise any more.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.090
You'd say, no, that's stupid.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.860
And reaching your potential
is the same.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.736
And you should think of it
the same, but we don't.

00:06:53.736 --> 00:06:57.170
We tend to think of it as a
magic answer or destination.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.970
And what it is, is a
series of steps.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.620
It's about process.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.230
In the same way losing weight,
or getting in shape, or

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.230
becoming a great something,
is about process.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.820
And most of us don't think
about it this way.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.820
And what I'm trying to get
people to do is realize, this

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.180
is a process.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.170
You need to follow
this process.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.810
I do not have an answer.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.950
I don't have an easy
destination.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.810
No, you are not going
to get there.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.840
It's going to have
to keep evolving.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.890
You'll reach your potential at
various stages, then you'll

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.920
change your mind and you'll
go for something else.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.130
But if you learn the process,
I think you're going to be

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.560
very satisfied with
where you get.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.260
I don't know what that means
about how much money you're

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.700
going to make, or how much style
you're going to have, or

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.820
how much status.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.430
But I think you're going to
learn, in the long run, those

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.060
are outcomes that tend to follow
performing at a high

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.230
level and reaching
your potential.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.740
All right.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.720
So my question is, if you
believe you really want to

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.560
reach your potential, what
are you willing to do?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.650
Are you willing to
follow a process?

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.180
And this is simple enough,
but it's hard as can be.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.230
OK.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.640
And the reason I've learned
about this--

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.480
I've been working on this for
30 years because I've built

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.350
companies, I run a venture
philanthropy firm, we build

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.670
non-profits--

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.500
Draper Richards Kaplan--

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.060
and everything I'm trying to do,
every day, is get people

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.090
to reach their potential.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.510
Why?

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.730
Purely selfish on my part.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.690
In that, if I can get people in
our organizations to reach

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.440
their potential, then I got a
better chance to reach mine.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.280
OK.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.820
And that's what builds
great organizations.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.140
A group of people, thousands
ideally, that are working to

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.960
achieve the vision of the
company, but working to be at

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.210
their best.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.120
And companies, normally,
will help you.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.030
But I would argue, you've
got to own this.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.420
You've got to own it.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.800
If you're waiting for somebody
else to tap you on the

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.160
shoulder and tell you how to
reach your potential, stop.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.860
You can stop now.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.940
You own it.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.940
You're going to own it the
rest of your life.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.120
And I want you to own
it and to get in a

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.830
habit of owning it.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.820
So how do you do that?

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.480
Number one, first--

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.210
and I'm just going to talk
through for 20 to 30 minutes,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.180
what some of the steps are.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.900
And they seem brutally simple,
because they are.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.310
But they're really hard.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.380
Step one, you have to actually
be able to write down on a

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.730
piece of paper--

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.750
and I'm going to probably
encourage you to try this.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.320
The book has lots of exercises
on how to do this.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.830
Can you write down your
strengths and your weaknesses?

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.110
Now, most people say, oh,
yeah, I can do that.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.800
And normally, the reason I
know this, I meet with

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.740
ridiculous number of people
every year one on one, CEOs

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.050
all the way down to
college students.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.210
And it's unusual for me to
meet somebody who can

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.490
accurately write down
their weaknesses.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.590
I say to them, tell me
what your strengths

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.580
and weaknesses are.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.930
When we get to the weaknesses,
well, I'm very impatient.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.290
Doesn't suffer fools gladly.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.410
Knock it off.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.170
Tell me the truth.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.250
What are your weaknesses?

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.490
I know you got them,
what are they?

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.220
Uh.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.880
Well, tell me what you heard
in your last review.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.480
Well, they said, just keep
doing what you're doing.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.670
OK.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.810
Did you get paid at the top
of your peer group?

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.880
Well, I don't think so.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.810
Well, how'd they explain that?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.930
Uh, they didn't.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.510
OK.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.480
[LAUGHS]

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.810
So the point of this is, you
get in your year-end review

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.310
and you're like-- and
I'm the same way.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.830
I'm like, thinking, oh my god,
I hope this goes well.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.650
And oh my god, I don't hope I
hear anything that's going to

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.370
make me feel terrible.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.000
And you get the heck out of
there, and it's over.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.110
And what I'm saying to you is,
you've got to own being able

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:41.230
to find out what your strengths
and weaknesses are.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.910
And it's not so easy.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.040
But my experience is, extremely
high percentage of

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.990
the time, if you know what your
weaknesses are, you're

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.640
almost always going
to improve.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.610
My experience is, why don't
people improve?

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.350
Why have I had people in their
careers where I think, god,

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.210
this person's got all the
skills, what's the problem?

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.150
They're not willing to

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.920
recognize, I have this weakness.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.860
The second you do, you'll
either decide it's not

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.880
realistic to improve on
it-- let's say you're

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.750
quantitatively weak.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.930
Could be, you're just
quantitatively weak.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:14.270
Fine.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.380
Pick something else.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.580
But can you write down your
weaknesses and learn how to

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.210
deal with it?

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.830
I'm not saying you have to
improve on every weakness, but

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.390
you have to have a strategy
for how to deal with it.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:25.920
OK.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.870
So that's point one.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:27.800
Can you write it down.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.590
Now here's why this
is complicated.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.765
It has to be relative.

00:11:30.765 --> 00:11:33.460
It has to be skill-based.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.260
OK.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.140
Not popular, is not a strength
or weakness.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.620
It's got to be skill.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.930
Analytical skills, written
skills, speaking skills,

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.070
domain expertise--

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.260
I've got in the book, 25
different skills that you

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.960
could list and put next
to each one a plus,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.890
a minus, or a neutral.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.740
It's got to be skill-based,
number one.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.570
Number two--

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.250
it has to be relative
to a job, to a task.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.870
Here, let me give you
an example, I

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.970
am a very fast runner.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.690
I've always been
a fast runner.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.990
That's fantastic, that's
a strength.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.670
Except, if the job is to be an
Olympic sprinter, it's not a

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.280
strength anymore.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.680
Versus a peer group that's
superb at that

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.090
job, it's now a weakness.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.380
In fact, I couldn't even
bother to try out.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.370
They won't even let me
try out, I'm so slow.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.260
And same with a job.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.090
You need to look at the job
you're in or, especially, the

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.390
one you aspire to.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:40.010
And can you write down the two
or three skill weaknesses that

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.690
you have, relative
to that job?

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.290
OK, try that.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.190
Now second, here's the other
reason this is so darn hard,

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.100
in my experience, you
can't do this alone.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.760
You'd love to think, OK, I
can do this by myself.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.090
My experience is, no.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.240
And here's why.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.730
All of you and all of us, me
included, have blind spots, in

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.800
that you don't see
yourself clearly.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.380
So you may have a weakness that
you're not even aware of.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.780
But I can tell you for darn
sure, if I ask that question

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.830
to all five or 10 people who
work with you every day, and I

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.110
said, tell me the strengths and
weaknesses of so-and-so,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.620
relative to the job
they're in.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.800
They can give them to me fast.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.070
They know your weaknesses.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.560
They don't even have
to think about it.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.770
The only person that may
not know, is you.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.100
Now how's that possible?

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.390
Why wouldn't they
just tell you?

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.940
Because they don't want to
upset you or offend you.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.290
They want to be on good
terms with you.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:50.300
Or you may send off a vibe that
you don't want to know.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.950
OK, so my experience is, you've
got to seek coaching

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.640
from people who observe you, as
to what they observe your

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.920
weaknesses are, and
your strengths.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.710
But the problem is, they're
not going to tell

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.320
you unless you ask.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.030
You have to give them
permission.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.470
And you have to be convincing
that you really

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.950
want to hear it.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.580
Because the most difficult
weaknesses you have, they may

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.980
not want to tell you.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.440
Here's a good one I
used to struggle

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.110
with, in coaching people.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.190
You say different things
to different people.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.660
Under pressure, you kind
of shade the way you

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.200
explain what happened.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.680
That's a weakness.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.150
How do I tell you that without
offending you?

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.730
OK?

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.510
You're going to have to come to
me and say, I really want

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.390
to improve.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.530
And would you give me any
advice from what you've

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.210
observed in my behavior?

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.370
And you're going to have
to convince me

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.470
you really mean it.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.660
Because when I give you that
one, you're going to think,

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.860
what a jerk.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.710
Right?

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.650
That guy is a jerk.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.390
Right?

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.400
And then me giving, and I'll
think, ugh, why did I

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.040
stick my neck out?

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.700
OK?

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.800
But the stuff you need to hear,
is the kind of stuff

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.190
that people are not necessarily
going to

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.410
want to tell you.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.056
The easy stuff, you know.

00:15:06.056 --> 00:15:11.860
The deeper stuff, people may be
fearful of offending you.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.900
You've got to ask.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.660
And in this regard, I wrote
down one other thing.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.970
There's a difference between
coaching and mentoring.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.400
A lot of you may think
you have a mentor.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.840
We use coaching and mentoring
like they're the same thing.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.480
They are absolutely not.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.390
Mentoring is, I tell you a
story, you give me advice back

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.750
based on my story.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.210
Problem is, your advice is
only as good as my story.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:43.264
And my story paints me
as, like, a savior.

00:15:43.264 --> 00:15:44.260
You know?

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.210
I did this, and I did
this, and then I got

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.790
screwed over this way.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.910
Or I had this bad
happen to me.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.810
And you say, oh, my god, those
people you work with, they

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.040
sound terrible.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.410
Oh my god, they're probably
very jealous of you, uh,

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.660
because, uh, you went to Harvard
Business School.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.410
And I say, no, they went to
Harvard Business School, too.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.920
Well, OK, then they're
just jealous of you.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.410
Maybe they think
you-- well, no.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.280
So mentors often give advice.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.390
They get people blown up.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.010
OK.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.020
But a lot of people, if you've
given as many year-end reviews

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.810
as I have--

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.900
I've had people say back to
me, my mentor tells me I'm

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.190
doing a great job and there's
something wrong with the

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.600
review system.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:23.940
OK.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.260
That's mentoring.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.680
It's got its limits.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.020
It can be useful for certain
tactical advice.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.830
But it's not the same
as coaching.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.800
Coaching is different.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.160
It requires direct
observation.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.640
Any of you play tennis,
or a sport?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.040
Golf?

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.580
How often do you call a tennis
coach and say, let me describe

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.690
my swing to you over
the telephone.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.140
I put a leg out and then I--

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.880
and they say, oh, that
sounds pretty good.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.510
Then they see you swing,
and it's terrible.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:56.630
OK.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.870
That's the difference between
mentoring and coaching.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.940
In order to write down your
weaknesses, you need coaching.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.560
Meaning, someone who actually
sees you in action.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.510
Because you may not even realize
your weakness well

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.680
enough to even describe
what you're doing.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.109
OK.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.599
But this is the key.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.780
In a company, and I used to run
companies, you can change

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.720
everything.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.339
Given enough time,
determination, and money, I

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.900
can change a lot of things
in the company.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.260
Sadly, with human beings, you'd
like to think you can

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.180
change everything
about yourself.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.660
I'm afraid not.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.410
There are limits.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.100
I am only 5' 11".

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.710
And as much as I would like to
dunk a basketball, and I'll

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.320
always want--

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.020
I'm never going to do it, OK.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.370
And I can't change things
to change that.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.920
I can't even palm
a basketball.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.230
But I still try.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:51.900
But the point is, with you,
everything you do has got to

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.050
start-- reaching your potential
starts with an

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.660
honest, accurate assessment of
your strengths and weaknesses

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.480
relative to a job.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.920
You need to learn to
get in the habit of

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.190
writing notes down--

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.960
and I would say, for the
rest of your life--

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.140
relative to a job, and seeking
the feedback of those that

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:11.980
observe you.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.780
So you can do it accurately.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.100
Because my experience is, if
you know your strengths and

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.020
weaknesses, you can either
decide to improve on some of

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.670
the weaknesses, you could decide
it's not realistic to

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.000
improve on some of the
weaknesses, and you can

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.520
surround yourself with people
who complement you.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.650
Or you can pick a
different job.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.130
But you have lots of options.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.190
The reason people make a lousy
choices and don't reach their

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.260
potential, often, is
they are unaware.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.230
And why do smart people fail?

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.570
Two reasons normally,
isolation and

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.900
inability to learn.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.570
That's why outstanding people
fail, and I see it every day.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:47.380
Isolation--

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.260
this is why CEOs fail,
too, by the way--

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.620
you get isolated, which
means you don't know.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.870
You don't know your strengths
and weaknesses.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.470
You're isolated because you
don't seek feedback.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.690
And you don't want to know,
inability to learn.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.020
I can tell you all, whatever
you guys end up, if you are

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.870
willing to get advice from
others who observe you, and

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.970
you're willing to learn, I don't
know where you're going

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.190
to go, but you've got a
heck of a good chance.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.160
But it starts with strengths
and weaknesses.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.380
This is painful for
many people.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.750
And by the way, just like
getting in shape, doing what

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.640
I'm talking about, if you
actually do this, you're going

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.610
to be sore.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.130
You're going to use muscles
you're not used to using.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.800
But you're going
to get better.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.530
Second, you do have
to understand what

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.630
your passions are.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.220
Now many of you think, you
pick Google, you're done.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.540
I already decided my passion!

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.660
I decided to work at Google,
what more do you want from me?

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.290
OK.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.500
Here's the problem.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.840
There's lots of different jobs
in this company, in the same

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.790
way there were lots of different
jobs where I was.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.780
You may or may not be
in the right area.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.670
But I do know this, passion is
the rocket fuel that allows

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.700
you to work on your weaknesses,
makes you get

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.980
advice from people-- because
it's painful to do--

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.310
and helps you do all sorts
of other things.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:08.230
Bad days, bad months, bad years,
tolerating adversity--

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.790
passion is the rocket fuel
that lets you do it.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:18.630
But you do need to know what
tasks your passion is about.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.670
OK?

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.090
And I think many of
you who are here,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.330
probably do know that.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.490
But you got to be able
to write that down.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.470
It is hard to perform at a very
high level, for a long

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:28.880
period of time, unless
you are passionate

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.050
about what you're doing.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.410
And here's the problem.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.570
Most of us, including me--

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.290
I loved what I did for almost
my entire career.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.910
I love what I do now.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.080
But there was a time,
eventually, in my career, I

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.090
stopped loving what I did.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.010
And I never dreamed that
could possibly happen.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.980
It will happen to you.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.540
Either you've been in the same
job for too long and you get

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.690
bored, or maybe the
industry changes.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.990
Or maybe you change.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.210
Or maybe something
else changes and

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.500
you run out of gas.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.840
Don't stop thinking about what
you're passionate about,

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.840
including in the community,
outside work.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.990
That's step two.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.000
Step three is understanding
yourself.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.220
OK?

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.400
Step three is understanding
your life story.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.090
And when I said, why
do leaders fail?

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.860
Isolation, inability to learn.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.290
And the biggest issue many
people have is they don't

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.700
understand themselves.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.370
And in particular, so you got
your strengths and weaknesses.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.860
You understand your passions.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.340
Fine, simple enough.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.550
Do you understand
your own story?

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.000
And for many of you in this
audience, as you get more

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.700
senior, you'll start
to see what I mean.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.900
When you have to start
delegating more.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.050
When you have to get up more and
speak in front of a group.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.510
When you have to fire people.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.940
When you have to hire people.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.510
When you have a highly valued
person working with you, who

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.500
you have to give bad news to.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.220
Or you have to give them
criticism and you realize, I

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.840
can't do it.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.090
I can't confront them.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.270
And so for most people, I
do a little exercise.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.450
When many people come to me for
advice, one of things I

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.910
talk to them about
is their story.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.750
Because I ask them a series
of questions.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.600
Why did you do this?

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.480
Why did you do that?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.150
Why did you do this?

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.260
And the truth is, sometimes,
you don't know why you did

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.410
what you did.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.890
Why'd you lose your temper?

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.810
Why'd you get impatient?

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.360
It has to do with your story.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.840
And I would comment, you've
got three stories.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.530
I'm only interested
in one of them.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.840
There's the facts of
your life story.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.710
Where were you born?

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.250
Where did you go to school?
--your parents,

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.170
family, just the facts.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.910
There's a second story, which
you've got a lot of practice

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.640
at, most of you here and most
people I deal with.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.400
It's called your success story,
which is a story of how

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.120
you overcame obstacles
and excelled and got

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.590
to where you went.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.810
Where you are now.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.320
It normally has drawbacks.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.130
It has failures.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:08.830
It has terrible things that
happen to you and you said, I

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.170
will not stand for that.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.710
I will overcome that.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.960
And I decided right then,
I was going to do this.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.320
And then I went and I did it.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.310
And I mean, you're going
to cry, it's such

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.140
an inspiring story.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.200
And you walk right in here to
Google with that resume, and

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.850
you told that story, and they
said, you belong here.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.165
And you said, I guess I do.

00:23:32.165 --> 00:23:33.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.290
OK.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.750
Here's the little problem.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.250
There's a third story.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.590
This is not one that you're
telling in your job interview.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.670
And this, I would call your
failure narrative.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.060
And every one of you
has got one.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.610
And I know this because
I've dealt with

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.180
people at all levels.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.490
And I've got one, several.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.710
And this is a story that
is based on the same

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.230
facts of your life.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.700
It's about--

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.220
by the way, most of you-- how
many of you have been fired?

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.180
So this is interesting,
very few of you.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.270
But if I talk to a normal group
of people out there,

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.590
especially entrepreneurs, you'd
be shocked how many of

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.890
them have been fired, or
believe they've been

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.350
mistreated, or had an injustice
done to them.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.790
Now, if many of you feel like
you haven't had an injustice

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.270
done to you, just wait.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.020
You will.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.330
All of us do.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.340
By the way, injustice happens.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.580
The key is, though, for most
people, it feeds into your

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.250
childhood, maybe events growing
up, injustice that

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.500
happens to you, maybe
a difficult boss--

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.540
feeds into your self-doubt.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.070
And all of you have a narrative
that's in your head,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.230
whether you're aware of it or
not, right now, that says, I'm

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.430
not good enough.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.980
I can't do this.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.030
I doubt that I'll ever be
a "blank" at Google.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.730
I don't think I can.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.950
And if you don't think you've
got it-- let me give you an

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.470
assignment.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.810
Write down your failure
narrative.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.330
I go through it at length
in the book.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.080
And the reason I urge people
to write this down, this is

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.680
the one that isn't politically
correct to talk about.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.800
You're not sharing it.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.510
You're not sharing it
with your peers.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.060
Most of us wear a
mask every day.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.490
But we have a self-doubt
about something.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.010
And I might ask it to you this
way, what's your biggest fear?

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.380
What is your biggest
area of self-doubt?

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.860
What is it you can't do?

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.160
And if you say, nothing, bull.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.830
You've got something
in your head.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.940
And for many people, they're
not even aware that it's in

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.680
their head.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.400
But I can tell you, it's
affecting what

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.640
you do every day.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.530
It's affecting your ability
to reach your potential.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:51.020
And you get more senior, and you
get more responsibility,

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.980
and the stakes get higher,
the failure narrative

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.870
comes to the fore.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.240
And so what I'm encouraging
people at all levels to do,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.940
write it down.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.700
It may surprise you.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.240
It may be as simple as talking
about injustices in your life.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.560
You know, a coach that
was difficult.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.630
Anything.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.170
But why do people fail?

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.570
Why do people fail
to get feedback?

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.270
Why do they fail to be able to
understand their passions?

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.050
Why don't they go for it
when they see something

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.020
they want to do?

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.600
Why do they keep quiet when they
should speak up and act

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.630
like owners?

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.050
Normally, it's doubt.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.655
What is that doubt for you?

00:26:32.655 --> 00:26:34.020
Can you write it down?

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.000
Are you aware of it?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.100
OK.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.860
And I'm going to do
this quickly.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.380
Now, performance and career
management is taking, as

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.500
simple as, your strengths and
weaknesses, your passions,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.220
understanding your story, and
matching them to a job.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.530
And I don't mean any job.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.360
I mean your dream job.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.630
Now, question.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.850
How many here have
a dream job?

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.940
And how many are not sure
what their dream job is?

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.640
And let me give you an
assignment from here on, you

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.380
should be thinking about it.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:14.050
Because my experience is, if
you think about your dream,

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.030
you are much more likely
to get to that dream.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.250
And I would say to all of you,
whether you think you have a

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.500
dream or not, you do.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.600
All of you have an aspiration.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.750
When you daydream.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.950
When you fantasize about what
you're going to be doing.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.290
How you want to impact
the world.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.310
The value you want to add.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.360
You've got a dream.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.980
Think about what it is, and
can you write it down?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.640
Reaching your potential, in my
opinion, is about taking your

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.190
strengths and weaknesses, your
passions, understanding who

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.660
you are, and trying to connect
them to a dream.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.420
Now, some of you may say,
I don't have a dream.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.160
My dream is to be employed.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.210
I'm just glad to have a job.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.890
My dream is that this company
does well, and I can just come

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.590
in here every day and
not be bothered.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.980
By the way, and for some
people, including me--

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.720
I had years I went through,
where I felt that way--

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.240
but my experience with human
beings is, that will not

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.430
sustain you.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.480
And my experience is, I've not
met anybody, yet, who is happy

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.690
with that for an extended period
of time, or performs at

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:25.300
their best level if they don't
push themselves more.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.310
So my question is, what's
your dream?

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.965
And then the second question is,
you've got to understand--

00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:35.340
and I talked about this when
I was here two years ago--

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.900
what are the two or three most
important things you must do

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.470
well to succeed in the
job you're in or the

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.420
job you want to do?

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.190
How does Google add value?

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.980
And the area you're
in add value?

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.810
Can you write it down?

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.090
And your boss certainly needs
to be able to write it down.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.840
This is how you mobilize
people.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.170
How do we add value?

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.900
What things do we need
to be great at?

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.850
What things do you need to be
great at, to be outstanding?

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.400
Can you write down those
two or three things?

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.300
The reason a lot of people fail
to reach their potential

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.430
is, they're spending their time
on all sorts of things

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.370
every day, but they don't have
on their wall the three things

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.820
they must do at a
superb level.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.790
There's a lot of things that I
get asked to do every day.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.700
There's only three or four, in
the job I'm in right now, that

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.820
I need to do at a superb level
if I'm going to be great.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.880
And what you learn to do--
this is how you choose

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.120
priorities, you've got to decide
how to spend your time.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.860
Do you match your time
with those top three?

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.150
How many of you can write down
the top three tasks that you

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.790
must be great at, to be
great at your job?

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.350
How many of you don't
know what they are?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.310
And I will tell you, go back,
interview your boss if you

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.170
have to, and write them down.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:59.180
I assure you, your boss, he or
she, has them in their mind

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.720
when they're reviewing you
at the end of the year.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.900
I certainly do.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.210
I can tell you that for sure.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.540
And they're measuring you,
every day, against those.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.040
It would be better if you took
ownership of knowing what

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.430
those are, and strive, and then
re-look at, again, your

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.290
strengths and weaknesses
versus those tasks.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.710
How do you rate?

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:22.510
Where are you strong?

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.140
Where are you weak?

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.390
What do you need to work at?

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.240
OK?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.830
You've got to do this.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.310
And I would say, the
other thing--

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.730
most of you are too young for
this-- but as you get

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.730
promoted, they change.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.790
Whatever you need to be great
at in your job, when you get

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.040
moved to a new job,
different three.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.950
If you get promoted,
different three.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.130
By the way, world changes,
competitors take actions, you

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.770
have a new strategic
initiative.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.230
Might be a different one
or two or three.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.380
Do you know what they are?

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.870
Because this is what you're
driving against.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.310
And by the way, you may
say, well, I don't

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.070
have time to do this.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.290
I'm working a ridiculous
number of hours.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.110
And I would say, this is the
prism through which you drive

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.960
every action you take and
every decision you make.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.100
If that's true, if you're
driving a Maserati, or

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.870
whatever you drive,
at 150 miles--

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.310
I don't drive one of those.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.070
I wouldn't know how to drive one
of those, because I can't

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.740
drive a stick.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.690
But if you drove 150 miles an
hour, it would be nice if you

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.950
knew where you were going.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.270
What's the vision?

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.260
What are the top two or three
tasks you must do well?

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.660
Can you write them down?

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:38.930
You should gear your skills
development against those.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.670
Your dream job, you ought to
think about what the tasks

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.560
were that you would
dream about.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.810
When were you at your best
working at Google?

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.010
When did you shine?

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.130
When were you your best
in your life?

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.950
When did you shine?

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.690
What were you doing?

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.430
What tasks were you
performing?

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.930
How does it fit with
your current job?

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.610
Maybe there's a job three doors
down that's a better

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.690
one, that's a better fit.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.540
But I'm saying, you need to
take ownership of thinking

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.690
about this.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.220
That's performance and
career management.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.890
It's not being nice to the boss,
or pretending that you

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.860
think what he or she thinks,
or, like, how are you?

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.740
And all that.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.350
Forget that stuff.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:24.080
I hate to break it to you, your
boss wants to like you.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.710
And I know you want
to like your boss.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.970
But I'll tell you, much more
important, they want to think

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.460
highly of you and how you
perform key tasks.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.700
They care about that
a whole lot more.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.670
Take ownership of that.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:34.930
OK.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.800
Let me go very quickly.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.290
Good versus great.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.940
And I've only got a
couple of minutes.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.190
My main advice is, once you've
done strengths, weaknesses,

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:49.980
passions, your story, matching
all that to the job you're in

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.540
and what's most important,
do you act like an owner?

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.050
When you walk in every
day, do you speak up?

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.150
When your boss says something
dumb or is about to walk off a

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:01.990
cliff, do you say,
no, I disagree?

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.060
Do you stick your neck
out appropriately?

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.000
Do you act like an owner?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.790
Do you help others who need
help, even though you don't

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.860
get any credit for it?

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.890
This is what makes a difference,
in my experience,

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.050
between people who are decent
or good, and great.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.600
Great companies are made up of
people who act like owners.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.870
Do you?

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.540
By the way, if you do for
others without regard to

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.100
what's in it for you, I strongly
believe, you will get

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.720
multiples more back in return.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.440
But if everything you do is, I
won't do this, unless I get

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.200
some back, tit-for-tat.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.510
Good luck.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.870
You're not an owner.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.380
I want to build a company
around people

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.380
who act like owners.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.130
You got to act like
an owner, do you?

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.440
OK, and then the last
part is, I said, you

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.940
can't do this alone.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.100
You've got to have
relationships.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:01.490
And I don't mean, be connected
to 1,000 people on Facebook,

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.540
or have 500 followers or 1,000
followers on Twitter.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.570
That's not a relationship.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.170
And one of the things I've
learned, which has been a

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:12.739
shocker to me, in the job I'm
in, is when I ask somebody,

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:16.770
like one of you here, what
problems are you having?

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.929
--And people usually come to
me when they're desperate.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.580
Harvard is like Switzerland.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.460
When they've tried everything
and then, it's sad, they're so

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.190
desperate, they come to me.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.960
And I'll ask them, after they
give me this earth-shaking

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.350
revelation and a terrible
problem, who have you talk to

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:35.560
you about it?

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.739
And the answer, more often
than not, is no one.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:39.690
And I say, no, no.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:40.980
I must have ask that wrong.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.800
Who have you spoken with?

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.920
And they say, no, you heard
me right the first time.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.790
No one.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.429
Well, how could that be?

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.449
And the reason is--

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:51.260
I wrote this down.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.859
We could talk about
this for length.

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:57.300
Do you have a relationship where
you understand someone,

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.840
you trust them, and
you respect them?

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.060
And they understand, trust,
and respect you?

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.110
Are you willing to disclose
things to people?

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.740
Do you have people you can
trust, that you're willing to

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.960
tell things to, and
seek advice?

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.930
It helps to do all the steps in
"Reaching your Potential"

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.660
if you have relationships.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.440
And I will tell you, if you have
three or four or five,

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.210
you're doing well.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.210
Very well.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.780
Most people think,
oh, I have 30.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.900
Or I've got all sorts
of friends.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.170
That's not what I'm
talking about.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.580
Who can you talk to when
you really need

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.060
to confide in someone?

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.490
And for many people,
it's no one.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.520
This is not something you
do over the telephone.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.970
You can't do it by email.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.890
It means face-to-face time with
people, where you have

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.560
mutual trust, respect,
and understanding.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.970
OK so we're about out of time.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.410
We're going to take
questions here.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.860
So here's my point.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.070
I've just described
a series of steps.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.700
You may be better at certain
steps than others.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.550
But this is a process.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.680
Reaching your potential is not,
you climb a mountain and

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.100
you're there.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.600
It doesn't work that way.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.900
It is a process.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.860
And what I'm trying to get
people to do is treat it like

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.110
getting in shape, or losing
weight, or whatever extended,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.360
regular process.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.390
Start using these muscles
to reach your potential.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:17.100
It is a long-term,
lifelong effort.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.880
And once you think you've
got there--

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.370
because I've had many
times in my life I

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.410
think I've got there.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:26.120
And then I realized, no,
I actually don't.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.420
I still want to do more.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.710
I want to be wanted, needed.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.460
I want to make an impact
on the world.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.700
It never ends, and it won't end
for the rest of your life,

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.860
is my experience.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.940
I have a 90-year-old mother,
she still wants

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.150
to reach her potential.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.540
It's human nature.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.830
OK.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.200
And so let me stop there.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.760
Let's go to questions.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.980
Just wanted to ask your thoughts
on, have you done any

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.060
c correlationship between
reaching your

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.145
potential and happiness?

00:36:51.145 --> 00:36:52.650
Are people, typically,
happy when

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.430
they reach their potential?

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.050
Or are they beating up
themselves, and then trying to

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.380
reach higher and higher,
as you move forward?

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:05.160
Well, I've read studies
of people, of

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.580
what creates happiness.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.430
And I've read books.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:08.680
And I, obviously, work
in academia.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.510
And a lot of my experience,
also, is anecdotal.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:21.380
Let me put it this way,
everybody has a little bit

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.770
different personality makeup.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.370
And there's some people, as they
kid around, can never be

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.320
happy unless they're
unhappy, right?

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.360
And then there's some people
that are just much more

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.550
peaceful, contented,
et cetera.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.720
My experience, though,
on this score--

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.880
reaching your potential--

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.870
I haven't met anybody, yet, who
doesn't want to be wanted,

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:45.140
and needed, and loved, and feel
that they're vital to

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.660
someone, or someones.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.720
Reaching your potential is about
figuring out where that

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.190
is and being able to do it.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.580
So does that mean you still
won't be aggravated about

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.490
three or four other things in
your life, depending on your

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:01.700
personality makeup?

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.910
Yeah, you might still be.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:10.730
But I think, people's
satisfaction is much higher if

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.460
they're working to get to a
place, not trying to please

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.450
everybody else, but to try
to make sure that they're

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.940
satisfied with where they are
and are adding value and

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.040
making a positive difference
in the world.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.290
And most people start off
thinking, if I could just make

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.470
money, or I could get to this
position, I could get this

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.580
metric, something--

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.990
then I think, I'm going
to be happy.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.430
Because everybody in these
magazines or television

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.830
programs, everybody
seems to be--

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.130
And then, what they learn is, A,
they're not happy, because

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.800
they're not adding the value
they want to have.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.910
And they're realizing, a lot of
people that they looked at,

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.120
who they thought were
happy, aren't as

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.340
happy as they thought.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.120
And so that would be
my answer to that.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.590
It may not be the whole
enchilada, but it's a good

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.860
part of it.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.000
When you say, if you have
three, four, five

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.800
relationships you are
doing pretty good--

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.050
Yeah.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.930
Who are these people
going to be?

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.850
Like, can they be your coworkers
or do you need to

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.100
select outside of work?

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.470
What type of people?

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.780
All right.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.170
So let me talk about that.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.350
Let me define again,
more slowly, what a

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.450
relationship is.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:24.570
And you should decide, by the
way, as I say this, make a

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:30.420
list on how many people fit
this criteria for you, OK?

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.500
So to your point of
relationship, in my opinion,

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.120
could be a coworker, it could
be a friend, it could be a

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.960
family member, it could be
somebody in the community.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.730
It might be somebody you don't
even like that much or

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.410
wouldn't want to
hang out with.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.390
But it's got three things.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.566
You understand them, and
they understand you.

00:39:51.566 --> 00:39:55.480
You trust them, and
they trust you.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.810
There are a lot of people that I
understand and would like to

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.230
talk to but, no offense,
they've got big mouths.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.990
And I know if I tell them, I
don't trust them enough or

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.730
they've got some
other agenda--

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:09.180
And even though they're a great
thinker, I'm not really

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.200
sure where they're coming
from, right?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.180
So you've got to trust
them and it helps

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.000
if they trust you.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.720
And then respect.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.180
You've got to respect them, and
they need to respect you.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.820
Those are the three elements
of a relationship.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.110
My experience, how do you
develop a relationship?

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.430
Three ways.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.900
Each of you has to be willing
to disclose something about

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.790
yourself to the other person.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.290
Sometimes in groups, when I
have enough time, I do a

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.290
little 10 minute exercise where
I have you pair-up with

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:40.390
the person next to you.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.130
And I say, disclose to them
something about yourself that

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:44.760
they don't know, that
would help them

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.600
understand you better.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.230
And everybody giggles
nervously, and

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.230
then they tell them.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.800
For example, I grew
up in Kansas City.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.320
My father was a traveling
salesman.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.450
My mother was a real
estate agent.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.195
And I go on and explain it and
they say, OK, I understand you

00:40:57.195 --> 00:40:58.130
a little bit better.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.260
OK.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.930
Are you willing to disclose
something about yourself?

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:05.900
Second thing I do is, can you
ask the person you just spoke

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.380
to, a question that would help
you understand them better?

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.110
This is the one most
of us are lousy at.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.440
How often do you go on a plane
trip with people, you don't

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.290
really learn anything
fundamental about them on that

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.690
plane trip for business?

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.590
Or vice versa, they didn't
learn anything about you.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.730
Because they didn't ask a
question that would allow you

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.440
to explain yourself, so they
could learn about you.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.200
OK.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.560
For example, I've seen people
who've worked together for 20

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.460
years, did not know one person--
the boss did not know

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.470
the subordinate had a
special needs child.

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.730
All these years, that was the
most important thing to them,

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:46.082
never came up.

00:41:46.082 --> 00:41:47.960
What was that about?

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.090
So are you willing
to ask questions?

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:53.980
And then the third one, can
you disclose an area of

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:59.460
self-doubt and seek advice
from that person?

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.310
I really doubt I'm that great a
"blank." What do you think?

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.570
Any advice you would give me?

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.040
What could I do about this?

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.330
I do this with people who don't
even know each other, or

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.240
some who have been working
together for 20 years.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.270
Just sitting there for 12
minutes, do it fast.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.605
And invariably, people who've
been working together for 15,

00:42:16.605 --> 00:42:19.840
20 years say, that's the best
conversation I've had in years

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.150
with this person.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.610
12 minutes.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.520
How's that possible?

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:24.770
OK.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.630
That's a relationship.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:29.820
That's how you build trust,
respect, and understanding.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.430
You got to be able to tell
something about yourself--

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.150
OK, not how many drinks you had
last night, but something

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.180
fundamental real, that helps
them understand where you're

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.480
coming from, maybe what
you're worried about.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.860
Can you ask them a question
that helps

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.870
you understand them?

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.830
Can you seek advice from them?

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:47.970
And so, by that, you may have a
few people at work you feel

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:48.630
that way about.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.160
You may have some people
outside work.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.340
My problem with many of you is,
do you have anyone that

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.890
you can do that with?

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.010
And I've been surprised.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:57.470
And this is--

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.530
I'll date myself--

00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:59.530
generational.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.820
My generation is better
at this, to my shock.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.480
We're worse at most everything,
but at this, I'd

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.860
say, we're better than yours.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.490
Why?

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.410
Because we only had two options
for communication.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:14.550
Telephone, yes, we did
have a telephone.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.800
Or you could write a letter.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.770
Yeah, but that was a pain.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.620
Or you could meet in person.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.760
You guys have a zillion other
modes, cell phone--

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.890
terrible.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.750
If you really want to understand
someone, email--

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.370
terrible.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.690
I see people, business leaders
and people communicating

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.570
important messages or trying to
have a serious conversation

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.430
by email-- forget it-- misread
each other completely.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.190
And you see this all the time.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:44.590
People send an email on
something that shouldn't be

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:45.380
done by email.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.070
It shouldn't even have been
done by telephone.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.680
Needed to be done in person.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.620
What are they thinking?

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:51.170
OK.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.830
So that's what a relationship
is.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.860
The problem is-- if I get back
to reaching your potential--

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.350
strengths and weaknesses,
passions, self-doubt, how do

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.690
you work through that stuff
if you don't have any

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:03.730
relationships?

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.700
Because we all have
blind spots.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.610
Why do leaders fail?

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:09.970
And outstanding people?

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.490
Isolation.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:15.450
Inability to learn.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:18.200
If you're connected to a zillion
people, but you don't

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.600
have any relationships, I can
tell you without knowing you,

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.910
you're isolated.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.330
And good luck on being
able to learn.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.190
You're not going to reach
your potential.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:30.790
So that's the thought.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:33.820
And I wouldn't have guessed 10
years ago that this was even

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.880
an issue out there.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.530
But I've realized, I've dealt
with so many people, it is a

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.460
big, big issue for people.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.090
Big issue.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.330
There's a relationship
shortage.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:49.020
Much more than a leadership
shortage.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.530
I'm just wondering, what's your
advice for people, if

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:57.220
they always playing big portion
in their mind, to have

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.870
failure in their attempts?

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:59.570
Right.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.270
Well, so here's the reason
I like talking

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.150
about the failure narrative.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:08.830
First of all, the one thing that
you should-- if you have

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:11.830
the failure narrative, always,
in your head, it might make

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:15.810
you feel better to know, you're
not the only one.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:20.160
I mean, everyone in this room,
to varying degrees.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.090
Now, that would shock
you, right?

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.930
Oh my god, no, I'm
the only one.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.610
Most people think that their
failure narrative is unique to

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:28.380
them and they're the only one.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.760
Not so.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.860
I can tell you with a certainty,
everyone in this

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.670
room has got one that is in
their minds, much more than

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:37.860
you would believe.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.180
Now, they cover it over.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.860
They look great and their
hair is nice.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.060
And everything is great.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:47.110
But I'll tell you, if you watch
them enough, and could

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:53.410
see what they can do and where
they just can't do it, that

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:54.630
failure narrative is there.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.465
So step one is to realize,
you're not the only one.

00:45:56.465 --> 00:45:58.100
There's not something wrong with
you because you have a

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:58.820
failure narrative.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:02.290
Step two is, do you
know what it is?

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:05.030
And then, step three is,
how is it affecting

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.090
your behavior now?

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.700
And then you get
to a question.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.850
Do you need to be a
prisoner of it?

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.870
You're not going to get
rid of it, by the way.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.450
I have no clue how to
get rid of one.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.560
But I do believe, if you're
aware of it and you try to

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.570
address it--

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.000
and I'll give you an
example real fast--

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.060
you address it, you don't need
to be a prisoner of it.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.890
I was petrified, if you can
believe this, of speaking.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.550
I could speak in front of 300
people at Goldman Sachs.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:36.830
But when I'd get in front of
1,000 people, I tried it.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:37.760
I couldn't do it.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.190
I freaked.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.440
I couldn't do it.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.990
Not everybody saw me freaking
out, but I freaked out.

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.580
OK, fine.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.470
If I was going to be head
of investment banking--

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.230
I was running corporate
finance at the time.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.120
They called me in.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.650
My boss, Hank Paulson, said,
we're going to promote to be

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.380
head of investment banking.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.250
And I talked him out of it.

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:57.100
I tried, furiously, everything
I could do to

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.070
talk him out of it.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.500
And then, he was co-head, at the
time, with Jon Corzine and

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.500
they didn't get along that
well, which has been well

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.290
documented.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.940
So I went around to Corzine
and talked him out of

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.420
promoting me.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.770
OK, Paulson, rightly,
wanted to kill me.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.130
OK?

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.030
But I was so scared, I promised
myself, I will never

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:19.950
become head of investment
banking because I never want

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.090
to get up in front of the annual
conference, in front of

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.780
1,500 people, and speak.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.520
And I'm going to do whatever I
need to do to get the hell out

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.530
of here, before that happens.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.370
No one would have dreamed that,
because I was such a

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.480
polished speaker, they thought,
in front of groups.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.430
And I seemed confident
and everything.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.750
And what I should have
done, is gone to Hank

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.540
and say, I am scared.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.400
But I didn't think I could.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.180
I was afraid to even
disclose it.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.440
Because I thought,
I'm the only one.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.890
I'm some weirdo.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:53.270
And then, unfortunately, I had
to give a eulogy at a funeral,

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:57.350
for someone to my family, in
front of a giant group.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.090
And I was petrified.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:03.630
But I learned that if you speak
from the heart, I can

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.460
give that speech.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.210
And it got me over it, but I
would've gotten over two years

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.250
sooner if I just told somebody
and got advice.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:13.430
So my question for you, if
you've got that, you're not

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.040
alone, but can you reach
out to somebody?

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.510
Do you have relationships
with one or two people?

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:20.590
You can disclose it to them
and get their feedback.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.370
Because I think you
can improve on it.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.710
You don't need to be
a prisoner of it.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:26.010
That make sense?

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:27.140
Thank you very much,
everybody.

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:27.640
Good to talk to you.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.875
[APPLAUSE]
