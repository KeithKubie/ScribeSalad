00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.904
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.110
Welcome all of you.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.220
My name is Joaquin Ruiz.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.710
I'm the dean of the
College of Science.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.334
And I thank you all
for coming tonight.

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:19.792
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.100
We started this lecture
series five years ago,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.040
more or less, with a
lecture on evolution.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.890
It was a time when Kansas
and parts of the country

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.610
were debating whether we should
be teaching intelligent design.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.470
We decided in the
College of Science

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.330
that it was important not only
to teach our own students,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.540
but to try to teach
our community what

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.580
we knew about science.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.020
And it was a great time.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.020
We started with very few
people, and today we're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.250
turning people away.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.880
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.792
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.020
Last year's lecture series dealt
with the magic of our brain

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.810
and how we think and how
we perceive our universe.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.450
And I think it's
fitting that this year,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.520
we continue with how we
perceive our universe

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.230
in a very different way.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.180
Today we're going to talk about
cosmology, how our universe was

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.150
created, the origin of
matter, the evolution of time,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.200
the evolution of dark matter,
the evolution of mass.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.800
Really it comes-- it boils
down to really the nitty gritty

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.630
of what we we're all about.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.335
And today I am pleased to
first and foremost, thank

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:45.410
all of those that
make this possible.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.310
The lecture series is
not a cheap endeavor,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.700
and people in our community
have really come up

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.260
and supported us in it.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.990
The Arizona Daily Star, Cox
Communications, Bob Davis

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.530
and Innovation Park,
Galileo Circle--

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.170
which are friends of
the College of Science--

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.039
Godat Design, Raytheon,
Research Corporation

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.220
for Science Advancement,
UniSource Energy

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.730
and Ventana Medical have paid
for this, and I thank you all.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.390
Last year, we asked
all of you what

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.840
would be an exciting lecture
series for this year.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.570
And many of you did respond
by email of your interests,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.280
and I guess we got it right.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.757
And the interest was cosmology,
and we've done cosmology.

00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:44.590
And today I'm as close
to God as I have ever

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.530
been, with Guy here,
who's come and given

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.520
a lecture about cosmology.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.500
Let me tell you a little bit
about Brother Guy Consolmagno.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.480
He's actually an alumni of
the University of Arizona.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.740
He was the fourth student
that came out of the planetary

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.570
Sciences Department--
which we're

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.320
so proud of, right-- which
came out of the Sputnik area.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.750
So Guy is the
fourth, and obviously

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.590
one of the most extraordinary
students that we've had.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.400
He's been in the Vatican
Observatory since 1993.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.080
His research
explores connections

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.420
between meteorites
asteroids and the evolution

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.580
of small solar system bodies.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.260
With the Vatican 1.8 metered
advanced technology telescopes,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.680
he surveys the broadband colors
and light curves of Kuiper belt

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.290
objects, using these
data to develop

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.970
an understanding of
their composition

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.790
and internal structures.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.020
Guy is truly an
amazing individual.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.136
He earned his undergraduate
and masters degree at MIT.

00:03:49.136 --> 00:03:52.280
He came to the U of A--
to a much better place--

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.280
to study planetary sciences.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.000
He arrived the second year that
the department was actually

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.090
open.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.810
And as I said before, he was
the fourth graduate student

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.190
out of the place.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.040
He's been a researcher
at Harvard and MIT,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.100
served the Peace Corps in
Kenya, and taught physics

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.860
at Lafayette College
in Pennsylvania,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.140
before deciding that the
whole thing was a mess.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.256
And he entered the
Jesuit order in 1989.

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:23.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.930
I don't know how
many of you saw Guy,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.656
but he actually was
on The Colbert Report.

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:29.030
And he's the only
individual I've

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.100
seen in The Colbert
Report that actually

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.260
had Colbert speechless, so
that's a feat in itself.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.910
He is a multifaceted scientist,
and I want to welcome--

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.030
I want to ask you to welcome
him as our first speaker

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.372
in this extraordinary series.

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:47.334
Thank you very much.

00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:56.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.000
It's fantastic to be back here.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.850
I think the only other time
I was ever in Centennial Hall

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.740
was to hear the Preservation
Hall Jazz Band in 1977.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.490
And I understand they're
coming back here.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.810
I wonder if it's the same guys.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.390
Tonight as you probably
know is the first

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.290
of six lectures on cosmology.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.350
And you've got a
wonderful group of experts

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.090
coming in and talking
about everything

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.290
from the Big Bang to dark
energy to the origin of life.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.220
By contrast my expertise
is not cosmology.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.902
It's actually the
study of meteorites.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.360
And this was probably
the only time

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.360
I get to mention
meteorites tonight.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.920
My role is a little
bit different

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.110
from the other speakers.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.080
I'm here to give
you an introduction

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.100
to the topic of
cosmology itself,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.220
as someone who is an outsider,
albeit a close outsider.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.640
Most of the speakers here have
been close friends of mine

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.559
for years.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.100
Michael Turner,
actually, was the one

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.480
who taught me
general relativity,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.330
back at the University
of Chicago 20 years ago.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.930
And so what I want
to do is show you,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.220
with some historical examples,
with a few stories, what

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.610
cosmology is, and
why it's interesting.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.490
In fact, why it matters.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.260
Now, I haven't
gotten that reaction.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.100
I probably shouldn't
mention the one connection,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.212
that the Jesuits
have with cosmology.

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:32.795
We're both worried
about missing mass.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.240
But since I'm standing up
here in a clerical collar,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.790
I do want to start
with tonight's lecture

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.760
with some readings
from Saint Paul.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.430
The first Paul's letter
to Timothy has in it,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.480
there is one God.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.520
There is also one
mediator between God

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.890
and humankind, Jesus
Christ, himself human

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.440
who gave himself as
a ransom for this,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.510
and who was attested
to at the right time.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.640
And then in Paul's
letter to the Ephesians

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.790
we read, God put this
power to work in Christ,

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.560
when he raised
him from the dead,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.710
and seated him at his right
hand in the heavenly places,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.970
far above all rule and authority
and power and dominion,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.390
above every name that is
named, not only in this age,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.010
but in the age to come.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.980
And he goes on to say, you were
dead through the trespasses

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.860
and sins in which he
once lived, following

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.110
the course of this
world, following

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.110
the ruler of the power
of the air or the spirit,

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.320
now at work among those
who are disobedient.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.510
And in his letter
to the Colossians,

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.430
Paul says of Jesus that he is
the image of the unseen God,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.650
the first born of all creation.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.870
In him we're created,
all things in heaven

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.990
and on Earth, everything
visible, everything invisible,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.470
thrones, ruling forces,
sovereignties, powers.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.620
All things were created
through him and for him.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.850
Now, one of the
remarkable things

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.880
about the letters of Saint
Paul, especially if you ever

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.720
hear them in church on Sunday,
is how utterly forgettable

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.520
they are.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.430
You see these words
whooshing past you.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.370
And you go, that sounds all very
nice, but what was that again?

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.810
What was he talking about?

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.960
If you're lucky, you might
catch a couple of key words

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.060
that only caught your
attention, because you

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.620
had no idea what he was
talking about, like mediator.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.109
What's this Jesus as mediator?

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:31.150
Why do I need a mediator?

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:31.900
You pray to God.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.567
God prays back or doesn't.

00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:38.890
The heavenly places--
what heavenly places?

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.990
Far above rule and authority
and power and dominion, thrones,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.410
ruling forces, sovereignties,
the ruler of the power

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.940
of the air--

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.720
what the heck is
he talking about?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.770
What he's talking
about is cosmology.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:02.020
Paul was assuming that his
readers and he were sharing

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.780
a common cosmology,
that used these terms

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.900
and knew what these
terms were all about.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.230
Now, most of us are familiar
with the classical view

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.210
of the universe, with
the Earth at the center,

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.750
and all the planets going, and
the sun going around the Earth.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.310
When you hear it
described that way,

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.476
you're probably thinking
of the Earth at the center,

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:22.540
with that little blue
ball that we've all seen,

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.950
and then moon with its
craters whizzing by,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.900
and Saturn with its
rings whizzing by,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.410
and Jupiter with its
moons whizzing by.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.750
No, that's not what this
picture is talking about.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.490
Cosmology is more than just
how the pieces are assembled.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.350
It's about the very nature
of the pieces themselves.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.080
Now, cosmology comes
from Greek words.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.710
It means words
about the universe.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.740
It was a term coined by the
17th century German philosopher,

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.780
Christian Wolff.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.660
And he wanted to describe
a kind of metaphysics

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.880
that talked about the totality
of everything that existed,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.390
or the nature of the universe,
based on logic and reason.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.590
It was the 17th century.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.830
They were big in logic
and reason in those days.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.630
More generally,
it's a word we can

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.220
use to refer to the world
picture of a culture, a school

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.390
of thought.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:24.960
And so in that sense
a cosmology is the sum

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.030
of all the assumptions you make,
about how the universe works.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.370
Some of those are assumptions
that you've sat down

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.199
and said, yes, I'm
going to assume this.

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:36.240
And some of those are
assumptions that you didn't

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.310
even know you were making.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.950
Because they're so built
into the culture, so built

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.470
into the way you were raised,
so built into the language

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.960
that you use, that
you don't even

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.380
appreciate how those
assumptions have colored,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.210
but not only the answers
you come up with,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.475
but the actual-- the questions
you even decide to ask.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.490
In the early 20th century, after
the advent of quantum physics

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.410
and Einstein's
theory of relativity,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.290
the word cosmology was taken
over by the astronomers.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.970
And so, nowadays, it represents
the scientific description

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.130
of the origin and nature
of the physical universe.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.450
But a cosmology can be
outlined in a way that

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.810
doesn't rely necessarily
on physics or astronomy.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.980
And these non-physics
cosmologies

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.710
have played important
roles in the development

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.700
of human thought, in the
way we understand ourselves.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.400
And there's this
constant feedback

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.190
between the assumptions we
make about what the universe is

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.190
about, and the science
we decide to do,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.170
the literature we
decide to write,

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.410
the art we decide to make.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.320
Ancient cosmologies started
with the observation

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.780
that the world was flat.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.410
Go outside.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.420
You can see the world was flat.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.380
There's a dome.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.270
You can go out and see the dome.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.509
Obviously, there must be
things above the dome,

00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:03.800
where you're hiding the hail
and the snow and the rain,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.410
because it leaks
through the holes.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.390
Because that's
where it comes from.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.985
Underneath the ground
is fire and brimstone.

00:12:11.985 --> 00:12:12.860
You don't believe me?

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.030
I can show you a volcano.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.600
You can show the
fire and brimstone.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.100
It's there.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.840
Anybody can see it.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.782
And there are waters
underneath the Earth,

00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:22.240
because that's where the water
goes after it stops raining.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.960
There are a lot of
different cultures

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.030
who have come up with
a similar picture.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.110
And in many cases, they've
even developed the picture,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.540
so that each of
those things that you

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.530
see crossing across the
sky, wandering through,

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.970
are themselves their own skies.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.040
There are different
levels of sky.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.650
There is one sky for the moon.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.960
There's another sky for
each of the planets.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.700
There's another sky for the sun.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.790
I was remembering I was
giving a talk on meteorites

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.197
to a group of Native Americans
in northern Wisconsin.

00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:02.280
And I was trying to describe,
what is a meteorite?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.446
Well, a meteorite is a rock
that falls from the sky.

00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:06.870
And an older woman raises
her hand, and she says,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.345
pardon me, which sky?

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.400
And I'm thinking, wow, that's
the question that Aristotle

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.620
or Thomas Aquinas
might have asked,

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.960
because it's out
of that cosmology.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.570
In a sense it's like saying,
which planet does it come from?

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.240
But, actually, it's
different, because there's not

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.240
thinking of planets
as places, the way

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.740
that we're used to
thinking of them.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.975
They're thinking of
them as realms of sky.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.130
Now, determining the
shape of the universe

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.610
from observation and reason,
began with the Greeks--

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.920
Parmenides, Pythagoras, Plato.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.550
All of them understood by
around the fifth century BC

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.240
that the world was round,
that the planets, the moon,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.090
and the sun were other
bodies, traveling somewhere

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.820
between the Earth and the stars.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.580
In one of his dialogues,
Timaeus, Plato

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.350
discusses whether
or not the universe

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.170
was always in existence, or
whether it had a starting

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.900
point.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.890
He argues that all things are
in the process of continually

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.300
being created.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.590
And that's in opposition
to what Parmenides said,

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.590
who said that all
matter was eternal.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.140
But the point is they
were already arguing

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.842
these points 500 years BC.

00:14:24.842 --> 00:14:27.920
The Pythagorean
mathematician, Eudoxus,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.370
explained the motions of the
planets, which are not simply

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.740
going past the stars, but
sometimes wander back,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.540
and then sometimes go forward.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.640
He described them in terms of
a series of concentric spheres

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.650
that were crystalline,
that would rotate on axes,

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.330
that themselves would rotate.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.480
So it was a very complicated
set of nested spheres.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.740
But out of this he could
explain what anyone with eyes

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.040
could see.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.340
Aristotle, of course,
took this and adapted it

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.470
to his physical universe.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.680
And he had the
notion that things

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.560
in the universe, the
material that you and I are

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.720
familiar with, are
made of four elements--

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.990
Earth, water, air, and fire.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.570
And one of the natures
of these objects

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.940
was that they would try to
travel to their natural place,

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.110
so that Earth, the brown
stuff, is at the center,

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.220
water is outside
of the brown stuff,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.290
air is outside of
the water, fire

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:38.960
is outside of-- because that's
why the fire element in a flame

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.020
is always going
upwards, so that if you

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.160
were to travel from the Earth
to the sphere of the moon,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.140
you would wind up traveling
through a ring of fire.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.900
Now, since there's only
one natural resting place

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.240
for Earth, obviously,
by necessity

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.740
there's only one Earth.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.000
And by necessity, there is
therefore only one universe.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.710
About 400 years after Aristotle,
the Roman era astronomer,

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.830
Ptolemy, used the observations
of the Babylonians

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.420
and the Greeks to flesh out
this geocentric cosmology.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.340
With mathematical rigor
he was able to work out

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.560
the idea of these
little epi-circles.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.184
I'm told there's a
laser pointer here.

00:16:27.184 --> 00:16:32.750
Yeah, this-- right, so
that you have Mercury

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.950
traveling around the Earth.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.800
But Mercury itself is also
traveling in little circles.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.260
In order to explain why,
when you observe Mercury,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.820
sometimes it goes back.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.750
And likewise all of
the planets traveling

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.190
around circles, which are not
exactly centered on the Earth--

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.130
because these circles have to
be a little bit off center,

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.700
in order to actually
match the observed

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.540
motions of the planets.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.790
But the thing was--

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.260
it worked.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.410
It worked to within the
limits of their observations.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:09.420
Mathematically he was able
to demonstrate the accuracy

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.380
of this geocentric cosmology.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.819
You've got a theory.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.050
You've got observations.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.550
The observations
match the theory.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.599
Hey, it's good science.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.670
It must be true.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.250
That's the assumption
that science

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.489
has worked on all along.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.570
And so this was accepted
for another 1,000 years.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.470
Now, the Ptolemaic
system was a long cry

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:38.150
from that biblical version,
of a flat Earth with a dome

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.540
and water above and below.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.000
Saint Augustine knew that.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.420
Writing well after Ptolemy
had been established,

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.580
he wrote a book
called On the Literal

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.610
Interpretation of Genesis.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.200
And he warned his
fellow Christians.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.894
He says, even a
non-Christian knows something

00:17:56.894 --> 00:17:59.060
about the Earth, the heavens,
and the other elements

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.120
of the world, about the motion
and the orbits of the stars,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.730
even about their sizes
and relative positions.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.160
Because Ptolemy was
able to work out that

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.660
the stars were very far away.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.730
The planets were
very far away, using

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.590
the geometry
available to him, even

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.210
with naked-eye observations.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.000
And this was well-known
throughout the world,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.830
throughout the educated world.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.340
This knowledge and
educated person has--

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.400
Augustine goes on, this
knowledge and educated person

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:33.000
holds as being certain from
reason and from experience.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.040
And he concludes it is a
disgraceful and dangerous thing

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.320
when an infidel--

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.360
here's a Christian
presumably giving

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.690
the meaning of Holy
Scripture, talking nonsense

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.755
about these things.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.730
It's clear that he
had his literalists.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.700
But it's also clear that
the educated Christians

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.230
understood, that's not how
you interpret scripture.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.147
Of course, one of the ironies
is that the sure knowledge

00:19:06.147 --> 00:19:07.730
of a science, that
he's talking about,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.979
was the Ptolemaic system
that we now know is nonsense.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.930
And so rather than this conflict
between the Ptolemaic system

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.480
and the biblical system leading
to some kind of Galileo trial

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.470
in the Early Middle Ages,
what really happened

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.010
was that most
theologians, at that time

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:34.990
and through the Middle Ages,
saw in this Ptolemaic cosmology

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.880
a reflection of the
nonphysical universe.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.130
Even if you assume
a spherical Earth,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.930
you still have this idea
that the physical universe

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:51.540
is a mirror of the
metaphysical universe.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.957
And if you had that picture
of the Earth at the center,

00:19:54.957 --> 00:19:56.790
and the planets going
around the Earth, that

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.400
doesn't mean the Earth is
the most important part.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.490
No, the Earth is
not at the center.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:08.020
It is at the bottom of
the chain of creation.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.880
The only thing lower
is the inferno,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.170
that fire and brimstone
I was talking about.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:18.300
And it's only after you get
past the lunarian sphere,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.760
that you finally
get to the realm,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:27.560
where things move eternally
in perfect circular motion.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.900
So it was not
self-centeredness that

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.150
said the Earth was the
center of the universe.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.700
It was a kind of
degradation that said,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.980
the Earth is the
bottom of the universe.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.910
And, in fact, there are those
writing in the Middle Ages

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.790
who make the point
that we, human beings,

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.507
are seeing the entire
universe inside out.

00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:49.090
The way that it
really works, you see,

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.530
is that there's God
we see at the outside.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:58.210
Because of a love of
God, the stars move--

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.600
literally moved by
love to try to imitate

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.660
the perfection of God, by
spinning at a constant rate.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.070
And their spin, in turn,
influences the inner spheres

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.585
to spin.

00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:13.000
And so this influence travels
down from sphere to sphere

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.030
to sphere, until you get to
the translunarian sphere.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.830
But, of course, these
influences continue

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.510
on to the astrology that
influences our lives on Earth.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.700
That was the chain they saw.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.210
But that chain is obviously
inverted from reality,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.890
because God is the center.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.860
And we are the ones
that are on the outside,

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.310
so far out that we're
barely noticeable.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.540
That was the medieval cosmology.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.630
A great source for this
kind of information,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.910
if you want to look up
further, is a wonderful book

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.834
by C.S. Lewis called
The Discarded Image.

00:21:49.834 --> 00:21:51.750
Now, everybody knows
C.S. Lewis is the guy who

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.708
wrote the Narnia books.

00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:56.310
You forget he had a day job.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.710
And his day job was
being a professor

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.920
of Renaissance and medieval
literature at Oxford.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.980
And he wrote this based on a
series of lectures he gave,

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.820
so that his students would
be able to understand

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:14.970
medieval literature, which
itself assumed this cosmology.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.330
You can't read Dante
without reading this stuff.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.720
You can't read Chaucer without
understanding the cosmology,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.820
that Chaucer thought
described the universe.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.330
And so to quote from
The Discarded Image,

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.420
"The spheres are moved
by the love of God.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.540
Each sphere or something
resident in the sphere

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.440
is a conscious and
intellectual being, moved

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.510
by intellectual love of God.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.710
The planetary intelligences
make a very small part

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.230
of the angelic
population, which inhabits

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.140
the vast aetherial
region, especially

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.140
the region between the
moon and the Primum Mobile,

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.030
so that from the
Earth, from the moon

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.640
on out to where you find God.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.250
Those regions are called
thrones, dominations,

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.400
et cetera."

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.320
Remember where we
heard those terms?

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.680
"Below the moon is the
realm of aerial beings,

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.980
which are known as demons.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.630
In some sources the
demons can be good or bad.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.610
Other sources divide
the good demons

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.670
into the upper air and the
bad demons in the lower air.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.920
By the time of the Middle
Ages," Lewis tells us,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.340
"the view gained ground
that all demons were bad."

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.650
In fact, they were
the fallen angels.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.480
And that's where D-A-E-M-O-N
became D-E-M-O-N.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.420
And this is just the
beginning of a census of all

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.560
of the strange and
marvelous creatures,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.010
that people assumed existed,
that we only see the faintest

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:48.099
reflection in modern fantasies,
like Lord of the Rings.

00:23:48.099 --> 00:23:49.890
All of the different
kinds of creatures you

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.390
see in Lord of the Rings were--

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:55.500
Tolkien was a scholar
reflecting this medieval view

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.570
of the universe.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.920
And, in fact, this view of
the universe, this cosmology,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.560
was a beautiful system.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.750
And it underlaid not only
the physics and astronomy

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.970
of the day, it
provided the framework

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.650
for the literature of the day--

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.940
Chaucer and Dante.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.380
It provided the framework
for the artwork of the day.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.310
To quote Lewis, again,
"There are few constructions

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.990
of the imagination
to have combined

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:30.490
such splendor, sobriety, and
coherence to the same degree."

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.620
He then goes on to write,
"It may be possible

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.930
that some readers have long
been itching to remind me,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.730
that it did have
a serious defect."

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:43.690
It wasn't true, but
it sure was beautiful.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.110
And this was the point
of Paul's letters,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.020
the things that I read
in the first place.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:57.030
Brian Purfield who is writing
for the British Jesuit

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:01.030
website, Thinking Faith,
interprets Paul's letters

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.220
as a reaction against
the cosmology.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.200
And I'm going to
quote him again.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.810
The people in Ephesus,
the people in Colossae

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.020
already had a view of the
world and their place in it.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.900
According to their
world view, the gods

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.550
were up there in the sky.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.500
The people were
down here on Earth.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.960
Between the gods and
themselves were a whole host

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.130
of intermediaries-- the demons.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.090
And if you're going to live
a happy life down here,

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.630
you've got to keep those
intermediaries happy.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.190
Because each of
them is in charge

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.010
of some part of
your earthly life.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.840
Now, Paul had gotten
word from Colossae

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.360
that the people there
were adopting Christianity

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.120
to their culture.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.060
And so when the
gospel preached to--

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.939
Colossians says that
Jesus is their mediator.

00:25:45.939 --> 00:25:47.730
They said, well, we
already have mediators.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.854
We've already got these
demons doing the mediating.

00:25:49.854 --> 00:25:51.780
What do we need Jesus for?

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.611
Or, at the very least, how
does Jesus fit into the system?

00:25:54.611 --> 00:25:55.860
Is he like the super mediator?

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.850
In other words, they were
trying to take the gospel,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.630
and superimpose it on their
already existing world view.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.500
And Paul doesn't
want them to do that.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.550
But, of course, as you can
see, it's a hopeless case.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.800
It's such an all-encompassing
world view, that they could not

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.137
conceive of life, religion,
living without assuming well,

00:26:24.137 --> 00:26:25.220
of course, there's demons.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.061
How else do you expect?

00:26:27.061 --> 00:26:28.310
You don't believe in the gods?

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.980
I can point them to you up in
the sky moving back and forth.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.500
Anybody can see
them for themselves.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:42.540
Meanwhile, back in India, we
have a very different cosmology

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.010
and a very different
take on things.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.000
Around the year 500,
Aryabhata was this marvelous

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.920
mathematician and astronomer.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.510
And in India at that time they
had not only phenomenally good

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.910
mathematics, but
they had the benefit

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:59.800
of having had the
Greeks around a few

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.750
100 years earlier,
who had brought them

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.780
all of the observational
evidence of the Babylonians.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.050
So they had about 1,000
years worth of observations

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.730
of the planets.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.380
And Aryabhata
around the year 500

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.370
has this radical idea,
that maybe the reason

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.800
we see the stars moving
from night to night,

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.680
during the night, is because
the Earth, which everybody

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.910
knows is round, is spinning.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.930
He came up with this idea
500 years before Copernicus.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.880
And if it's the Earth
spinning, then it's

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.420
the stars that are
standing still.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.544
Then what's really interesting
is, how long does it

00:27:36.544 --> 00:27:41.340
take for each of the planets
to move a complete circuit

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.520
through the fixed stars?

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.150
So we looked
through the records.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.941
And these are the
numbers he comes up with.

00:27:48.941 --> 00:27:53.990
He says, for Mercury if
you wait 125 Earth years,

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:59.260
Mercury makes 519 circuits
through the stars.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:04.340
Venus-- 251 Earth years
gives you 408 Venus years.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.540
On Mars 205 Earth years
gives you 109 planet years.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.470
So put this in a spreadsheet.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.170
Do the division for yourself.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.940
The calculated
period for Mercury

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.840
is 0.24 Earth years,
0.61519 Earth years--

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.640
1.88073.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.775
These are the modern
accepted periods--

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.020
pretty darn good.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.250
Now, I'm only quoting these
out to five decimal places,

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.190
for the reason that
it's not that we

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.310
don't know the period of Mars
to more than five places.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.970
It's because the period of Mars
is only constant to within five

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:45.470
places.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.930
It actually varies slightly
in the sixth place,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.260
depending on the perturbation
of Jupiter that year.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.310
So that this is as
good as-- accurate

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.280
as you're going to get.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.360
You can't do any
better than that.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.390
But Aryabhata is a
Hindu in a culture

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.650
that believes that the
universe repeats itself.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:11.380
And he's in a culture that
has phenomenal mathematics,

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:15.700
but hasn't yet invented
the decimal point.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.400
So he can't make
this calculation.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.870
All he can do is give you
these sets of numbers.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.530
But this divided by that
is a rational number.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.830
And this is actually
an irrational number.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:34.290
And the difference is only
in the fifth decimal place.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:39.780
But the difference is enough,
because being of a culture that

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.910
expected to find a
repeating universe,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.570
he then takes these numbers
and multiplies them together,

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.580
to find the common
denominator, which

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.580
would be the amount of time
it takes for the universe

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.290
to repeat itself.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.030
And it's a brilliant
calculation.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.965
And it's only off in
the fifth decimal place.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.840
But you can see how his
culture, his cosmology,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.750
has led him to ask a
question we would never ask.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.050
Because we know the planets
don't repeat themselves.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.040
They started arguing.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.706
And his followers
started arguing about,

00:30:15.706 --> 00:30:19.170
was there a time when all the
planets were exactly lined up?

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.870
And oh, by the way, since
the position of the planet

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.020
controls your
astrological horoscope,

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:29.490
this is clearly scientific proof
that not only does the universe

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.380
repeat itself, but that every
human action repeats itself,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.550
when we're on this endless
cycle and endless chain--

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.360
a very different cosmology
using the same observations,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:47.300
coming up with a very
different set of conclusions,

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.120
based on the questions
you expect to ask,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.554
and the answers that you
think you're looking for.

00:30:54.554 --> 00:30:59.840
Now, while this is going on--

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.900
skip ahead here
to my cheat sheet.

00:31:10.396 --> 00:31:11.520
Too many things in my hand.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.300
I'm going to drop that.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.766
I'm going to say, who
needs those pages?

00:31:18.766 --> 00:31:20.790
Get rid of that.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.910
Right.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:30.070
Yes, I'm going to move ahead
now to the Middle Ages, the year

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.910
1000.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.440
By the time of the Middle
Ages-- the High Middle Ages--

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.330
most of this Greek
and Roman learning

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.450
had been lost to the West.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.790
But it wasn't lost to
the Arabs, and it wasn't

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.100
lost in the Islamic world.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.650
There was a little bit of
crossover around the year 990,

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.400
980.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.580
There was an enterprising
young French scholar, Gerbert

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.140
d'Aurillac--

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.420
grew up near the
border of Spain, which

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.430
was Islamic in those days.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.620
He traveled to Barcelona.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.660
He'd learned the
secrets of the abacus

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.730
and the armillary sphere.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.480
He's the one who introduced
Arabic numerals to the West.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.710
His knowledge was so frightening
that people started rumors

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.640
that he was really a sorcerer.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.640
Now, I was looking for a
picture on the internet

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.645
of an armillary sphere
and a picture of Gerbert,

00:32:26.645 --> 00:32:28.020
and this is what
I came up with--

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:36.300
because, yes, he became
Pope Sylvester II.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.810
He was the one who
introduced Arabic numerals

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.640
to the Western world.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.510
And he was the one
that people thought

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:47.810
was a sorcerer, because
he could do mathematics.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:53.840
What finally happened was
about 100 years later in 1085,

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.790
the university in
Toledo, Spain was

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.410
captured by Christian forces.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.230
Its library was then
translated into Latin.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.970
And, finally, the
ancient knowledge

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.120
was reintroduced into
European universities.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.570
Now, at that time there
were certain aspects

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.880
to Aristotle's
thought, that appeared

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.790
to be in great conflict
with Christian teaching.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.270
For instance, Aristotle taught
that the universe was eternal.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.250
Genesis says, God
created the universe.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.730
Now, which is it?

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:25.260
In fact, Thomas
Aquinas, by the 1200s,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.500
had worked out a system
that meshed the two.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.900
He did it so well that
within a generation,

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.512
people thought that Aristotle
actually was a Christian.

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:34.470
He just didn't know it.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:42.330
However, the fact that there
were conflicts between theology

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:47.330
and the ancient wisdom inspired
a number of medieval thinkers.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.290
And here are two of them--

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.440
Maimonides and Bishop
Nicholas of Cusa.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.490
To look with a critical eye
at the Aristotelian thought,

00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:01.530
and to try to develop new ideas,
and to try to expand or alter

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.130
the cosmology of Aristotle,
rather than simply glomming it

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.370
on wholeheartedly, and assuming
that Christianity could be

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.850
built on top of
it, it's sometimes

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.560
thought that the
Renaissance would

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.310
have happened by around
the mid-1400s, if it hadn't

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.500
been for the Black Death.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.020
The plague reduced the
population of Europe

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.199
by a third.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.909
And the population
of Europe didn't

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.639
recover to where it
was in these years,

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.544
until the time of
the Renaissance

00:34:30.544 --> 00:34:31.460
that we actually know.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.150
And it's worth
noting that anyone

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:44.320
who tried to develop
an alternate cosmology,

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.800
had to face certain
serious scientific ideas.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.260
We know the
Copernican system that

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.199
showed the-- explained why Venus
has phases and such things.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:57.100
Tycho Brahe, the fellow
on the left here,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.480
actually developed a
famous system here,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.550
where the Earth
is at the center.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.870
The moon goes around the Earth.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.130
The sun goes around the Earth.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.610
All the other planets
go around the sun.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.510
And in this way,
he actually had all

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:17.170
of the benefits of
the Copernican system,

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.320
without any of
the disadvantages.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.480
For example, Brahe also
measured the positions

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.170
of stars very carefully,
and was able to show

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.740
no parallax, no little dodging
of the stars back and forth,

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.110
from one time of the year,
to another time of the year,

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.160
thus proving the
Earth doesn't move.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.160
In fact, there is a marvelous
thing that has just come out--

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.720
a fellow named Graney who's
doing history of science.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.810
If you wanted to show whether
or not there was parallax,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.580
as the Earth moves,
shouldn't you

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.700
see the relative positions
of the stars shift about?

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.410
To do that you would
want two stars that

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:56.370
were really close to each other,
but one much closer to you

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.000
than the other, so that if you
move your head back and forth--

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.370
my head moves differently
from how the screen moves.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.050
Because I'm in a
different position,

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.930
and that's how you know
that actually you're moving.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.210
Well, what you need are
two stars of very different

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.750
brightness, so that, obviously,
the brighter star is closer

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.510
to you, and the dimmer
star is further away,

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.900
that are real close
to each other.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:24.050
Galileo observed Mizar,
the easiest double star.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.610
And he observed
it very carefully

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:29.516
over a period of two years,
looking for such a motion.

00:36:29.516 --> 00:36:30.890
Because rather
than understanding

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.174
that Mizar is a dim star,
orbiting a bright star,

00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:35.090
he thought it was two
stars that just happened

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.890
to be in the same line--

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.680
an optical double,
but one further away.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:44.810
He was unable, obviously, to see
such a motion, which disproved

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.810
the Copernican system.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.226
So like a good
scientist, he never

00:36:47.226 --> 00:36:48.820
bothered to publish his results.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.900
But the real story I
want to talk about here,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.940
the story of cosmology,
is not the story

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.356
of Brahe so much, but the story
of the fellow next to him,

00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:02.480
Johannes Kepler.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.720
Kepler, basically,
inherited Brahe's data.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:11.630
But he also had along with this
wonderfully precise description

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.420
of the positions of
the planets over time,

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.020
which Brahe's system more
or less is able to produce,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.380
he had an interesting
philosophical system.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.670
Now, let's actually look
at the Ptolemaic system

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:31.029
versus the Brahe system, or the
Copernican and the Ptolemaic.

00:37:31.029 --> 00:37:33.320
Here you've got the Earth,
and things are going around,

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.060
and they've all got
little epicycles.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.286
Copernicus moves the
sun to the center,

00:37:38.286 --> 00:37:40.160
and he's got everything
going around the sun.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.220
But, still, the planets
have little epicycles.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.990
And, still, each
of the planets is

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.040
orbiting a spot that's not
exactly the center of the sun.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:56.060
And, in fact, the sun itself is
making a little dodgy circle.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.930
And he needs to do this in order
to preserve the appearances,

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.870
in order to actually
accurately predict,

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:07.290
where a planet can be
seen on any given night,

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:11.760
because both of these
systems assume that planets

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.750
move in perfect circles.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:19.400
Now, Kepler had
a different idea.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.720
Kepler's brilliant insight
is that, as we all know,

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.500
the physical universe mirrors
the metaphysical universe.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.810
If you're going to put
the sun at the center--

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.060
the sun is the most brilliant.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.310
The sun is the most wonderful.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:39.139
Obviously, the sun
represents God.

00:38:39.139 --> 00:38:41.430
But since he's a Christian
and believes in the Trinity,

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.170
it's God the Father.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.480
The light that
comes off of the sun

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.560
is the Holy Spirit, pouring
off of God the Father.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.870
And when it falls on
the sphere of the Earth,

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.130
it's the sphere of the Earth.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.520
That's the second
person of the Trinity.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.680
Now, if the sun is
actually the mirror of God,

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.970
it can't be making this stupid
little dance around nothing.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.180
God doesn't do that.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.810
Instead what must
be happening is

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.760
that the sun must
be standing still,

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.180
and the planets are doing
some other kind of motion.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.850
And the kind of motion that
allows this cosmology to work

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.820
is if you assume the planets
are moving in ellipses.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.452
It was on the basis of this
wacko theology, which nobody

00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:31.660
at the time but him believed.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.940
But in order to make
the sun look beautiful--

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.010
I'm stealing all
of this from a book

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:44.925
by Job Kozhamthadam who taught
me philosophy of science.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.940
Oh, he's got a wonderful
letter in his book.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:55.120
This is a letter from
Kepler to Herbert von

00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.630
Hohenburg, "The center is
the origin and the beginning

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.320
of the sphere.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.290
Indeed the origin has precedence
everywhere, and by his nature

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.850
always the first.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:09.600
When we apply this consideration
to the most Holy Trinity,

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.110
the center must refer to
the image of God the Father.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.780
Hence, the center of this
material world sphere

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.145
should be adorned by the most
ornate body that is the sun."

00:40:23.497 --> 00:40:25.580
Now, the fact that he had
this ludicrous theology,

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.770
meant that nobody really
paid much attention,

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.630
to the rest of his astronomy.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.750
He would send these
books to Galileo.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.200
And Galileo would look at
them and say, that nut,

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.570
and toss them in the
corner and never read them.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.950
And most other people did that.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:41.510
The only person
apparently who did

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:46.550
read them was Edmond Halley,
who then told Newton about it.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:51.290
And that gave rise to Newton's
attempting and succeeding

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.080
in using his law of gravity, to
explain the elliptical orbits.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.590
Now, notice a
common trait in all

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.960
of the different ways of
putting the universe together,

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.360
that we've looked at so far.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.292
Up to a point there is
an unspoken assumption--

00:41:10.292 --> 00:41:11.750
an assumption that
nobody even knew

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.020
they were making, because it was
so obvious to them, that when

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.730
you're talking about
astronomy, you're

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.710
also talking about religion.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.270
One tells you how
to go to heaven.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.160
The other tells you
how the heavens go.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.040
That's the famous quote.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.860
Cardinal Baronius said that
in defense of Galileo--

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.310
at the time of Galileo--

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.920
and it's a marvelous quote,
except that they're still

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.200
referring to the same heaven.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.940
The physical and
the metaphysical

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.780
really don't divide, until
you get to Isaac Newton.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.710
Now, the physics of
Isaac Newton finally

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.240
provided a viable replacement.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.520
Do you recognize what it is?

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.019
This is according
to the sign there.

00:41:53.019 --> 00:41:56.302
That's the tree planted
by one of the apples, that

00:41:56.302 --> 00:41:57.510
hit Isaac Newton in the head.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.248
This is actually in Cambridge.

00:42:01.937 --> 00:42:03.020
I got it off the internet.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.320
The new physics of Isaac Newton
provided a viable replacement

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.530
for Aristotle's system.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.850
Finally, you not only
had a different way

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.920
of describing where
the planets were,

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.030
you had a different way of
explaining why the planets were

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.460
where they were.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.960
And it relied on
physical laws that

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.700
applied exactly the same to
objects in space, as to apples

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.050
from trees.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:39.520
And that was the magic and
remarkable breakthrough,

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.090
and the total disrupting
of the old way of thinking

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:46.270
of the universe, into a new way
of thinking of the universe.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.300
The Earth and everything
on it was no longer

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.850
at the bottom of creation.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:56.880
It had been elevated to equality
with the rest of the planets.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.050
And this new way of
looking at the universe

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:08.080
gave rise to an
overt assumption,

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.990
one that is carried forth
in all cosmology even today.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:17.370
There is no privileged
place in the universe.

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:19.350
The laws that
govern the universe

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.090
are the same everywhere.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:24.420
Material is the same everywhere.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.010
And deductions
about the universe

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.290
derived in one place
in the universe,

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:30.700
based on observations
from that place,

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.800
also ought to be true
in any other place.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.120
And this cosmological
assumption is still

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.890
the fundamental
assumption, that underlies

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.140
everything you're going to
hear in the next six weeks.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.060
Just as the Earth is one
place among several places,

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.420
the sun now becomes one
star among many stars.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.730
And so speculations
about other worlds,

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.884
which have been going on
since medieval times--

00:43:57.884 --> 00:43:59.300
the medieval idea
of another world

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.920
was basically a
parallel universe.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.590
Now, it's simply another star
with other planets going around

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:05.090
it.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.390
Galileo's telescope had shown
that the Milky Way was actually

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.000
a collection of
individual stars.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.070
And the lack of
parallax of the stars

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.965
shows that the stars
are really far away.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.930
So the stars can't be shining
by reflected sunlight.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.690
They must actually
have their own light.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.860
And then in 1755, Immanuel
Kant, writing in the Universal

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.710
Natural History and
Theory of the Heavens,

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.960
carries this one step
further and says,

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.130
those discs of light that
we see may themselves

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:42.560
be island universes, analogous
to our own Milky Way.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.640
And this discussion-- this
idea was argued vehemently

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.320
for the next 200 years.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.730
This is a paper by William
Herschel, where he actually--

00:44:52.730 --> 00:45:00.530
that bright star in the center
there represents the sun.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:04.640
And this is his idea
of the farthest star

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.570
he can see in every direction,
away from the sun, based

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.900
on his telescope, out
of which he deduces

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.675
that we are in a disc of stars.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.220
Of course, he still has
the Earth and the sun

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:26.280
at the center of the disc, but
he has it that we're a disc.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.640
And he realizes that
there are other discs that

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.215
may well be other Milky Ways.

00:45:32.215 --> 00:45:34.590
As we are used to calling the
appearances of the heavens,

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.890
where it is surrounded with
a bright zone, the Milky Way,

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.610
it may not be a myth to point
out some other very remarkable

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.920
nebulae, which
cannot-- will be less,

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.580
but are probably much
larger than our own system.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:51.570
And being also extended, the
inhabitants of the planets that

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:55.710
attend to the stars, which
compose them must likewise

00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.360
perceive the same
phenomena, for which reason,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:06.420
they may also be called Milky
Ways by way of distinction.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:11.470
This is 1795.

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:16.930
That was the development of
cosmology in the Newtonian era.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:21.020
And then Einstein comes along.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.840
In 1916, Einstein described
in his general theory

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.030
of relativity, how space
and time and matter

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:28.640
are all interrelated,
how the force of gravity

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:33.340
can be understood as a
warping of spacetime.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:34.900
And then he's got a problem.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.700
Because if gravity is
the warping of space

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.780
and the universe is
infinite in space and time,

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.870
then given the infinite amount
of time the universe is around,

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:51.500
all of the universe should have
warped itself into one point.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.620
Obviously, it hasn't.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.760
What's going on?

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.010
The best Einstein
can come up with is

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.450
to find a place
in his equations,

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.580
where he can stick a
number, that he's calling

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.040
the cosmological constant
just, OK, there's

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.210
a fudge factor here that's
keeping the universe separated.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.840
I hate it.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.480
It looks inelegant,
but there it is.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.380
At the same time there
is a Russian, Friedmann,

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:22.040
who has the idea that an
expansion of the universe

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.960
could obviate the need for
this cosmological constant.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.860
But it's actually this
guy in the familiar collar

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:35.930
who also has a familiar ring,
because he was an MIT graduate.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.089
But he was not a Jesuit.

00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:39.380
He hated being called a Jesuit.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.300
He was a diocesan priest.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.290
He was from Belgium.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.120
His name was Georges Lemaitre.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.590
And he actually had two PhDs.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:48.920
His first PhD was from Louvain,
and it was in mathematics.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.350
He was fundamentally
a mathematician.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:54.860
But he did post-doctoral work
with Eddington in Cambridge,

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.430
came across the equations
that Einstein used

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:58.970
to describe general relativity.

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:00.920
And being a
mathematician, he could

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.250
read the equations of
mathematics, the way

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.980
that an English major
can read a poem,

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.850
and pull out information,
and see the implications

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:11.570
within the math.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:16.880
And he says, expansion
is in these equations.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.460
The cosmological constant is
not necessarily a bad idea.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.600
Don't get rid of it.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.250
But expansion is built into it.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:25.730
You can build an
entire cosmology,

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.670
based on the idea of
an expanding universe.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.130
And this fits in, in fact,
with quantum theory, which

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:33.290
is also being developed
at the same time.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:37.010
What if the universe started
at a point of incredibly

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:41.300
high quantum number, and because
of the energy of this point

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:47.540
is expanding from what
he calls a cosmic seed?

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.490
This, of course, means
that the universe

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:53.180
has a starting point in time.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.305
And this guy is a priest.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.070
We know where this is going.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.300
Fred Hoyle, who is another
cosmologist of the era,

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.670
made fun of this theory
by referring to it

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.330
as this Big Bang theory.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.059
Fred Hoyle was
viciously anti-clerical.

00:49:17.059 --> 00:49:19.100
You can picture what would
happen when Fred Hoyle

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.840
and Georges Lemaitre meet.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.340
They were best of
friends, actually.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.760
They went on vacations together.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.000
They were good buddies.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.550
They got along great, because
they were both interested

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.570
in the same things.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.790
But they came out of
different systems.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.730
To Hoyle, the idea of
a universe that was not

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.690
eternal and infinite, was so
contrary to the way he had

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.840
been raised as a cosmologist.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.540
Because it says that there
is, if not a particular place

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.760
that's special, a particular
time that's special,

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.419
that violates the
cosmological principle,

00:49:51.419 --> 00:49:53.960
forgetting that the cosmological
principle was after all just

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.820
an assumption.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:03.311
Lemaitre, on the other hand, was
very much at pains to say, no.

00:50:03.311 --> 00:50:04.560
Somebody is trying to call me.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.143
How dare they?

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.560
No, I'm not coming
up with this as a way

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.940
to try to rescue Genesis.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.680
Please don't say that.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.207
It's because it's
in the equations.

00:50:15.207 --> 00:50:16.290
You look at the equations.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:17.820
You can see the same thing.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.380
And, hey, we'll test it.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.730
We'll ask Edwin Hubble.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.100
Does he see galaxies
moving apart or not?

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.270
And, of course, he does
see galaxies moving apart.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:28.205
So Hoyle comes up with
an alternate cosmology--

00:50:28.205 --> 00:50:29.580
and you'll get
all of this story.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.500
I'm sure in the next--

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:38.720
the one interesting story
is in 1951, Pope Pius XII--

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.460
this is him visiting
our observatory

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.470
in about that time--

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:46.760
gave an address to the
Pontifical Academy of Sciences,

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.909
which is a group of
about 100 scientists

00:50:48.909 --> 00:50:50.450
from around the
world, who were there

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:52.634
to advise the church
on scientific issues.

00:50:52.634 --> 00:50:54.800
And they're not all Catholics
and not all believers.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.080
Stephen Hawking is a member
of the Pontifical Academy.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.150
And as addressing
these people he says,

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:03.690
isn't it interesting that
modern cosmology is now talking

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.311
about a beginning point?

00:51:05.311 --> 00:51:05.810
Cute.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.030
And Lemaitre hears about this.

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:14.250
And he's going, no,
no, don't say that.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.900
You're undoing everything
I've been trying to say.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.900
In 1952, the year
after this account,

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.460
the IAU, the International
Astronomical Union,

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.650
was scheduled to meet in Rome.

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:29.320
And they had invited the pope
to give some opening remarks.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.210
And, suddenly, the
rumor is going around.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.700
The pope is going to
endorse the Big Bang

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:37.420
theory as Catholic doctrine.

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.610
Lemaitre, who, after all,
invented the Big Bang theory

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:42.750
is terrified.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:44.990
And he goes, and he gets
an audience with the pope,

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:49.004
and he says, please, don't.

00:51:49.004 --> 00:51:50.420
And, in fact, if
you actually read

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.836
the pope's earlier
statement, it's

00:51:51.836 --> 00:51:55.282
very clear that he understands,
no, this is just a curiosity.

00:51:55.282 --> 00:51:57.740
I'm not actually saying this
is the way it really happened,

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.230
because who knows what
cosmology is going to look

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:03.040
like in a thousand years?

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.480
And when it came
time for the pope

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:08.359
to address the people at the
IAU, all he said was, you guys,

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:09.400
I love what you're doing.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:18.180
Keep it up-- which what more can
you ask a head of state to say?

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.900
The point is that
even today people

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:26.310
try to use the Big Bang
theory, either as a proof of,

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.830
or a proof against--

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.770
Stephen Hawking has a book
that just came out that shows,

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:36.990
oh, I figured out a way that
the gravitational interactions

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:40.260
in a vacuum can actually lead to
the spark that is the Big Bang.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.970
We don't need God anymore.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:44.250
It just spontaneously occurred.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:51.230
This cartoon
appeared as a result.

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:57.000
The fact is, of course, that
Stephen Hawking is right,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.900
that using God to explain
all the things that we can't,

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.540
whether it's the
start of the universe,

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:10.190
or the motions of the planets,
or why trees grow, reduces God

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:12.969
to a nature God,
reduces God to nothing

00:53:12.969 --> 00:53:15.260
more than the God of thunder,
and the God of lightning,

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:19.100
and he's just Zeus, or, at the
very least, one physical force

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.200
alongside all the
other physical forces.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.510
And going back to
what Saint Paul was

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:27.570
trying to tell his
followers, that's

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.850
not the way to think of God.

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:35.940
You can't tie your religion
to any one cosmology.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:41.110
But this does have
an interesting twist,

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:44.260
about the nature of
our deeper beliefs,

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:47.350
our culture, and our cosmology.

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:52.730
I love this wonderful
phrase from Chesterton,

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:54.590
"The Earth is so very large.

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.776
The cosmos is so very small.

00:53:56.776 --> 00:53:58.400
It's about the smallest
hole that a man

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.060
can hide his head in."

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.520
What is he talking about here?

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.160
He's talking about
the Earth, the reality

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:13.130
of our lives, the cosmos as
the ideas we have in our head,

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:15.260
about how the universe
works, compared

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.870
to the way the
universe really is.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.390
And what is fascinating is
that the major religions that

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:25.770
have been around
for a long time,

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:29.680
whether it's Christianity,
Judaism, Islam,

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.410
the animists, the Hindus--

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:38.630
religions that have survived
a change in cosmology

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:43.640
grow as a result. They
get wiser as a result.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.640
They recognize what
stuff is essential

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.370
and what stuff was
just cultural baggage.

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:55.200
Sometimes the way you learn
is to run into somebody

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.530
you disagree with vehemently.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:54:59.730
It works in science.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.250
You get a paper in the mail,
and you say, that's not right.

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:04.860
That can't be right.

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.940
OK, where did he go wrong?

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.970
And in working
that out you learn

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.340
something, that you never would
have thought about before.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:17.510
Sometimes recognizing that
the cosmology we're in,

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.380
the culture that we're
in, is inadequate,

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:25.100
is a brilliant way of
growing both our own culture,

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.320
our own religion,
our own philosophy,

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.510
and our cosmologies.

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:32.280
Because one thing I
think you're going

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.500
to find all of the
next five speakers

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.750
agreeing on, is
that half of what

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.390
you're going to hear in the
next five weeks is wrong.

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:46.740
We just don't know which
half yet, but that's OK.

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.710
That's what makes it fun.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:54.480
And rather than being
afraid of a new cosmology,

00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:02.110
we have to look at it as an
opportunity to recognize,

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:05.050
how much more wonderful,
and how much more beautiful

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:08.050
this universe is.

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.720
And I end with one last
quote from Chesterton,

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.700
which I just
stumbled across as I

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.580
was putting the
talk together, and I

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:18.790
think gives us that sense
of the proper attitude,

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:21.950
that every scientist has
towards the universe.

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.730
He says, "The essence
of all pantheism

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:26.320
is that nature is our mother.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.480
The main point of
Christianity is

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.600
that nature is not our mother.

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.850
Nature is our sister."

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:34.710
He says, "Nature
was a solemn mother

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.260
to the worshippers
of Isis and Cybele,

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.580
a solemn mother to
Wordsworth and Emerson.

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:44.730
But to Saint Francis, nature
is a sister and even more,

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:48.780
a younger sister, a
little dancing sister,

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:52.630
to be laughed at
as well as loved."

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:57.760
And that is the attitude
that we can embrace and enjoy

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.500
the universe, and our
study of the universe.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:01.750
Thanks a whole lot for coming.

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:34.440
We'll have a few minutes here
for question and answers.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.440
There are going to be a
few folks walking around

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.040
with microphones.

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:44.480
But just in case you don't get
the answers you want today,

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:49.910
Brother Guy is going to be
on astronaut.com tomorrow

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:51.950
at 12:00 noon.

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:52.649
So you can do--

00:57:52.649 --> 00:57:55.190
I don't know how to do this,
but you can get on the computer,

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.110
and talk to him
through the computer.

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:59.970
It's the new cosmology, I guess.

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:01.640
So just remember that.

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:02.680
Astronaut.com.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.390
So do you see any supernatural
aspect or evidence

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:15.830
to the universe, and,
if so, how would it look

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:18.670
different, absent that aspect?

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:26.090
I think my religion informs my
way of looking at the universe,

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:30.800
but it doesn't define
it or control it.

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.830
It rather explains why
I'm interested in looking

00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:35.850
in the universe in
the first place.

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.100
It doesn't tell me what to do.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:40.980
It tells me why
I want to do it--

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:46.080
the fact that I find astronomy,
not only rational, but also

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:51.597
fun, that I find
the ability to guess

00:58:51.597 --> 00:58:53.430
that this theory is
better than that theory,

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:55.680
because it's more beautiful.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.270
To me, those are reflections
of the nature of the Creator.

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.002
And that's very
different from saying,

00:59:02.002 --> 00:59:03.960
it must have been this
way, because I know God,

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.850
and God would have
done it that way.

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:07.140
That doesn't work.

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.670
Because I don't
know God that well.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:09.820
I can't get away with that.

00:59:15.972 --> 00:59:17.420
Excuse me.

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.410
I'm just dying to know, what
did you tell the woman--

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:25.040
the Indian woman
who said, which sky?

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.410
What did you tell her?

00:59:29.269 --> 00:59:31.310
I don't remember-- probably
something like that's

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.206
a wonderful question.

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:40.944
It is that I don't
know how to answer it.

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:42.360
And if you were
to ask it today, I

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.651
wouldn't know how to answer it.

00:59:50.441 --> 00:59:50.940
Here we go.

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:56.710
A fascinating lecture--
what I gather from this

00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:02.320
is that you view all
cosmologies as transient.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.780
All of science is
transient, in the fact

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.060
that a thousand years from
now, the science books

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.580
are going to look real different
from the way they are now.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:13.330
But where we are now is
a necessary place to be,

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.720
to get to where we're going
to be in a thousand years.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.100
Oh, good segue.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.475
I wanted to ask you a question.

01:00:19.475 --> 01:00:20.980
Oh, OK, sure.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.270
We'll get to that.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:27.310
How will we recognize
in the public, us,

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:34.110
people in the audience, when
a new cosmology is rising,

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:36.220
and how do we test it?

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.100
In the public it's really hard.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.580
The trouble is that the things
that get reported in the news

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:48.790
are new, and by their
nature, they're uncertain.

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:50.770
People have done
studies of science

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.960
as it's covered
in the newspapers.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.770
And it's generally
wildly inaccurate,

01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:59.800
not because of any
fault of the reporters,

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.350
but because the new
stuff itself turns out

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:03.430
to be wildly inaccurate--

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:07.330
50% wrong, and we didn't
know yet where the 50% was.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:15.250
So my sense is to allow yourself
to be entertained by new ideas.

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:19.050
But don't sell
your soul to them.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.980
Essentially, it takes about
a generation for an idea

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.054
to become well
enough established,

01:01:25.054 --> 01:01:26.470
that you can have
some confidence,

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:30.300
that it's a sure stepping
stone to go further.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.650
And science does
proceed rather slowly.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:39.420
There is a consensus effect
when a lot of scientists

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.390
think that we can get
someplace with this.

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:46.880
But there's also the sense
of, does it bear fruit?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.230
Do new, good ideas
come out of it,

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:52.050
that we wouldn't have had
before, that explain things,

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:55.500
maybe we didn't even know
needed explaining before?

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.690
And that's why things
like string theory

01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:00.150
are so suspect,
because the string

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.580
theorists seem to have run into
a brick wall at the moment.

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.420
There was a guy in our
community, a Jesuit from Italy,

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.560
who's doing string theory.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.020
And he's as
frustrated as anyone.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.020
But it could be-- you want
to give the next breakthrough

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:13.830
around the road.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.330
You don't want to
give up on it yet.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:18.800
It's still one of the best
things we've got going.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.260
But there are a lot of
places where we're stuck.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.220
This stuff is hard.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.310
One of the things
that I worry about--

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:27.710
and I've mentioned the
unspoken assumptions.

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.480
We have a generation.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.740
We have how many generations
of physics students who

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.230
have been educated
in our universities,

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:40.490
since the advent of quantum
theory, since the realization

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:43.760
that Newtonian physics
is fundamentally untrue?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.710
And, yet, how do we teach them?

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:48.690
We teach them Newtonian physics.

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:50.504
And there's a lot of
practical reasons.

01:02:50.504 --> 01:02:52.670
It allows you to build
bridges that don't fall down.

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:54.003
You can get a job with it.

01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.170
But when it comes to
trying to understand

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:03.650
the nature of physics
in physical reality,

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:07.920
are we doing our students a
disservice by getting them

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.781
to go think in the habit
of Newtonian physics,

01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:14.280
when, in fact, maybe those are
the wrong habits to think in?

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.836
And, yet, how would you teach
a 17-year-old quantum physics,

01:03:18.836 --> 01:03:20.710
without teaching him
Newtonian physics first?

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.140
We haven't figured that out yet.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.060
So we've got a long way to go.

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.500
And that's why it's so much fun.

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:32.890
Well, thank you very much.

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:33.860
I think that's good.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.296
Great, thanks.

01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:35.796
Thank you.

01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:37.275
Thank you, very much.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.385
Next week we will
have Chis Impey.

01:03:46.385 --> 01:03:47.760
Many of you know
Chris Impey will

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.135
be talking about the origin
of the universe, the Big Bang

01:03:50.135 --> 01:03:50.970
theory.

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:54.420
And there's also these
papers out there that have

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.010
if you fill out--

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.260
and you're lucky enough,
we're going to have--

01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.970
we'll give you a
telescope, actually,

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.560
if you are the winner.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.450
So fill it out, and thank you
very much for coming tonight.
