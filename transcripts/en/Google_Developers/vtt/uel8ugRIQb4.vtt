[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:08.140
LAURENCE MORONEY: Today I'm
meeting with Joanna Smith

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.950
to learn about patterns that I
can use to improve my Android

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.661
performance.

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.160
So, Joanna, I know you've been
working on this video series,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.871
"Android Development Patterns,"
and you've done a lot of videos

00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.370
on there.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.860
But tell us what
is it all about,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.090
and where did it come from?

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.340
JOANNA SMITH: The original
inspiration actually

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.730
was to be a little different.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.420
Most of our outreach
focuses on how an API works.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.900
Whereas we wanted to teach
how to decide on an API

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.180
in the first place.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.200
Let's say you're trying
to choose this or that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.340
for a particular situation.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.381
You need to know the
advantages and disadvantages

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:37.220
for the context.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.178
And most people, like
choosing the first answer

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:40.940
they get on Stack
Overflow, will never

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.732
understand that context,
which means later,

00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:44.523
when they grow their
app and their company,

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:46.000
and it becomes big
and complicated,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.070
they can't make
the best decision.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.486
And I wanted to
empower developers

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:49.940
to be able to make better apps.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.650
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.191
And you do this
through teaching them

00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:54.960
patterns rather than a specific
API or something like that.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.420
And my understanding is
for a lot of the patterns,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.210
is that once you've gotten it,
once you've gotten it down,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.270
you can reuse that
again and again.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.730
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.880
That's that context.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.285
Like once you've understood
not just what the answer was,

00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:05.910
but how you reached
that answer, you'll

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.660
be able to make
decisions in the future.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.190
And I think that's
great for developers.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.620
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.953
Now, you've done a ton of these.

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:13.120
There's a wide variety
of diverse videos.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.620
So shall we take a look at a
quick montage of some of those?

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.750
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah,
let's do a review.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.530
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.020
-So now you have
three components

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.666
that will help you interrupt
your users in the perfect way.

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.290
Use the dialog when
the user's response

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.830
is critical to your app
flow, because you need to be

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.360
disruptive in these moments.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.250
But use a toast to give the user
a tidbit of information that

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.880
doesn't change anything.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.890
And for everything in
between, the snack bar

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.290
is your new best friend.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.570
So if your user is
on an older SDK,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.310
then you know the
permission was granted

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.130
when the app was installed.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.120
However, if your
user's on Marshmallow,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.700
then you can't be so certain.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.340
-Android notifications
have gotten a lot better.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.300
Ever-evolving APIs don't
always make for the easiest

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.690
development experience.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.280
And that's why there's
NotificationCompat.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.440
It gives you a single interface
across all API levels,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.020
so you can concentrate
on building

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.370
the best notification you can.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.880
In the case of a
fragment pager adapter,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.120
you'll need to
implement GetItem,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.012
which returns a fragment
associated with each position.

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:10.642
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:12.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you've
done a lot of work here--

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.600
lots of videos, lots
of other content.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.959
Where can I find it all?

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.250
JOANNA SMITH: Well, on YouTube.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.370
We have a playlist.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.099
Look at that.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.890
We also, though, have
a bunch of blog posts

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.971
on Medium under the Google
Developers publication.

00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.720
Ian and I are both
very active on Twitter.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.386
We have Google+.

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:29.410
There's a collection that
kind of puts all this together

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.304
on Google+, so everywhere
on the internet.

00:02:32.304 --> 00:02:34.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: We'll
share the links below.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.140
JOANNA SMITH:
Sounds like a plan.
