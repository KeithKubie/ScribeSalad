00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.160
Scientists have created a clock that is even
more accurate than the atomic clock.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.220
Because scientists love to be punctual.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.220
Anthony here for Dnews.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.160
And a new type of atomic clock has been created.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.810
It is called an optical lattice clock.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.160
And while current atomic clocks are off a
second every hundred million years, optical

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.070
lattice clocks only loses a second every three
hundred million years.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.390
Now current atomic clocks use microwaves to
make cesium atoms oscillate at almost exactly

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.400
nine billion one hundred ninety two million
six hundred thirty one thousand seven hundred

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.850
seventy times per second.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.430
An optical lattice clock uses lasers to make
strontium atoms oscillate.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.770
Strontium is the new cesium.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.880
It's so hot right now.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.770
And strontium oscillates many more times a
second.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.860
Meaning we can measure each second more precisely.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.140
As a rational person, you might be thinking,
"That does not make my watch or my mobile

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.720
phone any more accurate."

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.720
Valid.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.820
But this is not about you and me getting home
in time to watch Hanibal, this is going to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.780
affect some really serious stuff.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.780
"Like what?"

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.520
Oh, I don't know...our ability to figure out
the entire fabric of the universe.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.659
So think about CERN, the Large Hadron Collider.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.130
We're launching these incredibly tiny sub-atomic
particles at each other from miles away almost

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.899
the speed of light and watching them collide
tells us new things about the nature of matter.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.499
Those collisions last incredibly small fraction
of a second and the particles can go through

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.200
millions of transformations while it's happening.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.649
So to make something like that happen accurately
and to make sense of it once it does, you're

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.289
going to need some really sensitive, really
synced up, time keeping instruments.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.420
But what about something more practical?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.420
Take GPS.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.299
To find out where you are, multiple satellites
orbiting the earth in different directions

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.179
pinpoint you as the planet rotates under them
at a thousand miles an hour.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.060
So they compare where they saw you and when
to get your current position.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.140
And if those satellites are even a millisecond
off from one another, their results are gonna

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.170
differ by about 100 kilometers.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.909
That is not super useful.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.439
Cell phone towers, our electric grid, high-speed
data transfer over the Internet.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.670
All this stuff requires accurate time across
multiple control devices.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.580
Precise timekeeping is what keeps all of our
important systems running and now, we could

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.380
do it three times more accurately.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.450
And in the future we're going to have ion
clocks.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.750
Clocks that measure the orbit of a single
neutron and keep time to an accuracy of 10

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.750
billion years

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.750
which actually puts this a couple billion
years after the death of the sun, so GPS positioning

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.500
probably won't be as important.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.300
It's a bit disheartening to find out so much
of our lives depends on really accurate timekeeping,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.710
because I've sorta built mine around being
late to everything.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.710
Constantly.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.300
I feel cosmically outta sync now.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300
Are you guys punctual?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.310
How do you feel about this?
