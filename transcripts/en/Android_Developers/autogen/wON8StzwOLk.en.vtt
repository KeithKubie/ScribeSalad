Kotwal thus far we've been focused on

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
Kotwal thus far we've been focused on
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.250
Kotwal thus far we've been focused on
making our list reader app beautiful on

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
making our list reader app beautiful on
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.990
making our list reader app beautiful on
phones but we haven't really looked at

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000
phones but we haven't really looked at
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.090
phones but we haven't really looked at
the tablet side of things so let's see

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
the tablet side of things so let's see
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950
the tablet side of things so let's see
if we just take that app that we've been

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
if we just take that app that we've been
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.170
if we just take that app that we've been
using so far and and put it on a tablet

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
using so far and and put it on a tablet
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.029
using so far and and put it on a tablet
let's see what it looks like so we have

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
let's see what it looks like so we have
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890
let's see what it looks like so we have
a nexus 10 here with the app running and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
a nexus 10 here with the app running and
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.599
a nexus 10 here with the app running and
you'll see it's not particularly

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
you'll see it's not particularly
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.339
you'll see it's not particularly
attractive at all there's all this

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
attractive at all there's all this
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930
attractive at all there's all this
wasted white space on the right hand

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
wasted white space on the right hand
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479
wasted white space on the right hand
side and then when I go into the detail

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
side and then when I go into the detail
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.840
side and then when I go into the detail
view the text is going edge to edge sure

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
view the text is going edge to edge sure
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.310
view the text is going edge to edge sure
the fonts are nice and we've we've

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
the fonts are nice and we've we've
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229
the fonts are nice and we've we've
modernized it with an action bar but

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
modernized it with an action bar but
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.200
modernized it with an action bar but
this isn't a great tablet experience so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
this isn't a great tablet experience so
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.910
this isn't a great tablet experience so
let's switch back to the slides

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
let's switch back to the slides
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100
let's switch back to the slides
let's talk about what we can do and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
let's talk about what we can do and
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.139
let's talk about what we can do and
really the obvious thing to do in this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
really the obvious thing to do in this
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.900
really the obvious thing to do in this
situation is to implement a two-pane UI

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
situation is to implement a two-pane UI
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.180
situation is to implement a two-pane UI
so we're going to go from something like

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
so we're going to go from something like
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910
so we're going to go from something like
what you see here to something like this

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
what you see here to something like this
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.670
what you see here to something like this
where we have both the list items on the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
where we have both the list items on the
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470
where we have both the list items on the
left hand side and the detailed items on

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
left hand side and the detailed items on
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750
left hand side and the detailed items on
the right hand side the way we're going

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
the right hand side the way we're going
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.960
the right hand side the way we're going
to do that is we're going to try and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970
to do that is we're going to try and
 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.690
to do that is we're going to try and
basically keep or reuse as much as the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
basically keep or reuse as much as the
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370
basically keep or reuse as much as the
code as possible we don't want to write

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
code as possible we don't want to write
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080
code as possible we don't want to write
a phone version and a tablet version of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
a phone version and a tablet version of
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.039
a phone version and a tablet version of
the apps that's not how you build

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
the apps that's not how you build
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.830
the apps that's not how you build
Android apps so we're going to use a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
Android apps so we're going to use a
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.539
Android apps so we're going to use a
little trick that we called XML

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
little trick that we called XML
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.070
little trick that we called XML
references so let's look at the code on

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080
references so let's look at the code on
 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.200
references so let's look at the code on
on on my machine here we we have our two

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
on on my machine here we we have our two
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140
on on my machine here we we have our two
activities the the the list activity and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
activities the the the list activity and
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030
activities the the the list activity and
the detail activity well you'll notice

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
the detail activity well you'll notice
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950
the detail activity well you'll notice
we've also got a layout here for a to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
we've also got a layout here for a to
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.499
we've also got a layout here for a to
paint activity now one way to load this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
paint activity now one way to load this
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.870
paint activity now one way to load this
is that when we load the initial

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
is that when we load the initial
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090
is that when we load the initial
activity the list activity we could just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
activity the list activity we could just
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859
activity the list activity we could just
at that point work out whether we're a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
at that point work out whether we're a
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.710
at that point work out whether we're a
tablet or not and load the two pane

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
tablet or not and load the two pane
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.300
tablet or not and load the two pane
layout we're not going to do that we're

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
layout we're not going to do that we're
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670
layout we're not going to do that we're
going to use this nice references this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
going to use this nice references this
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920
going to use this nice references this
XML references trick but I particularly

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
XML references trick but I particularly
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350
XML references trick but I particularly
like so we're still going to load

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
like so we're still going to load
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.120
like so we're still going to load
activity article list as our as our

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130
activity article list as our as our
 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.219
activity article list as our as our
layout but we're going to specify this

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
layout but we're going to specify this
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.249
layout but we're going to specify this
Refs XML file and that name isn't

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
Refs XML file and that name isn't
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.260
Refs XML file and that name isn't
special we're just calling it that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270
special we're just calling it that
 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.760
special we're just calling it that
but what is special is we're going to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770
but what is special is we're going to
 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.740
but what is special is we're going to
chuck it in a directory called values

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750
chuck it in a directory called values
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.330
chuck it in a directory called values
smallest with 600 dip land the smallest

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340
smallest with 600 dip land the smallest
 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.490
smallest with 600 dip land the smallest
with 600 it basically tells us that this

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500
with 600 it basically tells us that this
 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.740
with 600 it basically tells us that this
is a tablet that's a metric that we use

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
is a tablet that's a metric that we use
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.660
is a tablet that's a metric that we use
the land tells us we're in landscape

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
the land tells us we're in landscape
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.580
the land tells us we're in landscape
mode so in landscape mode on a tablet

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590
mode so in landscape mode on a tablet
 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.770
mode so in landscape mode on a tablet
we're going to load this ref store XML

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
we're going to load this ref store XML
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.190
we're going to load this ref store XML
and this this file has the activity

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
and this this file has the activity
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.170
and this this file has the activity
article list and what we're saying is if

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
article list and what we're saying is if
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.340
article list and what we're saying is if
you refer to a layout called activity

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350
you refer to a layout called activity
 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.680
you refer to a layout called activity
article list instead of returning what's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
article list instead of returning what's
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.590
article list instead of returning what's
already there in your resource folder

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600
already there in your resource folder
 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.190
already there in your resource folder
return a different layout so load whoops

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
return a different layout so load whoops
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.280
return a different layout so load whoops
load this layout here activity article -

pane so again we've done it all in XML

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540
pane so again we've done it all in XML
 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.880
pane so again we've done it all in XML
without actually having to change any

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890
without actually having to change any
 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.740
without actually having to change any
Java and we'll get the right layout

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
Java and we'll get the right layout
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.300
Java and we'll get the right layout
we'll get the - pane layout which is

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
we'll get the - pane layout which is
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.760
we'll get the - pane layout which is
great but we're not done yet because we

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770
great but we're not done yet because we
 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.380
great but we're not done yet because we
actually need to make one more change

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390
actually need to make one more change
 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.260
actually need to make one more change
which is when the user selects and item

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270
which is when the user selects and item
 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.400
which is when the user selects and item
from that ListView

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
from that ListView
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.560
from that ListView
we shouldn't launch another activity

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570
we shouldn't launch another activity
 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.720
we shouldn't launch another activity
into their detailed view what we should

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730
into their detailed view what we should
 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.390
into their detailed view what we should
be doing is selecting or replacing that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400
be doing is selecting or replacing that
 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.660
be doing is selecting or replacing that
that right-hand fragment so what we're

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670
that right-hand fragment so what we're
 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.180
that right-hand fragment so what we're
going to do is actually in our activity

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
going to do is actually in our activity
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.270
going to do is actually in our activity
in our article list activity we're going

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
in our article list activity we're going
 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.830
in our article list activity we're going
to work out if we're in - pane mode

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840
to work out if we're in - pane mode
 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.570
to work out if we're in - pane mode
there's multiple ways you can do this so

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580
there's multiple ways you can do this so
 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.180
there's multiple ways you can do this so
we're not going to to go into it in a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190
we're not going to to go into it in a
 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.699
we're not going to to go into it in a
great amount of detail but once you know

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709
great amount of detail but once you know
 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.340
great amount of detail but once you know
if you if you're working in in two pane

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350
if you if you're working in in two pane
 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.949
if you if you're working in in two pane
mode all you're doing is basically when

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959
mode all you're doing is basically when
 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.900
mode all you're doing is basically when
the item is the list item is selected

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910
the item is the list item is selected
 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.060

fragment with the relevant one if you're
 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.080
fragment with the relevant one if you're
in single pane mode you're just going to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090
in single pane mode you're just going to
 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.760
in single pane mode you're just going to
go and call the start activity so on

go and call the start activity so on
 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.470
go and call the start activity so on
phones will start a new activity on

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480
phones will start a new activity on
 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.750

tablets will just replace that fragment

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760
tablets will just replace that fragment
 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.210
tablets will just replace that fragment
on the right hand side simple as that we

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220
on the right hand side simple as that we
 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.910
on the right hand side simple as that we
have our two pane UI of course this is

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920
have our two pane UI of course this is
 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.470
have our two pane UI of course this is
all based on the assumption that you are

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480
all based on the assumption that you are
 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.840
all based on the assumption that you are
already using fragments if you're not

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850
already using fragments if you're not
 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.880
already using fragments if you're not
using fragments in your app already I

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890
using fragments in your app already I
 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.250
using fragments in your app already I
think you're making a mistake

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260
think you're making a mistake
 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.229
think you're making a mistake
it's it's really important that you do

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239
it's it's really important that you do
 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.110
it's it's really important that you do
so it allows you to to make these apps

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120
so it allows you to to make these apps
 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.229
so it allows you to to make these apps
really flexible depending on the form

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239
really flexible depending on the form
 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.970
really flexible depending on the form
factor and you'll see we did it with

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980
factor and you'll see we did it with
 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.990
factor and you'll see we did it with
minimal effort so let's switch back to

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
minimal effort so let's switch back to
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.930
minimal effort so let's switch back to
to our our slides and what we'll see now

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940
to our our slides and what we'll see now
 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.070
to our our slides and what we'll see now
we've got our nice two-pane UI great

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080
we've got our nice two-pane UI great
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.929
we've got our nice two-pane UI great
but one thing that's still lacking here

00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:28.939
but one thing that's still lacking here
 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.749
but one thing that's still lacking here
is spacing that those margins that we

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759
is spacing that those margins that we
 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.339
is spacing that those margins that we
specified on either side for the

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349
specified on either side for the
 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.320
specified on either side for the
detailed view they don't seem as

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330
detailed view they don't seem as
 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.770
detailed view they don't seem as
applicable for a tablet and in fact even

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780
applicable for a tablet and in fact even
 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.559
applicable for a tablet and in fact even
now ListView seems a little bit squashed

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569
now ListView seems a little bit squashed
 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.990
now ListView seems a little bit squashed
more so than it should be so what we're

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000
more so than it should be so what we're
 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.969
more so than it should be so what we're
going to do is actually we're going to

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979
going to do is actually we're going to
 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.040
going to do is actually we're going to
go and override some of those values for

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050
go and override some of those values for
 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.240
go and override some of those values for
tablets so switching back to the code

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250
tablets so switching back to the code
 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.179
tablets so switching back to the code
you'll recall that we had dimensions XML

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.189
you'll recall that we had dimensions XML
 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.240
you'll recall that we had dimensions XML
file that we'd specified for our list

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250
file that we'd specified for our list
 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.950
file that we'd specified for our list
views we'd had some top and bottom

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960
views we'd had some top and bottom
 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.260
views we'd had some top and bottom
margins and for our detailed view we had

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270
margins and for our detailed view we had
 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.020
margins and for our detailed view we had
some margins on on either side what

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030
some margins on on either side what
 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.580
some margins on on either side what
we're going to do is specify another

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590
we're going to do is specify another
 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.300
we're going to do is specify another
dimensions file for tablets 6 600 dip

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310
dimensions file for tablets 6 600 dip
 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.059
dimensions file for tablets 6 600 dip
and we don't care whether it's portrait

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069
and we don't care whether it's portrait
 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.430
and we don't care whether it's portrait
or landscape we're going to use these

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440
or landscape we're going to use these
 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.950
or landscape we're going to use these
dimensions and instead of 8 and 16 we're

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960
dimensions and instead of 8 and 16 we're
 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.320
dimensions and instead of 8 and 16 we're
going to go 16 dips vertically for

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330
going to go 16 dips vertically for
 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.140
going to go 16 dips vertically for
margin for the ListView and 80 dips on

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150
margin for the ListView and 80 dips on
 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.050
margin for the ListView and 80 dips on
either side so now let's switch back to

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060
either side so now let's switch back to
 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.969
either side so now let's switch back to
slides and see what that will actually

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979
slides and see what that will actually
 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.129
slides and see what that will actually
end up achieving this is what we have

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139
end up achieving this is what we have
 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.309
end up achieving this is what we have
now when we put those new margins in

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319
now when we put those new margins in
 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.649
now when we put those new margins in
we've got much better spacing vertically

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659
we've got much better spacing vertically
 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.330
we've got much better spacing vertically
between our list items on the left and

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340
between our list items on the left and
 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.670
between our list items on the left and
on either side in the detailed view as

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680
on either side in the detailed view as
 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.730
on either side in the detailed view as
well so with that being said we've now

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740
well so with that being said we've now
 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.469
well so with that being said we've now
come to the end of this check point

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479
come to the end of this check point
 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.320
come to the end of this check point
which is this is where we started with

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330
which is this is where we started with
 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.600
which is this is where we started with
our tablet app not very attractive at

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610
our tablet app not very attractive at
 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.390
our tablet app not very attractive at
all and this is where we've come to so

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400
all and this is where we've come to so
 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.600
all and this is where we've come to so
the next part we're going to focus on

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610
the next part we're going to focus on
 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.659
the next part we're going to focus on
performance tuning
