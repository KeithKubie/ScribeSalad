[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:06.958
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH] Whoa!

00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.425
Hi!

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:18.389
[LAUGH] Thank you!

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:20.820
Thank you!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.320
Great.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.738
Thank you!

00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:23.726
Oh, thank you.

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:27.809
[APPLAUSE ENDS]

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.392
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
Secretary Clinton,

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:30.680
welcome back to Google.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.530
HILLARY CLINTON: It's
great to be here, Eric.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.970
You've grown a little bit,
since I've been here last.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.630
Just a little.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.445
ERIC SCHMIDT: Are you
talking about my weight?

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:39.566
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:43.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: I knew I
gained some pounds, here.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.500
No, the company is much larger
and even more successful.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590
And thank you for
your first visit.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.490
We're here to talk about
your book, which, you know,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.760
I've actually read.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.330
HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: I did
want to present you--

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.844
I did want to present
you with my book.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:00:59.760
And I want-- it's entitled
"How Google Works."

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.176
And I want you to
notice something

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:05.170
that's different between
your book and my book.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.010
Now, your book is 600 pages and
very-- lots and lots of words.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.710
My book is 37 pages,
and it uses big type.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.920
And my book has black
and white photos,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.680
and yours has color photos.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.955
So, on a pound for pound basis,
my book is more valuable.

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:23.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310
HILLARY CLINTON: Well,
but there are many things

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.570
you can do with my book that
you can't do with this book.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.320
ERIC SCHMIDT: Such as?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.090
HILLARY CLINTON: Well,
you can work out--

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: Foreign policy?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.200
HILLARY CLINTON: No, you
can work out, with my book.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.240
ERIC SCHMIDT: You can
work out with your book?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.406
HILLARY CLINTON: Absolutely.

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:34.890
And if you get two copies--

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.230
ERIC SCHMIDT: Weightlifting?

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.840
HILLARY CLINTON:
--you'll be balanced,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.210
while you're working out.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.720
You can use it as a doorstop.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.720
This would just
slip under the door.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.140
You can't imagine using
that as a doorstop.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.690
I don't know.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.410
I think it's kind of a--
just a draw, don't you think?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.184
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
at some point,

00:01:52.184 --> 00:01:53.850
we're going to be
talking about my book.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.070
But I want you to
notice that my book is--

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.030
My book is so short, you can
read it during this interview.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.530
HILLARY CLINTON:
Well, I have to say

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.080
there is a particularly
attractive picture of you,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.360
on page 31, wearing some
kind of ridiculous hat,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.229
with some model of an airplane.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.520
ERIC SCHMIDT: And a picture
of Bill Gates, in the back.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.540
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's get to work.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.290
So, Secretary Clinton, your
book is entitled "Hard Choices."

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.866
And what we're going
to do is, we're

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.080
going to have some
questions from me,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.310
we have some
[INAUDIBLE] questions--

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.110
that is, submitted
from the audience--

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.120
and we have some live
questions, as well.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.650
And the first
question I want to ask

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.990
is that you and I had a
very dear friend-- Richard

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.120
Holbrooke-- who
died, unexpectedly,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.480
of a heart attack.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.760
And you had appointed him to do
the negotiation in Afghanistan.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.750
Do you think that his
death affected the outcome

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.570
in Afghanistan?

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.800
As a brilliant negotiator,
did we miss him that much?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.620
Did we end up in,
roughly, the right place

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.374
in Afghanistan, at
the end of it all?

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:53.790
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, there's
two parts to that question.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.930
Let me address our friend,
Richard Holbrooke, first.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.280
He was, in my view, the premier
diplomat of our generation.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.150
He was dramatic, when called
for; he was persistent,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.830
he was tough-minded, but
he believed, passionately,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.000
that you couldn't end
a war if you didn't

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.960
talk to the people
on the other side.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.760
Now, that may sound
simplistic, but, indeed,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.320
that's a huge obstacle
for many in diplomacy--

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.180
politics, governments--
to get over.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.880
How do you end a
war, if you talk

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.080
to the people you
despise-- who you view

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.870
as the troublemakers,
the instigators?

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.680
And Richard came at the
assignment I asked him to take,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.860
on behalf of the
President and myself,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.770
with that strong
conviction-- borne out

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.640
of his many years of experience,
and, in particular, his ending

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.650
of the wars in the Balkans,
when my husband was president.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.610
He spent a lot of
time with Milosevic--

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.840
a most unsavory character.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.550
He drank with him, he yelled
at him, he bullied him,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.780
he listened to him
and, eventually,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.080
was able to get to the
Dayton Peace Accords, which

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.580
ended the war, even
though it didn't

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.690
end all of the
political and ethnic

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.560
and other problems that are,
unfortunately, still prevalent.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.700
When I asked him to take
on the task in Afghanistan

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.670
and Pakistan, he went at it with
his same level of commitment--

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.380
even relish.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.380
And, as I write in
the book, we were

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.570
beginning a process of
reaching out to, and responding

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.720
to outreach from, the Taliban.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.610
And I gave a speech that tried
to make the case that that

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.230
might be distasteful;
it certainly

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.200
was to me, for many
reasons, as to how

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.570
they treat people in general,
and women in particular.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.700
But there had to be a
political negotiation, in order

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.560
to try to end the conflict.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.220
And literally, the
day he died-- and he

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.390
suffered a terrible
attack in my office--

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.750
we were talking about
the first meeting

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.470
that we had engineered
between an American diplomat--

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.970
one of Richard's lieutenants--
and a representative of Mullah

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.090
Omar.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.590
I guess the short answer, Eric,
is that Richard would never

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.100
take No for an answer.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.050
We had a lot of difficulties,
both with President Karzai--

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.709
because he didn't want us
talking to the Taliban--

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:26.250
and we had problems
with the Taliban,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.560
because they didn't want to
talk to President Karzai.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.980
So we were playing a kind
of multilevel chess game

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.210
and trying to move
the parties closer

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.270
to talking to each other.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.080
And, unfortunately,
with Richard's death,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.910
we kept up the
initiative, but we

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.690
didn't have that same
overpowering presence

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.620
that he brought to it.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.210
Now where we are with
Afghanistan-- and Pakistan,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.650
because we looked at them,
very much, as presenting

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.590
similar challenges to a
lasting peace and to threats,

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.850
first of all, to the
region, and even beyond--

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.580
is an election that was held
that has been criticized

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.570
for irregularities
that now, finally--

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.250
and I give Secretary Kerry
credit for going there.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.830
There's no substitute
for going to these places

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.480
and staying and trying to
engineer some kind of solution

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.880
That there will now be a
total audit of all the votes,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.330
in Afghanistan, to determine
who the next president is.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.540
So things are, kind of, on
hold, until we know that.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.610
What I think of as the
three biggest challenges is,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.190
number one, getting a
new president in who

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.060
could keep Afghanistan unified.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.630
Despite all of the
problems that many of us

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.800
had with President Karzai,
that was his primary goal.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.270
To try to keep the
country unified,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.290
and not fly off in
different ethnic directions.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.300
And we need to support whoever
that next president is and do

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.340
our best to give him the
authority that he needs,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.290
to try to keep the
country unified.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.380
Secondly, continuing to work
with the Afghan security

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.570
forces.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.390
They have proven to be much more
dependable, effective fighters,

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.680
taking the fight
to the Taliban--

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.040
because the Taliban is
very clear that they intend

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.910
to reoccupy territory they
lost to coalition troops,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.120
in the last several
years, following

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.170
the surge that
President Obama ordered.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.060
So continuing to work and
support the Afghan security

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.560
forces.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.790
And then, finally, being
well aware that so many

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.840
of the problems in Afghanistan
are incubated in Pakistan.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.870
And the Pakistani
government is now

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.100
facing some of the
most serious threats

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.880
that it, historically, has,
because, as I say in the book,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.380
they had an idea that was
never going to be workable,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.880
for the long term,
which is, you can

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.370
keep poisonous snakes
in your backyard

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.650
and expect them only
to bite your neighbors.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.090
And the Pakistani military
and intelligence establishment

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.670
have, unfortunately, over years,
worked with-- supported-- lots

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.800
of the terrorist groups--
extremist groups--

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.760
for their own
purposes, some of which

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.010
was to keep Afghanistan
kind of off-kilter.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.080
So there has to
be a lot of effort

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.120
made to work with the
Pakistanis, as difficult

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.040
as that is.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.830
And that's something that
I spent some time on,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.420
in the book, because
I worked very

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.830
hard to try to have as effective
a relationship as we could.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.909
But at the end of the
day, the Pakistanis

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.110
have to stand up to the threat
from within, which is also

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.429
a threat to Afghanistan--
and, by the way, a continuing

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.429
threat to India.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:47.475
So it's a-- we've made
progress, but not nearly enough.

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:49.975
ERIC SCHMIDT: I was in Pakistan
a little bit after you were,

00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:52.980
and I found it incredibly
confusing to figure out.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.230
In fact, while I was there,
the president I met with

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.800
was gotten rid of
by the supreme court

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.170
over-- something involving
financial and his child.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.560
In the book, you spent a fair
amount of time on, I think,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.210
one of the significant
foreign policy

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.142
achievements during your tenure,
involving the pivot to Asia.

00:09:09.142 --> 00:09:10.100
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: And when
I lay it out-- right,

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.980
we've got the Pakistan problems.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.771
You were the first
person to really open up

00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:19.389
Burma-- Myanmar-- you met
Aung San Suu Kyi, et cetera.

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:20.930
But you start looking
at, like, the--

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.495
as an example, the
Spratly Islands,

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:27.970
and this line called Line
Nine, between China and Japan

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.675
and the others-- it's getting
more confusing to an outsider.

00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:32.550
HILLARY CLINTON: Mhm.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.175
ERIC SCHMIDT: You
talk about the pivot.

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.890
Do you think that we understand
how to navigate, now,

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.270
between these-- each
of these countries

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.660
is becoming more nationalistic,
as it becomes stronger.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.750
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:51.730
Well, that is a trend that I saw
really beginning to take off.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.150
And it has a number
of implications,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.200
both for the region,
but also for us,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.110
and the rest of the world.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.950
As China has gotten much
more economically powerful,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:08.340
it's understandable that they
want to project their power.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.720
But it's quite threatening,
to the rest of the region.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:21.200
And what I saw as a growing
threat was the increasing

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.450
budgetary resources going to
the People's Liberation Army,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.330
to build up their naval
capacity so that they

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.640
could project power on the seas.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.870
Now, the United
States, primarily,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:41.120
has kept the peace in
Asia, in navigable waters,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.300
for the protection of
commerce, and our navy

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.270
has been a very positive force.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.010
But it's clear to
me that the Chinese

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:55.530
intend to challenge
American naval superiority.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.324
That's their perfect
right, to do so.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.740
They are a sovereign
country; they

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.650
get to make those decisions.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.050
But the problems
that Eric alluded to

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.610
are having a rebound
effect around the region.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.410
So that, if you see China
developing its first aircraft

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.500
carrier, with plans for a
number of more carriers,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.690
and you see China
being quite aggressive

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.170
on territorial claims--
not that they're

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.610
willing to arbitrate
those claims,

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.530
but they're merely
asserting them,

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.540
against the Philippines and
Vietnam and Japan, primarily,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.030
now.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:35.100
And you see that this could
lead to increasing tension,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.860
and maybe even
conflict, in the region.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.980
Then we have an opportunity,
but also a responsibility,

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.140
to work closely with, number
one, our allies, because we

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.060
have mutual defense
treaties with five

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.350
nations in the region.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.550
Obviously Japan and South
Korea and the Philippines

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.060
and Australia,
but also Thailand.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.580
So we are treaty-bound to
work with-- and, if necessary,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.530
protect-- our allies.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:08.270
Nobody wants to see any kind
of conflict that erupts,

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.020
but, when you look
at what's happening

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.470
between China and Vietnam,
and China and Japan,

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.860
and China and the
Philippines, this

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.090
is going to take some
very careful management.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.900
And so it takes a combination
of America continuing

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.800
to assert itself as a Pacific
power, but intensive diplomacy,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.750
to try to send the
message to China--

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:37.500
why would you want to
disrupt 40% of global trade?

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.640
Why would you want to skirt the
edges of potential conflict?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.310
And you see what's
happening in Japan.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.440
Japan is getting much
more nationalistic

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.520
and aggressive, in
response to that.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.740
So this is going to be a primary
obligation and area of concern,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.282
for the United
States, going forward.

00:12:55.282 --> 00:12:56.656
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
very important

00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:58.230
that China-- it,
ultimately, does not

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.615
become China and the people
who are opposed to China.

00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:01.490
HILLARY CLINTON: Yes.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.990
ERIC SCHMIDT: Then
you could set up,

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.384
for another 100 years, some
sort of a real contest.

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:08.050
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, one other
thing-- and I write about this,

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.450
because I became aware--
you know, China had,

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.970
when I became Secretary
of State, two issues

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:20.020
that they repeatedly stressed,
as their core interests-- Tibet

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.420
and Taiwan.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.160
I mean, that was, every time
you met with a Chinese official,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.640
what you would hear, in
addition to everything else.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.100
And, you know,
they were confused

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.440
by our support
for the Tibetans--

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.990
our openness to the Dalai Lama.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.120
I had a really
vigorous disagreement

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.810
with Jiang Zemin--
who was president,

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.660
at the end of the '90s-- over
Tibet, because I kept saying,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.880
China is a great country.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.590
I mean, you are growing
at 10+% in those years.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.320
Why are you so
obsessed with Tibet?

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.540
And he said, why are you
so obsessed with Tibet?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.040
And we had--

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.539
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:56.040
--you know, this
big back and forth.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.060
And I said, my
goodness, somebody

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.476
meets with the
Dalai Lama, and you

00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:02.550
want to write them out of the
global order, practically.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.750
But it's very deeply
felt, by the Chinese.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.350
And on Taiwan,
obviously you all know.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:12.700
Starting in 2010, I'm in one of
these very long meetings that

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.520
are made longer because
you have to have

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.207
consecutive translation,
in many of them.

00:14:17.207 --> 00:14:19.790
Some of you who've done business
on behalf of Google in China,

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.980
you know that.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.950
And all of a sudden,
it was Tibet, Taiwan,

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.030
and the South China Sea.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.480
And I just sat up,
straight, and I thought,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.900
what do you mean,
the South China Sea?

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.140
So I began to engage
with my counterparts.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.900
I heard you mention
the South China Sea.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.970
What did you mean?

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.610
Oh, why-- well, what we
meant was, of course, that we

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.880
claim the South China Sea.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.430
I said, all of it?

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.880
I mean, this enormous
body of water?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.720
Absolutely.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.830
It is China's.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.620
And then, you know, they began
telling me why it was China's.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.170
They found pottery shards on
this island-- or this atoll,

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.460
or this rocky reef-- that
went back to the Ming dynasty.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.050
It, therefore, was China.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.620
I said, really?

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.120
Now, let me say this to you.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.995
ERIC SCHMIDT: [LAUGH]

00:15:00.995 --> 00:15:01.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.260
HILLARY CLINTON: Um-- United
States-- and I asked--

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.780
ERIC SCHMIDT: You can just
hear her saying that. "Really?"

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.905
HILLARY CLINTON: "Really?"

00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:11.150
I actually had a map drawn up,
where the United States claimed

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.310
the entire Pacific.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.460
And I said, look, you
know, you were our ally,

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.400
but you couldn't have
beaten the Japanese back,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.720
and you couldn't have
had the, kind of,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.620
economic rise, without
American power.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.470
And we have cans-- old
cans of food, everywhere.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.360
You may have pottery shards,
but we've left our debris,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.690
too, and so we're claiming
the entire Pacific.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.570
I said, this is an
absurd argument.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.280
Oh, no; very serious.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.900
And not only that, we're
claiming the East China Sea.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.740
And we're going
after the Senkakus,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.910
which the Japanese have claimed.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.075
And we're going after the
territorial waters of Vietnam,

00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:49.700
because, obviously,
they want to drill,

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.500
to see what might
be off their coast.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.480
This was a very well thought
out introduction of a third core

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.200
interest.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.510
And, therefore, we have
to take it very seriously.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.680
And what I've argued-- and
I've made this very clear

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.780
to our Chinese friends-- the
United States doesn't take

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.050
positions on these islands,
and who should govern them,

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:15.550
or who they belong to, but
where there are disputes,

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.580
we have dispute
resolution mechanisms

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.130
that China, as a
great nation, should

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.650
be part of taking advantage of.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.560
And so, this is going
to be an ongoing debate

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.351
between us, and
within the region.

00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:32.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: So-- to show
you how good this book is--

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.520
there's a lengthy conversation
about the origins of this.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.640
And the secretary talks about
the original "hide and bide"

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:46.050
strategy that Deng Xiaoping
had, and how much has changed.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.550
You also spend a
fair amount of time

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.022
talking about a genuine hero in
the world-- Aung San Suu Kyi.

00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:51.980
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.438
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
you described her

00:16:53.438 --> 00:16:56.360
as "There was a quiet dignity
about her, the coiled intensity

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.072
of a vibrant mind inside
of a long-imprisoned body."

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:01.030
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.320
ERIC SCHMIDT: These sort
of glimpses of the way you

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.319
sort of-- I found it
absolutely fascinating.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.195
I'd like to move to an
area where-- you know,

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:11.400
you say "hard choices"-- I,
personally, see no choices,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.175
and that's Syria.

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:13.050
HILLARY CLINTON: Mhm.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.839
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
you're famously

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:19.079
known for having been--
or at least allegedly

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.000
being-- in favor of
earlier intervention.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.010
And I just want to
review where we are now.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.500
170,000 deaths, 11 and
1/2 million internally

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.700
dislocated people,
three million refugees.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.510
One out of six people
in Lebanon and one

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.160
out of five people in
Jordan are now refugees.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.110
Imagine if that happened
from Canada and Mexico

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.300
to the United States--
the impact on the economy.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.340
If that's not bad
enough, it's the biggest

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.810
humanitarian conflict
in the world, today.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.470
There's no obvious
groups to support.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:58.380
It's a proxy war, involving
Russia, Iran, Syria, et cetera.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.270
And now, the latest
is, of course,

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.760
this ISIS Group,
which has managed

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.770
to get to some number
of miles to Baghdad.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.990
It's not clear what to do.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.520
Do you do a no-fly zone?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.670
Well, who do you protect?

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.340
Right?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.870
If you're gonna arm somebody,
who are you going to arm?

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.120
When you think about it, had we
followed what you wanted to do,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.630
what would we have done,
and what should we do now--

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:20.810
or what can we do now?

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.230
You talk about
this, in the book,

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.300
but, obviously, you don't
talk about the current ISIS

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:24.725
situation.

00:18:24.725 --> 00:18:25.600
HILLARY CLINTON: Mhm.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.130
Mhm.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think it's
the biggest current problem

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.560
in the world, in terms of
just mass death and problems.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.340
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Eric,
I label that chapter "A Wicked

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.810
Problem"-- which is
a futurist concept,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:46.320
because there really
weren't any clear decisions,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.440
with a straight line
to consequences.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.120
Even if you made account
for unintended consequences,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.930
it was always going
to be a hard choice.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.370
What I argued, back at the
beginning of the conflict,

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:05.840
was that, in looking at Assad's
crackdown and his alliances

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.114
with Iran, Russia, and Iran's
proxy-- Hezbollah, in Lebanon--

00:19:10.114 --> 00:19:11.530
[HIGH-VOICED SOUND FROM
 AUDIENCE]

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.570
--there would be a
very serious issue.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.070
Uh, does somebody need
some help, back there?

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.370
Can we-- can we help to--
how about some water?

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.259
There's-- did somebody pass out?

00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:26.240
Yeah.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.740
OK.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: I
think we're fine.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.246
HILLARY CLINTON: You've got
somebody, back there, to help?

00:19:29.246 --> 00:19:29.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:30.565
Let's continue.

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:31.398
HILLARY CLINTON: OK.

00:19:31.398 --> 00:19:39.700
Um-- If you looked at
the level of violence

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.050
that Assad was willing to
use-- and I was pretty sure,

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.740
from the beginning,
he would do whatever

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.210
it took to beat back
the demonstrators

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.040
and to hold on to territory.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.610
His father had done it, before
him, some of you might recall,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.600
in leveling the
city of Hama, which

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:03.290
had been a hotbed of opposition
and a particular home

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.630
for Muslim Brotherhood
opponents to the prior regime.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.960
So I had no doubt.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.790
In fact, one of
the stories I tell,

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.610
in the book-- I asked the
Foreign Minister of Saudi

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.170
Arabia-- Saud Al
Faisal, who had been

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.970
in that position
for many years--

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.830
whether he thought
there was any way

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.240
to change the
calculation of Assad

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.860
and have him either begin
to tamp down the violence

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.220
or look for a
political settlement.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.774
And Saud said, no, because his
mother would never let him.

00:20:40.774 --> 00:20:41.690
[MURMUR FROM AUDIENCE]

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.160
And that, I thought,
was very telling--

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.730
that there was this family
obligation, enforced

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.070
by his mother, who
would say to him,

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.770
every day, here's what your
father would have done.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.270
So, given that lineup
of characters, history,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:04.990
and the like, I believe that,
if we had gone in to identify

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.950
and properly vet members of
the original opposition-- which

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.380
were not Al Qaeda,
were not ISIS;

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.610
they may have been pharmacists,
or doctors, or lawyers,

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.800
or students, before
the opposition rose up

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.570
against Assad's
brutal crackdown--

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.570
that we would get to know
who the likely hard men,

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.330
on the other side, were.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.090
And, perhaps, we
could help to build,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:37.180
from that, a viable opposition
force that could hold ground

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.560
against Assad and,
at the same time,

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.171
be the anchor for developing a
more effective political arm.

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:49.900
You know, I could sit here,
today, and say I was right.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.550
But I can't say that,
because we don't

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.110
know what would've
happened, had we

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.530
followed that
particular approach.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.430
There were very good
arguments, on the other side.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.360
But what I know now is
that what I worried about

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.340
has happened-- that Assad has
not moderated his behavior.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.740
The only good thing that has
come out of the last two years

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.910
is the removal of, at
least, the known stockpiles

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.940
of chemical and
biological weapons,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.190
which I do think was an
important accomplishment.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.040
But we know that
territory is being

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.830
taken by extremist groups--
ISIS being the most audacious,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.480
with their claim
of a caliphate that

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.710
crosses the border
between Syria and Iraq.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.600
And I think we have a
pretty good idea what

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.183
that would mean--
what that would mean

00:22:40.183 --> 00:22:43.750
for the region, where
you could, possibly,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:49.530
have a very extreme,
organized territory that

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.360
was a safe haven and
a launching ground.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.200
We saw this in Afghanistan.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.090
I mean, that's what happened
in the border areas, when

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.890
Al Qaeda decided to ally
itself with the Taliban

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.780
and set up shop, there.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.260
And it doesn't necessarily
mean just misery for Sunnis

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.350
who are not of their
extreme nature--

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.620
and others within Iraq,
and the same within Syria.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.490
It can lead to problems in
Europe, where, we think,

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.460
at least 2,000
Europeans with passports

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.350
have gone to fight
with extremist groups.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.680
And it certainly can
mean more threats to us.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.660
So what to do, now?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.890
I think part of what we have to
do is what we're trying to do,

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.430
and that is, to
restabilize Iraq.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.970
And the reason it's so difficult
is that Prime Minister Maliki

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:44.680
basically reneged
on every commitment

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.350
he made-- to the United States,
as well as his own people.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.249
When he was
legitimately elected,

00:23:52.249 --> 00:23:54.290
he was able to form a
government, the first time.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.990
He was just reelected,
and the problem

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:02.010
is that he began governing in
an exclusive, sectarian way,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.810
cutting the Sunnis out of
power, refusing to pay the Sunni

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.710
fighters that the United
States had recruited to get rid

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.130
of Al Qaeda in Iraq-- which was
one of our major achievements,

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.590
on behalf of the
Iraqis, before we left--

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.120
and refusing to have a
fair deal over oil revenues

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.180
with the Kurds.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.290
So the Kurds and a lot of
the Sunni tribal leaders

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.450
are, basically, of the mind
that you can't trust Maliki.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.550
You can't work with
him, and we're not

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.590
going to support him, as he
tries to take back territory.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.060
So it's a political negotiation
that we and others are engaged

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.480
in, because, unless you can get
the local Sunni leaders once

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.320
again to throw their lot in,
on behalf of a unified Iraq,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.970
you cannot drive ISIS out of
Mosul and other places that it

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:50.612
has seized.

00:24:50.612 --> 00:24:53.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: And ISIS is very
dangerous, by every measure.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.720
HILLARY CLINTON: Well,
they're very dangerous.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.830
They're kind of a follow-on
to the original Al Qaeda,

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:08.280
but not as based in the
leadership of Bin Laden

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.110
and Zawahiri.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.440
it's now younger people.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.170
They're more violent;
they're more aggressive.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:19.040
They're trying to do what has
been the dream of extremist

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.030
Sunnis caught up in terrorism,
for a number of years, now,

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.690
and that is to establish--
or, in their mind,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:31.697
reestablish-- a caliphate, and
put one of their own in charge.

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.030
So yeah, they're very dangerous.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.960
And they will not be satisfied
in just governing territory.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.430
They will believe it's
both their religious duty

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.760
and their desire for
greater power, that they

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.970
have to take this
further afield.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
what I thought I'd do

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.460
is ask you a little bit
about the Israeli-Palestinian

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.030
situation.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.330
I'd like to talk to you a
little bit about what you've

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.869
been working on
since leaving office.

00:25:56.869 --> 00:25:58.160
And then we'll go to questions.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.330
And we have thousands
of questions--

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.050
--it being Google.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.760
So in the book, you
talk at some length

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.100
about negotiating and getting
to know Bibi Netanyahu-- who's

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.780
a charismatic leader, by any
standard-- and the challenges

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.470
he's faced from terrorism.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.760
And in the book, you talk a lot
about Hezbollah and the Lebanon

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.780
war, and those sorts of things.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:28.410
Israel is, today, confronting
the Gaza rockets--

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.410
Hamas, and so forth.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.870
Looking at it--
I was just there;

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.530
Google has a big presence,
there-- it's, to some degree,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.300
in Hamas's interest to
have this cycle continue.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.470
They get money,
they get resources,

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:44.290
they're getting rockets
out of Syria, et cetera.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.450
And the rockets can, now,
reach the entire country.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.650
And I was thinking about, if
you think about our good friends

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.350
in Canada.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.600
Right?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.558
So imagine Canada was
different, and somehow it

00:26:52.558 --> 00:26:54.510
was raining rockets
on us-- or Mexico,

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.740
or whatever-- people
here would go crazy.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.120
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.470
ERIC SCHMIDT: Right?

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.210
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.040
ERIC SCHMIDT: And so you
can really understand.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.690
In fact, the Israelis have
built this thing called

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.170
Iron Dome, which actually
has intercepted 80% or 90%

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.170
of the rockets-- which
is a remarkable technical

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.262
achievement, and good for them.

00:27:09.262 --> 00:27:11.470
Do you have a reading of
what's going to happen next?

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.880
Because it doesn't seem
to be getting better.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.470
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, you might
have seen the President doing

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.050
a live press statement, this
morning, from the White House.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.570
And he's asked Secretary
Kerry to go to the region,

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.710
try to reestablish the
November 2012 cease-fire that I

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.310
negotiated, back
at the time, when

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.430
rockets were raining on Israel.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.860
And I went from
Cambodia to Israel

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.430
to negotiate what the
Israelis would accept,

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.610
and then to go to
Cairo, to negotiate

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.100
with then-President Morsi.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.800
And we were able to
reach a cease-fire that

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.065
held until this month.

00:27:57.065 --> 00:27:58.210
And I'd make three points.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:02.320
One, Hamas really does have
its back against the wall,

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.000
and that's always dangerous.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.940
You know, they were, basically,
driven out of Damascus,

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.930
because that's where
they had taken up

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.980
their headquarters, for years.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:19.320
But when Assad consolidated
the Alawite minority,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.400
to go after the majority of the
population, which are Sunnis,

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.950
it became impossible for Hamas
to maintain its headquarters,

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.120
there.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.880
They moved to Cairo
because, at the time,

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.120
the Muslim Brotherhood
candidate-- Morsi--

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.980
was the president.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.660
There was a lot of
sympathy, there.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.970
And they began to
try to maneuver

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.030
to control splinter
groups within Gaza.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.710
Because it's not just Hamas.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:53.710
There are some even harder-core
extremist groups, within Gaza.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:57.280
So you have a couple of
different groups, led by Hamas,

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.840
gathering up more
sophisticated weaponry.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.350
So when I negotiated the
cease-fire with Morsi,

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:06.470
he had never done
anything like that,

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:10.050
but he did have a
relationship with Hamas.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.340
So we were able to
come up with a written

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.480
agreement where Israel
made certain commitments,

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.690
Hamas made certain commitments,
and, thankfully, it

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.120
was before there
was an invasion.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.660
We were about 48 hours
from an invasion.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.910
So what has happened, since?

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.650
Well, Morsi's gone.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.660
Al-Sisi is the president.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.170
He, basically, has declared
the Muslim Brotherhood--

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.630
and everyone
associated with them,

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.310
which would include Hamas-- are
threats to the Egyptian state.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.910
So Hamas no longer has
a partner in Cairo.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:48.020
The West Bank has remained
fairly secure and stable,

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.130
in part because of the attitude,
still, in the West Bank,

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.170
that they'd rather
have a negotiation then

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.830
go back to resistance.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:01.730
So Hamas-- and its
allies, who have really

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:08.390
brought about the importation
of more long-range rockets--

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.180
has, for whatever
combination of calculations,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.010
decided that it's
in their interest--

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.080
as Eric said-- to, once
again, attack Israel, maybe

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.730
because they believe they
will get more support;

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.520
they will get more
financial resources.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.470
Maybe they think that they will
cause an uprising in the West

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.130
Bank that would join with them.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:34.130
They have a number of different
reasons why they might do this.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.030
So once they began firing
the rockets-- and the rockets

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.480
have longer range, and they're
somewhat more accurate.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.620
But the Iron Dome-- which
the United States funded,

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.570
but which is
Israeli technology--

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.210
has worked surprisingly
well, in intercepting

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.890
80%, 90% of the rockets.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.690
But there was also the
increasing threat from tunnels.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.550
You know, it used to be
that Hamas had tunnels going

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.880
into Sinai, and those were
both for smuggling weapons

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.340
but also smuggling
goods that would

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.450
escape the Israeli embargo.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.870
The Egyptians have done
a much more thorough job

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.240
of shutting those
tunnels down, but Hamas

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.980
has been busy building
tunnels into Israel,

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.000
with the primary purpose of
attacking Israelis and trying

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.700
to spark a very
violent response.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.030
I can't believe that the
current Hamas leadership did not

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.800
know that, if they
kept up their attacks,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.380
Netanyahu would be
forced to respond.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.710
As I said, when I
got to Jerusalem,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.760
for the first part
of the negotiations,

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.740
they were already sending out
notices for reserve soldiers

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.590
to begin mustering
up, and that they

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.910
were going to have to invade.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:52.470
So I believe that Hamas wanted
to provoke this reaction,

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.460
and I believe that Netanyahu--
at the end of the day--

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.270
the Canadian-Mexican example
is not so far-fetched.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.230
I mean, any country,
your first obligation

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.810
is to protect your
citizens, and I

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:06.650
believe that Netanyahu knew
that he had to take action,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.880
and he has-- and Israel has
the right to self-defense.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:17.820
So now we're into not only
a very unfortunate clash,

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.870
but a propaganda war.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.590
You know, the terrible,
horrible pictures

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:29.370
of children who are the victims
of Israeli military action--

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:33.860
which Israel is right to
say is, in large measure--

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.560
not completely, but in large
measure-- because of the way

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.560
Hamas has sited its rockets
and set up its operating

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.290
centers in neighborhoods,
surrounded by civilians,

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.910
in houses.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:50.940
The tunnels, where
there was a firefight,

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.540
with Hamas fighters
coming out of one

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.770
of the tunnels and
Israeli soldiers--

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.300
two Americans, dual citizens--
two young American men,

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.890
serving in the IDF, killed.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:09.020
So we have to try, if we can,
to negotiate another cease-fire.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.760
Egypt declared a cease-fire;
Israel accepted it;

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.980
Hamas rejected it-- in
part because, I do think,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.990
they want to provoke
what we're now seeing.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:22.320
And it's deeply distressing,
but unfortunately,

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.480
unless there's a
mutual cease-fire,

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.390
I think Israel will continue
with their military objectives,

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.860
which are to find and
destroy the tunnels,

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.440
find and destroy as many
of the rockets as they can.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.090
And there will continue to
be a terrible loss of life.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: And I
agree, and it's very sad.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.740
Let's make a context switch.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.500
Since you left office, you've
spent a great deal of time

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.470
on empowerment,
entrepreneurship,

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.610
the role of women and children.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:57.380
Google has partnered with
you, a little bit, on that.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:02.130
And I think people
will be interested in,

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.280
what do you think
needs to be done?

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.450
You've given a series
of speeches about this,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.632
the role of women, and so forth.

00:34:08.632 --> 00:34:10.090
You're, obviously,
committed to it.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.459
Take us through your thinking.

00:34:11.459 --> 00:34:13.699
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I
do want to thank Google

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.929
as being one of our
partners, in this effort.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.820
When I got out of
the State Department,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.130
I joined my husband
and my daughter

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:23.370
at the Clinton Foundation.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.560
My husband had
started it, and I'm

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.900
very proud of what he built.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.066
I had nothing to do with it.

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:30.120
I was in the Senate and
the State Department,

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.719
for those 12 years.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.889
But he came up with an
approach that, I think,

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:38.520
is fairly called
"entrepreneurial philanthropy,"

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.780
where you bring people together,
through the Foundation,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.330
and through the Clinton
Global Initiative,

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.530
to partner to solve problems.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.610
And we have very clear metrics.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.120
Are you making progress, or not?

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.567
And if you're not,
then we're not

00:34:52.567 --> 00:34:54.150
going to keep doing
what doesn't work,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.025
and we're going to do
more of what does work.

00:34:56.025 --> 00:34:57.830
And we think we're
all in this together.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.320
So, both internationally
and domestically,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.790
there's a number of
really important projects.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.560
Bill just left
Borneo, where we're

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.950
doing one of our
climate initiatives,

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:11.830
trying to save the rain
forest in Indonesia,

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.340
partnering with a number
of other governments

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.040
and businesses.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.050
So when I got out, in
addition to wanting

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:23.060
to work on the Foundation
priorities and CGI priorities,

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.200
I added three.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.730
I added something we
call Too Small to Fail.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:34.890
And that is a program aimed
at persuading families

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.560
to read, talk, and
sing to their babies,

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.860
because what we know is, if you
come-- if you're our daughter--

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:49.520
Chelsea-- or our new grandchild,
you are going to be talked to

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.464
and read to and sung
to until, probably,

00:35:51.464 --> 00:35:52.630
you just want us to go away.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.950
And we're doing it,
both because it's

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.860
great to build relationships
and connection,

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.360
but we now know, from brain
research, it builds brains.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.610
And when a child from a
family like one of ours

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.100
goes to kindergarten, that
child will have already

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.490
heard 30 million more words
than a child from a poor family.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.745
Now that does not mean the
child from the poor family

00:36:16.745 --> 00:36:20.230
is any less loved,
any less treasured,

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:24.940
but there's not the time
or understanding, often,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.230
so that parents know they can
be their child's first teachers.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.920
So we are partnering with the
Next Generation Foundation,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.440
in San Francisco, and a
number of other groups,

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.490
like Sesame Street, to
get this message out.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.210
Secondly, we rolled out-- at
the Clinton Global Initiative

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.840
America meeting, in
Denver, last month--

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.937
a program that is aimed at
trying to work with companies,

00:36:48.937 --> 00:36:51.020
like Google-- we'd love
to talk to you about this,

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.420
but-- to create
ladders of opportunity

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.980
for unemployed young people.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.470
We have 6 million young
people in America,

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:02.670
between the ages of 18 and
24, who are neither in school

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.007
nor at work.

00:37:04.007 --> 00:37:05.590
And that's terrible
for them, and it's

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.740
terrible for us and our economy.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.200
And then, finally,
I took with me

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.890
my commitment to women and
girls-- their empowerment;

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.760
their full participation.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.050
And my jumping-off
point is the speech

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:21.630
that I gave in 1995,
in Beijing, which

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:26.110
was intended to make
a very clear statement

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:29.270
of the global priority that
human rights are women's

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:31.520
rights, and women's
rights are human rights.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.420
But accompanying that was
a platform for action,

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.270
signed by 189 countries,
about what they

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:42.000
would do to move toward
full participation of women

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.920
and girls.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.970
And we've made progress,
but not nearly enough.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.910
So we started a program
called No Ceilings,

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.840
and it's got three purposes.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.350
Number one, we want to be
able-- with Google's help,

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.960
and others-- to get
the best data possible,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.020
so that we understand
where the gaps are.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.640
We know, for example, we've
made tremendous progress

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.800
in getting girls into
primary education;

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.460
not so good in
secondary education.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.170
So what are the gaps?

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:11.550
How do we describe that?

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.120
And how do we
visualize it, so people

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.470
who may not be experts or
advocates in this field

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:22.784
can look and see what the
remaining business is?

00:38:22.784 --> 00:38:24.700
I have a chapter called
"Unfinished Business,"

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.390
and it's really about
what more we need to do.

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.120
Now there are big differences
between the developing

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.280
world and the developed world.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.090
In the developing
world, we still

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.645
have some very clear
obstacles to overcome.

00:38:36.645 --> 00:38:38.270
We still have countries
that don't even

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.830
give birth certificates
to girl babies,

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.204
because they're just not
important enough to register.

00:38:43.204 --> 00:38:44.620
So when we say to
ourselves, well,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.556
how many girls are
in school-- and you

00:38:46.556 --> 00:38:48.760
know a significant
percentage don't even

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.509
have birth certificates, and
there's not a good census-- how

00:38:51.509 --> 00:38:52.300
do we measure that?

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.200
Or when we look at Asia, there
are three million fewer girls

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.050
and women than there
are boys and men,

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.990
because they just
don't-- they're not born,

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.690
or they don't live to
their fifth birthday,

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.860
or they are victims of
violence and neglect.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.620
And we have this huge gap.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.180
And I think one of the
problems that China and India

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.340
are facing-- and
will face even more--

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.580
is the big gap between
marriageable men

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.020
and marriageable women.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.970
And some of the
violence against women

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:27.280
is a result of what is
a very big imbalance.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:33.100
Now, in the so-called developed
world, we've changed our laws,

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.330
but what we have left
are cultural problems.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.165
And so, in addition to
getting the data-- where

00:39:39.165 --> 00:39:42.000
are the gaps-- we want to look
at, what are the solutions.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.940
And they will vary from country
to country, region to region.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.340
One of the efforts I made,
in the State Department,

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.140
was to do-- begin to do--
with the IMF, the World

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.940
Bank, and others-- an economic
analysis of what it means

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:01.550
for girls and women to
be left out of economies.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.430
Now we know girls and women
are in the informal economy,

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.600
but that's not counted in GDP.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.500
I remember going to
Africa in the '90s,

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.070
and all I saw were
women working.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.530
They were carrying water;
they were carrying firewood;

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:16.007
they were tending fields;
they were in the marketplaces.

00:40:16.007 --> 00:40:17.840
And I asked an economist,
I said, how do you

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.320
take account of all
this economic activity?

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.900
And they said, we don't, 'cause
it's in the informal economy.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.340
So what I wanted was an
analysis about what difference

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.180
it would make if we
had girls and women

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.920
in the formal economy.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.780
And it makes a huge
GDP difference.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.980
And the person in
the world who has

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.830
jumped on this,
more than anybody,

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:42.501
is Prime Minister Abe of Japan,
because, when he took office,

00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:44.000
he took office on
the promise he was

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.620
going to get the economy going.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.200
And he looked at
trade barriers; he

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.970
looked at the lack
of immigration.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.120
But one of the
biggest problems was

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.090
educated Japanese women
were not in the economy.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.580
And that, in fact, if they
had greater participation,

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.160
the projection was, the
Japanese economy could go up

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.040
to GDP-- that could go up to 9%.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.580
ERIC SCHMIDT: So the quickest
way to grow your economy

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.530
is to use the talents
you already have.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.280
HILLARY CLINTON: Use
the talents you have,

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.020
and raise the talent
base of women and girls,

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.780
in places where
they're not educated,

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.320
and take advantage
of those talents,

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.750
in places where
they are educated.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.041
ERIC SCHMIDT: Seems so obvious.

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.300
Why don't we just do it?

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.100
HILLARY CLINTON:
[SIGH] Well, that's

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.454
what we're trying to figure out.

00:41:21.454 --> 00:41:23.620
And, with Google's help,
we'll get the best analysis

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.786
to make the recommendations.

00:41:24.786 --> 00:41:26.490
ERIC SCHMIDT: --we
violently agree with.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.630
I want to finish up, with the
book, with the last paragraph.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.470
You talk about the
memorial service

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.760
for your mom, who
passed away, recently.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.950
And you said, "I
looked at Chelsea,

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:40.300
and I thought how proud
Mom"-- your mom-- "was of her.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.270
Mom measured her
own life by how much

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.850
she was able to help
us and serve others.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.130
I knew that, if she
was still with us,

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.590
she would be urging
us to do the same.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.390
Never rest on your
laurels; never quit;

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.390
never stop working to make
the world a better place.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.960
That's our unfinished business."

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.890
Is that why you work so hard?

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:01.860
HILLARY CLINTON: It really is.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.060
I don't want to get all
psychobabbly, but, um--

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.050
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's OK.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.060
HILLARY CLINTON: You know,
I so admire my mother,

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.120
because she had a miserable
childhood-- I mean,

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.490
just horrible.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:22.420
Abused, neglected, abandoned.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.340
Sent, by herself--
at the age of seven,

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.350
eight-- in charge of
her younger sister,

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.230
who was about six-- put
on a train, by themselves,

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.250
in Chicago; sent to
California, to live

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.060
with her paternal grandparents,
who did not want her.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.930
And just a terrible experience.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.570
And finally, having to leave
that home at the age of 13,

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:46.940
to get a job working in another
family's home, taking care

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.270
of their children, in
return for room and board,

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.680
and the opportunity-- if
she could get her chores

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.670
done in the morning-- to go to
school, if she could get back

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.975
in the afternoon.

00:42:55.975 --> 00:42:57.600
So I mean, when I
was a child, I didn't

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.975
know any of this
about my mother.

00:42:58.975 --> 00:43:01.600
I just knew that she was a
great mom, and she was fun,

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.470
and she took
wonderful care of us.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:07.190
But as I learned
more about her life,

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.010
upon becoming a teenager
and a young adult,

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:14.290
I was just astonished,
because I thought,

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.850
you know, so many things
could have gone wrong.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.229
I mean, she could have given up.

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:20.520
She could have been embittered.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.470
She could've-- even if she'd
got married and had children,

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.610
she could've been as
mean-spirited or neglectful

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.100
as her mother and her
grandmother were to her.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.580
But instead, she worked so
hard to be a better person.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.580
And she never got
to go to college,

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.180
but she was always studying
and trying to learn

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.820
and believed passionately
in education.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:47.210
And I think it did have a lot
to do with my sense of service.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:50.170
Because-- you know,
I remember going

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.960
to babysit for the children
of migrant farm workers

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.630
who, in Chicago, you know,
they would come up from Mexico,

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:58.550
and they'd pick crops.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.480
They'd go through Illinois,
they'd go into Michigan.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.550
And our church had a babysitting
program for the youngest

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.210
children, on
Saturday mornings, so

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.924
that the school-aged children,
who went to school with us,

00:44:08.924 --> 00:44:10.590
would be able to go
out into the fields.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:13.760
And so I remember babysitting
these adorable little kids,

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.077
and my mother learning that
one of the little girls

00:44:17.077 --> 00:44:18.660
was going to have
her first communion.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.784
And, of course, they didn't
have money for a dress.

00:44:20.784 --> 00:44:23.140
And my mother took the
mother of the little girl

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.340
and bought a dress.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.840
And my mother was always trying
to think of ways that, just

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.660
through her own efforts,
she can help somebody else--

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.710
and encouraging
me to do the same.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.300
So there's no doubt
in my mind that she

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.090
was my biggest inspiration.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:43.760
And her example was a
great, continuing reminder

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.150
of what can happen.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.670
Because, I'd end with this.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:50.850
I asked her, once-- I said,
with all of your-- really--

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.989
suffering, what
made the difference?

00:44:52.989 --> 00:44:54.530
How did you turn
out the way you did?

00:44:54.530 --> 00:45:00.320
And she said to me, at so
many points along the way,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.120
somebody was kind to me.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.760
It wasn't my family, but
it was somebody else.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.380
And she told me
about-- literally,

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.900
when she was, like,
four years old,

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.350
and her parents were teenagers--
totally irresponsible.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.730
They'd leave her
for days, they'd

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.077
give her a little bit
of money, and she'd

00:45:18.077 --> 00:45:20.410
have to get herself down the
stairs of the tenement they

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.820
lived in, and go next
door, to a restaurant,

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.687
and ask for food, with
a little bit of money.

00:45:25.687 --> 00:45:27.270
And she said-- looking
back, she said,

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:29.920
I know they gave me more
food than I could pay for.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.790
Or, when she was in school, and
she would never have any lunch,

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.790
and never had any
money to buy lunch,

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.100
and the teacher noticed it.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.700
So the teacher--
without embarrassing

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.760
her-- would bring an
extra piece of fruit,

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.460
would bring an extra carton
of milk, and would say,

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.830
oh, I've brought too much food.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.400
Dorothy, would you
like something,

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.280
because I just
can't eat all this.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.210
Again, not humiliating
her, but making it possible

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.990
for her to receive
that kindness.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.480
And the family that she
moved in-- to work for--

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.990
was the first time she was
ever in an intact family that

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.520
loved each other and
cared about each other

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.020
and had plans for the future.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.310
And she could see all of that.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:10.210
So it was just a great reminder.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:13.650
But you don't have to go
into full-time philanthropy,

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:17.140
or charitable work, or
faith-based work, or politics.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:22.070
But there's always something
you can do that helps somebody.

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.350
And if you do it in a way
that preserves their dignity,

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:29.240
and gives them the feeling
that it was kindness, as

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:34.370
opposed to arrogance, it
can make a huge difference.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.374
So I think that left
a great impression.

00:46:37.374 --> 00:46:39.415
ERIC SCHMIDT: There is a
very nice picture of you

00:46:39.415 --> 00:46:41.434
and your mom, Chelsea,
and Mark, in the book.

00:46:41.434 --> 00:46:42.350
HILLARY CLINTON: Yeah.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.433
ERIC SCHMIDT: We have
questions from the audience.

00:46:44.433 --> 00:46:46.670
Let's get some folks
lined up, here.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.970
But the overwhelming-- there's
a ranking system that we use,

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:50.590
of questions--

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:50.700
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.635
ERIC SCHMIDT: And the
overwhelming ranking,

00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:54.010
throughout the
company-- and this

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.593
is being watched all
around the world,

00:46:55.593 --> 00:46:58.196
in Google-- is a
question about the NSA.

00:46:58.196 --> 00:46:59.070
HILLARY CLINTON: Mmm.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: And,
as you know, Google

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.713
is quite opposed-- along with
the other tech companies--

00:47:02.713 --> 00:47:05.470
to what we see as
overreach by the NSA.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.200
And we all think, for example,
that bugging Angela Merkel's

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.620
phone is pretty stupid,
if I could be blunt.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.494
HILLARY CLINTON: Mhm.

00:47:11.494 --> 00:47:13.160
[SOFT RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER FROM
 AUDIENCE]

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.880
ERIC SCHMIDT: What is your
opinion of NSA's spying--

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.760
surveillance-- the
domestic spying?

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.110
You know, this occurred, I
think, after you were there.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:20.320
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.400
ERIC SCHMIDT: You have
any opinion about this?

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.710
Number one question from Google.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.190
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, yeah.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.780
I mean, don't do stupid things.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:27.940
And that doesn't
mean we don't need

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.960
to have a system of
surveillance, because we do.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.190
I mean, I think that
has to be accepted.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:38.060
But how we do it, and
how we explain it,

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.770
and what we tell our partners,
is incredibly important.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:45.590
I was just in Berlin, on my book
tour in Europe, and, of course,

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:47.540
that was the number one issue.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.270
And I said, look, Angela
Merkel's a friend of mine,

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:51.750
and I apologized to her.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.500
It was wrong; it
shouldn't have been done.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.100
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
I should tell you,

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.380
I had dinner with her,
and she looked at me,

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.830
said, what are they doing,
listening to my conversations

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.030
with my mother?

00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.220
HILLARY CLINTON: Yeah.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: I mean,
people remember this.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.743
HILLARY CLINTON: Oh, absolutely.

00:48:00.743 --> 00:48:05.450
And, look-- I think we were
beginning to take a hard look

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.210
at what we did, post-9/11.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.140
And that was happening.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.250
The President had
actually given a speech,

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.910
before the Snowden
disclosures, about the need

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.290
to take a hard look
at the legislation,

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.340
and how it was
being implemented.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.780
So we had to do that,
because I voted for things,

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.150
and then I voted against
things, trying to figure out

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:29.520
how to get the right
balance in security

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.530
and liberty-- the
age-old question.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.954
And we have to do-- we have
to do a much better job,

00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:35.370
and we have to do
it in a way that

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:39.040
doesn't affect our great
companies, like Google,

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.984
because, clearly, that
would be unfortunate for us.

00:48:42.984 --> 00:48:44.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's
go-- here, go ahead.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.260
You're the first question,
then we'll go over here.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.509
AUDIENCE: Secretary Clinton,
thank you for joining us,

00:48:48.509 --> 00:48:49.150
today.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.140
I wanted to get your take
on the state of Congress

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.750
and internal politics
within the US.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:57.890
It seems like things are
getting increasingly polarized,

00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:59.540
to the point of dysfunction.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.890
I think that the "kick
the can" economic policy

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.190
that we're building is
really hurting our country.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:08.290
So I'm wondering what you think
needs to be done, to fix it,

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:11.899
and who the right
people are to lead that.

00:49:11.899 --> 00:49:14.190
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I
think your question is exactly

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:15.540
on point.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.020
I think we have two crises,
right now, in our country.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.850
We have an economic
crisis, that has

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.800
to do with both
growth and inequality.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.790
You may not feel
it, here, at Google,

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.450
but it's real in the
lives of many Americans.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.910
And we need to get back
to doing smarter things,

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.530
in terms of economic policies.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:33.810
And we have a political crisis.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:37.220
I would even argue it's a
crisis of our democracy,

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.810
because it's not functioning.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.120
And I would make
three quick points.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.690
First, having been in and
around politics for a long time,

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.230
please don't get
indifferent or disgusted

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:57.350
and walk away from it,
because, truly, the best way

00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:01.410
of changing what's going
on is through voting.

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.380
I mean, that may
sound simplistic,

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:04.270
but I've been there.

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:05.050
I've seen it.

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:06.970
I know it can work.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.810
And I would have just
a few pieces of advice.

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.520
Don't vote for anyone who
says he or she will never

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.700
compromise-- and
does it proudly.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.680
You know, they have
all the answers.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.470
They even have a direct
channel to the Divine,

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.355
so they know what
should be done.

00:50:22.355 --> 00:50:23.419
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:23.419 --> 00:50:25.210
And therefore, they're
going to Washington,

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.160
or they're going to Sacramento--
wherever they're going--

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.451
and they will never compromise.

00:50:28.451 --> 00:50:31.170
That is death, to a democracy.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:34.650
I don't know if any of you
saw the great Steven Spielberg

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:37.200
movie about Lincoln, and trying
to get the 13th Amendment

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:37.930
passed.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:39.839
There was just a
great movie-- I mean,

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:41.880
a great play-- in New
York, called "All the Way,"

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.360
about LBJ trying to get
Civil Rights passed.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.620
You've got to compromise, if
you're going to make progress.

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.750
And so don't vote for people--
don't give them money,

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:53.340
don't encourage them.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.370
You can be
conservative, but find

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:58.130
people who understand the
meaning of conservative.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.050
It's not radicalism.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:02.880
It's conserving,
and trying to build

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.370
on institutions that work.

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:11.140
And then, finally-- to go to the
final part of your question--

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.840
it's not only what
citizens should do,

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.360
in terms of voting and
contributing and trying

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.370
to pick people who will be
better partners in solving

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:20.640
our problems, but it's
what leaders, themselves,

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.300
have to do.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:27.100
And Washington is, now,
set up for dysfunction.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.060
People are elected, often,
with the best intentions,

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.740
and then they get there, and
they spend all their time

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.240
raising money so that they can
be reelected the next time,

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.698
instead of doing
the work that they

00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:39.680
were elected to
do the first time.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.360
And they also are
rarely with each other.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.750
It didn't used to be that way.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.820
You met across the aisle.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:51.659
You met across the
ideological divide.

00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:52.700
And we're not doing that.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.570
So people don't get
to know each other.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:57.790
And so I think if
you are running

00:51:57.790 --> 00:51:59.710
for one of these
offices, you just

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:02.750
have to be absolutely
committed to spending

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:04.599
a lot of time trying
to build relationships,

00:52:04.599 --> 00:52:06.890
because, at the end of the
day, that's what it's about.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.820
You have to have enough
trust, enough understanding,

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.350
to be able to make decisions.

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:13.660
And you know, that's what
we're missing, right now.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.440
ERIC SCHMIDT: I would also
add-- I have to bring your book

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.940
back--

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.180
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.070
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Quote-- "In general,

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:20.335
I was surprised how many
people in Washington operated

00:52:20.335 --> 00:52:22.050
in an evidence-free zone"--

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:22.925
HILLARY CLINTON: Yes.

00:52:22.925 --> 00:52:23.915
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:23.915 --> 00:52:26.290
ERIC SCHMIDT: --"where data
and science are disregarded."

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.884
You then go on and quote
an unnamed senior Bush

00:52:28.884 --> 00:52:31.300
administration official, who--
I'm dying to figure out who

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.779
this is-- who said, "'the
reality-based community

00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:35.820
of people, who believe
that solutions emerge from

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.540
your judicious
study of discernible

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.670
reality.' I've always
thought that's, exactly,

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:41.700
how to solve problems.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.664
The Bush aide went
on, 'That's not

00:52:43.664 --> 00:52:45.330
the way the world
really works, anymore.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.180
We're an empire,
now, and when we act,

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.777
we create our own reality.' That
attitude helps explain a lot

00:52:50.777 --> 00:52:52.860
of what went wrong (LAUGHING)
during those years."

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.470
So maybe the answer
is also, let's

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:59.500
go back to the-- we can debate
the principles, and so forth,

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.125
but let's make sure
the data's correct.

00:53:01.125 --> 00:53:03.583
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, and what
a place to talk about this.

00:53:03.583 --> 00:53:05.060
I mean, that's
exactly-- I mean, I

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.360
used to give speeches about
being in an evidence-free zone,

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.660
in the Senate.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:14.250
And we've got to figure out
a better way of breaking down

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:18.850
the intellectual barriers
that exist between people

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:22.590
of different political beliefs.

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.520
There's recent research
that's been done--

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.550
and I would welcome
any of your thoughts

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:30.460
on this-- that shows, if you
hold an opinion strongly--

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.700
like, let's just pick
supply-side economics--

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.712
trickle-down economics--
which don't work;

00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:36.170
there's no evidence
that it works--

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:39.310
but it is deeply
believed by people.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.520
Or that immigration is
bad for the United States.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.640
Totally wrong; evidence to the
contrary, going out for miles--

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.980
ERIC SCHMIDT: Can we just pause?

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.580
Like, isn't that amazing,
that we just heard this?

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.020
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:48.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.970
I know.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.530
ERIC SCHMIDT: This country
was built on immigration.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.890
HILLARY CLINTON: 100%.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:58.950
And we know we have
evidence, but oftentimes it's

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:02.370
difficult to break through
the psychological barriers

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:03.610
to hearing that.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.460
So we've got to do a better job.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.140
And I think about this a lot,
because of the dysfunction.

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.460
Some people deny climate
change because they

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:15.810
think they are doing it
to protect industries

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:18.550
they make money from, or
they get contributions from.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.680
Some people deny it because they
don't understand the science,

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.370
and they kind of, you know,
just throw up their hands.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:26.760
And it's easier to say, oh,
well, it'll all work out.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.520
Some of it-- some people deny
it for religious reasons;

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.950
whatever.

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.880
That's just one
example of an issue

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.260
that we are gridlocked over.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.770
And thank goodness for
President Obama beginning

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:40.070
to do things that will
deal with climate change

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.840
through executive action.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.510
But how do we begin to
have a conversation, again,

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.740
where we actually
listen to each other?

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.920
Because, you know, we are much
less sexist, much less racist,

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.580
much less homophobic, than
we were, a decade or two ago.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.650
But, boy, the one
remaining bias we have is,

00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:59.290
we don't want to
be around people

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:02.540
who share a different
political opinion.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.540
You know, we just don't
want to argue with them;

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.873
we don't want to listen to them.

00:55:05.873 --> 00:55:07.500
And it's on both
sides of the divide.

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.835
So we've got to do a better job.

00:55:08.835 --> 00:55:10.210
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Question over here.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.510
HILLARY CLINTON: Sorry.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Secretary Clinton.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.860
I was hoping we could use
some of your experience

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.910
in dealing with rather
difficult international crises

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:24.090
and controversies with one
of the deep controversies

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:25.980
affecting us.

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.840
What do you think it
will take to resolve

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.890
the tension between advocates
of synchronous and asynchronous

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:32.154
programming models?

00:55:32.154 --> 00:55:33.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:33.516 --> 00:55:35.061
ERIC SCHMIDT: Um--

00:55:35.061 --> 00:55:36.985
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:39.470
Are you-- are you s-- oh.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.780
Would you like to--

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.090
HILLARY CLINTON: Well--

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:41.790
AUDIENCE: She's good.

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.330
HILLARY CLINTON: Yeah, well--

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:43.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.050
I mean, I'm no expert.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.030
But clearly--

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:47.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:47.176 --> 00:55:50.840
--you know, synchronous models
require lightweight threads.

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:56:00.297 --> 00:56:01.880
ERIC SCHMIDT: Have
you been-- have you

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.810
been spending some
time in Silicon Valley?

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:04.310
[LAUGH]

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:06.309
HILLARY CLINTON: I've
been thinking a lot, about

00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:07.175
Silicon Valley.

00:56:07.175 --> 00:56:09.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: Did you
actually have a real question?

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:12.141
Oh, actually, that was
the right answer, I guess.

00:56:12.141 --> 00:56:12.640
Right?

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:12.760
AUDIENCE: Hey, yeah.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.051
Since she's so good at this,
I'm wondering if, maybe, I

00:56:15.051 --> 00:56:16.726
could even ask you another one.

00:56:16.726 --> 00:56:19.210
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:23.280
AUDIENCE: Given-- there is
a suggestion that, given

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.600
increases in productivity,
over the past few decades,

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.760
that the total number of jobs
that the American economy can

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.650
even have may be structurally
less than the number of people

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:35.490
who are in need of
jobs, and even more so

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:38.172
for jobs that can actually pay
enough for someone to live on.

00:56:38.172 --> 00:56:39.130
HILLARY CLINTON: Right.

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:41.676
AUDIENCE: If this is really a
fundamental, structural reality

00:56:41.676 --> 00:56:43.050
we're going to
have to deal with,

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:44.740
how do we adjust
to such a world?

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.990
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I'm
really glad you asked that,

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:49.900
because I don't have a quick,
glib answer to give you,

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.310
but I can tell you
that I would love

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:55.560
to have any thoughts
from all of you,

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.240
because you are
making this new world.

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:01.130
I mean, Google is a part of
the future that is out there.

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:04.720
And, as I look around,
it's a very diverse crowd;

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:09.120
a lot of young and youngish
people who have, uh--

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:09.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think they
all look young, to you and me.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.102
HILLARY CLINTON: Yeah, they do.

00:57:12.102 --> 00:57:12.602
They do.

00:57:12.602 --> 00:57:13.990
ERIC SCHMIDT: [LAUGH]

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:18.890
HILLARY CLINTON: --who have
skills and abilities that are,

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:22.830
really, required,
in this new future.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:27.900
There is a serious political
and economic dimension to that.

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.400
And I don't think it's
enough to, basically,

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.120
say, everybody
else is just going

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.030
to have to get used to it--
live with it-- because that is

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:39.500
a recipe for, not only
increasing inequality,

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:43.230
but what inequality
does to social cohesion,

00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:46.020
to democratic institutions.

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.500
So I think it's one of the
most serious questions we

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.110
have to figure
out how to answer.

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:53.800
Now, you know, there are
some obvious, quick answers--

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.860
like, you have subsidized
employment for people,

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.530
in certain areas,
so at least they

00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:00.660
have something to do
all day, every day.

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:05.490
You try to figure out how you
create incentives for companies

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.762
to keep people employed instead
of making them unemployed-- you

00:58:08.762 --> 00:58:12.370
know, the German system, where
the government, basically,

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:13.746
subsidizes you,
to avoid layoffs,

00:58:13.746 --> 00:58:16.120
but then you've got to figure
out what to do with people.

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.850
I mean, there are
no easy answers.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:22.170
And, given the intellectual
brainpower in here,

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.510
the United States may be
getting to this sooner

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:25.930
than other parts of the world.

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.930
Everybody is going to get to it.

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:29.450
I mean, right now,
the Chinese are

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:31.540
trying to figure out
how they continue

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:35.060
taking tens of millions of
people out of rural areas,

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:40.780
bringing them to urban areas,
and putting them to work, when

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:43.560
wages are going to rise, when
their economic advantage, then,

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.400
may be diminished.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.331
So this is a huge social,
political, economic issue.

00:58:47.331 --> 00:58:49.580
And if you've got any thoughts,
I'd love to hear them.

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.290
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's have a
quick question, over here.

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:54.020
AUDIENCE: Secretary Clinton,
it's an honor to have you here.

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.686
I saw you on the
"Daily Show," recently,

00:58:55.686 --> 00:58:58.530
where Jon Stewart preemptively
announced your candidacy

00:58:58.530 --> 00:58:59.390
for President.

took my daughter--

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:05.890
about six years ago-- to
the Democratic primaries,

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:07.550
to vote for you.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:10.061

ERIC SCHMIDT: She's
old enough to vote?

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.470
AUDIENCE: She-- she
came to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:16.050
HILLARY CLINTON: I'd love it.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:16.800
I'd love if I could do that.

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: Just checking.

[LIGHT LAUGHTER FROM AUDIENCE]

00:59:18.811 --> 00:59:20.310
AUDIENCE: How do
you-- and I thought

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:21.370
you handled it
quite graciously--

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:23.075
but how are you
going to handle it

00:59:23.075 --> 00:59:25.408
when there are so many people
are, obviously, interested

00:59:25.408 --> 00:59:26.965
in having you in
this next election?

00:59:26.965 --> 00:59:28.090
HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you.

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:30.166
Well, Jon Stewart
was a lot of fun.

taking your daughter.

We always took Chelsea to vote.

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:44.030
I mean, really, I think every
18-year-old old should be,

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.420
automatically, registered
to vote, upon turning 18.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.076
I think we need to
get young people--

00:59:48.076 --> 00:59:48.418
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:48.532
Absolutely.

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:59:48.988 --> 00:59:50.821
HILLARY CLINTON:
--involved in our politics,

00:59:50.821 --> 00:59:52.700
making those decisions.

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:56.320
This is a very personal
decision, for me.

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.430
And I don't take
it at all lightly.

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.560
I'm, sort of, feeling my way
through it and toward it.

01:00:04.808 --> 01:00:08.680
I think we face some very
serious, hard choices,

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.520
as a nation.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.400
And I have no illusions about
what a president, alone,

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.130
can do, because it's necessary
to bring the Congress,

01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:19.850
to bring the private
sector, to get people

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.380
from all walks of life involved.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:27.070
But I think we're
at a real juncture.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:31.090
And I'm well aware that I
have a lot of experience;

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:35.850
I've seen the presidency, up
close-- now, over 20 years,

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.000
both because of my husband,
and also, I worked closely

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
with George W Bush,
after 9/11, because I

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.060
was a senator from
New York, and we

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.480
had to rebuild Lower Manhattan.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.090
And then, obviously,
working closely and becoming

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:51.600
not just a partner, but a
friend, of President Obama.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.100
So I am going to take
my time, because I

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.450
know that, once I decide if I
am going to run, it's nonstop.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.830
And the campaigns are
even more demanding

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.520
than they were four years ago.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.350
And so, I mean, I've talked with
people in the Obama campaign,

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.270
and they, basically,
say, you know,

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:13.980
2012 was so much more
advanced, technologically--

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.860
and in terms of voter
outreach-- than 2008.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:21.000
And we don't even know what's
going to be required in 2016.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.610
And I'm sure a lot of you--
because of what you work on,

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:27.020
invent, and the like--
will be part of that.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:32.000
So I want to be sure that it's
the right decision for me,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.600
and that I will not
just-- I say in the book,

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.810
you shouldn't ask
somebody, in my opinion,

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:40.310
whether they're going to run,
or if they think they can win.

01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:41.680
Those are the easy questions.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.730
And most people who run
for president-- no matter

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:46.530
what you think-- think they can
win, or they wouldn't do it.

01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:47.670
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:49.680
But, really, what's
your vision for America,

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.570
and can you lead us there?

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:53.140
And I think that's
going to require--

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.348
and it goes to the great
question that was asked over

01:01:55.348 --> 01:02:00.610
here-- it's going to require
some really careful analysis

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:02.340
and agenda-setting.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.660
Because you-- in my opinion,
whoever runs-- and, certainly,

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.920
if I were to run,
I would want to run

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.982
on as specific an
agenda as possible.

01:02:09.982 --> 01:02:11.940
Because I don't want
there to be any illusions.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.900
You know, we don't have time
for people to just think

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.880
in very general
terms, because we

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.460
have to get a consensus, coming
out of this next election,

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.350
about what we're going to
do, to solve these problems.

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.200
And, hopefully,
bring some people

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.490
into the Congress-- on both
sides of the aisle-- who

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:32.350
are willing to compromise
and make those tough calls.

01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:34.730
So I'm thinking
about it, and I hope

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:36.820
you'll say hello to
your daughter for me.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:37.320
[LAUGH]

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:37.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.634
ERIC SCHMIDT: So, uh,
so, Secretary Clinton--

01:02:39.634 --> 01:02:43.610
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:46.130
--we have a way-- we have
a way of asking people,

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:50.090
during the audience, what the
most important question is.

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:54.230
And when you became
First Lady, your name

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:57.990
was determined by the
tradition of "First Lady."

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.190
HILLARY CLINTON: True.

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:03.940
ERIC SCHMIDT: And Googlers want
to know the following question.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:09.270
They want to know the
name of President Clinton,

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.521
in a scenario where there's
another President Clinton.

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.520
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.150
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:14.691
ERIC SCHMIDT: Googlers
have indicated

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:16.840
that there are two choices.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.640
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: The
first one is "Bill."

01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:25.040
So it would be "Ms.
President and Bill"--

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.571
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

01:03:26.571 --> 01:03:29.237
ERIC SCHMIDT: --which would have
a certain gender equality-- you

01:03:29.237 --> 01:03:31.660
know, "Mr. Clinton
the First Lady."

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.566
And the second one
is "First Laddie."

01:03:33.566 --> 01:03:34.566
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

01:03:34.566 --> 01:03:35.066
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:35.066 --> 01:03:39.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: So we're going
to-- Google does things

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.050
by consensus and by votes.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:41.390
HILLARY CLINTON: Aha!

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:44.110
ERIC SCHMIDT: So we're going
to determine this for you, now.

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:45.109
HILLARY CLINTON: Oh, my.

01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:47.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: So I need a
sign of hands of all-- those

01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:49.150
are your two choices.

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:52.450
She should call him "Bill?"

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:53.529
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.570
ERIC SCHMIDT: She should
call him "First Laddie?"

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:56.702
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:58.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: The
decision is made.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.560
We're announcing it
today, Mrs. Clinton.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.540
He's going to be
called "First Laddie."

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.665
Would you like to respond?

01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:04.165
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:04.165 --> 01:04:05.915
HILLARY CLINTON: Oh--
oh, my goodness--

01:04:05.915 --> 01:04:06.790
ERIC SCHMIDT: If not,

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:07.595
[BOTH LAUGH]

01:04:07.595 --> 01:04:09.800
HILLARY CLINTON:
That's very good, Eric.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.440
Oh.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.485
I have to say-- um--

01:04:12.485 --> 01:04:13.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: "Bill."

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.634
I would have voted for "Bill."

01:04:14.634 --> 01:04:15.550
HILLARY CLINTON: Yeah.

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.260
You know, I-- there
was one choice

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.260
that I'm more partial
to-- not that-- uh, this

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.091
is a hypothetical.

01:04:20.091 --> 01:04:20.590
Um--

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:21.465
ERIC SCHMIDT: [LAUGH]

01:04:21.465 --> 01:04:22.721
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:22.721 --> 01:04:24.669
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:27.382 --> 01:04:29.090
HILLARY CLINTON: And
that's "First Mate."

01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:29.800
I kind of like that.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: "First Mate"?

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:30.593
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:30.593 --> 01:04:31.360
HILLARY CLINTON: "First Mate."

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: "Ms.
Clinton and First Mate"?

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:33.870
HILLARY CLINTON: [LAUGH]

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:34.380
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.296
ERIC SCHMIDT: Come on!

01:04:35.296 --> 01:04:37.320
We can do better than that!

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.970
HILLARY CLINTON: (LAUGHING)
Well, we have to see.

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think you
can see-- first place,

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:43.500
we're going to have
a book signing,

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.040
after this, in [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.350
I think you can see, in
Secretary Clinton-- Senator

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.380
Clinton, First Lady
Clinton-- a person

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.670
of enormous impact on our world.

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:55.380
Somebody who has
spent her entire life

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.510
with this prodigious
mind, trying to serve us.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.280
I'm proud to be
your friend, and I

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.030
admire everything you've done.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:04.300
And I know people in this
audience feel the same way.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:04.790
HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:05.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
congratulations [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.235
HILLARY CLINTON: Thank
you all, so very much.

01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:08.126

01:05:08.126 --> 01:05:09.608
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank
you very much.

01:05:09.608 --> 01:05:11.090
HILLARY CLINTON:
(LAUGHING) That was great.

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:11.941
That was something!

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.066
ERIC SCHMIDT: "First Mate!"

01:05:13.066 --> 01:05:17.018
HILLARY CLINTON:
[LAUGH] That was great.

01:05:17.018 --> 01:05:18.994
