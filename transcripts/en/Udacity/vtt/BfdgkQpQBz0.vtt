00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[D. Evans] So here's the Python expression to compute that.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're multiplying the speed of light times 100cm in a meter

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
times 1 divided by 1 billion.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One nanosecond is 1 billionth of a second.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You'll note that I can't have space in the numbers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's convenient when I write out the numbers to put spaces in them

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so we can see how big they are.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Python doesn't allow that. That looks like separate numbers if we have spaces there.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That wouldn't be valid in the Python grammar,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so we can't have the spaces there.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So when we run this, we get the result 29.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That says it's about 29cm that light travels in 1 nanosecond.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is a little surprising that it's an exact number and it's an integer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And the reason it's an integer is because of the way Python does arithmetic.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If all of the numbers here are integers, Python will truncate down to the integer.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If we want a more accurate result, we should turn one of these numbers

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
into a decimal number.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So now we've changed the 1 to 1.0.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now we run it and we get 29.9792458, so almost 30cm,

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which is a better answer than 29 was.
