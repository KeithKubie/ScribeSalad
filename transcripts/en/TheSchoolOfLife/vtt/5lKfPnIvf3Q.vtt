00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
We might assume that letting people know what we want and how we feel is relatively easy.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.260
We, surely, just open our mouths and say it.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.700
But human life shows extraordinary troubles around communicating

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.520
our intentions and emotions clearly and honestly.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.380
This is some of what we get up to as an alternative to straight forward communication.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.440
We say nothing but somehow expect to be understood anyway, and blame the person for not reading our minds.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.200
We don't get something off our chest,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.400
we go in for people pleasing behavior but secretly we build up hatred and resentment.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.040
We pretend we don't care.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860
We become avoidant and tough.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.400
We say things are okay and they're not okay at all.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.100
We explode dramatically rather than explain calmly,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.180
the explosion often being the result of a past burial of the problem

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.980
that then gives way to eruption of resentment.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.480
We nag bitterly.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.460
We give up even trying to explain and get interested in trying to order, impose, and control instead.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.900
There's so much that we should be talking about:

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.040
what we want in bed, how hurt we are by certain things our friends and family do, usually inadvertently,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.980
how badly we need a cuddle, but don't want to look weak by asking,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.320
or, how we want to pay rise or promotion, or a shift to another role we feel sure we'd do very well.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.840
Non-communication starts early.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.420
It's almost always the result of a certain sort of childhood

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.600
in which we were not allowed to get things off our chest in a direct and sincere way.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.400
Perhaps we had an angry parent, around whom we had to walk on eggshells,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.080
we had to be so careful with what we said or a terrified explosion could be unleashed at any point.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.500
Maybe we had a prudish parent; it broke their heart every time we were a bit rough or unhygenic

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.580
no wonder we find it hard to be frank about our body and its desires and needs.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.360
Or maybe we had a very fragile parent, whom we loved, but were always afraid of bringing problems to

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.980
in case they couldn't take it or broke down.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.700
Or perhaps the parent was too preoccupied and busy;

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.040
our concerns were nothing next to the challenges they had

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.700
with the corner chop, the doctor's surgery, or the business.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.700
Bad communication has its roots in the feeling that "we can't be both truthful and tolerated and loved";

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700
"who you are isn't enough."

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.140
Once we get more conscious of how reluctant we are to communicate directly, we may be able to start to take action.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.160
By understanding our past we can see that the present may not in fact

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.060
require the compromises around communication we once had to accept as children.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.880
Without quite noticing it, we may be sticking to the very unfortunate habit that was formed, understandably,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.260
to deal with problems that actually belonged to another past era.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.640
We can afford to be bolder; we're stronger now and others are stronger than we might imagine.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.480
Most people can actually take some stiff news, and if they really can't, we can walk away.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.940
Put yourself in the shoes of those you're afraid of.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.840
Is it really so nice to be lied to or not told what matters?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.440
People need to know the bad news to fix it.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.300
We can endure the risk of being disliked in the name of a cleansing confrontation.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.600
We should go through mental exercises to practice an inner resilience around communication.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.780
"I may be sacked, but I can find another job."

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.760
"They may not like me here, but there'll be  other places where I can find friends."

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.180
"What I feel is not always bad or strange, it deserves to be heard!"

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.280
We have to tell ourselves helpful, important things that we fail to hear from others sufficiently loudly early on:

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.900
"you're going to be okay, whatever happens next;"

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.980
"I will love you even if the news is challenging."

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.340
Enough of stalking the Earth with our shoulders hunched and our eyes wary.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.340
We have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.640
We can afford to say what we really feel to those who deserve to hear it.
