1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.700
So tell me about your book you want,

2
00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:07.320
one of the things that was surprising that I had heard was you or your

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.220
experience with concussions now. Um, tell me about that.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.570
So when I've had concussions in that flip,

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:20.010
I was talking about 1998 day tone. I got a concussion from that crash. Uh,

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:25.011
I'd had concussions throughout my career at many different points and didn't

7
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.830
think anything of them. I thought when you, you know, when you got a concussion,

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.580
you joked about it with your buddies about how it made you feel and you just

9
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.540
rested until it was gone and you race through it.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.740
Uh, and eventually it go away and you were fine. You know,

11
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:44.340
it was just something that would go away. And you never thought anything about,

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500
you never thought about seeing a doctor.

13
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:48.180
You never thought about getting treatment.

14
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.240
You didn't know there was even treatment available for a concussion.

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.310
You just thought it was something like a bruise, you know.

16
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.840
So this is going on throughout my whole career. I was racing it. Uh,

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.820
I was testing it Kansas, uh,

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.800
motor Speedway in 2012 blue right front tire hit the wall at 185 miles an hour

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.190
and it screwed me up.

20
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.090
And so that was a really not, you know,

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.200
that wasn't a typical crash,

22
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.160
not something that drivers deal with usually in their career.

23
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.070
This was something that was unique to me, uh,

24
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.910
and it was just a terrible impact at a bad angle, at a very,

25
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.470
very fast rate of speed.

26
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.460
And I got out of the car and I knew something was wrong with me and I couldn't,

27
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
you know, I couldn't, I felt, you know,

28
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.880
just like I'd been hitting the head with a bat, uh,

29
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.380
shocked and shell-shocked in a way or just couldn't, I couldn't,

30
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.790
uh, shake it off. You know,

31
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:51.040
you just kind of wanted to shake your head and get it out,

32
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.200
whatever it was and you couldn't. Um, that's the way I failed. Immediately.

33
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.300
Immediately after that crash, we went,

34
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.580
our tests was done cause the car was killed.

35
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.840
So we went over to this place to get some lunch and we're sitting there and I

36
00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:09.160
started getting sick, nauseous before we ever, you know, I wouldn't even, uh,

37
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.210
we just ordered it. We just sat down and I started, I'm sitting with my team,

38
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.960
all my guys, and I'm, uh, starting to, I think I'm,

39
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.740
I'm throw up right there in front of him and I'm getting nervous and I don't,

40
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.920
I haven't said to them that I feel this way, you know,

41
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:28.240
so I don't want to tell them I feel this way. Um, but my crew chief,

42
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.640
Steve ATAR is like my brother. Um, as like Steve, I, uh,

43
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.770
am getting sick and something's wrong with me.

44
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.521
I don't know what's wrong with me,

45
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:39.880
but I got to get out of this room is a business lunch hour.

46
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.590
It's full of full of people, noises, talking, chatter, shit going on.

47
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:47.380
And I gotta get the hell out of there. Um,

48
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.310
and as I was getting up to leave my wife come walking in, they were,

49
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.930
she was coming to get me,

50
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.840
we were going to Washington Redskins Monday night game and uh,

51
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.960
sitting on her box with Dan Snyder and whoever else is.

52
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.360
So we had them plans to go. I said, Amy,

53
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.030
I'm gonna go lay down in the car. I just got to lay down the car for a minute.

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.010
And I laid down all the way in the car all the way to the airport. I'm thinking,

55
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.550
this is, this is bad, this is worse than I've ever failed anything.

56
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:20.200
But hopefully it's going to go away. And so we'd get the game we get,

57
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.010
we went into the Redskins game, we watched the game, uh,

58
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.330
did that whole thing.

59
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.650
And I went about four weeks of feeling bad and sick for about four weeks and it

60
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.900
finally went away. And I was,

61
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.480
I knew that was unusual for it to be that long,

62
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.770
but in my mind I wasn't thinking doctor. I wouldn't think in treatment.

63
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.330
I wouldn't think in anything like that.

64
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.160
It ain't crossed my mind to tell anybody here that I really needed. I thought,

65
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.180
you know, I thought that I had been dishonest and not,

66
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.510
uh, you know, I hadn't,

67
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.850
I hadn't been honest with everybody about the way I was feeling,

68
00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:03.170
but I didn't never think that it was going to cost me anything. So I thought,

69
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.630
all right, I'm feeling better. I'm good. Go to this race.

70
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.930
I've been racing the whole time. Right. Finally, four weeks later I'm great.

71
00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:13.730
I go to another race, I'm racing, I crashed and it all came right back,

72
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.210
like as bad as it was, if not worse.

73
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.110
And that's when I said I got to go to the doctor. This is bad. I can't,

74
00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:25.970
you know, I can't even, you know, I can't keep crashing like this.

75
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.360
Just putting these concussions so close together is a bad deal is dangerous.

76
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.880
And my, I couldn't bite my tongue,

77
00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:38.900
like my attitude and my emotions and shit was out of whack.

78
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.660
Like I couldn't control my anger and I was like, anybody would be,

79
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.780
anybody say something I didn't like. I'm like, you know,

80
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.000
I want to tell them to fuck off. You know? And that was just not like me.

81
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:54.230
I couldn't, I couldn't like keep myself calm and, uh,

82
00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.140
everything that I heard like made me angry. It was the craziest thing.

83
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.640
Even people just talking about stuff, but just get under my skin. I'm like,

84
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.010
uh, real impatient. Um,

85
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.830
and there was some new symptoms, but I finally, uh, I went to the doctor and,

86
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.540
and uh, got to, I went to this neurosurgeon, Charlotte,

87
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.660
Dr. Petty. He's like, I want you to meet this guy in Pittsburgh.

88
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:24.950
His name's Mickey Collins.

89
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.600
He works with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the penguins. And, uh,

90
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.240
I'm like, all right. I go up there and I'm thinking,

91
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:33.500
I'm going to meet this guy that works,

92
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.820
works with the penguins in the Steelers and he sees, you know, players,

93
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.180
but he's a, he's a doctor that sees anybody and everybody,

94
00:05:41.181 --> 00:05:44.930
like there's kids in there, you know, that got hurt playing on the playground.

95
00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:49.850
There's workers, uh, con, you know, uh, carpenters, Housewives,

96
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.760
everybody's in that damn waiting room to see this man.

97
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.600
He sees about 25 people a day. And, um,

98
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.940
he's an expert on head injuries and he's got, you know, he's just,

99
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.520
he's on the cutting edge of whatever the hell the new shit is. He knows,

100
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.340
and he's, you know, his team and his people are investigating it.

101
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.600
And so there, uh, he fixed me. So I go there and I'm like,

102
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.170
this is what happened. This is how it happened. I crashed. I hit it.

103
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.140
I didn't tell anybody about it. I was sick for four weeks. I got better.

104
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.990
I crashed in this race and I feel sick again. And he was like, well,

105
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.450
these are two different injuries of two different parts of your brain.

106
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:31.250
The first injury you bruised, uh, right front edge of your brain. Uh,

107
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.490
when you hit the wall, he said this, the second crash,

108
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.740
you twisted the base of your brain and injured some things in the back of your

109
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.160
brain and that's why you're having the emotion or different things like that.

110
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.450
So, uh, but he went deeper into it than that. He was like, you know,

111
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.260
we did all these, uh, tests and, um,

112
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.120
visual tests and all kinds of stuff for, for, and I'd go back to,

113
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.590
I mean, we did this thing. We did,

114
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.370
I went through the gamut for a whole day of doing tests and then I went back

115
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.570
every, uh, week, uh, before I, you know,

116
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.340
and in two weeks I was back racing again. I was clear. And, uh, so he,

117
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.950
he took an injury that I hid and took four weeks to heal and healed it in two

118
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:20.900
weeks. What did he do to heal it? Um, he gave me,

119
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.670
I never took any medication on this particular, uh, issue.

120
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.440
He gave me a home exercises and I exercises. There was a,

121
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.600
I had problems with focusing and making my eyes work, tracking your knowledge.

122
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.270
It's like a bird flying across the sky or anything like that. I couldn't,

123
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:39.470
my eyes couldn't stay on it.

124
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:43.760
If I looked at you and my eyes would bounce off of you. Um,

125
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.570
and they just wouldn't stay, you know, if you said, Hey man,

126
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:49.610
we'll take a picture and you held up a camera.

127
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.620
And I tried to look at the lens and smile,

128
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:55.340
my eyes would wanna jump off of that object. They would want.

129
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.910
They didn't want to look at what I wanted them to look at and track anything

130
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.690
going anywhere. And this is the cause of that. Um,

131
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.900
the, the brain has the ocular stuff.

132
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.100
Uh,

133
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.670
I mean you can have injury to that part of your brain or you can have an injury

134
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:15.470
to the vestibular part of your brain that,

135
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.590
that of that may like if you had bad balance,

136
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:21.440
then that your eyes and your balance work together.

137
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.190
And so if you have a vestibular issues that can create ocular issues and um,

138
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.200
that can create, um, that, that can affect your, uh,

139
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.140
anxiety and depression and things like that. So all of these,

140
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.260
you can have an injury to one part of your brain that affects four other areas.

141
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.220
And so, and we talk about that in the book. Mickey comes into the book and,

142
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.820
um, I'll talk, you know, I'll say this is what I was feeling.

143
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.640
This is what I did. And Mickey, you will come in behind me and say,

144
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:56.370
this is the medical science behind that and this is how we treated it and why.

145
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.050
But I would have an injury to one singular area of my brain,

146
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:04.170
but I would have four different symptoms affecting four different parts of my

147
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:08.970
brain for different senses. And um, you know,

148
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:13.410
he would have to hone in on the one that was broken and then know to fix it.

149
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.760
And when he started fixing it,

150
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.520
all the other ones would start communicating together.

151
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:20.580
The brain would start working in balance and visual and all those things would

152
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:24.210
start to work again in anxiety and all those things, you know,

153
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.620
begin to come back in tune. No. When you said he fixed it,

154
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.440
like what is he doing? Uh, he, well,

155
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.330
so he gave me physical exercises to do.

156
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.100
I had some balance issues. Basically if I was, if I turned my head,

157
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.150
uh, or looked up and down, I would get dizzy and sick.

158
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.760
Like my stomach would turn if I turned my head left a ride.

159
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.560
If I looked up and down, just sitting there,

160
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.590
like the best thing for me was just sit on the couch and not move.

161
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.230
And so like literally not move and I felt fine then.

162
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:03.090
But if I moved an inch man, it was like Mike, it'd make you stomach nauseous.

163
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.450
And so I did a lot of motion.

164
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.780
I did a lot of exercises that created a ton of motion with my head.

165
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.080
I'm lifting heavy balls up and passing them over my shoulder this way or that

166
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:18.990
way, taking a ball and turning around and hit it this way,

167
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.260
taking the ball and turn around and hit that. Just doing that for,

168
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.820
for hours and hours and hours. And so I would train basically,

169
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.690
uh, I was training myself to, to balance again, you know, training my training,

170
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.760
my body to balance itself again.

171
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.000
And as in my,

172
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.140
if I couldn't see a horizon or a flat surface, uh,

173
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:47.730
I couldn't tell which way was up. And yeah, it was so bad. And,

174
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.300
um, the visual stuff, there was these a,

175
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:59.301
I had a string with these balls on it and I would hold the string on my nose and

176
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:03.600
hold it out here and I had to look at all those balls and it would, my ma,

177
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.200
my eyes are focusing just all it's doing is really just making my eyes change,

178
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:11.940
focus from one to the next to the next and back on to the next, next and back.

179
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.780
And there was this ad chart on the wall and it had all these letters and all

180
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:17.910
these numbers on it. And I had to, uh,

181
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.450
I had to look at that chart and turn my head back and forth this way,

182
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:25.050
but look at that eye chart and count and count, uh,

183
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.530
dude from a to Z, but backwards do the alphabet.

184
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.650
So I'd have to look for the letters. Where's the, you know,

185
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:36.000
and go backwards or one, one to 20, you know. Oh, why are you shaking your head?

186
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.990
Two, three, yeah. And standing up and walking backwards and walking forward.

187
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.590
And what is this doing to your mind? Like, how do, how does this fix your mind?

188
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.670
What is the mr process? You know, I don't know what the real,

189
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.700
I don't know what it's the,

190
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.830
I've had the problem with me was my system.

191
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:58.630
So my ability to understand, balance and understand horizons.

192
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.660
And so I was putting my mind in a perplex,

193
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:05.561
uh,

194
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:10.270
in a complex environment or making my mind do complex things that you don't do

195
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.790
every day and it's just firing and it's, yeah,

196
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.030
it's kind of like stretching this muscle, you know, it's like,

197
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.840
it's like they used to say when you would get hurt to go into a dark room and

198
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.680
hide and, or you know, no, no electronics, no TV,

199
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:27.250
just sit in a dark room and wait. And what they're,

200
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.840
what they believe today is that exposure is what helps pushing yourself into

201
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.690
these complex environments and doing things that are really challenging for

202
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:36.100
yourself. Even doing that,

203
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.680
if I put you in front of that ad chart and made you turn your head back and

204
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:42.160
forth and walk, walking two steps forward, two steps back and doing it would be,

205
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.390
it'd been difficult for you. Um, uh, so,

206
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.500
but for an injured person it's super difficult. It has to be really challenging.

207
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.360
Um, but it just sort of tunes the mind or to retrains the brain to do balance to

208
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:57.100
balance it retrains the eyes to,

209
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.160
to track on objects and to lock on objects and stay on them.

210
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:04.060
And what's crazy is it sounds like physical rehab, if you had a knee injury,

211
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.000
there's a physical yes, there's a lot of physical rehab to it.

212
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.650
There's a ton of it.

213
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.970
And don't think about that when it comes to the mind though.

214
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.570
I'm actually think of the mind is like something that needs to be healed with

215
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.630
medicine. Yeah, I agree. Um,

216
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:22.270
all the probably 85% of the work that I did was physical therapy.

217
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.510
<v 1>Does your diet or anything like that?</v>

218
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.670
Cause they say inflammatory causing [inaudible]

219
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.650
<v 0>foods. Are inflammation causing foods? I did not. I did not change.</v>

220
00:13:30.651 --> 00:13:34.670
I drank strictly drank water. I didn't drink anything other than water.

221
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.840
And uh,

222
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:40.640
I incorporated bananas and things like that into my diet that I never ate before

223
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.860
it and cause of potassium.

224
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.830
What effect does potassium have on in recovery?

225
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.370
I just hear that it's good for your brain. It's good for your brain is hurt.

226
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.210
Yeah, I did not, my doctor didn't say start eating this stuff, but it was just,

227
00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:57.560
you know, you got, you get tidbits like when you go and get injured like that,

228
00:13:57.561 --> 00:14:00.230
you're going to get people texting you and giving you the information here and

229
00:14:00.231 --> 00:14:02.510
there and you kind of take what you want and go at, you know,

230
00:14:02.511 --> 00:14:06.920
I don't know about that, but, um, did you ever mess with CBD at all? CBD?

231
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.880
<v 1>You don't know what that is? No. No. Interesting. Um,</v>

232
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:14.770
CBD is a non-psychoactive form of hemp and uh,

233
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.420
it's a radical inflammation fighter in a lot of people that have like some

234
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:21.550
pretty significant injuries to the brain.

235
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.860
A lot of fighters take it like right after fights. It used to be, um,

236
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.310
it's still questionable federally.

237
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.021
Like they're trying the,

238
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:35.950
there's some pushes to try to make it illegal just because of pharmaceutical

239
00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:38.950
drug companies kind of putting pressure on them. Doesn't do anything.

240
00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:40.600
In terms of like get you high or anything?

241
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.180
<v 0>No, I've actually, I actually read a little bit about that, um,</v>

242
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.610
just a couple of weeks ago because it, um, controls anxiety and,

243
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.130
and has helped a lot of people. That one of my biggest,

244
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.770
one of the problems that I faced just on a, you know,

245
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:57.800
on the regular everyday is, is where my anxiety is. Like,

246
00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:01.910
is that because of being famous? I don't know.

247
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:05.710
I think it comes from like your childhood and just things that you experienced

248
00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:09.020
in life. And what are you anxious about? Um,

249
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.240
<v 1>just general social situation.</v>

250
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:19.200
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I mean I, I would avoid, I would, I've,</v>

251
00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:23.330
I've gotten a lot better. Like I go, I can't, I, I would avoid concerts.

252
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.650
Even if I love the band, I would, uh, just cause there's too many piano. Yeah.

253
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.060
Yeah. But does it 200 people that are gonna bother you? No. No. Um,

254
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.370
I don't think so. And I like being bothered.

255
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:36.980
I don't mind people coming up to me and saying, man, that's cool.

256
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:39.470
I know you are. I mean, that shit feels great,

257
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.830
but it was more about like,

258
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.970
am I going to be accepted? Is it? My scene is,

259
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.540
I don't know, man. I just always had a lot of anxiety over it.

260
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.500
<v 1>Oh, okay. So anxiety about whether or not</v>

261
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.220
<v 0>you're going to fit in fit in. Yeah. Okay.</v>

262
00:15:56.221 --> 00:16:00.990
So you felt like an outsider when you're younger. Yeah. Yeah. So that anxiety,

263
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.000
I don't know, I still feel, um, I D I don't,

264
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.310
you know, so that shit goes away hard. Takes a long time for that to go away.

265
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.000
Yeah. Yeah. Like my wife, um, she, uh,

266
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.330
likes ashwagandha. You ever heard the around around? Yeah. So she,

267
00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:20.940
she likes that and I take that every once in a while and I think that shit works

268
00:16:20.941 --> 00:16:25.500
pretty good. Kind of keeps you calm and, yeah. Yeah. So,

269
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.850
but I've never tried to,

270
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.660
I've read about when I was reading about ashwagandha is when I read about that

271
00:16:30.661 --> 00:16:31.620
stuff you're talking about,

272
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.440
<v 1>I'll get you something. It'll help. CBD is amazing and you know what?</v>

273
00:16:35.441 --> 00:16:35.901
It's really good.

274
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.620
There's some muscle balms that work really good on sore joints and stuff.

275
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.490
I mean, but like, and nothing I've ever used before, better than anything.

276
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.990
CBD just gets right into the muscles. And just relaxes all the inflammation.

277
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.740
And the best part about it is it's 100% natural and no side effects.

278
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.690
There's nothing but in terms of like,

279
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:56.900
there's a bunch of different CBD oils you can take and you just,

280
00:16:56.901 --> 00:17:00.650
they chilly out but they don't get you high or anything. You're not weirded out.

281
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.870
But they just just calm me down. Right.

282
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.440
And I wonder how much that calming down is because of inflammation.

283
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:11.270
Just reducing inflammation and just, it just, it seems to, your body has a,

284
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.790
your body knows what to do with it. He bought, he's like, Oh,

285
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:16.820
I know what this is. This is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.380
I mean I got Ted NuGen into it. Really? Man, Ted Nugent, before he came on here,

287
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.160
he was telling me how he's on anti marijuana and this and that,

288
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:28.040
and we had this conversation about it, but makes people lazy. I'm like,

289
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.970
I don't think it does, man. I think people are just lazy. And I told him,

290
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.860
because I know he's got some serious knee problems,

291
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:36.560
had all these knee surgeries. He's, you know, he's a mad man.

292
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:39.710
He used to jump off the top of the fucking stage and land on the ground and blew

293
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.790
his meniscus out. Yeah.

294
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.210
I got him on the CBD balm now and now he texted me the other day. He said,

295
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.930
there's not a thing I've ever used. It's helped me like this before. Really?

296
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.230
Yeah. So now I'm having cases sent to him like every week. Yeah.

297
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:56.400
He loves the shit. I mean, he's, he wants to endorse it, which is hilarious.

298
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.230
Like the motor city madman, Ted Nugent, super anti marijuana, wants to enjoy,

299
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.920
so endorsed a cannabis product that's helped as Nick. Yeah. Yeah.

300
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.870
But it doesn't do anything to you psychologically.

301
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:11.580
It doesn't affect you calm me down. Yeah. That's what I read about it. Yeah.

302
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.740
Doesn't have that part of the part of the drug. My friend's son has,

303
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.410
um, it's a type of epilepsy, uh,

304
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.950
Brendan shop and he started giving his kid CBD oil and it stopped the epilepsy

305
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.723
in its tracks.

306
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.800
<v 0>Yeah. I think I read where they are. Um,</v>

307
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.200
it's been used for that for years. Yes. Yes. Yeah. To hail,

308
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.840
uh, for, um, God

309
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.480
<v 1>seizures. Yes. Yeah. For seizures. Yeah.</v>

310
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.490
It's just a radical inflammation, decrease her, just figures out a way.

311
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:47.820
It does it as some sort of interaction with your body where it just reduces

312
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:52.530
inflammation. But it's just like I said, it also calms people down,

313
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.760
alleviates anxiety and no side effects. That's the most important one.

314
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.300
Some people, it gives them a weird stomach. They don't like the way,

315
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:03.450
but I think they'd probably take it too much or maybe it's expired or something

316
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:07.380
like that. Yeah. I've never had those issues. But I'll get you something.

317
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.190
You should look into that too. Right? Yeah. So what else did they do with you?

318
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:15.210
Did you do any cryotherapy or anything like that that also would reduce

319
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:16.044
information?

320
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.480
<v 0>No, no. Basically I went and, um, in this,</v>

321
00:19:20.481 --> 00:19:24.590
in 2012, we did may S basic, basic, uh,

322
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.800
physical therapy and eye therapy,

323
00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:31.370
eye eye tests and different eye exercises.

324
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.840
Um, and in two weeks I was back in the race car raced for, that was

325
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.820
<v 1>in 2012. I raced all the way to 2016. Two weeks.</v>

326
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.070
You felt a hundred percent yeah. That's amazing.

327
00:19:43.071 --> 00:19:45.170
So with all these crazy exercise you're doing,

328
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.710
when did you feel like it settled in? Like, wow, this is really working?

329
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.060
<v 2>Uh, [inaudible]</v>

330
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.100
<v 0>pretty. I mean, if it was a two week period, it wasn't, you know,</v>

331
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.220
it was a day or two I guess. You know what I mean? I can't even remember.

332
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.910
I can't remember that far back a day or two. Yeah. I mean,

333
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:04.730
I imagine it was feeling pretty good after a couple of days. I'd have to,

334
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.320
I don't know. I mean, I don't know if it affected me right away or,

335
00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:12.470
but I know I was, by the time we had, I take an impact test,

336
00:20:12.471 --> 00:20:15.110
which is basically kind of measures memory and things like that,

337
00:20:15.111 --> 00:20:19.730
all kinds of different stuff. And my, um,

338
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.650
measurements had come back to my norm, you know, my basic, uh, uh,

339
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.311
you're, you know,

340
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:30.040
they kind of make you take the impact test beforehand so that gets your,

341
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.140
your blueprint of how you are and, uh, and then whenever you get injured,

342
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:38.950
you take it again and they'll line that up against, against that and say, okay,

343
00:20:38.951 --> 00:20:40.690
yeah, you're deficient here. This is a problem.

344
00:20:40.691 --> 00:20:42.880
Maybe it's not diagnosing a concussion,

345
00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:45.760
but it's asking us to look in this area.

346
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.980
And so you have a baseline and then you have whatever the post, you know,

347
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:55.450
your injury or post-crash uh, baseline is. Um,

348
00:20:55.451 --> 00:21:00.451
so I was matching all my normals on that impact test and that was kind of the

349
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:03.820
trigger for them to go, man, if you feel good, you look good here.

350
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.330
All the things you're saying that your back, you know. And uh,

351
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.750
I wanted to go race so I feel pretty good.

352
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:16.230
Is it a strange feeling knowing that you can't see what the damages like a brain

353
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:22.930
injury is a strange one, right? Because it's affecting everything in your body,

354
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:26.440
but you don't, you don't see it. Like if you have a broken arm,

355
00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.640
you're looking at it, you know, it's in a cast that gets fixed. You know,

356
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.740
you're, you're aware of it. You're doing rehab on it,

357
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:34.240
you're looking at and while you're doing it, yeah.

358
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.260
There's something about the brain where it's all like you can kind of mind fuck

359
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:43.060
yourself and say, I think, I think I'm okay. Yeah. That's why. So in the,

360
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.590
in the book I talk about these notes,

361
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:48.640
I started taking after that crash in 2012 when I would wreck after that I would

362
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.650
get sick and I wouldn't tell anybody.

363
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.640
And so I started writing these notes in my, in a journal, in my phone.

364
00:21:55.390 --> 00:22:00.390
And from 2013 all the way to 2016 I had this long journal of crashes and how I

365
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:03.700
felt and I would, uh,

366
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.270
crash on Sunday and I'd ride in the journal on Sunday night, Monday morning,

367
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:10.450
Monday at lunch, money at night, you know, every three times a day,

368
00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:12.640
every day until whenever I felt good,

369
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.000
which was usually either Wednesday or Thursday of that week.

370
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.220
And I was writing these notes because I couldn't tell if I was getting better

371
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.050
than the brain injury or any type of head injury. I mean, if you said,

372
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.280
how's it feel Monday? And then you asked me again Tuesday, I'd be like,

373
00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:31.360
I really don't fucking know man. It just, it's there.

374
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.630
I don't know if it's better, I just feels bad.

375
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.260
And so I would try to write is detailed as I could.

376
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.160
On a day on a Monday and then try to write as detailed as I could on Tuesday and

377
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:44.410
reread Monday and see, Hmm, is this better?

378
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.110
I can see in the comments or you know,

379
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.930
I can't really remember exactly what I was feeling Monday,

380
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:52.780
but in the comments it seems better and I would write these notes. Right.

381
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:58.140
And so I kept doing this and I thought I was treating myself and eventually it

382
00:22:58.151 --> 00:22:58.750
caught up with me.

383
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.380
Like I had about a dozen concussions in a period of about two and a half years.

384
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.100
Wow.

385
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.100
And I got to where I couldn't walk and I called my owner and I was like,

386
00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:12.010
man, I need to talk to ya can't race this weekend. I can't hardly walk.

387
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.090
And my balance is so bad that I can't get up off the couch without holding on to

388
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:19.030
something and walking across the room without grabbing stuff as I go.

389
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:24.310
And he was like, we got to go back to the doctor. What are you doing?

390
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.500
He was mad. He's like, you know, what do you fucking do?

391
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.950
And getting to the doctor, why aren't you at the doctor? And I was like,

392
00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:31.270
you're right, I need to go to doctor. I mean,

393
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:34.720
a concussed person doesn't have good judgment and self-awareness, you know,

394
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.280
you're just, you're just in a brick and you're in a, it's like being hung over.

395
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.310
You have the worst hangover, you can't make decisions.

396
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.100
And so I went back to Pittsburgh,

397
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.760
saw Mickey again and I had to stay out the entire whole half of the year in 2016

398
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.980
to get better. It took me five months to get, well instead of two weeks. Wow.

399
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.830
And that time, um, I was on,

400
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.280
they put me on medication that would drop my anxiety levels so the anxiety

401
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:04.700
levels would stay down so that I could concentrate on, uh,

402
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.620
the injury and what medications? Um, I'd ha,

403
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.370
I don't know exactly the names, but um, it was, uh,

404
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.350
it was very,

405
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:20.351
very small doses and it would take about three weeks for it just to kind of kick

406
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:24.140
in. I'd have to take it for a while before it started working. Um,

407
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:29.170
but it just made me real chill and it made me not analyze myself every single

408
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.000
day when I got up. When I got up I wouldn't go, Hmm, is it still there?

409
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.330
Is it as bad as it was? Let me walk across the room and see how I feel.

410
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:41.960
Let me go do this and test this and try this and try this and try this all day

411
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:43.220
long and see how I feel.

412
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.560
It made me stop doing that cause I was driving myself crazy and um,

413
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.080
he gave me a lot more physical therapy, basketball movements,

414
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.080
anything that got my head moving. Um,

415
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.080
I do those exercises for about two weeks.

416
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:02.720
Some of them would stop triggering symptoms.

417
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.210
I'd go back to his place in Pittsburgh.

418
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.140
We'd go through about 30 more exercises and I'd take home about 15 that made the

419
00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.530
symptoms trigger. And I do them for about two,

420
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.870
three weeks and some of them would stop working. I go back to him,

421
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:17.000
we'd go through more physical exercises to, you know,

422
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.860
kept doing that process over and over and over.

423
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.360
I took the medication for about a year and a half. Um,

424
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.700
and I had a lot of, they gave me this, uh,

425
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.910
computer program for my eyes and I was wearing these,

426
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.870
I would wear these three D glasses and uh, uh,

427
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.800
this computer program would try to take these three D objects and go to two D

428
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:42.510
and back to 3d in my eyes would literally try.

429
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.780
It would felt like it's trying to rip my eyes apart.

430
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.830
It hurt like physically hurt when this object would try to go from,

431
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.670
from uh, 3d to D and it was going very,

432
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:57.170
very slowly and it felt like it was trying to rip my eyes apart and imagine your

433
00:25:57.171 --> 00:26:00.470
eyes are tethered together so when you look left, they both go there, right.

434
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:03.170
And they both go wherever you look, they go together like they're supposed to.

435
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.420
And mine didn't want to do that. Mine,

436
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.870
you couldn't physically see my eyes towed out or going the wrong way.

437
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:11.780
You couldn't see that. But when I tried to look over here,

438
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.030
they both didn't go to the same place.

439
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.650
And that was that action or that,

440
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.420
that computer program was strengthening that activity of my eyes,

441
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:27.650
trying to do something together and I would walk.

442
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.633
So if I,

443
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.080
I've got these Buffalo on my property and they're across the field, wait,

444
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:35.300
you know, 200, 300 yards out across the field,

445
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.290
out the back window of my living room. And if I walked across the floor,

446
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.860
every step I took would knock my eyes off of the,

447
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.620
like they're way out there and I could look at them. But if I took a step,

448
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.880
my eyes would shake and I couldn't, I'd have to find them again, you know?

449
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.290
And so that would, that computer program would strengthen my ability.

450
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.860
It's called gaze stabilization. It would make it to where when I walk, I don't,

451
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.960
you know, if I'm walking or bouncing across the room,

452
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.730
I'm S I can still look at you in the eyes and you know, like a normal person.

453
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:11.070
And if I, when I was in my, at my worst, I couldn't do that. And so, uh,

454
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.460
but that took a long time to fix. And, uh,

455
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:18.870
the book basically is me admitting, making those mistakes. Uh,

456
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:22.710
I should've went to him as soon as I got sick again the first time.

457
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:26.090
Instead of trying to document it myself and, and hide it and,

458
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.270
and manage it myself and trying to get to whatever the end of my career was,

459
00:27:30.271 --> 00:27:32.280
whenever that moment was and retire,

460
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:36.570
thinking I was going to walk away without anybody ever knowing. Um,

461
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.540
and it, and I had to retire after that,

462
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:44.250
after that 2016 year of missing half a season and going through all that,

463
00:27:44.251 --> 00:27:45.420
I didn't want to go through it again.

464
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.710
I had one more year on my contract in 2017 so I finished that season.

465
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.060
And that was that. Were you apprehensive while you're finishing that season?

466
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.900
Yeah, I didn't want to get hurt.

467
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.570
I didn't want to go back through that whole process again and go through that

468
00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:59.280
rehab again. I didn't want to get sick again.

469
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.000
Me and my wife just got married on new year's of 2016 17.

470
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.710
So we are newlyweds. We're getting, she's pregnant. Uh,

471
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.800
we're going to have a baby. Um, you know,

472
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:13.320
I didn't want to go through any of that stuff sick.
