a new proof has been announced to which

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909
a new proof has been announced to which
 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.010
a new proof has been announced to which
they claim is the largest proof ever it

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
they claim is the largest proof ever it
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.770
they claim is the largest proof ever it
comes in two parts the first part is

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
comes in two parts the first part is
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.379
comes in two parts the first part is
this this is part 1 and part 2 is 200

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
this this is part 1 and part 2 is 200
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.790
this this is part 1 and part 2 is 200
terabytes large that is huge I'm gonna

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
terabytes large that is huge I'm gonna
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.140
terabytes large that is huge I'm gonna
start with something simpler something

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
start with something simpler something
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.349
start with something simpler something
perhaps you can try yourselves okay this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
perhaps you can try yourselves okay this
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.390
perhaps you can try yourselves okay this
is the idea let's take the numbers 1 to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
is the idea let's take the numbers 1 to
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700
is the idea let's take the numbers 1 to
9 I'm just going to draw them out in a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
9 I'm just going to draw them out in a
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470
9 I'm just going to draw them out in a
grid here I think these are the numbers

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
grid here I think these are the numbers
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.519
grid here I think these are the numbers
1 to 9 I'm not going to write the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
1 to 9 I'm not going to write the
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.370
1 to 9 I'm not going to write the
numbers in quite yet and now I'm

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
numbers in quite yet and now I'm
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.290
numbers in quite yet and now I'm
interested in a plus B equals C so these

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
interested in a plus B equals C so these
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940
interested in a plus B equals C so these
are gonna be whole numbers and I'm a I'm

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
are gonna be whole numbers and I'm a I'm
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310
are gonna be whole numbers and I'm a I'm
gonna have a plus B or C that's not a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
gonna have a plus B or C that's not a
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860
gonna have a plus B or C that's not a
difficult equation I want them to be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
difficult equation I want them to be
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720
difficult equation I want them to be
different so let's have a less than B

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
different so let's have a less than B
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.490
different so let's have a less than B
less than C can I color these numbers 1

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
less than C can I color these numbers 1
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.869
less than C can I color these numbers 1
to 9 using red and blue so that I don't

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
to 9 using red and blue so that I don't
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.540
to 9 using red and blue so that I don't
have a plus B equals C all the same

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
have a plus B equals C all the same
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.849
have a plus B equals C all the same
color so I don't want them to be all red

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
color so I don't want them to be all red
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860
color so I don't want them to be all red
or orbital that's something I want to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
or orbital that's something I want to
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.380
or orbital that's something I want to
avoid so let's try to see if we can best

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
avoid so let's try to see if we can best
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240
avoid so let's try to see if we can best
start with one it's a red there's no

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
start with one it's a red there's no
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.410
start with one it's a red there's no
reason why not and let's have to be at

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
reason why not and let's have to be at
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.120
reason why not and let's have to be at
blue this means 3 is 1 plus 2 that's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
blue this means 3 is 1 plus 2 that's
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010
blue this means 3 is 1 plus 2 that's
okay we can pick a color it could be red

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
okay we can pick a color it could be red
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.530
okay we can pick a color it could be red
or blue and Brady you could pick if you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
or blue and Brady you could pick if you
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.940
or blue and Brady you could pick if you
want do you want to be red let's make it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
want do you want to be red let's make it
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.410
want do you want to be red let's make it
red yeah ok fine so we'll have 3 in red

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
red yeah ok fine so we'll have 3 in red
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.969
red yeah ok fine so we'll have 3 in red
well that's interesting because now we

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
well that's interesting because now we
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.149
well that's interesting because now we
can make some deductions 3 is red one is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
can make some deductions 3 is red one is
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.300
can make some deductions 3 is red one is
red so four can't be red that's what

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
red so four can't be red that's what
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190
red so four can't be red that's what
we're trying to avoid we don't want them

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
we're trying to avoid we don't want them
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050
we're trying to avoid we don't want them
all to be the same color because then we

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
all to be the same color because then we
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999
all to be the same color because then we
would have a plus B equals C all the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
would have a plus B equals C all the
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.730
would have a plus B equals C all the
same color or one plus three equals four

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
same color or one plus three equals four
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.590
same color or one plus three equals four
would all be red that would be something

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
would all be red that would be something
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.620
would all be red that would be something
we're trying to avoid that means 4 it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
we're trying to avoid that means 4 it's
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359
we're trying to avoid that means 4 it's
going to be blue that's right for as

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
going to be blue that's right for as
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.679
going to be blue that's right for as
blue great but that's something we can

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
blue great but that's something we can
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.749
blue great but that's something we can
use as well 2 is blue for is blue 6 will

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
use as well 2 is blue for is blue 6 will
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.380
use as well 2 is blue for is blue 6 will
have to be red let's put 6 as red well

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
have to be red let's put 6 as red well
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.560
have to be red let's put 6 as red well
that's interesting now because we've got

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
that's interesting now because we've got
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.380
that's interesting now because we've got
1 plus 6 is 7 we're trying to avoid it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
1 plus 6 is 7 we're trying to avoid it
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690
1 plus 6 is 7 we're trying to avoid it
being red will have to be blue let's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
being red will have to be blue let's
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.229
being red will have to be blue let's
make it blue 6 plus 3 those are both

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
make it blue 6 plus 3 those are both
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.030
make it blue 6 plus 3 those are both
Reds

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
Reds
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.869
Reds
I'm gonna have nine as blue okay we're

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879
I'm gonna have nine as blue okay we're
 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.509
I'm gonna have nine as blue okay we're
doing okay so far don't have a problem

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519
doing okay so far don't have a problem
 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.550
doing okay so far don't have a problem
oh but wait there is a problem because 2

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560
oh but wait there is a problem because 2
 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.569
oh but wait there is a problem because 2
plus 7 is 9 and they're all the same

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579
plus 7 is 9 and they're all the same
 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.860
plus 7 is 9 and they're all the same
color oh no III messed up I didn't do it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870
color oh no III messed up I didn't do it
 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.470
color oh no III messed up I didn't do it
I failed here this has failed well

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480
I failed here this has failed well
 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.119
I failed here this has failed well
there's lots of other ways of coloring

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129
there's lots of other ways of coloring
 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.520
there's lots of other ways of coloring
in the numbers 1 to 9 in fact each of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530
in the numbers 1 to 9 in fact each of
 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.610
in the numbers 1 to 9 in fact each of
them has two options red or blue so it's

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620
them has two options red or blue so it's
 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.899
them has two options red or blue so it's
going to be 2 to the power 9 512 so

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909
going to be 2 to the power 9 512 so
 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.409
going to be 2 to the power 9 512 so
there's 512 ways new colors in is not

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419
there's 512 ways new colors in is not
 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.629
there's 512 ways new colors in is not
very hard for you to convince yourself

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639
very hard for you to convince yourself
 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.610
very hard for you to convince yourself
that you're always going to fail you're

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620
that you're always going to fail you're
 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.929
that you're always going to fail you're
always going to end up with something

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939
always going to end up with something
 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.300
always going to end up with something
like that or you could just check all

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310
like that or you could just check all
 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.309
like that or you could just check all
the options if you want you could check

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319
the options if you want you could check
 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.460
the options if you want you could check
the 512 options and you'll see and it's

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470
the 512 options and you'll see and it's
 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.580
the 512 options and you'll see and it's
not possible to avoid a plus B equals C

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590
not possible to avoid a plus B equals C
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.819
not possible to avoid a plus B equals C
in the same color that's what this

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829
in the same color that's what this
 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.129
in the same color that's what this
problem was about but they took it one

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139
problem was about but they took it one
 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.309
problem was about but they took it one
step further they were interested in a

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319
step further they were interested in a
 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.670
step further they were interested in a
squared plus B squared equals C squared

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680
squared plus B squared equals C squared
 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.439
squared plus B squared equals C squared
and they wants to color in the numbers

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449
and they wants to color in the numbers
 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.479
and they wants to color in the numbers
using red and blue just like we did

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489
using red and blue just like we did
 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.969
using red and blue just like we did
before but they wanted to avoid a

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979
before but they wanted to avoid a
 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.129
before but they wanted to avoid a
squared plus B squared equals C squared

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139
squared plus B squared equals C squared
 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.670
squared plus B squared equals C squared
being the same color so all being red or

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680
being the same color so all being red or
 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.879
being the same color so all being red or
all being blue now you might recognize a

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889
all being blue now you might recognize a
 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.159
all being blue now you might recognize a
squared plus B squared equals C squared

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169
squared plus B squared equals C squared
 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.649
squared plus B squared equals C squared
that's Pythagoras theorem but we're

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659
that's Pythagoras theorem but we're
 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.809
that's Pythagoras theorem but we're
interested in whole number solutions for

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819
interested in whole number solutions for
 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.869
interested in whole number solutions for
this so a solution might be 3 squared

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879
this so a solution might be 3 squared
 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.839
this so a solution might be 3 squared
plus 4 squared that is actually equal to

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849
plus 4 squared that is actually equal to
 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.059
plus 4 squared that is actually equal to
5 squared so we just check and that's

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069
5 squared so we just check and that's
 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.050
5 squared so we just check and that's
see if that's a solution 3 squared is 9

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060
see if that's a solution 3 squared is 9
 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.960
see if that's a solution 3 squared is 9
4 squared is 16 adding together is 25

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970
4 squared is 16 adding together is 25
 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.679
4 squared is 16 adding together is 25
great because 25 is 5 squared another

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689
