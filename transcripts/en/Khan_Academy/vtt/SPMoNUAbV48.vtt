00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:03.299
- Let's see if we can figure
out what 4 divided by 2/3 is,

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.197
and like always, pause this video,

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:08.124
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.180
Well, one way to approach it is to realize

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.603
that this is the same thing

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:16.270
as 4 times the reciprocal of 2/3.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:18.991
So it'd be 4 times 3

00:00:20.483 --> 00:00:23.647
over 2, and what is this
going to be equal to?

00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:27.002
You could pause the video
again if you're so inspired.

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.741
Well, what you need to realize
is this is the same thing.

00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:34.197
4 could be written as
a fraction as 4 over 1.

00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:36.947
So 4 over 1 times 3/2,

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:41.286
and we've multiplied fractions before.

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:43.527
To do that, you just
multiply the numerators.

00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:46.436
4 times 3 is equal to 12,

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:47.856
and you multiply the denominators.

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:49.971
1 times 2 is equal to 2.

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:54.243
12/2, well that's the same thing as 6.

00:00:54.243 --> 00:00:56.706
This is the same thing as 12 divided by 2,

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:59.455
but a key question is
why does this make sense.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:01.454
You know, I said dividing by something is

00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:03.945
the same thing as multiplying
by the reciprocal.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:07.414
And to think about that,
let's draw four wholes.

00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:11.242
So let me draw it in the same red color.

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:15.629
So let's say that this is
one whole right over here.

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:17.212
This is two wholes.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.420
This is three wholes.

00:01:21.872 --> 00:01:23.760
And then this is four wholes.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.287
So I have four wholes there.

00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:28.139
And imagine splitting it up into groups

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:31.411
that are each 2/3 of a whole.

00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:33.484
So actually, let me just divide everything

00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:35.581
into 1/3s real fast.

00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.748
So I'm gonna divide everything
into 1/3s, into 1/3s.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.365
So I'm gonna make each
group a different color.

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:46.948
So here's one group that is 2/3.

00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:51.784
Here's another group that is 2/3.

00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:57.496
Here is another group that
is, or another section,

00:01:57.496 --> 00:02:00.647
that I could say, that represents 2/3.

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:04.814
Here is another section
that represents 2/3.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.497
Here is another section.

00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:10.411
Folks, let me do that
in a different color.

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:11.244
Here is,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.627
here is another section

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:17.924
that can represent 2/3

00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:20.707
if I take those two blue 1/3s together.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.874
That's 2/3, and then last but
not least, I have another 2/3.

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:29.862
So how many sections that
are each 2/3 large do I have?

00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:31.279
Well, I have one,

00:02:32.488 --> 00:02:34.321
and then these is two,

00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:38.502
and then I have three,
and then I have four,

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:41.250
and then these two combined make a,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.792
make my fifth section that is 2/3 large,

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.170
and then finally, I have six.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.396
So I have six.

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.020
I can take four wholes and split it

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.187
into six equal sections that
are each 2/3 of a whole.

00:02:56.254 --> 00:03:00.253
So 4 divided into sections
that are 2/3 of a whole,

00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:02.253
you will get 6 sections.
