00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.150
- You can find full bios of
everyone here in your programs

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.670
already, but let me just say
that it's wonderful to have

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.812
people back at Radcliffe.

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:17.020
I think it's wonderful to
have people come back home,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.910
and to think of
this as a home base.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.970
And again, oh, the
puns, the bad cliches

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.190
will come flying when you
start talking about sports.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.160
But it's real, too, and
we are happy to have you

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.020
back, and thank you so much.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.960
Martha was Radcliffe
fellow in '09.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.880
You know she teaches
at Holyoke College

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.770
and she is the
author of Curveball,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.570
the biography of Toni Stone.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.130
Lydia, wow-- Lydia is
also a Radcliffe fellow.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.400
She is an award-winning
playwright

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.530
and I think her work
speaks for itself.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.190
Many of her plays explore race
and gender on different levels.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.195
And she's known here
at the Huntington,

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:03.070
the Goodman in Chicago, and her
plays have been across country.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.050
Megan-- thank you
so much for joining

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.690
us as well-- is an
accomplished theater director

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.760
with many credits to her name.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.850
She's worked with Lydia
on several other projects,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.891
and I think that synchronicity
was really helpful

00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:15.730
in this process.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.090
And she also works and consults
with arts organizations

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.760
to improve diversity
and inclusion.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.118
And Nambi Kelley is our
Toni this evening, our star.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.029
She has many TV credits and
stage credits to her name.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:34.570
And I think it's also important
to point out that you're also

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.610
a playwright, right?

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.400
And that you're working on an
adaptation of Toni Morrison's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.050
Jazz.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.600
So we have quite a distinguished
group here with us.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
And I kind of just wanted to
start off by asking you all--

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.010
I was trying to find
some commonality here

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.810
that we could begin
around sort of telling

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.240
the story of Toni Stone and
this idea of storytelling.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.210
And each of you tells
stories in different ways--

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.510
as an actress, as a
historian, as a playwright,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.230
and as a director staging
the stories as well.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.800
And I kind of wanted to
think of this as something

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.400
to sort of reflect on how you
go through that process, how you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.780
sort of discovered Toni Stone.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.155
Maybe starting with you Martha,
from the historical point

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:21.150
of view, getting a sense
of how you realized

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.240
that you had a
historical story to tell

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.074
that was important to you and
would be important to others.

00:02:28.074 --> 00:02:29.490
- Well, I just
first wanted to say

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.020
it's grand to be back
Dean Cohen, Judy.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.820
I wrote Curveball here so it
feels very, very wonderful

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.380
to acknowledge that, the support
I got and the gratitude I

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.580
feel for this wonderful place.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.770
I knew I wanted to--

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.710
I'd finish one book, I knew
I wanted to write a sports

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.350
book because I love sports.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.920
I think it's a great
lens for telling

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.632
multiple kinds of stories.

00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:01.590
And I just heard this--

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.210
I had heard this tag of the
woman who replaced Hank Aaron.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.310
And that's all I knew
about Toni Stone.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.590
And so I did some
basic research.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.160
To write a book,
I felt that I had

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.710
to meet three criterias,
three rings of the story.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.340
First, was it a good compelling
story about baseball?

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.020
Was there a narrative arc?

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.500
Was there enough drama to it?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.390
And I thought certainly
there was that.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.050
The second ring was
more complicated.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.070
David Halberstam the great
nonfiction writer once

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.980
said, "behind every
great sports story

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.530
is the story of a nation."

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.690
And I think that's
quite right if you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.350
think Muhammad Ali, Jackie
Robinson, Billie Jean King.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.150
And so I think Toni's
stories provides

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.430
that kind of look at
the period post-war

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.390
before the major events of
the Civil Rights Movement

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.310
to look at Jim Crow
America through, obviously,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.600
the lens of gender.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.540
What was it like
for a woman who had

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.260
this notion of doing something
that was not supported

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.690
by the culture,
that was sabotaged

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.209
by some members of her own team?

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.870
And then lastly, I felt it
had to say something about who

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.000
we are as human beings.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.780
And I didn't know
the answer to that.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.360
And it took a lot of
interviewing former players--

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.070
old guys in garages and
their basements telling me

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.050
the story--

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.000
to find out what that might be.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.080
And I met this one guy
who played with Toni.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.910
His name was Thomas
"Taterbuster" [? Bert. ?]

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.796
And we had an interview.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:05:00.404
Interviewing was winding
up and I asked him

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:01.320
what he was doing now.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.347
And he said he was
teaching his grandkids,

00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:05.930
coaching them, Little
League baseball.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.929
I said, what's the hardest
thing for them to do?

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:10.260
He said, hit a curve ball.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.620
And I did not know
exactly what he meant.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.690
I played softball,
but I didn't, I

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.100
don't know the strategy of it.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.650
So, he said, stand
up let me show you.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.810
And he pretended
like he threw a ball.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.250
And he said, to hit a curve
ball you have to step into it,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.230
not lean away from
it, which is kind

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.930
of counterintuitive to what
you think you should do.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.330
And months later, then that was
the third ring for me-- what

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.390
does this story tell us?

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.730
- I should probably
put that in the play.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.980
- What's that?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.920
- I should probably put that
in the play, very good telling.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.300
- [LAUGHING] Well, especially
because it took me like a year

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.180
to think about it.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.560
- I'll try and work that in.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.340
- But I think that that larger
question of what is this--

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.650
does Toni's story tell us about?

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.120
What does it mean
to be human-- is

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.820
when life hands
you one imperfect

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.450
chance to live your
dream, what do you do?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.330
You step into it.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.990
- Go ahead.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.865
- That was beautiful.

00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:03.906
- Yeah, that's beautiful.

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:05.600
- Beautiful.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.550
- That's just
absolutely beautiful.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.530
So, Lydia, you took
this frame where

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.140
we have Toni actually
telling her story.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.040
What was-- to me--
is there is there

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.570
a kind of counter storytelling
going on here as well?

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.310
A kind of reclaiming a
narrative about baseball

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.100
in a way that's adding to
the voice and the history

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.650
of baseball and--

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.270
- Well that's the kind of thing
people say about playwrights,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.680
not something playwrights
say about themselves.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.320
I would say that
my job, after all

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.400
of this beautiful foundation
that Martha has laid down,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.500
is to then put it into a
ridiculously short form,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.260
and make you laugh and cry,
and feel inspired enough

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.300
to talk about it later.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.850
I want to celebrate--

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.240
the reason I was compelled
to write the play--

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.290
Pam McKinnon-- who really tried,
and was texting me the whole

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.390
time, and had made it
all the way to LaGuardia,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.810
and it just wasn't
going to happen--

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:15.500
called me with Samantha Barry,
the producer of this piece.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.750
And they had gotten the
rights to this wonderful book.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.400
And at this time I didn't know--

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.690
at that time I didn't know that
Martha was a Radcliffe fellow,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.190
but I was going
into my fellowship.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.580
In fact, I might have
just been applying,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.560
because I think it
was in the application

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.600
that I was going to--

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.190
Yeah Judy.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.680
Judy is like absolutely,
it was in the application.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.960
- Wow.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.030
- So there was all of
this synchronicity.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.860
And I was saying
no to commissions.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.800
I was a little over-commissioned
and I'm slow writer.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.525
And so as soon as I heard
the story, I was sort of--

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.970
it was disappointing that I
had never heard of this person

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.350
before.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:02.270
And felt sort of like
my responsibility, which

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.000
is as self-aggrandizing
as if I'd said

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.320
the sentence you led in with.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.200
But there it is, so.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.930
Do you want more?

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.013
I think that's all I have.

00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:14.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.252
- That's fantastic.

00:08:16.252 --> 00:08:17.710
Megan, maybe you
could add a little

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.080
about taking it off the
page and giving it this form

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.010
that you did this
evening, as a director.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.940
- Yeah, sure.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:32.100
I mean, so, if Martha lays
the historical foundation,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.770
and Lydia like condenses it into
a story where we laugh and cry,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.799
it's like we put it into bodies.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.970
We embody it.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.530
And you have to-- like each
moment of telling the story--

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.110
and we only got to work on
it for four days or whatever.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.390
Even in that, each moment
of it, in an embodied way,

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.600
is taking that history--

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.660
all this social,
cultural, political,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.320
and racial economic
history of these people,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.820
and of this moment, and how they
relate to us and our moment.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.040
Because we're in our moment
as we're in real time.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:18.327
Yeah, that every second
of that is embodied, so.

00:09:18.327 --> 00:09:19.160
- I kind of wanted--

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.435
I didn't get a chance to say--

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.800
these are such talented people.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.640
And I know, you applauded them.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.304
And I know you know
they're talented.

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:31.970
And they gave a really
good performance.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:38.280
But there's a sort of precision,
and a very specific kind

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.750
of knowledge, and embracing
of skill and training

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.880
that I think the
parallel between what

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.840
an elite group of actors do and
what an elite group of athletes

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.650
do.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.160
And so it's been a pleasure to
be able to work with people so

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.450
at the top of their game.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.600
And I'm incredibly
grateful to the Radcliffe.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.970
Because, I mean, look--

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.560
generally when you
workshop a play,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.110
people don't say, come,
be in this gorgeous room.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.510
And we'll put in
this gorgeous hotel.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.320
And you can eat
really good food.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.750
They fed us all day.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.980
So it's a nice way, it's a very
cushy way to develop a play.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.770
And it's great that
I was able to do it

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.890
from the birth of this
play all the way through.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.790
And you gave me another workshop
somewhere in the middle.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.410
And now to be here--

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.684
and thank you.

00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:28.250
Thank you, thank you.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:34.500
OK, I said that, and to Megan.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.240
- I think I was
pretty much that--

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.850
so, talking about
embodiment and the way

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.240
that all of the different layers
of what you guys are up to you

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.620
has to be embodied, both in the
individual body of each actor,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.840
and in the overall picture
of what we're doing.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.048
There's something that's so--

00:10:53.048 --> 00:10:56.580
I mean, I'm not
saying there isn't

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.360
layers to a play about a
family in a living room.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.890
But there's such a--

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.700
this is the epic
scope of this story,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.670
both in terms of the scope
of the game of baseball,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.190
and in terms of the scope
of all of the history

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.990
that you've described,
and that Liz

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.470
described that it represents.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.860
Every image, every
gesture, everything

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.300
is really heavy
with all of that.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.910
- And can I do one more
thing, like that, that I did--

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.570
is to say that the
elegance of the gestures--

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.450
I mean to do a reading is so
challenging, because you're

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.060
communicating something
that generally you

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.860
would see play full out--

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.000
and that she had these very
eloquent and precise gestures.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.159
You were there, right?

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:44.950
- That's fine, yeah

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.687
- So I thank you for that.

00:11:47.687 --> 00:11:48.270
- That's good.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.270
- Good directing.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:49.770
Thank you.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.916
- That's great.

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:54.620
Nambi, what was it like
to actually play Toni?

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.380
What kind of obstacles did
you see in your preparation,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.860
and also for her,
that she was facing?

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.440
- That's a big question.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.300
So, I would say, in terms
of the continuum of what

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.145
has been laid before me, which
is you start with the book,

00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:15.770
and then you break
it down into a play,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.960
and then you break it
down into the director,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.260
and then you put it in
the body of an actor.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.320
For me the biggest joy--

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.960
I, too, did not know
who Toni Stone was.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.020
I grew up a huge baseball fan.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.295
Go Cubs.

00:12:31.295 --> 00:12:33.248
So sorry, Boo.

00:12:33.248 --> 00:12:33.748
- Uh huh.

00:12:33.748 --> 00:12:40.630
- So I kind of was ashamed
that I didn't know who she was,

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.700
but equally delighted
that-- wow--

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.670
you get to discover
this wonderful person.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.320
And so it is such an
important part of the history.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.820
And so, for me, it was like,
oh, I got to find out about it.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.528
And I found out about
it, and I found out

00:12:54.528 --> 00:12:56.930
about Mamie Johnson, and then
all the other people that

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.640
came after her, the
woman who replaced her.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.782
And was just like--

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.990
to part of me, it was like,
yay, this is so much fun.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.540
Thank you, Lydia,
thank you, Megan.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.040
Right?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.360
But then, as we got into
the process-- so I did that,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.800
I read the play.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.020
I want to read the book,
but we didn't have time,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.470
because this happened so fast--

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.790
but I will.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.380
That for me it was--

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.710
I'm a kind of actor that I
like to do a lot of research.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.090
And I like to be very precise.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.320
And I like to layer stuff in.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.900
So for me, I'm actually
kind of disappointed

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.140
in myself, because--

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.670
- Ooh!

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.580
- --the athlete in me,
because I did used to run.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.510
The beauty of having a process--

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.960
this process-- is that we get to
share with you a piece of what

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.460
this is.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.160
And literally, that was an
edited version of Act One,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.120
right?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.200
But for the actor, everything
that we've talked about

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.610
is so layered.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.140
And it's so complicated.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.400
And it's so rich.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.920
And so, today, what I
spent my morning doing--

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.050
we talked about--

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.160
Lydia said, oh, she
might be on the spectrum,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.710
on the autism spectrum.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.580
And so I spent my
morning watching

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.516
videos of different people with
different levels of autism.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:13.890
And was thinking, well they
say, well sometimes he goes--

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.290
So, I say, here
comes Sydney Pollack.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.998
So this is how-- you
know, so like trying

00:14:16.998 --> 00:14:20.270
to find that sort of
specificity in such a short time

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.950
is like, oh!

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.760
You know, there's just so much
more we could do and layer.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.790
And so, like it's a piece of it.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.770
And for the actor,
it's a piece of it.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.280
And so, as the
actor, I can't think

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.960
about I'm playing history.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.370
I just got to be in the moment.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.850
But I certainly layer all
of that into it, absolutely.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.010
- It's so funny to listen
to you speak so humbly

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.640
of the truncated
process that you had,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.020
and all that you would do.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.310
Because I would text
Nambi my appreciation--

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.980
and I texted her and I
said, I learned so much

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.420
about the process of writing
watching you be an actor.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.200
And again, back to the precision
that I'm talking about.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.507
But you can see, in the
rehearsal room, Nambi leering--

00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:08.090
this and that.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.230
And then, also, Nambi,
it's an athletic endeavor

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.730
to do what you just did.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:19.080
I mean, to carry this thing
with all those words--

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.220
anyway, it was so
beautifully done.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.970
And thank you.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:23.480
- Thank you.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.730
I guess the thing is
that I wanted to--

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:29.816
I'll shut up.

00:15:29.816 --> 00:15:31.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.700
Just say, just be quiet.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.714
I said it already.

00:15:34.714 --> 00:15:36.130
- Well, Nambi, I
want to build off

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.671
what you're saying
here a little bit,

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:39.910
about sort of
finding these layers,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.510
and relating that to sports
in some way as this very

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.010
powerful element of society.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.520
And I think, oftentimes, we
think of the power of sports,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.140
we think of the NFL
large, large, large money,

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.670
big business.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.210
But sometimes, I think the
power of sports in this case

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.640
is really captured so
beautifully by you and Lydia

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.390
in that first scene, when
she's touching the ball

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.740
and she's feeling it.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.615
And Lydia's sensuality
is sort of--

00:16:07.615 --> 00:16:09.741
I feel like it's moving
through the piece.

00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:10.240
And it's--

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.130
- Did you say,
Lydia's sensuality?

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:17.140
- Well, I don't know entirely,
but, yes, I sense that.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.450
I sense there is--

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.140
yes, I do.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.430
I sense that there is some kind
of way in which the sport is

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.170
actually--

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.140
she's getting close to
the smell of the glove

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.090
and the crack of the bat.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.400
And it's just so--

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.800
it's just-- you can touch it.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.790
You can taste it.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.890
And suddenly, those
desires are part of her.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.850
And that becomes part of her
relationship with Alberga,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.349
as well.

00:16:41.349 --> 00:16:43.570
- We talked about that,
we talked about how--

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.420
and Martha and I talked
about that early on, too.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.277
There's so much that Martha said
to me that works its way in.

00:16:49.277 --> 00:16:51.610
And when I'm sitting next to
Martha, I'm like, oh, yeah,

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.220
I got that, mm-hmm--

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.100
about when somebody
does something

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.530
so at the top of their game,
there's a sexiness to it.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.960
It's just hot to see somebody
do what they do really,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.461
really well.

00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:06.168
- And do it well.

00:17:06.168 --> 00:17:08.710
- And it's an interesting thing
for the person playing Toni,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.250
because in one
way she has this--

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.550
and this is all, this
is what I've made Toni.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.118
I would not presume to--

00:17:20.118 --> 00:17:25.430
The Toni that we have
created, based on the--

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.950
I just became very inarticulate.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.270
What am I trying to say?

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.140
I don't know.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.370
I entirely lost it.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.782
It'll come back to me.

00:17:35.782 --> 00:17:36.740
- Absolutely, I think--

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.760
- Well, what we start with?

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.330
I really want to--

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.350
I was going to do a
thing really good--

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.280
- I think--

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:40.640
- Something really good.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.000
It was going to be good.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.960
- Yeah feel like it's
related to the fact

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.190
that the choices that
you've made around Toni,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.100
particularly related to,
is she on the spectrum.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.320
It isn't how you necessarily
immediately think

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.525
of like the most sensual,
the most sexy person.

00:17:53.525 --> 00:17:54.900
- That's what I
was going to say.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:00.032
- But she is sexy when
she really, really excels

00:18:00.032 --> 00:18:00.740
at what she does.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:00.990
- Yes.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.573
- And I was going
to say the challenge

00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:04.940
for an actor of playing
someone who is disconnected

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.090
from herself, from her
body, and from the nuances

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:14.870
of how we interact socially, who
embodies the sport to which she

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.860
is so physically tied--

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.230
it's really beautiful to
watch and beautiful what

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.080
you did with it.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.150
- The opening scene
was the first scene

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.112
you've shared with
me here at Radcliffe.

00:18:28.112 --> 00:18:28.820
Whenever I came--

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.860
- So, the first thing,
we were drinking, right?

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.740
Is the first--

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.110
- No, we had that really
bad meal down at the--

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.812
- Oh, we did!

00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:36.312
- Yeah.

00:18:36.312 --> 00:18:37.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:37.942 --> 00:18:39.650
- But I had written
it on a little thing,

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:40.880
and I read it to you.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.280
- Yeah, you read
it to me in Byerly,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.400
And I was just blown away by it,
because it embodied so much--

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:55.490
not only that passion of when
you do something that you truly

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.720
love.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.120
I mean, people always ask
me, what is this book about?

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.560
And, to a certain extent,
it's a love story,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.350
but it's a love
story about work.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.960
It's a love story
about what you do.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.750
And not only does
that passion come out,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.780
when you're talking
about the tactile nature

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.590
of the ball and the glove,
but it's also identity.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:21.680
And that was completely
who Toni was.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.530
Reporters often ask Toni,
what do you like best

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.570
about playing baseball?

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.460
And she always had
the same answer.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.220
And she had this
high-pitched voice,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.310
and you could tell there was
a sort of quickness to it.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.350
I saw footage of her.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.190
Her eyes would gleam.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.600
And she said the most
benign, kind of mundane thing

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.440
about the sport.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.675
She said, infield practice.

00:19:45.675 --> 00:19:47.960
She said, I love
infield practice.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.310
Well, when you think about it--

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.560
the ball lops first to third,
third to second, second

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.370
to catcher.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.900
Boom, boom, rhythm,
rhythm, rhythm.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.120
So, and then she said this.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.640
She said, it's infield practice.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.880
She said, it's
beautiful-- comma--

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.720
if it's played right.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.220
You know?

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.190
So it was also--

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:13.040
it was poetry, it
was transcendence,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.600
it was beauty for her.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.410
- Wow.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.230
- You see, every
time Martha talks--

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.220
and then, you have been so
generous through the process

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.450
of my writing it.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.109
Because Martha will just be
supportive, just supportive.

00:20:29.109 --> 00:20:31.150
And then you'll say
something like you just said.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.566
And I was like,
why didn't I put--

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:33.550
OK, let me go back.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.510
And then people say, wow,
Lydia that was so insightful.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.320
And I'm like, yeah.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.785
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:41.785 --> 00:20:44.030
- Well, the generosity
goes both ways.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.390
This is the first time I've
ever had a book adapted

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.142
for the stage, and I
didn't know what role

00:20:48.142 --> 00:20:49.100
I was supposed to play.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.290
And I remember, we were doing
a workshop here at Radcliffe,

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.950
a couple of years ago.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.730
And I can't remember the scene
anymore, but you turned to me,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.380
and you asked me
about a verb tense.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.040
And I was like
higher than a kite.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.200
I got to pick the verb tense!

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.128
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:07.128 --> 00:21:09.850
Oh, man!

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.990
That was fun.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.120
- Well, I will
tell you that there

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.630
are people who generate the
source material who can not

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.670
be as generous.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.410
You could have made
this process hell,

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.330
so I thank you for
not doing that.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.300
- It goes both.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:25.860
- Yeah, I--

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.880
- We shouldn't end on that.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.046
- OK, I'll give you another.

00:21:28.046 --> 00:21:29.512
Let's not, let's not, let not.

00:21:29.512 --> 00:21:30.928
- Think we'll have
another debate.

00:21:30.928 --> 00:21:34.170
- One other aspect that relates
to this notion of regularity

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.316
in the infield practice
is this idea that--

00:21:38.316 --> 00:21:40.440
and this really comes
through in Toni's character--

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.070
about her trying to understand
the rules of baseball

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.260
and the rules of dating.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.520
And I also-- this is, I imagine,
trying to understand the rules

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.370
that are part of being
in the Jim Crow era--

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.710
right-- where breaking those
rules have a really high cost.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.550
And at some level, I think
we can think of sports again,

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:07.710
as sort of inculcating people
who play into a kind of system

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.430
of justice.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.392
Where are these rules?

00:22:09.392 --> 00:22:11.475
And there's an umpire, and
there's accountability.

00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:13.500
And In baseball, there's
a special accountability,

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.125
because they're putting all the
negative things up on the board

00:22:16.125 --> 00:22:17.010
about you.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.780
And I was just wondering--
there's also this--

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.410
but you're also subverting
the fools, right?

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.890
The clowning, right?

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.460
There's a double consciousness
here, of you're watching me,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.960
I'm watching you.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.090
And you're also doing
this in the play.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.910
You've got the men switching
from black to white.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:37.370
You have them moving from
men to gender, as well.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.620
Can you talk a little bit
about the idea of subversion

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.460
and the clowning in
this experience for you?

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.580
- Well, It's interesting.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.200
There's an interesting
relationship

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.100
between being an
artist of color,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.540
and making work
that acknowledges,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.490
that talks about race
and gender and sexuality,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.970
and how that interacts
with an audience.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.930
And as my career has
progressed, and the houses

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.990
have become bigger and
fancier, the audiences

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.000
have become wider and wider.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.930
And so, you can't make the
work that's about this thing

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.870
without acknowledging-- or
at least understanding--

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:27.620
the discomfort of the dynamic
and the tensions between how

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.390
you're going to interact with an
audience with regards to that.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.350
And it's a dance, but I don't
think that the dance that

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.440
African-American, that
artists of color, that women,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.800
that women artists of color,
that, I guess, white women--

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.910
you know, I think anyone who's--

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.850
oh, my God, I'm not
saying this very well.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.720
I was.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.370
I was on a roll, wasn't I?

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.070
I was really--

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.653
- Doing great.

00:23:53.653 --> 00:23:54.860
- doing something.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:01.370
But it's a peculiar dance.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.610
And there's such a
parallel between the dance

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:11.180
that these amazing athletes
did, and the dance that we all

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.700
do to bring what
we do to audiences,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.340
and the politics of that,
and where the politics meet

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.540
the art, and how
all of that works.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.940
And so I couldn't-- it
just comes out in the play.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:28.260
And I don't know that the play--

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.540
I noticed, today that I think--

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.180
or over the weekend,
I've noticed

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.480
that I don't know that the play
is quite excavating the joy.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.960
I don't know how to put that
on stage, the ridiculous joy

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.620
of when the win happens.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:51.190
And it doesn't right now,
when I try to put it--

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.840
I don't know how to do it yet.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.670
It'll come to me.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.510
But that's a part of
that dynamic, too,

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.980
the uncomfortable--
the dynamic, all of it.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:06.160
Because in the
minstrelsy, there was joy.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.640
And in the
African-American audiences,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.300
watching the clowning, it's
a different kind of clowning.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.550
It's a different
kind of laughter.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.250
And it's an art form that's
appreciated for the art form

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.830
that it is, and becomes
something else depending

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.900
on the view of the audience.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:31.570
And how exactly to capture that
for a white audience is tricky.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.790
And that's probably where the
joy is lacking in the play,

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.800
because I don't know
how to do that, yet.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.390
I guess I could just not let
white people come to the play.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.875
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.870
That's one answer.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:50.150
- Well there's one scene
that you didn't do today--

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.300
with the clowning--
that just pushes.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.800
It pushes.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.300
It pushes.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.910
- Well, the
choreographer found that.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.910
And it's such a
collaborative piece.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.010
The choreographer
from a workshop

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.620
that we did in New
York found this thing

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.560
where the physical, the actual
physical, the exertion--

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.120
so it started out being
this beautiful funny kind

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.970
of movement that
was dance and light,

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.150
and through the sheer act of
the repetitive nature of it,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.230
it became something else.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.570
And then it became
something tragic.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.070
And it was just--

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.750
and yeah.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.347
So that was-- I hadn't written--

00:26:25.347 --> 00:26:26.180
I didn't write that.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.550
I wrote the passage that
we heard Steve read.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.080
So it's just interesting--

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.589
- That is where
that dance comes.

00:26:35.589 --> 00:26:36.380
- That's the dance.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.350
- Well, I hope this workshop
has given you a chance

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.190
to really evaluate for
yourself the beauty

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.850
of the script and the gift that
you have giving to people here.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:55.530
And I saw a lot of
joy in the cast,

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.280
and I hope that continues
to come through.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.100
- Thank you.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.089
- And maybe this is a good
now to open up to you all,

00:27:01.089 --> 00:27:02.630
and to see if you
have some questions

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.104
that you'd like to ask.

00:27:04.104 --> 00:27:06.520
And if you would, we have a
microphone here in the center,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.090
if you'd come up.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.965
Please feel free to
come up, ask a question.

00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:14.590
We'd really appreciate it if you
would just identify yourself--

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.580
who you are, your name, and
then just ask a question.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.460
- Hi my name is Laura, and I
was wondering about the choice

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.190
to make all of the cast other
than Toni be played by men,

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.190
in spite of the fact that
they go back and forth

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.250
between multiple genders.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.500
- You tried to ask me that.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.880
You did.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.470
You asked me that.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.600
That's a good question.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.360
- If I may, I was hoping to hear
about it both from a directing

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.830
perspective and a
play-writing perspective,

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.496
as well as from the
acting perspective--

00:27:43.496 --> 00:27:45.747
how it informed your
performance, as well.

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:47.080
- What was your name by the way?

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:47.550
- Laura.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.050
- Laura.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.732
- Thank you, Laura.

00:27:49.732 --> 00:27:50.690
- Do you want to start?

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.000
- You start, and then I'll go.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.350
- OK, I'll start.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.330
Thank you for the question.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:56.560
Thank you for the question.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:08.160
I toyed with if I wanted Toni to
be the only woman in the piece.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.430
And then part of that whole
politic that we talked about,

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.970
around the making of theater
and the awareness of the politic

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.640
of the making of
theater, is that women

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.350
and African-American
women don't actually

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.660
get to be on the stage enough.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.520
So the audacity of
making one role for that

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.510
play that will happen maybe
in February for one actress,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.810
but you saw how
beautiful that was.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:41.730
Just the act of putting eight
male bodies on a stage doing

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:47.790
something that is beautiful
and supporting a woman,

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.820
an African-American woman--

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.080
it felt like a really important
visual and a really important

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.220
gesture.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.750
And it's fun to be in a
rehearsal room with eight

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.460
not-unattractive men.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.660
So there's that.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.360
- I also think that the--

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.090
so if you had a woman to
play [? Millie ?] and a woman

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:21.720
to play Mama, either they
aren't on the team or--

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.190
which to me is just marginalizes
them and their bodies further--

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.150
or they're playing
men on the team.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:35.910
And that, to me, doesn't help
us with telling Toni's story.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.420
Because Toni is on a
team of all male bodies,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.340
and to me there's something
incredibly powerful

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.300
and-- as a woman--

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:50.160
incredibly powerful to see
her, to see her struggling,

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.812
to see her holding
her own, to see

00:29:51.812 --> 00:29:53.520
her going through all
the things that she

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.880
goes through surrounded
by these guys.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.370
And so for that reason
it feels right to me.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:06.030
And then, I also am
moved by watching men

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.160
play women really respectfully.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.540
We don't see that very often.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.430
Usually men playing women is
just like surefire comedy.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.930
Ha ha, that guy is
acting like a woman.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.090
That is so funny, right?

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.550
It's just hilarious.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.430
And, you know--

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.660
- And in particular,
that black men

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.150
have been asked to put
on dresses all the time.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.180
And so, to have
the empowering act

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.200
of having an actor
be able to embrace

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.100
the beauty of his
mother, or his lover,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.030
and not have that be something
perverted is a very striking.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.280
And the arbitrary
nature of gender--

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.350
I think it says something
really interesting

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.490
about gender in general.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.740
Because once she and
[? Millie ?] are in that room,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.190
they are two women.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.770
And I never-- and I
loved that Megan cast men

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.570
with beards as the women.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.490
That was incredible.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.270
So satisfying.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.990
I meant that in a good way.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.960
- I love what you say about
men playing women respectfully.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.540
And just historically, one
of the ways that the Negro

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.280
Leagues had to do that dance--

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.580
through denigration-- was that
in the '30s, some of the teams

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.535
wore grass skirts.

00:31:23.535 --> 00:31:24.260
- Grass skirts.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.150
There's a scene that
talks about that.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.862
Oh, you missed so
many good scenes.

00:31:28.862 --> 00:31:30.605
You'll have to
come back to the--

00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:34.280
there's a scene in which the
white owners of the teams

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.150
talk about that.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.640
They have this whole
conversation about

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.540
is it OK to do
something that makes

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.280
Toni look good on the field.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.540
Well, what it mean to baseball.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.540
And yet there are
these white owners

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:55.030
making their employees do
this other kind of dance.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.570
- To answer the question about
from an acting perspective,

00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.080
for me--

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.080
where did she go?

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.800
Hi, sweetheart.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.008
There's a moment of rehearsal,
where I'm like, ha ha,

00:32:06.008 --> 00:32:07.041
is't that funny?

00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:09.290
And then it goes away and I
don't even think about it.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.206
And it's just the meet--
oh, sorry, mic-- it's

00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:13.600
just the meeting of a
soul, souls of spirits

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.430
on another-- you know.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.850
So I don't even process it.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.350
Like the reading we did this
afternoon, and then the reading

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.350
we did just now, I don't
even think those are men.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.040
It doesn't even occur to
me at all in the scene.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.270
- And how quickly and
easily all of my casts

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:34.600
have come to embrace
that, with no control.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.210
I thought there would
be some kind of thing

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.430
we would have to
do, around making

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.860
the actors feel comfortable in
their body and da-da, da-da,

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.960
da-da, da-da.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.230
And immediately,
people are game.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:50.970
Actors are so game, and just--

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.530
it's really kind of beautiful.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.160
- Thank you very much for the
performance and for this panel.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.690
It's fantastic.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.590
My questions-- I bought
the book last year, Martha.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.620
And I was curious
from listening to you

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.260
speak tonight, if it would
have made a difference when

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.820
you were doing the interviews,
if you had been a male.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:18.172
Obviously you can't-- and
if you had been not white.

00:33:18.172 --> 00:33:20.630
Do you think-- because you were
talking to a lot of the old

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.930
players--

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:21.430
- Right.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.635
- --and I was wondering how
they interacted with you.

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:25.562
- Yeah.

00:33:25.562 --> 00:33:27.770
Well, I was certainly aware
as I was writing the book

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.610
that I was a white
writer writing

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.440
about an African-American.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:42.300
And the thing I constantly
reminded myself of

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.980
was what I didn't
know, and to be

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:55.200
able to have an openness to
learning everything I could.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.740
I don't know that
in the interviews,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:06.220
that I sensed that
gender or race would

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.500
have made a difference.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.210
What I was greeted with,
again, and again, and again,

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:16.540
and again, was gratitude
for telling a story--

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:21.190
that somebody was getting
the story out there.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:25.429
I relied a great deal
on a group called SABR--

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:29.469
the Society for American
Baseball Research,

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:33.130
which is a group of
researchers that kind of span

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:37.030
out to everything dealing with
baseball, including one dealing

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.500
with the Negro League.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.620
And those guys
provided entree for me

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:47.830
for all of these older
players that I talked to.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.050
No one ever treated
me as though I didn't

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.659
know what baseball was about.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:56.409
They had to explain
things to me.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:00.400
And I hope I entered
into those discussions

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:09.250
with, obviously, respect
and great curiosity for it.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.800
So I guess my answer
to your question

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:18.160
is that I had an overwhelmingly
positive experience with it.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.630
- Thank you.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.600
- So I wanted to say
thanks, and ask you all

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.480
to join me to the
panelists, to the actors,

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.905
for this wonderful evening.

00:35:27.905 --> 00:35:29.090
[APPLAUDING]

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.810
It's really a privilege
to get behind-the-scenes,

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.310
and to see a play in formation.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.630
So thank you for being so
open and honest with us.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.180
And I hope we'll see you all
back here tomorrow morning

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.020
at 9 for the conference.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.530
Thanks.
