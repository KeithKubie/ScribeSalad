a cliche in Silicon Valley for the last
 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.780
a cliche in Silicon Valley for the last
few years big data this big date of that

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
few years big data this big date of that
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.760
few years big data this big date of that
big data is really one big mountain of

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
big data is really one big mountain of
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.689

you know tremendous trash heap and you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
you know tremendous trash heap and you
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759
you know tremendous trash heap and you
want to find those gems you really want

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
want to find those gems you really want
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.410
want to find those gems you really want
to find out what's gonna make the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
to find out what's gonna make the
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660
to find out what's gonna make the
experience better so there are a lot of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
experience better so there are a lot of
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.099
experience better so there are a lot of
sophisticated machine learning

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
sophisticated machine learning
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.659

algorithms that Netflix and other
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.270
algorithms that Netflix and other
companies deploy to really figure out

what's the one of the gems that are
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.020
what's the one of the gems that are
gonna make a better experience and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
gonna make a better experience and
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.400
gonna make a better experience and

you find those gems what it does is it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
you find those gems what it does is it

doesn't make it a more alienated less

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
doesn't make it a more alienated less
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240
doesn't make it a more alienated less
you know more machine experience it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
you know more machine experience it
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.650
you know more machine experience it
actually makes it a more personal

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660
actually makes it a more personal
 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.869
actually makes it a more personal
experience it becomes much more about

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
experience it becomes much more about
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090

years ago with Pandora and they were

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
years ago with Pandora and they were
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.440
years ago with Pandora and they were
really small then and Netflix was much

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
really small then and Netflix was much
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300
really small then and Netflix was much
smaller and we were just comparing notes

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
smaller and we were just comparing notes
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370

and I remember back in these days and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
and I remember back in these days and
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.249
and I remember back in these days and
there's like 10 years ago they had their

there's like 10 years ago they had their
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.219
there's like 10 years ago they had their
walls lined with CDs all over and they

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
walls lined with CDs all over and they
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440
walls lined with CDs all over and they
had a whole line of people in this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
had a whole line of people in this
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359
had a whole line of people in this
cramped office with headphones on and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
cramped office with headphones on and
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069

Netflix we were all about rating our

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
Netflix we were all about rating our
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.010
Netflix we were all about rating our
titles on a one to five star system and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
titles on a one to five star system and
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.399
titles on a one to five star system and
we were very much using a lot of

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409
we were very much using a lot of
 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.870
we were very much using a lot of
behavioral a lot of algorithms around

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
behavioral a lot of algorithms around
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.609
behavioral a lot of algorithms around
the behaviors of what users were doing

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
the behaviors of what users were doing
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530
the behaviors of what users were doing
and based on some a lot of clustering

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
and based on some a lot of clustering
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.650
and based on some a lot of clustering
techniques we weren't really

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660
techniques we weren't really
 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.479
techniques we weren't really
deconstructing the titles yet we would

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
deconstructing the titles yet we would
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.980
deconstructing the titles yet we would
get to that soon after

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990
get to that soon after
 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.990
get to that soon after
they weren't really deploying a lot of

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
they weren't really deploying a lot of
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.580
they weren't really deploying a lot of
the collaborative filtering models that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
the collaborative filtering models that
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.950
the collaborative filtering models that
we were using on our algorithms so we

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960
we were using on our algorithms so we
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.380
we were using on our algorithms so we
compared notes and we influenced each

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
compared notes and we influenced each
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.820
compared notes and we influenced each
other and we only met a couple of times

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
other and we only met a couple of times
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.080
other and we only met a couple of times
with them and we were paying attention

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
with them and we were paying attention
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.820
with them and we were paying attention
to what other companies were doing in

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
to what other companies were doing in
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.160
to what other companies were doing in
terms of personalization and based on

terms of personalization and based on
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.740
terms of personalization and based on
these learnings everyone kind of evolved

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
