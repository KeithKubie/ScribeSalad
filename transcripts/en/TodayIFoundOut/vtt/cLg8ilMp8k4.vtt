00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.210
The Rum Rebellion and 5 Other History Facts

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.210
1.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.480
The first president of the United States,
George Washington, upon his death bed told

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.830
his attendants “I am just going.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.419
Have me decently buried and do not let my
body be put into the vault in less than three

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.860
days after I am dead.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.280
Do you understand?”

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.150
He was terrified of accidentally being buried
while he was still alive.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.560
Among other famous taphephobics was Frederic
Chopin, who upon his death bed said “The

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.790
earth is suffocating… swear to make them
cut me open, so that I won’t be buried alive.”

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.749
Yet another taphephobe was Hans Christian
Anderson who would always lay a card on his

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.280
dresser before he went to sleep, even while
traveling, that said “I am not really dead.”

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.710
He also requested that his arteries be slashed
before burial.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.249
If you are a taphephobe, but don’t want
to be cremated, simply tell your loved ones

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:49.430
to make sure to have your body embalmed.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.609
If you aren’t dead before the embalming,
you will be after.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.609
2.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.350
In 1891, Ellen Martin was the first woman
to be able to vote in Lombard, Illinois.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.289
She noticed that the Lombard charter on who
could vote didn’t mention gender.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.329
This charter superseded Illinois law and,
thus, she was legally allowed to vote.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:12.000
She and 14 other women voted in the 1891 elections
before the charter was promptly amended.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
3.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.060
The book “The Woman and the Car, A Chatty
Little Handbook for All Women Who Motor or

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.590
Who Want to Motor” (presumably extremely
chatty, given the title), by Dorothy Levitt

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.110
written in 1906, recommended that women carry
a hand-mirror while driving as it is convenient

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.390
to be able to see behind you during traffic
by holding the hand mirror up.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.100
This is the first known mention of rear view
mirrors being used in automobiles.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.810
The mounted rear view mirror wasn’t available
standard in cars until 8 years later in 1914.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.310
As for the first person to use a mounted rear-view
mirror in an automobile, which he installed

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.560
himself, this was race car driver Ray Harroun.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.500
On May 30th, 1911 while racing in the Indianapolis
500, Ray was unable to get a mechanic to ride

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.020
with him during the race.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.820
This was the custom at the time, as it provided
the driver with the ability to know what was

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.869
happening behind him and to be made aware
of any cars about to overtake him.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.630
Ray ingeniously installed a mirror on his
car instead.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.789
Ray didn’t get this idea from the “chatty
little handbook”, but stated he thought

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.190
of it after remembering seeing a mirror used
for this same purpose on a horse-drawn vehicle

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.190
in 1904.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.940
4) The Ancient Romans favorite wiping item,
including in public restrooms, was a sponge

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.920
on a stick that would sit in salt water and
be placed back in the salt water when done…

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.730
waiting for the next person to use it…

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.920
Ancient Greeks were a little more sanitary,
using stones and pieces of clay.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.549
5) Rum helped spur the American Revolution
as well as the Australian Rum Rebellion.

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.190
It is estimated that around 3 gallons of rum
were consumed per person per year in the American

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.909
colonies shortly before the American Revolution.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.460
Rum production was also colonial New England’s
largest industry.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.440
The passing of the Sugar Act in 1764, also
known as the American Revenue Act, drastically

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.150
disrupted the economy of many of the American
colonies, particularly hitting the rum industry

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.150
hard.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.860
Among other things, this act resulted in the
colonies having to increase the price on their

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.640
rum, which allowed the British West Indies
to increase their market share of the sale

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.640
of rum.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.819
This act, along with the later Stamp Act,
enraged some of the colonists and helped establish

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.250
the “no taxation without representation”
that eventually became a rallying cry for

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.569
the revolutionists.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.320
As for the Australian Rum Rebellion, this
took place after the governor of New South

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.270
Wales, William Bligh, in 1806 decided to outlaw
rum as a medium of economic exchange.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.540
This resulted in the New South Wales Corps
turning on him and holding him under arrest.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.209
The Corps then ran the island for four years
until Governor Lachlan Macquarie arrived.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.250
6) Ben Franklin fought hard for the Turkey
to become the United States’ official bird,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.450
but he obviously lost out to the supporters
of the Bald Eagle.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.930
His case for the Turkey being the national
bird on the Great Seal is laid out in the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.390
following letter to his daughter Sarah Bache:

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.750
“For my own part I wish the Eagle had not
been chosen the representative of our country.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.250
He is a bird of bad moral character.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.260
He does not get his Living honestly.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.420
You may have seen him perched on some dead
tree near the river, where, too lazy to fish

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.640
for himself, he watches the labor of the Fishing
Hawk; and when that diligent Bird has at length

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.519
taken a fish, and is bearing it to his nest
for the support of his mate and young ones,

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.540
the Eagle pursues him and takes it from him.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.440
With all this injustice, he is never in good
case but like those among men who live by

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.750
sharping &amp; robbing he is generally poor and
often very lousy.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.150
Besides he is a rank coward: The little King
Bird not bigger than a Sparrow attacks him

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.550
boldly and drives him out of the district.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.600
He is therefore by no means a proper emblem
for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.460
who have driven all the King birds from our
country…

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.210
I am on this account not displeased that the
figure is not known as an Eagle, but looks

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.470
more like a Turkey.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.220
For the truth, the Turkey is in comparison
a much more respectable bird, and withal a

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.300
true original native of America…

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.050
He is besides, though a little vain &amp; silly,
a bird of courage, and would not hesitate

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.419
to attack a grenadier of the British Guards
who should presume to invade his farm yard

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:17.740
with a red coat on.”
