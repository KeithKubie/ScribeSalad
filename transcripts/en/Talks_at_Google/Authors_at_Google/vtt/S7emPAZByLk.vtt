[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.410
SPEAKER 1: A former dancer, Mary
studied structural integration

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.610
with Ida Rolf.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.420
She has taught movement in
bodywork classes since 1994

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.940
and was chair of the
movement faculty of the Rolf

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.650
Institute of
Structural Integration

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.720
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.670
The new rules of
posture is the second

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.770
of three books Mary
has published along

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.220
with numerous articles in
magazines including "Massage,"

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.820
"Shape," "Men's Fitness,"
"Somatics Journal,"

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.830
and "Massage and Body Work."

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.530
Her newest book,
"Your Body Mandela,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.230
Posture as a Path to
Presence," is coming out

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.610
at the end of the year.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.080
You can look for it on
her website or on Amazon.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.410
She has videos, a blog, and
much more on her web site,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.511
which is
www.healyourposture.com.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:55.336
Ladies and gentlemen, Mary Bond.

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:56.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.959
MARY BOND: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.600
I know we had an
eclipse, and there

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
were other exciting things
going on today and here you are.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.670
So sitting, standing, and
moving in the modern world

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.160
is not always comfortable.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.780
But we get used to it.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.380
A lot of times, we don't
notice our discomfort

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.830
until it becomes
full blown pain.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.480
So you folks are Google.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.770
You're known for innovation.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.250
And what I hope to do
today is to inspire

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900
you to help redesign the
way the world works so it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.200
could be more body friendly.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
So because I want
you to feel what

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.860
I'm talking about
in your bodies,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.580
I'm going to ask you to stand
up and do things every so often.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.200
So now is one of those times.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.310
If you would just stand
up, it would be great.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.830
OK so bring your arms way high.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.910
Make fists.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.380
Tighten your elbows.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.910
Tighten your knees.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.860
Push down in the floor.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.560
Stretch your spine
as high as possible.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.320
And then go side to
side just a little.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.120
So notice you are
stretching, but you're

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.550
contracting at the same time.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.080
That's important.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.210
Really stretch, really reach.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.220
OK, now open your hands.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.560
Scrunch up your eyes.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.050
Open your mouth
like you're yawning.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.280
Ah, more stretch!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.750
More, more-- OK, now
you could let go.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.490
And feel your body right now.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.280
Something-- a little
something, a little energy

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.510
moving through it.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.260
Yeah?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.180
So what you just did
is pandiculation.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.160
And most mammals do
this many times a day,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.000
sometimes up to 50 times.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.530
But humans feel a little
sheepish doing it in public.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.650
Nonetheless, you felt there
was an effect I think.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.090
Nod your head, yeah?

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.570
There was an effect.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.190
So what might be new is
that that effect matters.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.570
It's important.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.790
So we'll talk a little
more about pandiculation

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.720
as we go forward.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.020
This is cover art for the
book you just picked up.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.930
And the gist of that book is
that posture isn't a position.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.630
It's not what you do
with your shoulders

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.730
or your head or your gut.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.360
Posture is your
response to this moment

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.980
and the next moment
and the next.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.620
Every succeeding moment
requires you to respond.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.870
We're not aware of it, and
we get habits about doing it.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.200
But basically, posture is
how you feel stable and safe

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.140
in a pretty unstable world.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.670
And so changing,
transforming your posture

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.450
amounts to creating different
strategies for how you feel

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.330
safe inside to meet the world.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.180
So it involves body
awareness, self awareness.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.280
It's not a quick fix.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.440
So this book is not
something you're

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.790
going to benefit from tomorrow.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.870
Takes a little patience.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.900
So how do we sit,
stand, and move

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.040
in this crazy modern world?

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.720
In a world that increasingly
ignores what the body is

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.625
made to do, which is to move.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.720
All organisms move
in order to survive.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.400
We know that.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.220
There's a Doctor Scholls
add on television right now.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.840
It says, born to move.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.260
So we have this in
our consciousness,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.810
and yet we don't really
embody it in our being.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.400
So how many of you
have standing desks?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.310
Do you stand at them?

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.030
It's helpful?

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.930
Sometimes you do, sometimes--

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.430
yeah.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.100
So standing desks and ergonomic
chairs are good ideas,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.530
but they're external
fixes to the problem

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.790
of our ancient bodies
in this modern world.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.550
So I want to dig a little deeper
into the nature of your bodies.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.270
I want to talk about
what you're made of,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.690
the ground substance
of your body,

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.910
and how to take care of that.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.720
I want to talk about the
architectural principle that

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.710
holds you together,
and about perception,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.760
and what perception
has to do with posture.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.540
And then I'll give you
some advice about sitting,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.180
since you insist on doing that

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.980
And we'll talk about, in the
end, exercise and movement

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.270
and the future of
the human body.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.690
So that's my plan
for this little talk.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.020
And I wanted to share with
you a little about where

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.860
I'm coming from.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.510
This is my teacher.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.670
Her name was Ida Rolf.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.190
And she was a biochemist.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.450
But her passionate interest
was in human structures.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.240
So she developed
a manual therapy

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.270
she called structural
integration.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.260
And so her students and her
clients nicknamed it Rolfing.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.580
She didn't much like
that, but now most of you

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.490
have heard of Rolfing, yes?

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.950
So this therapy looks at the
body as living architecture

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.460
which has been
distorted and diminished

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.290
by accidents, and
compensations, and poor use,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.040
like sitting all
day without moving.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.640
She viewed pain as the
product, mostly the product

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.570
of imbalance structure.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.010
She had two revolutionary
ideas for the 60s.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.570
This expresses one of them.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.270
It's her logo.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.830
She thought that the body--

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.340
she taught that the body
is organized by gravity

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.980
just like this building
is organized by gravity.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.690
So if the body
could be balanced,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.170
then gravity wouldn't
tear the body down

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.050
but would in fact actually
contribute to health.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.910
So that was her first idea.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.660
Her second idea is that the
body's connective tissue

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.160
is plastic.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.170
It's able to change.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.690
So through
manipulation, she found

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.230
that she could restore
balance to structures that had

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.680
become distorted and twisted.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.950
She was the first to
recognize the importance

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.980
of connective tissue,
what we now call fascia.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.090
She died in 1979.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.060
But the first
research conference

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.730
about fascia, the
fascia congress,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.150
wasn't held until 2006.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.670
It happened at Harvard,
which was exciting for us

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.020
body workers.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.260
But it was also attended
by many researchers

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.530
from around the world
who had become interested

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:16.290
in this aspect of the body
that had mostly been ignored.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.250
So this is a simple
metaphor to share with you

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.000
how fascia pervades your body.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.330
The rind of the orange is like
an all over body suit just

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.290
under your skin.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.919
If we peeled off all the skin,
we would see a fascia layer.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.980
It's literally a body suit.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.400
It contains everything else.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.890
And underneath that are
the segments of the orange,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.720
represent the various organs and
muscles and larger structures

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.000
that each have a containing
membrane, as well as blood

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.200
vessels, and nerves, and bones,
all have a wrapping of fascia

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.640
around them.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.720
And all of this
fascia is continuous.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.270
And the little orange
bits inside the segments,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.750
you know how your fingers get
sticky when you eat an orange--

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.230
so those little bits
represent cells.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:22.080
So each cell in your body
has its own fascial membrane.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.600
So it's been suggested
that if you took out

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.320
everything else from the
body except the fascia,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.300
you'd still have a
recognizable human shape.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.060
This is an 18th century
painting of a dissection.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.870
It hangs in the Wellcome
Library in London.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.880
So until recently, anatomists
stripped away the fascia

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.180
and discarded it so they could
look at the interesting things,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.580
the liver and the brain and the
circulatory system and so on.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.540
And that was good.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.250
We needed that.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.800
But what it did was
perpetuate the idea

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.540
that your body is made up
of an assemblage of parts,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.000
rather than that it develops
out of wholeness, which I'll

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.780
talk about a little more later.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:22.260
This photo is an endoscopic
image of living fascia.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.280
It's magnified 130
times, and it's

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.510
the work of a man named
Jean-Claude Guiberteau.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.920
He's a French microsurgeon.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.420
He uses endoscopy in his work.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.660
So this means putting
little cameras and lights

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.520
and microscopes inside
the living tissue.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.500
So he has been so awed by what
he saw that he's developed

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.800
a collection of these images.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.700
And I can give you his
web site after the talk.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.785
Appreciate these
geometric forms.

00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:05.650
The immune system--
sorry, the fascia system

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.520
is now being
studied the same way

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.580
that the immune system and
the circulatory system and all

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.810
the other systems
are being studied.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:20.020
So there are three main
constituents of fascia.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.280
One is collagen. It's
like protein fibers which,

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.890
when they're woven
tightly together,

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.280
have the strength of steel.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.980
There are also elastic
fibers that you

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.840
could stretch to 100%
of their capacity,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.870
and then they could relax back
without deforming their shape.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.540
And the third constituent
is a watery matrix,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.430
something like egg white,
kind of mucousy stuff.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.830
And they're swimming
in their cells

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:59.030
like immune cells, and fat
cells, and nerve cells.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.650
So this was very interesting
to us in the body work world,

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.410
that there were nerve
cells in fascia.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.650
We knew from doing
Dr. Rolf's work

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.110
that there was some
kind of communication

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.130
through the fascia.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:17.870
But we had all kinds of other
ideas about what was doing it.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.610
And there are actually sensory
nerve fibers in the fascia.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:28.990
In fact, estimated six times
as many nerve fibers in fascia

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.190
as in muscle.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.670
So when you think you're moving
through your neuromuscular

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.510
system, it's actually
the fascial system

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:46.270
that is allowing that to
come into full expression.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.110
A lot of these nerve
sensors in the fascia

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.660
are called interoceptors.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.560
That means they tell you what's
going on inside your body.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.980
So when you feel bloated, or
you have a tickle or an itch,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.880
or you have sexual
arousal, or air hunger,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.300
all of these kinds of
sensations in your body

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.500
are because of the
interoceptors in your fascia.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.610
So you might think
that interoception

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.620
is the way you know
that you have a body.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.630
A lot of different
textures fascia can assume.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.010
It can have the
transparency of glass,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.480
so your corneas are fascia.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.800
Your breasts are fascia,
full of lots of fat cells.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.270
When you have a scar, that's the
collagen fibers woven tightly

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.860
together to protect the wound.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.680
It's also very fluid,
gelatin like, slidey--

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.610
slippy-slidey.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:01.520
So when we watch our most
beautiful athletes and dancers,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.830
what we're seeing is not just
their superb neuromuscular

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.050
system, but also the health
of their fascial system.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.320
Note the last point.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.670
Stress and immobility
dehydrates your fascia.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.770
It makes it stiff.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.200
It makes you stiff.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.110
So stress and immobility
are the characteristics

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.360
of the modern workplace.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.360
The powerful leaping
of a kangaroo

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.110
is due not just to its
powerful leg muscles,

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:37.440
but to the high percentage
of fascia in its body.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.200
So when those elastic fibers
stretch through movement,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.700
it stores kinetic energy
which is then released

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.260
and the kangaroo rebounds.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.430
Interesting thing here is
that our bodies, human bodies,

00:14:54.430 --> 00:15:00.830
have the same high percentage of
fascia in them as the kangaroo.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.250
So if you think about
that, it's clear

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:09.760
that we're made for leaping and
running, and not for sitting.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.750
This is a video, one of
Jean Guimberteau's videos

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.830
of living fascia.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:21.670
You'll see the yellow fat
cells along the bottom,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.770
tendonous material, the college
across the middle of the slide.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.600
And a blood cell,
the blood vessel

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.030
you might be able to see moving.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.030
So where that's
happening is just

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.740
below your elbow
on your forearm.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.040
So find that place on yourself.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.810
I'm going to play
the video again.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.410
But if you make
just a pinch of skin

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.390
with your finger pads,
just a gentle pinch of skin

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.520
and pull up on it, and
when the video starts

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.840
you could slowly let
down on the pinch

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.720
and then draw up again
as the video goes up.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.280
Now it's coming down, you're
letting go of your pinch.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.430
And you're pulling up.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.980
These images are so amazing.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.610
So that kind of shape
shifting is going on

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.300
inside your body with every
movement that you make--

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.640
while you're
breathing, while you're

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.800
brushing your teeth, while
you're rolling over in bed.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.680
This is another one of
Jean Guimberteau's videos.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.964
And it takes place
in the same place,

00:16:50.964 --> 00:16:52.130
but it's a little different.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.680
It's magnified 10 times.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.290
The other one was
magnified 20 times.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.110
And this one is also a
deeper place in the forearm.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.530
So take the palm of one
hand and press it lightly

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.829
against the skin just
below your elbow,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:11.540
as if those two layers of skin
were adhered to each other.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.960
And then what you do is
just a gentle pulling down

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.827
of this skin toward your wrist.

00:17:17.827 --> 00:17:19.910
And you might be able to
feel that you're not just

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.290
pulling on skin, but other
layers are moving underneath.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:30.570
And then draw up toward your
elbow with that same thing.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.220
So that's what's going on here.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.580
The bubbles that you see are
because of the difference

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.150
in pressure between
what's going on

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:55.740
inside the incision and the air
outside, pressure differential.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:04.940
Notice the changing direction
of these microfibers,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.310
how they keep
re-orienting themselves,

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.746
changing their polarities.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.330
It's like a crystalline
kaleidoscope inside you.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.110
So you keep your fascia
healthy by moving.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.050
And the important thing is
movement in many directions,

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.660
so multi-directional movement,
not forward movement that's

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.860
repetitive.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:44.080
So if you had a choice
between going to a dance jam,

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.000
or working out on an Exercycle,
for the benefit of your fascia

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.310
you need to go dancing--

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.970
probably for other reasons, too.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.830
Whole body stretches
are good for the fascia,

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.610
so that pandiculation
that we did before.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.850
As long as it's a whole
body stretch and not

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.090
just this kind of stretch
of isolated muscles

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.470
that people do.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.020
That's a different thing.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.430
Gentle bouncy movements, so
if you went folk dancing that

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.110
would be good for your fascia.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.430
Not big leaps, but
just gentle bouncing.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.010
Micromovements-- we'll be
doing some micromovements

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.790
in a few minutes.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.740
These are small movements that
you can barely, barely see.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.600
Certainly you can feel them.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.120
Massage can help.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.950
All of these suggestions
don't cover strength training

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:39.920
or aerobic training.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.710
You need that too, of course.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.220
This is fascia specific.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.650
This image of an embryo
is at development

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.070
about four to five weeks.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.780
But fascia emerges in
embryonic development earlier

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.210
than this, at about two weeks.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.420
So fascia researchers
suggest that muscles,

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.360
bones, organs, in fact
all other living tissue,

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.830
may in fact be specializations
within the unified

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.800
medium of fascia.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.500
So that's a very
different way of thinking

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.560
about how we evolved
than the idea

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.065
that we're just a bunch
of parts stuck together.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.890
Everything in the fascial system
is interconnected and fluid,

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.990
and you can feel this
when you breathe.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.050
So let's try.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.570
So if you would
just be comfortable,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.240
and if you feel like
closing your eyes sometimes

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.020
that helps you feel
your body more readily.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.520
Just go inside and feel the
sort of swelling and settling

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.530
of your chest as you
inhale and exhale.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.600
Just a little expansion,
and then diminishment.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.780
And you could feel it, probably
also in your belly a little,

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.270
puffing up and letting go.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.570
And then turn your attention
to your shoulder blades,

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.140
and see if you can feel
them sliding maybe apart

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.890
from each other, maybe up
a little bit as you inhale

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.410
and resting down.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:39.020
Shoulder blades move apart
so the rib cage can expand.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.880
And then drop your awareness
down into your forearms.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.770
There are two bones in your
forearms, in each forearm.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.870
And there is a
membrane in between.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:56.600
So imagine that membrane
swelling and settling

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.880
as you breathe in and out.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.350
And then come down
into your lower legs.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.820
See if you can go that far
down and feel your fascia

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.505
moving as you breathe, in
between the lower leg bones.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.080
It's interesting
that the place where

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.470
you feel a sensation
in your brain,

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.660
is the same place that
you imagine a sensation,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.280
the sensory cortex.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.720
So it doesn't matter if you
think you're only imagining it.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.140
It's good enough.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.330
Drop down into your soles.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.610
See if you can feel
that when you inhale,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.555
there's the slightest
pressure down into your shoes.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.510
And let yourself imagine
that tensile matrix

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.130
that we saw earlier.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.910
Imagine it throughout
your whole body,

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.980
all those little fibers
changing their orientation.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.620
Thank you, you can
open your eyes.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.940
Could you feel a bit?

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.140
Imagine you felt?

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.610
But it will be a while
before our culture

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:33.470
learns to see the body as
continuous and connected.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.340
We think of the body
in bits and pieces.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.660
When we have a pain, we
blame it on an isolated part.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.500
We exercise isolated,
separate muscles.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.030
We do lap pulls and ab crunches.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.530
And when we want to
portray images of power,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.100
we just add more
and stiffer parts.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.880
This model suggests
a way of conceiving

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.760
how the body is held together.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.720
So it is, you're seeing
struts held in place

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.230
by a network of tension.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.020
In terms of the body,
the elastic lines

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:26.230
are your soft tissues and
the struts are your bones.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:32.540
Ideally, your bones are floating
in a network of soft tissue.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:38.360
This architectural principle
is called tensional integrity,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.710
or as Buckminster Fuller
called it, tensegrity.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.200
And you can see
that if you change

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.710
the tension in just
one of those strings,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.890
the whole structure
would change its shape,

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.950
change its orientation
a little bit.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.410
And that's true inside us.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.680
That's how we work, too.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.650
Even the vertebrae, the
individual vertebrae

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.890
in your spine, can
float and respond

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.010
inside this network of tension.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.080
But we don't think
of it that way.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.160
We talk about the
spine as a column.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.670
On the right, you see
a tensegrity tower.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:26.090
It's a sculpture by a man
named Kenneth Snelson,

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.560
in the Washington National
Mall in Washington.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.090
And you can see that it's more
similar in quality to the spine

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:38.320
than the Washington Monument is.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:44.170
So how do we learn to behave
more like biotensegrities

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.260
and less like stacks of bricks?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.360
Well, it's helpful to
think or imagine back

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.120
to prehistoric times,
how the body might

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.370
have functioned in those days.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:05.180
So our prehistoric ancestors had
to move their bodies in order

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.350
to survive.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.920
So you could imagine
what kind of movements

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.130
they might have had to do
to kill their breakfast

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.170
or herd their cattle.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.100
So they'd be crouching,
or throwing, or digging,

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.160
or lifting, carrying
stuff, and none of that

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.190
would be predictable
or repetitive.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:29.780
So constantly changing
movement, large body movements.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:36.110
Also, they would be traveling
in bare feet, or skins,

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:41.870
on uneven terrain which had
pebbles and thorns in it.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.570
So their feet had
to be extremely

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.475
mobile to navigate the ground.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.860
And that mobility in
the feet would play up

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.960
through the whole
fascial system,

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.780
so every joint in
the body would have

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.990
to respond to the
movements of the feet.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:05.370
So that's an example of
micromovement in a sense.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.970
And these movements,
large and small,

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.540
must have kept their
fascia healthy.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.460
I like to think that, anyway.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.450
And they had to have a panoramic
view of their surroundings.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:24.450
They had to have
360 degree awareness

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.070
through all their senses--

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:36.380
through hearing, sight,
olfactory, feeling sense.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.650
And it's as if they had eyes
in the backs of their heads.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.160
But with us, we're
always looking forward--

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.100
this way, this way, forward.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.410
So let's practice something.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:54.600
I want to see if you can feel
the benefit of having a more

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.760
broad peripheral awareness.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.699
So you need to stand up again.

00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:01.740
So you could pandiculate.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.685
It's a good idea.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.280
There are certain noises
that go with pandiculation.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.645
Yeah, it could be louder.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.580
OK, so find a detail somewhere
around you-- not a person,

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.470
but something you could look at.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:27.480
Could be the screen, or it could
be exit sign, or a thermostat,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.010
some detail that you could
gaze at with a lot of intensity

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.110
of vision that you have to
write a report about this thing,

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.580
and it's due tomorrow and
your job depends on it.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.250
So really look.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:41.870
Look hard.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.080
Keep that.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.630
Keep that intensity.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.790
And notice your breathing.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.030
Notice where it's
located in your body.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:29:00.170
Notice the relationship between
your torso and your neck

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.940
and jaw and head.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.205
Notice the sensation
in your eyes.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:15.590
Notice where your
weight is on your feet,

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.350
and how big you feel in general.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.820
OK, so relax that.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.100
Just shake it out.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.620
We want to neutralize ourselves
so we can do something else.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.130
Thank you.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.220
So now, put your
fingers out like this.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.690
Wiggle your fingers.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.140
And you can see, peripherally,
still looking at me,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.234
you can still see what's
beyond your fingers.

00:29:38.234 --> 00:29:39.650
You could put your
hands down now.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.490
And just keep
looking so that you

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:47.450
have a sense of the
periphery of the room.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.480
And you also notice something
about what's above your head.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.130
You can feel it.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:56.510
And because you walked in here,
you know what's behind you.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.790
You have a kinesthetic
memory of what's behind you.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:08.330
So you have a broad
perceptual awareness.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.450
So I want you to see if
you can keep that, and then

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.300
turn and look at
your same object

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.510
that you looked at before.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.840
And I'd like to suggest some
things that may or may not

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.622
be different.

00:30:22.622 --> 00:30:25.080
They're different when I teach
this to different people.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.800
So I think it's
possible that you're

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.480
breathing lower in your
rib cage, not so high

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.340
in your upper chest.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.610
I think your eyes feel
softer, and that you feel

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.910
less merged with that object.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.430
There's more of a
sense of you being here

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.720
and it being over there.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.220
Also, it's possible that you
see the object in its context,

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.280
so your report is going
to be more interesting.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.320
So great, thank you very much.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.910
I like to think of this as
tensegrity of perception.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:16.200
So what I mean by that is, by
having these little feelers out

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.910
in all directions, you
establish a virtual network

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.900
in the space, a virtual
network of potential directions

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.920
of movement through
the space that actually

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.260
helps support your body.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.950
I think you've felt that you had
better posture the second time,

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.710
yes?

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.180
You were bigger.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:45.390
Yeah, and so this awareness
of our surroundings

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.820
helps our bodies
open up on the inside

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.710
as well as on the outside.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.170
So we have better posture.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.050
We actually have
more strength, which

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:59.620
if you stay for the little class
afterwards I can show you that.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.680
So picture the movements you
make to get to work, to get up,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.790
get your breakfast, go to work.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.700
And the movements that you
make while you're at work.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.120
It might be different at
Google than it is other places,

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.900
but generally in offices
your movements are curtailed.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.150
You don't have a
lot of movement.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.270
Most of it is in
the forward plane.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.540
And your perceptions
are narrowed.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.250
So I think it's
important for us humans

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:36.510
to acknowledge that the
amazing conveniences that we're

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.720
living with in this
time may actually

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.700
be diminishing our body's
natural capacity for movement

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.780
and perception.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.040
So we want to change
that, I think.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.660
What can we do about sitting
and standing and moving

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.120
in the workplace now?

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.640
So an expensive ergonomic
chair is not the answer,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.790
because it doesn't
guarantee that you're going

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.790
to sit in it in a balanced way.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:13.810
This chair, like many, has a dip
towards the back of the seat.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:18.360
So that dip tends to roll
the pelvis back and invite

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.410
your spine to lean
against the backrest.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.330
Most modern chairs
are like this.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.810
You slide back.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.220
Car seats are the worst.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.250
Those bucket seats are
designed to prevent movement.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:42.650
If human spines don't need back
support when we're standing up,

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.220
why would we need them
when we're seated?

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:51.140
Well, we don't, as long
as the pelvis is sitting

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.480
at the right inclination.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:58.550
So that inclination involves
having a 45 degree--

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:02.780
a greater than 45 degree angle
between the hip and the thigh.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.340
So this is Charles.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.179
And you can see that
he's sitting more upright

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:15.500
on the left and his
weight, some of his weight

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.590
is being born through
his feet and his legs.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:24.239
About maybe 40% of his weight
is born through legs and feet.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:29.929
And so he has a
broader base of support

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:33.080
when his thighs are
slanting down hill that way.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.380
And that forward
inclination of the pelvis

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.400
creates an automatic
lift through the spine.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.870
In the other picture, where he's
sitting in a lower chair, that

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:49.040
invites his pelvis to roll
back like I was describing

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.280
modern chairs are inviting
you to do, in these chairs

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.440
right here.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.360
And so he's sitting
on his tailbone,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.280
on his buttocks flesh.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.000
His whole torso is compressed.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.740
He looks duller.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.015
His head is poking forward.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.360
So let's practice this.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.280
So unfortunately, these
chairs don't raise and lower.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.320
But we can make do.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.960
I think you can feel
something if you don't mind

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.260
sitting more forward on them.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:25.870
So imagine it's a bench or a
stool, not a chair with a back.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:29.030
Yeah, already that's better.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.720
See?

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.060
You can do it.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.870
All right, so on purpose,
I'd like you to roll back.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.330
Just roll this part
of your anatomy

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:42.260
back, like Charles is doing
in the right hand picture.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.040
And notice what happened
to your spine and torso.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.990
You compress.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.560
You stay there.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.720
I want you to really feel it.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.080
So you're sitting on
your buttocks flesh,

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.780
maybe on your tailbone.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.640
Take a nice full easy breath.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.660
Yeah, so it's like really
not easy to do that.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.805
But we get used to this.

00:36:09.805 --> 00:36:11.940
And we drink a lot of
coffee because we're not

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.084
getting enough oxygen.

00:36:14.084 --> 00:36:15.000
All right, stay there.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.790
One more time.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.110
One more thing I'd like you
to notice how creative you

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.980
feel in that position.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:29.280
And then just from there,
roll your pelvis forward.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.830
So you can think of
it different ways.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.440
You can think of
having your pubic bone

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.900
farther from your bellybutton.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.130
You can think of having your
tail moving more and back

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.510
behind you.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.560
And you're sitting now on
the flesh of your thighs,

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.230
rather than the flesh
of your buttocks.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.880
Does that make sense?

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.090
And you feel there's
more weight on your feet.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.550
So you have more support, yeah.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.020
So I'd like to take this
a little bit farther.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.290
If you don't mind, reaching
underneath yourself find

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.220
your left sit bone--

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.390
it's just in front of
the gluteal flesh--

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.690
and your right sit bone.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:17.210
And while you're back
there, find your coccyx.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:21.290
Just touch it so you really
really know where it is.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.320
OK, so now stay
seated on your thighs

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.690
and look down Inside yourself.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.290
You'll see that those three
points make a triangle.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.430
Does that makes sense?

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.640
Can you feel that?

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.610
Nod your head.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:39.020
These lights are
glary, I can't see.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.650
All right, so that triangle is
called the posterior triangle

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.740
of your pelvic floor,
or the anal triangle

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.990
of the pelvic floor.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:52.490
And notice now if you
roll back and sit more

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.920
towards the buttocks,
that that anal triangle

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.430
got smaller, more compressed.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.450
So that area is at the
bottom of your gut tube.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:06.140
It connects all the
way up to your throat.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:10.760
So how well you can digest
your lunch when you're

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.155
in that compressed position?

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.440
Let's roll forward
now, once more.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.000
And I'm going to take this
still a little bit farther.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.310
This is a female pelvic
floor, but the anatomy

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.390
of the muscular apparatus
is pretty much the same

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.010
for all genders.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:41.880
And you notice that triangle
I outlined, the anal triangle.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:47.160
And notice at the bottom,
the anal coccygeal ligament.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.070
That's a little
tiny slip of fascia

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:54.420
between your anal
sphincter and your coccyx.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.050
So we're going to experiment
with a micromovement of that.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.740
So you need to be
sitting comfortably

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:07.440
upright on your thighs, not
leaning back on the backrest.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:13.860
And see if you can draw your
coccyx just a few millimeters

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.340
closer to your anal
sphincter, without disturbing

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.871
anything else.

00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:20.370
That's good.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.036
You're doing it.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:29.010
All right, so let's undo it.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.420
So go back the other way.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.770
See if you can just imagine
that ligament lengthening,

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.800
your coccyx lengthening back.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.020
OK, so I wish you
could see yourselves,

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.650
because there's this--

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.010
you're all sitting
with nice posture,

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.950
but there's this diminishing.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:51.890
Maybe you could feel it inside
yourself, deep inside your--

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.450
anybody?

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:55.230
Let's do it again.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.660
You might feel it.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:03.390
So be open and big and on
your thighs, on your feet.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:10.010
Just move the coccyx forward
towards the anal sphincter.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:14.025
And there is just a slight
shriveling up inside.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.170
And then reverse it.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:19.020
Go the other way.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:33.950
So there's a difference in
what happens inside your body

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.020
when there is tension
around this area.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.780
Most of us have
fallen on our coccyx,

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.440
or had some kind of injury
to the pelvic floor some time

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.850
in our life.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:50.720
And yet we don't speak of it,
except jokes on late night TV.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.390
It's important to
think about it.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.180
The interoceptors
in your fascia help

00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:00.950
you feel that subtle
change in your posture

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.155
that happens because
of your tail space.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:10.425
So I can't resist
talking about this.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.410
It's in the news, right?

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.110
This thing.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.960
I've been teaching
sitting for a long time,

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.220
and I've wondered why it
is that it's harder for men

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.930
to comfortably be seated
upright in the pelvis--

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.920
harder for men than women.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.110
So I've been asking around,
and what people have told

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:39.220
me is that there can be
an uncomfortable friction

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:44.560
between the skin of the scrotum,
the underwear, and the jeans.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.420
So all of that kind of rubs
together like layers of fascia.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.740
So in order to sit
upright, it would

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.200
require a manual
adjustment you're not

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.740
going to make in public, right?

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.640
So men have also told
me that underwear

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.940
that supports the genitals
in a more forward position

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.340
makes it easier to sit
upright in the pelvis.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.570
So I'm not going to tell you
what kind of underwear to wear,

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:14.320
guys--

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.590
really not.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.390
But I will tell you that the
orientation of your pelvis

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.820
makes a huge difference to the
decompression of your spine

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:29.660
and to your posture
going forward.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:35.920
So take a look at old men
walking down the street,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.790
and notice they
have no tail space.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.160
I promise you, they don't.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:48.540
OK so, here if you
can see there's

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.500
a blue cushion that Melanie
is about to sit down on.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.855
It's a disk about this big.

00:42:54.855 --> 00:42:58.180
And you blow it up with
the air, but not very much.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.490
So it's not bouncy, it's more
like sitting on a waterbed.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:11.670
So when she sits on it, there
can be a subtle reverberation.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:17.130
You might see a subtle
reverberation up her spine

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.170
as her pelvis just sort
of floats on that cushion.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.730
So that's actually
helping to pump fluids

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.340
into those microfibers.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.300
That qualifies as
a micromovement.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.140
And micromovements are
good for your fascia.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:47.480
There are new articles every
day about the kind of exercise

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.740
that you can do to maintain
your heart health, your brain

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.880
health, your longevity.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.790
I'm talking about
your fascial health.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:04.310
And sitting is particularly
detrimental for fascia.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:09.530
The hip joint is a ball and
socket joint, like this.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.480
And that's great for movement.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.180
It's terrible for stability.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.600
So when you sit with
your legs at that angle

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.800
for a long, long hours
without much movement,

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.240
the fascia around
your hip and down

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.410
through your legs and thighs
gets tighter and matted

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:31.860
and more uncomfortable.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:37.595
So it would be great if, when
you take a little break--

00:44:37.595 --> 00:44:42.260
you know, it's recommended
that people who sit

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.960
go five minutes
every hour, moving.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.676
Have you heard that?

00:44:47.676 --> 00:44:49.550
Every hour you're supposed
to get up and move

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.390
for five minutes.

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:54.000
I think it's
probably hard to do.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.140
But if you did it, it would be
better to do this, to do this

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.090
than to just walk
around, because it's

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:04.460
non-directional movement.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.910
It's innovative movement.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:10.870
So think about, what if
people did this around Google?

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:15.050
It would be just like
taking a coffee break.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.870
It's not shameful
to move your body.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:22.670
It's not embarrassing to
do what your body needs.

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.010
You just simply
have to recognize

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.060
that your body needs it.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.480
And I think you need to
take perception breaks,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.250
because looking at a focused
object for a long time

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:42.160
induces a sort of
a hypnotic trance.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:42.980
And you know that.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.410
You work and work and you think,
well, just one more thing,

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.500
and then I'll get up.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.180
Just have to keep going.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.620
So you need to purposefully
break the trance every so

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.490
often.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:59.840
One way is to put attention
into the soles of your feet.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.120
So you could do that right now.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.860
Just drop your
attention down there.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.750
Feel the skin of your
feet inside your shoes.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:12.570
You could even feel your feet
breathing, like you did before.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:17.960
You could feel a little
cleavages in between your toes.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.990
Feel your toenails.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.020
But you're still
listening to me, right?

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.650
But you're also present in
the lower part of your body.

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:31.190
I think what happens with
computers and technology

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:35.390
so, so often is that
the energy of the being

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:40.820
gets drawn up into
this part of your body.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.020
I also recommend using
urgency as a trigger

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.720
to widen your perceptual field.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:53.360
So you know how you develop that
broad perceptual field earlier?

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.070
OK, so let's try something.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.740
If you just take out
your phone right now.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.779
Just reach down
and get your phone.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.470
OK, so notice your
state the minute

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:10.090
you have the phone in your hand.

00:47:12.881 --> 00:47:14.380
Can you feel what
I'm talking about?

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.600
It's like, you go there.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.880
It's like, you disappear
into the phone.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:23.900
So the phone could be a cue.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.170
A device could be a cue.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:30.550
So keep the phone in your
hand, but take a moment

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.980
to widen your perceptual field.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.740
So however you do
that, especially think

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.095
of the space behind your body.

00:47:38.095 --> 00:47:38.845
That really helps.

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:43.720
And keep that space
and then check Twitter.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.440
You can do it.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.980
It might slow you
down a nanosecond.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.650
I don't think that's bad.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:58.850
But it's a way of being
present with your device,

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.280
rather than present
inside your device.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.400
So when you're not at work,
or maybe even when you

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:14.020
are, because you're here,
you could sit on the floor.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.560
And the benefit of that is, it
opens up those hip joints that

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.470
have been compressed
and restricted

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:24.670
by sitting on too many chairs.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.710
You could have lunch
sitting on the floor.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:27.810
You could watch a movie.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:38.020
And unless you
override the impulse,

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.320
you pandiculate every
morning when you wake up.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.720
It primes your body.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.560
It primes your fascia
for the day ahead.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.180
So it's good.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.140
Don't override it.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.950
If we're going to persist
doing sedentary work,

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:59.880
we need to become less
self-conscious about our need

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.510
to move.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:12.730
So here, see if you can see
the way the movement translates

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.940
through her legs and
hips, up into her spine.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.980
All of them.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.190
The burdens on their heads
help decompress the spine

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.250
so spinal movement
is more accessible.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:32.045
But notice the harmony in
the rhythm of these people.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:55.200
I think we need to create
a culture, environments

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.840
and designs, that are
kinder to the human body

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.600
than the hard flat
surfaces and square rooms

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.020
that we've boxed ourselves into.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:10.330
Google is known for innovation.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.650
So I'd like to leave
you with a challenge.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:19.650
I hope you can use your designed
thinking, your engineering,

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:23.530
to help redesign the
way the world works

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:27.690
so that people might have
to move more in order

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:29.520
to do their work.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.120
I don't know how
this could happen.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.170
But I think you do.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:37.350
And if you move more,
two things will happen.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:43.080
It generates creative ideas,
and it improves your posture.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:49.230
So the last screen is just some
websites for more information.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.610
You can learn about
fascial fitness.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.390
I just briefly glossed over it.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.390
The man's name, Robert
Schleip, is one of--

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:59.020
he's a Rolfer in Germany.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:03.340
He's also one of the
foremost fascia researchers.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.950
So he's developed a program.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:09.510
Then there's Jean Claude
Guimberteau's website,

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.510
in case you're interested
in those images.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.020
The International Association
of Structural Integrators

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.320
lists about 17
different schools which

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.925
teach the legacy of Ida Rolf, so
you can learn more about that.

00:51:23.925 --> 00:51:28.690
And my website will tell you
when my new book is happening.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:34.350
And I have a newsletter,
but I don't send it out

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:39.540
very often so you don't get
inundated by stuff by me.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.885
Thank you so much.

00:51:42.885 --> 00:51:43.385
Thank you.

00:51:43.385 --> 00:51:47.452
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:47.452 --> 00:51:48.410
Oh, there's a question.

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.951
That's great.

00:51:48.951 --> 00:51:50.610
AUDIENCE: Just a
question So you know,

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:53.760
when you said sit
forward, I did that.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.050
And I feel good and it's up.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.360
But I get tired, and
then when I lean back

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.460
I feel like I'm resting again.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.190
So how do I not feel like
I'm using all my muscles

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:03.510
or something to sit forward?

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.760
MARY BOND: Well, you
will be using muscles

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.800
that you don't use because
you're leaning back habitually.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.532
And I don't know how long
you've been leaning back.

00:52:13.532 --> 00:52:14.490
AUDIENCE: Many decades.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.680
MARY BOND: But a
decade or two, right?

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.310
And so you need to work
through that, little by little.

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:22.830
I think of titration,
when you just

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:25.800
go drop by drop
to make a change,

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.830
rather than expecting yourself
to sit upright all the time.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:33.960
But it really will help to
open up that tail space,

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.686
and to get a broad support.

00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:38.310
AUDIENCE: So in
practice, I should just

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:39.270
practice a little bit?

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.311
MARY BOND: Just do it a
little bit, and sit back.

00:52:41.311 --> 00:52:43.590
Maybe you could
associate sitting upright

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:47.892
with certain tasks, and leaning
back with other kinds of tasks.

00:52:47.892 --> 00:52:49.350
AUDIENCE: OK, and
then try and bias

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:50.827
myself more towards sitting up.

00:52:50.827 --> 00:52:51.910
MARY BOND: Yes, of course.

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:53.850
And exercise.

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:56.355
Go dancing.

00:52:56.355 --> 00:52:58.230
AUDIENCE: Can I have a
prescription for that?

00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:59.140
MARY BOND: Mm-hm.

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.420
Yeah.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.380
I'm glad you felt it.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:09.280
And it does take a little
bit of a sincere desire

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.990
to make that change.

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:15.790
And also, in movie theaters
you have to just lean back,

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.680
because otherwise no
one can see around you.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:21.520
Yeah, there's one.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.560
AUDIENCE: I'm one trend behind.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.480
I still use the ball.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.850
I was just curious what
you think about that.

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:26.350
MARY BOND: Sitting on a ball?

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:29.950
Yeah, well that cushion I
showed you, the cushion--

00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:31.540
that's available.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.410
You search for it,
you'll find it.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.710
So that was my solution,
because the problem

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:40.720
with sitting on a ball is
it makes you sit like this.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.720
So I think it's better
for the hip joints

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.320
not to be stuck in
that wide position.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.610
And also the ball tends to
roll back a little too much.

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.730
So I really like that
cushion idea, because it's

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:56.615
almost like sitting on a ball.

00:53:56.615 --> 00:53:59.470
AUDIENCE: What's
the cushion called?

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.000
MARY BOND: It's
called disk o sit.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.210
And it's on Amazon.

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:05.410
Disk o sit, yeah.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:08.640
It's a desk on which you sit.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.270
AUDIENCE: You were talking
about having peripheral vision,

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:14.260
and as a glasses
wearer, I wonder

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.130
if you have any thoughts
or insights on contacts

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.720
versus glasses being--

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.980
like, I definitely find
my awareness is much more,

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.590
like when this is all blurry.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.307
So I wonder if you
had feelings on that.

00:54:28.307 --> 00:54:29.140
MARY BOND: For sure.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.090
I wear glasses, too.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.250
But I notice that--
and this thing

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:36.130
that I taught you is one of the
most important things I ever

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:39.530
teach anybody, is this
awareness of the space,

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.080
especially the space behind you.

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.810
There's something
magical about that,

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.960
that makes you feel supported.

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:51.430
And I don't think it matters
whether you wear glasses

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:52.120
or not.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.750
I mean, the glasses
do focus our attention

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:59.390
towards that forward gaze.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:02.020
But that doesn't mean
we can't be aware.

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.965
And you felt the effect, right?

00:55:03.965 --> 00:55:04.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:05.291
MARY BOND: Yeah?

00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:06.040
There's an effect.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.450
That's what matters.

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:08.944
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah.

00:55:08.944 --> 00:55:09.610
MARY BOND: Yeah.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.350
Oh my gosh, lots of questions.

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:14.950
I'm going to go over here first.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:20.110
AUDIENCE: So I've heard over
the years sort of two competing

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:21.550
notions of posture.

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.870
And you touched on
one very nicely,

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:26.860
which is this tensegrity
idea, that the body is

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:33.550
a dynamic system supported by
elasticity and by structure.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:37.300
And then a second one that talks
about this kind of rootedness,

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.620
where you're--

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.190
MARY BOND: Stacks of blocks.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:42.010
AUDIENCE: Stacking
your bones and trying

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.470
to make sure that
you're well supported

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:45.550
through your skeleton.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.320
Are those actually
contradictory?

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:52.337
Or is there some underlying
principle behind them both?

00:55:52.337 --> 00:55:53.170
MARY BOND: I don't--

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.980
I like to think
that they both work.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.680
But if you could have
a stack of blocks

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:06.220
that was floating in
a tensegral apparatus,

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:10.180
wouldn't that be better
than just compression, block

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.190
upon block upon block?

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:15.280
So I think Ida Rolf's
idea was stacks of blocks.

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.380
You saw it in her logo.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:21.400
And she also talked a lot
about Buckminster Fuller

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.330
and tensegrity.

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:26.350
So she had both things
happening when she taught us.

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:28.750
And I think she just
had it both ways

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.760
and hadn't integrated them.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.230
And I think that's still true.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:38.290
And I know that there are times
when I'm a stack of blocks

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.010
and I can't help it.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:45.400
But if you just move more
towards the conception

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.730
that you're a tensegrity,
I think already

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:56.260
that makes a change in
how you embody this flesh.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.225
And maybe I'm being too poetic.

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:02.650
AUDIENCE: I think
this is hard, and I've

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.380
wrestled with it myself.

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.510
MARY BOND: Yeah, so both
and, is what I'd say.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:11.650
But go towards the tensegrity
side as much as you can.

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.660
And did you
understand what I said

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:17.980
about the awareness of space
being a way of perceiving

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.720
tensegrally?

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:23.230
Does that make sense to you?

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:24.440
I can't see you very well.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.660
Are you nodding your head?

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.820
OK, great.

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.659
Thanks.

00:57:28.659 --> 00:57:30.700
AUDIENCE: So you've made
me feel a little hostile

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.134
towards my desk chair.

00:57:32.134 --> 00:57:32.800
MARY BOND: Good.

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:38.020
AUDIENCE: Is just adding
a cushion sufficient

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.490
if it's tipped back like that?

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:43.750
Or what else should I get?

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:45.940
MARY BOND: Well, I
like those cushions.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.630
It doesn't work for everybody.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:51.370
But I've tried every kind of
little chair thing you could

00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:54.940
find, because I write books.

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.850
And I've found that having that
cushion that moves a little bit

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:00.720
is beneficial.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.130
There are chairs that move.

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:04.270
They're very expensive.

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:08.850
They are like a spring,
and you can find them.

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:17.850
What else you should do is,
bring your headphones and jam

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:21.311
for five minutes once an hour.

00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:21.810
I'm serious.

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:25.620
AUDIENCE: But like, look
for a chair that's flat?

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.530
MARY BOND: Well, the chair
should be at a height,

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:31.890
if I can pantomime
this, that your hips are

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:34.020
higher than your knees.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:37.060
And the more high, the better.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:40.350
So the more you perch
rather than sit,

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:43.080
the better, because
that invites your pelvis

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:47.370
to roll forward which gives
you a lift through your lumbar

00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:50.880
spine and on up through
the rest of you.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.700
You could email me.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.970
Send me a picture of your
chair, and I answer email

00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:02.640
so if you're struggling and you
say, should I buy this chair?

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.456
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:59:06.456 --> 00:59:07.122
MARY BOND: Yeah.

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.750
AUDIENCE: So is just
standing all day at your desk

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:19.547
healthier than sitting at your
desk all day, with no motion?

00:59:19.547 --> 00:59:21.880
MARY BOND: You're going to
move more if you're standing,

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.070
I think.

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:27.040
Maybe not.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.730
What I have at my kitchen sink,
which is the place where I

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.890
stand the most if I'm--

00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:38.780
and also I have a platform for
my computer that's on a shelf.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.510
So it's like a standing desk.

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:44.770
And both of those places I've
put a pebble back doormat.

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:45.970
Have you seen those?

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:48.400
Doormat made of pebbles.

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:53.744
So that allows your feet a
little sensory experience,

00:59:53.744 --> 00:59:54.910
gives you a little movement.

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:57.070
There are more and
more things coming

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.770
through the internet
of standing desks

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.790
with different kinds
of wobble boards.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.180
And there's one that
looks like a skateboard,

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.382
so you're going like this.

01:00:05.382 --> 01:00:06.590
I don't know how it would be.

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:08.410
You have to tell me.

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:15.410
AUDIENCE: Having
stood extensively

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:19.760
as well as using many
chairs, the chair

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.910
is keeping you from your
normal fidgeting effectively.

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:25.540
And I think that's
why standing works

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:29.540
so well, because so many of
us tend to shift from one leg

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.820
to another, lean one
way and then the other.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.670
And the chair largely
prevents that movement,

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:36.260
while standing allows it.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.390
Just standing, otherwise--

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.020
MARY BOND: Yeah, you can fidget.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.230
Yeah, so fidget away.

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:44.989
Thank you, that's really
true about fidgeting.

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:47.030
AUDIENCE: About those last
two videos you showed?

01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.696
MARY BOND: Yeah.

01:00:47.696 --> 01:00:51.230
AUDIENCE: What I observed most
distinctively between them

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:53.660
is, the earlier video,
the developing world

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.660
video with the women carrying
things on their head,

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.450
besides the fact that they
may have been functioning more

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.000
efficiently just
because they had to,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.680
because of the weights
on their heads,

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.950
they were walking in what
you might call, you know,

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.210
Caribbean time.

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:09.950
They were walking
at the rate that

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.410
was comfortable for
their body, so their body

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.270
resonated naturally.

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:20.730
The people in the urban video
were rushing, but not jogging.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:23.180
So they were accelerating
a normal walk

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.660
beyond the natural speed of
a normal walk, at which point

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:31.040
the body's resonant frequency
doesn't match it anymore.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.620
We are embarrassed to jog,
because people get upset.

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.840
They will think that
something is wrong.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.330
Yet we feel the need to
get somewhere faster,

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.950
because we're on the clock.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.620
That is what I feel like
is what drives that.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.620
Some of the people clearly
had health problems

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.130
that made it difficult.

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:50.046
MARY BOND: Well, sure.

01:01:50.046 --> 01:01:52.990
Sure, but I've showed
the difference,

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:55.354
just so you see that.

01:01:55.354 --> 01:01:57.800
Quality of experience,
your mirror

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.840
neurons pick up on the
movement that you look at.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.240
So first, about
the first video, I

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.960
have a hunch that it was
slowed down slightly.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.760
It was a little
bit in slow motion.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.510
So it wasn't quite accurate.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.570
And the other one, if any
of those people jogged

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:20.660
they would be jogging
on hard surfaces.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.650
So there's no rebound,
no give from the earth.

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:29.450
So it would be jarring to
the spine and the whole body.

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:34.980
So I'm all for it, for more
of us running to do things.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.980
But we've paved paradise.

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:44.080
So I don't know the answer but
I'm suggesting that you do,

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.940
collectively.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:49.720
Yeah.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.855
Thank you so much
for those questions.

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:52.480
That was great.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.630
[APPLAUSE]
