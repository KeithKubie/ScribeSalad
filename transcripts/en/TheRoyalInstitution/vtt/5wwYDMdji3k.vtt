00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.445
[FUTURISTIC SOUND EFFECTS]

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.712
So I'm John Domingue.

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:18.670
Thank you very much for
all of you coming here.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.080
Thanks a lot for the invitation.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.710
I'm the director of the
Knowledge Media Institute

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.751
at the Open University, which
acts like a corporate R&amp;D

00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.250
centre.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.740
The OU has 175,000
students, and my job

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.160
is to create new technologies
which may be useful to them.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.240
My role here tonight is the
warm-up act for the main event.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.430
So I'm going to try
and explain what

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.800
blockchains are in 30 minutes.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.190
I assume that you
know nothing, OK?

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.260
So I'll start from
the very beginning.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.420
And I must say I'm an
enthusiast, so I'm going

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.160
to have a very positive spin.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.209
So I'll talk about the impact
of blockchains as I see them.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.530
I'll talk about the
Ethereum platform.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.680
And before that, I'll talk about
some elements of blockchains.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.610
I'll talk about some of
the more stranger things

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.470
that people claim you can
make with blockchains,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.690
and I'll have a few
concluding thoughts.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.820
So there's the
impact of blockchain.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.570
So as I said earlier, if people
have heard of blockchain,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.956
it's through the bitcoin and
the various elements of that.

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:33.830
There are various claims
that have been made.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.910
So the World Economic
Forum said there'll

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.310
be a tipping point for this
technology in a few years.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.670
Santander say that they'll
save $20 billion very soon.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.860
I go to a lot of
blockchain events

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.010
where there are often
1,000 people there.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.735
And you get two types of people.

00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:01.470
You usually get skinny teenagers
who have their own startup,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.090
and have some software,
and are becoming rich,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.780
and who are building software.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.060
And then you get 10% are
people in blue pinstripe

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.210
suits from the banks
hoping to make money.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.420
So in terms of applications
that I see out there,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.870
there's been for a while
blockchain platform

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.390
trading on the New York Stock
Exchange in the shorts market.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.330
But we see a lot of
applications which

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.950
are not in the financial area.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.660
So I'll say what blockchains
can do in a moment.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.820
There's a company that
has 10 million diamonds

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.020
on the blockchain.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.140
So one the things that
blockchains are good for

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.550
is recording provenance.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.880
Now, the claim from this
company is the only reason

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.102
why anybody pays any
money for a luxury good

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:49.560
is because you know
its provenance.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.940
You know its history.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.660
You know the diamond wasn't made
yesterday in someone's garage.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.580
The painting wasn't painted
by somebody in some cellar.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.002
You know the complete history.

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:02.460
And they're using
this for diamonds

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.860
to make sure they're
not from war-torn areas.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.260
There's a big connection
between blockchains

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.360
and what's called the
internet of things.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.000
Putting physical
objects on the internet.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.770
There was a demo from--

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.140
these are in DocuSign
for car leasing.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.280
And to caricature what they
did, is the car key and the car

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.750
are on the blockchain.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.610
There are no forms to fill in.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.240
You simply walk in, they
throw your car key to you,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.460
and as long as you keep paying
funds from your bank account,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.500
your car key will work.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.825
And when you stop, your
car key will not work.

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:44.120
So that's a different way
of thinking of things.

00:03:47.106 --> 00:03:48.605
One thing one can
do with blockchain

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:50.720
is that you can disintermediate.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.620
I may say more about that later.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.910
So any context where
there's a middle player,

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.950
you can take out
the middle player

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.184
and replace the trust that had.

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:02.600
Another application
of blockchains

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.790
is in the energy sphere.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.460
So there were
citizens in New York,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.390
in Brooklyn, who have
solar panels on their roof.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.640
And they're generating
electricity.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.170
And they're selling
that electricity

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.540
to other citizens in New
York with no energy company

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.040
and no bank in between.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.600
So a trusted mechanism
for peer-to-peer selling

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.310
of electricity between citizens.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.290
At the Open University, I have
a movie that's showing now.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.260
We're using blockchains, or
beginning to use blockchains

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.720
for storing your accreditation.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.896
So I may ask one of you, do
you have any qualifications?

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:44.270
And you say, yes,
I have a degree

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.860
from the University of Oxford.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.410
And if I say, I don't
believe you, what can you do?

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.380
You have to run home,
hopefully find the certificate.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.200
In the context of lifelong
learning, this may not work.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.260
So what we're doing is we're
putting micro-accreditation, so

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.610
a very fine-grained account
of student accreditation

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.110
onto the blockchain.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.686
Then we're matching that
to jobs which are online.

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:05.060
So I had another
project where we

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.660
have 5 million jobs in a
particular computing area

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.690
online.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.540
So as you sleep,
your qualification's

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.440
automatically matching your
skills to the skills for jobs.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.180
And then they're
presented to you.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.950
The other thing we do is we
find you jobs that you're

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.250
nearly qualified for.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.930
And then we find
you courses which

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.760
will fill those skills gap.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.520
So again, another
ecosystem with a blockchain

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.250
running where we're removing
the need for an intermediary.

00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:35.920
OK.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.350
So that's a very lightning
overview of some applications.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.800
I'll know talk about some of
the elements of the blockchain

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.460
now I've increased your
interest, hopefully.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.330
So a blockchain is
simply a public ledger.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.930
It's a public record
of transactions.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.110
And the reason why banks get
interested-- well, have become

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.530
interested in the blockchain--
is because all the bank is,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.600
to caricature them, is a ledger.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.270
They have databases, lots
and lots of databases,

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.710
to contain the ledger.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.890
And they spend a
lot of resources

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.670
overnight reconciling all
their internal ledgers

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.170
with the ledgers of others.

00:06:17.352 --> 00:06:20.440
And you need a complete record,
because, of course, your bank

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.560
balance unfortunately
isn't dependent on just

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.300
your last transaction.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.580
It's dependent on all
of your transactions.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.510
So that's why you need a ledger.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.190
Now, the reason
why Santander think

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.670
they'll save a lot of money
is, rather than spending

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.700
a lot of effort in
reconciling literally hundreds

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.384
or thousands of databases
of ledgers internally

00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:41.800
and with the other
banks, there'll

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.610
be one global source
of truth that everyone

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.710
can point to and
say, yes, that is

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.810
the public record
of our transactions,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.820
and we all trust it.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.990
This talk is not
very technical, but I

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.580
want to introduce the
definitions of some elements,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.680
just so you know if
you read about them.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.310
So one is the cryptographic
hash function,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.250
which you'll hear about
hashes if people tell you

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.780
about blockchains.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.450
It's a very easy
thing to define.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.880
So a hash function is, you
take a file of any size--

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.000
they can be very small, they can
be the size of a whole movie--

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.500
and you hash it.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.710
It generates a file
which is always small.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.700
A string of a fixed length
which is not very big at all.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.170
If you change any element
of the input file--

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.940
just one pixel in the movie,
or one element of data--

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.200
the hash completely changes.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.590
So the hash acts like a
thumbprint of the document.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.719
Take a document of every
size, create its thumbprint,

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:47.260
the hash, and then you put that
hash on the blockchain, which

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.170
is very small.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.780
Then people can sign on it.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.500
And when you take
out whatever it

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.740
is, your document you're
interested in, you can say,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.277
my big document
matches the thumbprint.

00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:57.860
And the thumbprint
must sign the hash.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.430
So that's what hashes do.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.110
So a blockchain is
simply a linked list.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.450
It's a list of blocks
where every block points

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.140
to the previous
blocks through a hash.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.740
So one thing that gives you
trust is the hash function.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.630
If I go back to some part of
that history as the blocks,

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:24.040
and I make a change, the hash
function will no longer work.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.080
The linked list will be broken.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.260
So then you can trust
the whole blockchain

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.690
because every block is
pointed to the hash function.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.030
So that's one thing
that gives you trust.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.059
There are other elements
that give you trust

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.590
as well, which I'll talk about.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.669
Another thing is that
it's peer to peer.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.980
So if you pull out your
smartphone now, or a tablet,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.920
or a laptop, and you
run something online,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.760
the chances are
you're connecting

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.060
to a central database,
a central server.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.940
Usually something like
Google or Facebook.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.070
With a blockchain,
it's peer to peer,

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.480
which means if you're a
main player in this space,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.180
everybody gets a complete
record of the entire blockchain.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.340
So everybody can check
what everybody else

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.530
is doing to make sure
that nobody else is

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.850
behaving in a bad fashion.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.090
If you do have a
peer-to-peer system,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.890
there's the problem
of, who's going

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.990
to produce the next block?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.170
So we could imagine a
scenario where all of us

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.430
are on the blockchain.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.225
All of us have one node, and
we all have a complete record.

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:32.100
But somebody needs to
produce the next block.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.290
How are they going
to choose them?

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.830
And there's what's called
consensus mechanisms.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.010
So a way of choosing the
next person, but making it

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.840
somehow fair.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.310
Another term that
you'll hear about

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.410
is something called a
consensus mechanism,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.040
and the main one that's used
on platforms such as Bitcoin

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.560
is proof of work.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.910
Proof of work is a way
of getting entities

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.090
that don't know each other
to collaborate and trust

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.520
each other what's
happening, because it's

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.890
very hard to cheat.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.750
In many of the blockchains
such as Bitcoin,

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.850
they're what's
called public, which

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.940
means anyone with a
computer can join.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.300
So what they do is they
have a cryptographic puzzle.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.084
So there's some puzzle
that you have to solve.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:20.250
And the way they designed
the puzzle is the only way

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.650
to solve it is to guess.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.510
So there's some seed called
the nonce with a function,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.710
and you guess the x such
that the function magically

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.940
produces a small number.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.700
And then to make
the puzzle harder,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.612
you just make the number
smaller and smaller.

00:10:37.612 --> 00:10:39.570
So what happens is you
have all these computers

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.950
around the globe trying
to solve the puzzle.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.370
And they keep guessing, and
the numbers that come out

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.390
are too big.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.000
And then at one point,
somebody guesses right,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.355
and then they win the prize
of producing the next block.

00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:53.850
So that's another
element of trust.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.730
So to cheat, you would
have to go back, recreate

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.540
all the hashes, and resolve
all the proof of work puzzles.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.270
And because they're
hard to solve,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.545
you would have to
solve them faster--

00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:08.100
if it was the room--
everyone else in the room.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.860
And that's another element
that creates trust,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.730
because you cannot
out-compute everybody else.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.230
OK.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.790
So it's basically,
proof of work is

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.440
a way of stopping the one bad
person or bad players doing

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.610
nasty things.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.710
And it's been
mathematically proven,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:32.100
as long as less than 50% of your
colleagues, if less than 50%

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.110
of them are bad, you're OK.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.020
Once more than 50% of them
are bad, then you're not OK.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.010
But it's a pretty good
way of ensuring trust.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.720
One negative side effect
of this is something

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.800
that's called bitcoin mining.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.550
So imagine all these machines
trying to solve these puzzles,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.482
and everybody wants
to create a new block.

00:11:52.482 --> 00:11:54.690
If you create a new block,
you actually get a reward.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.070
On Bitcoin, you get a coin.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.810
So this is the largest bitcoin
mine-- or it was time ago--

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:01.590
in the US.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.220
And you can see they have
this big farm of machines.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.060
So they have all
these machines doing

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.590
these cryptographic puzzles.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.970
And it was computed
at some point

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:14.910
that Bitcoin is maybe using
more electricity than Ireland.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.860
And it's growing, so
you see that's an issue.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.430
So people work on different
consensus mechanisms

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.120
that don't use electricity.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.620
I won't spend too
much time on this.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.828
I'll go through this quickly.

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.650
But proof of work
is the most common.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.610
So who has the most
computing power?

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.880
Who can solve the puzzles?

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.730
There are others.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.530
Who has the most capacity?

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.170
The more disc storage
you give, the bigger

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.090
your chance of
winning the prize.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.250
Proof of stake.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.140
You take some of your coins.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.760
You lock them away and
say, I will never use them.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.790
The more coins you
lock away, the greater

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.470
your chance of producing
the next block.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.340
Proof of burn.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.500
I take some coins and I
actually set fire to them.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.270
Literally.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.220
And then that gives me a stake.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.550
So this is all about, if you
want to play in the game,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.800
prove that you're engaged.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.210
And that should make
the bad people shy away,

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.830
because they won't be as
engaged as the others.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.530
There is one of elapsed time.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.360
Who's been waiting the longest?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:22.080
And then there are proof of
authority networks where--

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.660
these are not open
anymore, but you only

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.860
let certain machines go in.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.280
So certain banks, if
they want to collaborate,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.680
may only let other banks go in.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.290
So these are called
permissioned blockchains.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.700
As opposed to completely
open blockchains,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.070
anyone can join the party.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.420
Everything is
controlled by accounts.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.160
So there are public
and private keys.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.860
I won't labour this, but
everyone has two keys.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.420
Your public key, you
share with anyone.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.140
And that can be used to
encrypt secret messages.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.990
You keep your private
key in a secret place,

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.860
and that's the key for unlocking
anything that was unencrypted.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.610
So anything that happens
on the blockchain

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.060
is always signed with somebody
using their private key.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.210
So you know, in principle, who's
carried out any transaction

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.930
of any sort.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.660
And that's another
element of trust.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.290
The most popular blockchain
platform after Bitcoin

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.160
is Ethereum.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.910
Ethereum has a couple of
interesting extra things.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.030
So I said that the blockchain
is only a public ledger.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.330
Ethereum adds another element.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.240
So it has two types of accounts.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.410
These normal accounts
for transferring funds.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.380
And then it has something
called a smart contract.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.160
So the interesting
about smart contract,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.515
it is a piece of code.

00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:47.390
So instead of putting
data on the blockchain,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.700
they put a piece of code.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:54.460
And in principle, this code can
embody any legal or financial

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.515
contract.

00:14:55.515 --> 00:14:57.970
So then I have my
blockchain running,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.820
and it can be running financial
and legal contracts for me

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.700
in the trusted fashion,
transferring funds

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.837
across the globe.

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.670
And again, there are
many interesting things

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.711
that we can do with that.

00:15:07.711 --> 00:15:10.520
So some of the applications
that I mentioned previously--

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.330
so for example, the one with
the car and the car keys--

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.820
was running with
smart contracts.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.370
On top of that, people
build applications

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.890
as combinations of
smart contracts.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.560
Instead of calling
these apps, they're

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.180
called dapps, for
decentralised applications.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.250
And then there are
special browsers.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.730
So in the way that one can
have a browser for browsing all

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.760
your movies, or browsing
your applications,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.020
you can browse your dapps in
a special blockchain browser.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.640
OK.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.270
There's a great
website called "How

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:51.340
to Avoid Pointless Blockchain
Projects" for the sceptical.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.410
And this talks about
the various things

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.760
that you need for a blockchain.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.250
So as with anything,
you do get some hype,

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.230
and then people
will try to apply

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.580
a blockchain to everything.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.835
So the main
characteristics you need

00:16:02.835 --> 00:16:04.600
for when a blockchain
will be useful,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.680
you should need to share data.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.800
If you don't want to
share data, forget it.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.830
You should have
multiple writers.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.970
So multiple people want
to write that data.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.030
There should be an
absence of trust.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.100
It's not the case that
everybody trusts everybody

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.660
else completely.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.360
And your transactions
should interact, ideally.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.830
As I said, with
your bank balance,

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.352
it's the combination
of transactions

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:28.060
that give you your
bank balance, not just

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.640
your last spend or last income.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.430
And then there should
be a set of rules.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.750
You should not be
completely anarchic.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.390
Some people should care about
the rules and the assets

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.640
that you're transferring,
be that coins, or diamonds,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.460
et cetera.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.730
And something should
back the assets

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.510
where there is a
community, or whoever.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.550
So a couple of the more
outlandish elements

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.550
that we have that people are
working on with blockchains.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.360
Two of them I'll talk
about are DAOs and ICOs.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.690
So a DAO is a distributed
autonomous organisation.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.839
So I have this blockchain,
which everyone trusts.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.520
I have smart contracts.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.250
And these are running with
no humans in the loop.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.349
And they're transferring assets.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.310
So some people are thinking, OK.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.260
I can create a company.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.670
A company that trades
with no humans.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.920
Why do we need humans anymore?

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.339
They're not always trustworthy.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.770
And this will run,
and we can look

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.230
at the record of what
happens on the blockchain.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:37.790
So there was something
called The DAO,

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.760
I guess over a
year ago, which was

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.900
acting like a venture capitalist
running on the Ethereum

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.200
blockchain.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.420
This had, at one point, $160
million worth of investment.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.860
Crowd-funded.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:57.070
And it was parcelling that
money out to various projects

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.185
with no humans using small
contracts on the blockchain.

00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:05.710
There's an interesting
element where

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.130
you can think about
combining any physical object

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.540
with a blockchain platform.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.630
So then one can think about
turning any physical thing--

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.090
maybe this theatre,
maybe a screen--

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.430
into a company that trades.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.470
And it rents itself out.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.410
So you can think about
a car leasing company

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.780
with no humans on the loop.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:33.400
IBM, they had a washing machine
that would order its own powder

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.290
when it run out.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.310
And when it thought that
it was going to break down,

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.690
it would contact an engineer,
pay the engineer for the work,

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:41.640
and carry on.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.480
Again, with no
humans in the loop.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.100
So again, different
things one can think of.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.980
ICOs are something
in contrast to what

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.579
you see on the stock exchange.

00:18:52.579 --> 00:18:54.370
So when somebody wants
to set up a company,

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.530
they have an initial
public offering.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.670
So I say, I have
a fantastic idea.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.450
I have a company.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.400
Why don't you invest?

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.870
Please invest in me.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.930
People invest in certain
funds, and for that, they

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.180
get shares in the future
profit of the company.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.314
So you can think about the
shareholders investing.

00:19:10.314 --> 00:19:11.980
And then, some point
later, you actually

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.390
build your product,
whatever it is.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.000
And then you start selling.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.200
Users pay you for
those services.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.970
Now, in that context, you
have two types of stakeholders

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.050
to caricature it.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.480
You have the users
paying for services,

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.450
and you have stakeholders, which
are somehow-- in one aspect,

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.500
you say, well, they're
syphoning off the money

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.719
for the initial
funds they put in.

00:19:32.719 --> 00:19:34.510
With a blockchain,
there's something called

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.262
an initial coin offering.

00:19:36.262 --> 00:19:37.720
So one interesting
thing one can do

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.303
with a blockchain
is you can basically

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.390
invent your own currency.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.360
So I can invent
the John currency

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.950
for my fantastic product.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:49.090
And I can say, you can
buy the John currency.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:54.310
It only costs you 5 pounds
for every John coin.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.930
You buy that, but it's
really an investment,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.360
because I don't
have the service.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.160
But you trust me,
and my services

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.120
will come in the future.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.930
So when my services come,
users will pay for them.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.420
And then all of the
John coins you bought

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.860
will be worth something.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.430
So then we have an ecosystem
with users-- and somehow--

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.660
stakeholders and shareholders.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.970
But there aren't really
any shareholders.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.240
So you can take out
the middle player.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.160
It all runs on the blockchain.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.600
And there is no
shareholder syphoning off.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.020
There are just different
elements using the John coin.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.500
And the John coin stays
in the whole ecosystem.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.010
OK.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.910
So let me just have
some closing remarks.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.160
So of course, some of what
I said maybe intentionally

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.550
is a bit provocative,
a bit outlandish.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.760
But think about
the current world

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.430
that you live in now, where
every time you take out

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.640
your device, you're connecting
to some central server

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.630
that you've never seen.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.560
Some database somewhere
that you don't control.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.800
And there are some big companies
now, big tech companies,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.070
that have a lot of data on you.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.740
Tim Berners-Lee, the
Sir Tim Berners-Lee

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.570
who invented the web,
he had an article

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.590
in Vanity Fair in August
where he postulated

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.490
that the web is now
anti-human because of this

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.400
over centralization of data.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.790
And he's in fact working on
technologies to alleviate this,

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.840
and we're connecting
to his software

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.660
to connect it to our blockchain
at the Open University.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.210
There was a journalist
in The Guardian

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:36.030
who asked Google, please send me
all the data you have about me.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.117
So Google had 5.5 gigabytes'
worth of data on him.

00:21:40.117 --> 00:21:41.950
Now, of course, you can
change your settings

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.120
in different ways.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.020
I assume that his settings
were the least restricted.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.160
But Google knew
everywhere he had been.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.810
They knew about his searches,
including those deleted.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.320
They knew his
activity on YouTube.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.450
Now, with a blockchain
and other technologies,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.780
we can think about creating
a different type of internet

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:07.980
or web where the data is
shared in a more equal fashion.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.380
There's also another
case where you

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.120
can think about
people suffering not

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.220
for the over-centralization
of data,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.860
but because there's a
lack of data on them.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.550
I read a statistic recently
that 30% of citizens in the US

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:25.560
cannot get credit because they
have no work history and no

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.310
credit history.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.800
In the UK, we can think
about the Windrush scandal

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.190
that people were deported.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.280
And one can view that problem
as a problem with data.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.900
They didn't have
the data to prove

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.470
that they had been in the UK
for every year for the last 50

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.970
years.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.969
The government actually
burned some of the data.

00:22:43.969 --> 00:22:44.890
It didn't help.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.510
So you can think
about alleviating

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.250
some of the social
justice issues

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.470
around data which
may be exacerbated

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.457
by data through technology
such as the blockchain.

00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:55.894
OK, thank you.

00:22:55.894 --> 00:22:58.289
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.140
Thank you, John.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.860
We now have Sajida Zouarhi,
blockchain engineer

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.619
at Consensus.

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:24.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.560
Hello, everyone.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.960
My name is Sajida Zouarhi.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.760
I'm going to introduce
myself briefly,

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.400
and then we'll go to
the core of the subject.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.440
So I'm a blockchain architect.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.300
I work at Consensus, one
of the biggest companies

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.270
in the blockchain ecosystem.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.420
Consensus is actually
a flat company.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.060
We've no hierarchy.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.450
And it's aiming at bringing
blockchain solution

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.270
to the world, as well as
innovating as a company itself.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.040
I am also a engineer and a
computer science PhD student.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.830
I work on critical data
management and transmission

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.750
over complex systems.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.190
And I have numerous side
projects, one of which Kidner,

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.590
and I'm going to
talk about it after.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:08.280
I'm also very involved in
association and community.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.960
I organise hackathons.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.060
If you don't know
what a hackathon is,

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.770
feel free to ask at the end.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:18.840
And my goal is to explain what
blockchain is in the simplest

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.965
terms possible.

00:24:19.965 --> 00:24:22.470
And also, since I'm here
at the Royal Institution

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:27.690
and I'm thankful for the invite,
I want to help create a bridge

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.140
between academia and the
developer world, which is--

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.090
in blockchain and
bitcoin community--

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.680
sort of filled with cypherpunk,
and libertarian, and people

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.410
with alternative mindsets.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:43.560
So one of the subjects
we're going to talk about,

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.560
blockchain has been explained
in a brilliant way by John.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.500
And I'm going to give you
just a simple example that

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.340
summarise this.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.210
And maybe you can use that
example to explain blockchain

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.500
to, I don't know, your children,
your parents, your friends,

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.810
those who are allergic
to math but interesting

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.460
into Bitcoin and blockchain.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:07.500
So we're going to take an
example about a family.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.490
So you have a family with
parents and four children.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.040
There is a very simple
rule in that family.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.290
Everyone has to wash the
dishes at least once a week.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.930
Parents, they have some
sort of attributes.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.930
First, they have authority
over the children.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.740
They can supervise their work.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.000
They can ask them
questions, and children,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.590
they have to answer
their parents.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.490
But also, they can use some
sort of pressure system,

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.340
like rewards,
punishments, ice creams.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.760
Things like that.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.800
OK.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.900
So we have, still, a problem.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.370
Trust in this family.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:49.080
What if the sister says
that she has done her duty,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.750
but actually, it's her
brother that did it?

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.590
How can we tell-- how
can the parents tell--

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.950
who is lying and who is not?

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.900
So at the end of
the day, they still

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.480
have to play police and
actually monitor the children.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.270
And this is very tiring.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.950
So the question is
how to help parents.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.470
Well, actually,
blockchain is the answer.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.330
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.400
I know.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.840
So they go to the supermarket.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.940
They buy a blockchain.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.810
Yes, you can find it everywhere.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.750
So it is basically just
a transparent tube,

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.490
and you put it in
your kitchen floor

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.570
with some cement around it.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.040
I'm giving you the
recipe of blockchain.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.870
You give some tokens
to your children.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.670
Each colour for one child.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.640
And you give them a
padlock and a key.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.757
So why is that?

00:26:36.757 --> 00:26:38.340
If you think about
everything you just

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.260
heard about
blockchain, actually,

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.470
this is a metaphor of
what blockchain is.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.330
The transparency of
the tube is important,

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.937
because in the
public blockchains,

00:26:47.937 --> 00:26:49.020
everything is transparent.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.820
You can actually read
every transaction

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.610
on that ledger is
replicated on every node

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.230
of the peer-to-peer network.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.800
This is one of the greatest
attribute of blockchain.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.150
The second series is the cement.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.070
We've been talking
about hashes earlier.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.390
Hash function.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.660
The thing that actually links
every block in the blockchain

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.809
and make it not corruptible.

00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:09.600
This is the cement.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.630
You cannot take the
tube and shake it,

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.270
or remove some of the
tokens of the children.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.300
Each token is like a transaction
or a block, if you want.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.450
And then the padlock and the key
is the cryptographic elements.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.450
Cryptography is one of the
core element of blockchain.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.870
You cannot interact on a
blockchain if you cannot sign

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.360
your transaction, so you need
your public and private key

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.180
to do so to express yourself.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.030
And no one else can do it,
because no one else has

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.210
your private key, which is
why every time you will hear

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.970
about blockchain,
the first advice is,

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.137
don't lose your private key.

00:27:43.137 --> 00:27:44.678
Because if you lose
your private key,

00:27:44.678 --> 00:27:46.980
you lose everything,
especially your bitcoins.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.420
And it happens a lot of time.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.294
I don't know if you
heard about that man that

00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:53.100
went into a garbage trying
to look for the hard drive,

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.690
and he had some private key.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.600
Because now he's a millionaire,
but actually, he's not.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.288
So.

00:27:59.288 --> 00:28:02.710
So this tube was
actually built, and it

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:06.580
was shown at a hackathon
I organised in 2016.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.900
Designers worked on it.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.520
They have no
technical background,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.340
but they were able to
build this metaphor, which

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.940
is that the sister and
brother are actually society.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.560
We have millions of
sister and brother

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.020
that are trying to
collaborate, to work together.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.400
But they cannot always
trust each other.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.440
So what do we do?

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.420
We add third parties.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.530
We add middlemen.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:27.910
We add authorities.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.470
And after that, they
take everything.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.550
They take the value.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.641
Think about Uber.

00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:33.640
I don't know if you had
the same issue in the UK

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.580
as we had in France, but
it was almost a revolution.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.020
People were burning
tyres in the subway--

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.460
in the outer roads
and highway, actually.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.680
They were actually
throwing things

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.410
at people, customer
from the Uber.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.030
So it went very bad.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:49.570
Why?

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.360
Because they felt like
they've been losing their job.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.530
And why is that?

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.160
Because Uber basically
took over the market.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.710
But at the same
time, the drivers,

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.390
they could have organised an
Uber in the form of the DAO,

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.320
for example, and say, OK.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.160
We have the cars.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.090
We have the expertise.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:07.923
We have the network.

00:29:07.923 --> 00:29:08.770
We have the clients.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.330
Why do we need someone else?

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.500
But they didn't do that.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.390
They kept doing the same way.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:17.060
And Uber added an added value
with a better algorithm.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.250
And now they control--

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.570
they own the driver.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.410
They own the margin.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.410
They calculate everything,
and nobody can say nothing.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.230
So every time you don't take,
let's say, your own fate

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.680
into your hands, then you're
letting room for someone else

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.950
to do it.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.340
OK.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.650
So why is blockchain
interesting?

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.280
Because blockchain, it
is not just a new tech.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.180
It is not a software.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.730
It's nothing like that.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.980
It's a social and
technical paradigm shift.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.940
It's a new way of
building things.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.280
And it's not just about finance.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.466
It's not just about bitcoin,
and darknet, and speculation,

00:29:51.466 --> 00:29:52.840
and greed, and
everything we like

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.000
to read about in the newspaper.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.610
It's just like the internet.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.060
When the internet was born,
it started quite slowly.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.600
People didn't even understand
what was the internet.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.990
I recommend you to
watch some old video

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.380
about people talking about what
is the internet on TV shows

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.780
and things like that.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.610
It's super funny.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.610
They don't even know what
they're talking about.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.040
This is us right now
talking about blockchain.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.950
And we have to be patient,
because it takes years for us

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.010
to have a concrete application
of what is internet,

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.397
and what it brings to us.

00:30:25.397 --> 00:30:27.730
So it's going to happen in
the same way with blockchain.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:33.110
And the good news is that
it's happening way faster.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.856
So now I'm going to focus on
one aspect, which is actually

00:30:36.856 --> 00:30:38.230
a good transition
with what we've

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.600
seen at the end of
the last presentation

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.150
about centralization of
data and the question

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.060
of self-sovereignty on data.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.060
So do you really own
the data you produce?

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.250
I did a presentation at
a technical conference

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.170
a few months ago, and the
title was, "Who Owns You?"

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:56.950
So I ask this question.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.920
Nobody told me anything.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.840
So the answer is, no one.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.810
That's the answer.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.240
Nobody owns you.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.300
But in the reality,
some big players

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.465
of the digital
ecosystem owns you,

00:31:08.465 --> 00:31:09.590
because they own your data.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.240
They know everything about you.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.360
People, they are
afraid of hackers.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.080
I don't know, like
some kind of myth of--

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.260
it's not a myth, but it's
like a minority of the threats

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.230
that we're living in,
like Russian hackers.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.720
Like East European hackers
entering everywhere.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.460
But this is not
the biggest threat.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.600
The biggest threat is the data
that you're actually giving.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.700
Like, you are giving it.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.940
Nobody is actually forcing you
or breaking into your computer

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.320
to make you give it.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.900
And this is when you use
WhatsApp, when you use

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.220
Instagram, when you use Google.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.920
When you use all these
friendly application.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.860
But actually, these
are toxic friends,

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.140
because they are sucking
everything from you,

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.270
and they are not giving
you anything back.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.360
You're completely out
of the value chain here.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.900
So let's take a
look at this text.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.280
This is a piece of terms and
condition from Instagram.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.850
And just the second paragraph
is like the translation

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.340
in human language,
because, you know.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.920
So what Instagram is
telling you is that, OK.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.770
So you own your original
pictures and video.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.810
But we are allowed
to use them, and we

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.710
can let others use them as
well anywhere around the world.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.260
And also, people might
pay us to use them,

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.480
and we will not
pay you for that.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.910
Awesome, right?

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.070
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.920
Great.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.530
And what do we do every
time we download an app?

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.190
We press Yes.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.790
Why?

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.410
Because we need the service.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.170
So we are in a paradigm
that is very simple--

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.380
and I don't know why we believe
it's how things should be--

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.510
where, when we
need to service, we

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.120
are ready to sacrifice
our data to have it.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.580
And sometimes, we pay.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.990
This is like a
double punishment.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:55.180
So let me introduce you to
some of my research work.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.580
I've been asking
myself two questions.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.640
How to give back to the
user control over its data,

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.260
and how to reconcile
transparency

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.350
and confidentiality in a
decentralised environment.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.200
You have now understand
the hope that

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.450
is in blockchain, the promise.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.120
But I believe that if we don't
solve the confidentiality

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:18.580
situation, it's going to be not
as spectacular of a revolution

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.839
as we want.

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:22.630
One case study that
I'm going to talk about

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.440
is my project, Kidner, which
is a decentralised matching

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.480
platform for kidney transplant.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.230
So first, critical data.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.500
What are they?

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.110
So we can found them everywhere.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.440
It's personal data,
medical data, crisis data,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.270
business data, bank data.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:43.860
And I don't know if you know
that, but take a look at this.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.870
The data that are the most
expensive and the most

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:50.160
searched for by malicious
person are medical data.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.630
Don't know if you knew that.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.230
That's scary.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.980
So Kidner is about
using blockchain

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.700
in a health care
environment, which

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.950
is kind of the worst
thing if you're

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.080
building a startup or an
entrepreneurship project

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.640
to start with because of
all the legal complication

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.130
and ethical complication.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.198
But I believe if you can solve
this, we can solve everything.

00:34:11.198 --> 00:34:13.739
So I'm going to introduce you
to the concept of Kidner, which

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.310
is across the nation.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.820
So we have Bob and
Alice, like always.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.040
So Bob needs a kidney.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.400
He's a recipient.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.429
Alice wants to give
Bob her kidney.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.409
She's a donor.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.739
Unfortunately, Bob and
Alice are not compatible.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:33.010
What that mean is that this
transfer cannot happen.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.710
This might be the end
of the story for them.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:36.449
OK.

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:38.850
Then we have Carol and
Dave on the other side,

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.440
maybe in another country.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.179
Same situation there.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.189
What they don't know-- because
it doesn't exist today--

00:34:46.189 --> 00:34:48.480
what they don't know is that,
actually, Alice and Carol

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.820
are compatible, and Dave
and Bob are compatible.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.710
And you will only
know that if we

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.755
have a pool of pairs
of incompatible donor

00:34:55.755 --> 00:34:59.340
and recipients on a connected
network with algorithm that

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.550
can run to find matches.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.520
Right?

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.930
So how do we create that?

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.520
To create that,
you need a network

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.715
of hospitals that are
willing to collaborate.

00:35:07.715 --> 00:35:11.160
But they don't want to, because
medical data is sensitive.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.370
And also, data in general
is sort of precious.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.870
So people, they don't
want to share that.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:21.060
So blockchain here, I'm using
it to solve a governance issue,

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.370
meaning that there is
not one hospital that

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.100
is the authority on
the other hospital.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.770
There is not one place
where data are stored,

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.920
like for example, in the US.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.050
What about patients in
France, or Europe, or?

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:38.010
So if you don't remove
this from the blocks,

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.890
nothing is going to happen
just on a political level.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.660
So with blockchain,
there's nothing

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.670
such as this, because
every hospital is

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.850
going to run its own node
and store its own data.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.590
Second thing,
matching algorithm.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.229
We need to do computation
in a decentralised fashion.

00:35:52.229 --> 00:35:53.520
We can do that with blockchain.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.960
We've seen it with Ethereum.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.090
It is the perfect platform to
run decentralised application.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.090
We also call them
unstoppable application,

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.180
because no one can
actually kill the process.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.980
Now, the third aspect of
this project is cryptography.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.460
So I'm working on a cryptosystem
such as homomorphic encryption,

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.300
or a multi-party computation.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.200
And basically, what it does,
it enables you to compute

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.800
and perform calculation on
data that you cannot see.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.730
On encrypted data.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.930
It's also blind computation.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.300
With my team, we are building
a platform called HellHound.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.110
And it is a decentralised
platform for blind computation.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.610
Any startup, any company,
anyone can use HellHound, send

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.910
some encrypted data,
send an algorithm,

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.020
and we're able to
send back the result.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.790
We don't know what
the result is.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.286
We don't know what
the inputs are.

00:36:43.286 --> 00:36:44.910
But we're able to
send back the results

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.820
so that it is decrypted
by the end user.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.500
If you think about
that, that means

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.170
that we don't have anymore
to do the sacrifice

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.190
I was talking about earlier.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.750
Now, we can use, for example,
23andMe for the genetics.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.610
The DNA testing.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.170
You can use that,
but you don't have

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.510
to give your DNA
information to 23andMe

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.900
that is going to build
the biggest DNA database--

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.060
which is something
very scary, I think--

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.230
of the world.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.900
And you have actually to pay
for that just to know who

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.780
is your third-degree cousin.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.990
So if you use that, that
means that you can go and do

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.580
your own DNA test.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.630
You can encrypt your file, own
it, send it to such platform,

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.780
and get back the result, and you
never disclosed any information

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.990
about yourself.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.930
This is self-sovereignty.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:34.620
This is what blockchain
can bring to our IT system

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.860
and services right now.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.690
Yeah.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.106
If we have time,
I'm going to show

00:37:41.106 --> 00:37:45.460
you this video about
the Kidner Project.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.080
So this video was
done for a hackathon

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.330
that we actually won in May.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.220
And it was the Blockchain
for Social Impact hackathon.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.105
So here, you see two person.

00:37:56.105 --> 00:37:57.730
One is the donor,
one is the recipient.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.910
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:41:19.078 --> 00:41:22.036
So thank you for watching.

00:41:22.036 --> 00:41:22.536
Thank you.

00:41:22.536 --> 00:41:25.006
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.570
So I'm just going to
look at this, but.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.850
So basically, what
we're trying to achieve

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.430
with Kidner is prove that
technology can actually help

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.370
save lives and have an impact.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.900
We already have a
prototype that is working.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.280
You can see it here.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.660
This is not the best
front-end you've ever seen,

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.450
but this is proof
that it can work.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.240
And we've been in contact
with doctors and chief

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.615
of nephrology services.

00:41:53.615 --> 00:41:58.150
They are very interested
in the project, as well as

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.475
the WHO, who contacted
me personally

00:42:00.475 --> 00:42:02.350
to work on how
blockchain can help

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:05.106
prevent kidney trafficking.

00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:07.022
Let's say kidney
transferability if we turn it

00:42:07.022 --> 00:42:08.460
in a positive way.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.850
But I can tell you that organ
trafficking and organ tourism

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:13.540
is massive.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:19.030
So if you want to learn
more about Kidner,

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.020
we have a website.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.060
kidnerproject.com.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.480
And we have been featured in
the Telemedicine and e-Health

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.340
Society Journal.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.580
So moving on.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.320
We've been true to hope.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.510
Now let's talk about the hype.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.870
So now that we're
saying about blockchain,

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:39.490
it is a great
technology that can

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.030
help us achieve many things.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.680
But we cannot put
blockchain everywhere.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.120
Unfortunately, that's what
people have been doing.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:50.470
And this is why people are
distrusting this technology,

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:55.060
because they're seeing too much
announced newspaper article

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.760
talking about what
blockchain can solve.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.730
You know that company just added
"blockchain" in their product

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.700
title, and their
valuation increased 100%.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.143
So I can understand how
this can send bad signals.

00:43:11.143 --> 00:43:14.670
But let's just
take a look at how

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:18.030
we can find a good use case.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.120
So for that, you
need a methodology.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.050
So I'm just going to let you
take a look at this, but yeah.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:26.870
You laugh, but that's what's
going on in companies.

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.730
I've been to meetings
pretty much like that.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.140
So OK.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.290
So if we take a look at
the hype curve of Gartner,

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.460
we are pretty much at the peak.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.930
But it has been
going on for years,

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.470
so now I don't even
know if we are just

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.010
going to be in hype for years
and years, or if it's just,

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.320
I don't know, normal
for blockchains.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.960
What we do know is that
they're here to last.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.144
It is not just a
short-term thing.

00:43:54.144 --> 00:43:56.060
It is going to impact
your life in the future,

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.970
so no one can not take
a look at this now.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.170
I wrote an article--

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:02.985
very easy to read--

00:44:02.985 --> 00:44:04.360
called "Blockchain
Is the Answer,

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.640
but What Was the Question?"

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.495
So few tips I'm giving you.

00:44:09.495 --> 00:44:11.220
You start from your use case.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:15.240
You all have
expertise in a field.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.460
You all have pain points
you want to solve.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.050
So just take a look
at that, and see

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:22.620
how we can leverage the value
proposition of the blockchain

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.034
that now we know to
solve these pain points.

00:44:26.034 --> 00:44:27.450
You have to know
the possibilities

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:29.050
and the limits of a technology.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.285
Blockchain's not going
to solve everything.

00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:32.380
Not at all.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.850
But it can solve some things.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:35.460
But if you are aware
of that, now you

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.130
can propose relevant use
cases to your company,

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.550
or to your own startup.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.390
You can download a tool.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.980
It's free.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.130
I've done it after compiling
knowledge and questions

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:48.440
from hackathons
I've been mentoring.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.970
It's called The
Blockchain Canvas.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:51.500
Looks like this.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.790
It's pretty intuitive.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.880
It's like the
business model canvas

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.020
but for a blockchain use case.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.140
Remember the slide
that John showed you

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.060
about the question you
need to ask yourself?

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.740
That's pretty much
the same idea.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.440
If you're able to
fill all these spaces,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.350
it means that you are probably
on a very good use case.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.500
And then you can use this to
brainstorm more, and maybe

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.622
specify your use case.

00:45:13.622 --> 00:45:15.080
So it is really a
tool that you can

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.690
use on your own review team.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.540
This is an example of
the Kidner Project.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.694
Just with this canvas,
I can explain everything

00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:24.610
about the Kidner Project
I've just showed you.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:28.040
Just in one slide.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.060
So as a conclusion,
hope and hype.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.170
That's my answer for you.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:34.670
Why?

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.503
Because actually, it's
not about blockchain.

00:45:36.503 --> 00:45:37.700
It's about humans.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.780
Blockchain is neutral.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.880
It's a technology.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.980
It's humans who put
expectation in blockchain.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.510
It's humans who
can use blockchain

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.370
for good or bad things.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:48.170
So we'll see what
we do with that.

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.420
Also, blockchain won't
solve all our problems.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.640
And certainly not alone.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.640
What it means is that
you can use blockchain

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.370
to create a solution,
but you will for sure

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.140
have to use other tools.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.500
If you take a look at the
blockchain Kidner Project,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.570
you've seen that I've
used cryptography,

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:07.580
because blockchain
on its own could not

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.160
be viable for this use case
because of the confidentiality

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:10.960
issue.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.430
Blockchain is also
a scalability issue.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.300
It has many issues.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.880
But the good thing is,
we have to be patient

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.590
because the paint
is still fresh.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:20.214
I don't know if we
say that in English,

00:46:20.214 --> 00:46:21.480
but we do say it in France.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.360
So it means that
we have to wait,

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.240
because people are
working on this.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.720
Our researcher are on it.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.276
Developers are on it.

00:46:28.276 --> 00:46:29.650
Ethereum Foundation,
for example,

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.790
is working on removing some
roadblocks on the Ethereum

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.220
blockchain.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.510
And mistakes.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.470
Mistakes were made, and
they are going to be made.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.590
The DAO-- I don't think we
have time to dive into this,

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:46.250
but yes, that was
a good example.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.527
Money was stolen.

00:46:47.527 --> 00:46:49.110
They did a rollback
on the blockchain,

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.870
basically, breaking some of the
promises of this technology,

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:54.320
but also saving the
credibility of the technology

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.740
so that it can have a future.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.710
So again, a trade-off.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.170
And mistakes will always
be made, because people,

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:04.950
they have to learn how to
handle blockchain solutions.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:09.320
You, I think, have the habit,
if you lose your password,

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.860
to click on I
forgot my password.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.900
We sometimes do that.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.730
We don't do that
with blockchain.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.840
If you've lost your private
key, it's lost forever.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.400
All your millions
are lost forever.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.760
There's no one you can call.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.760
There's no support
service that can help you.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.440
This is very
disturbing for people

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.790
who are not used to this.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.780
So it's not like it's going
to go mainstream in the year.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.820
But people are
developing some platform,

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.560
developing some
solution, and you should

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.090
be looking at it right now.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.190
I could talk forever
about the use cases

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.610
that are actually running.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:44.100
I'm not talking about things
that are going to be released,

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.700
but things are actually
existing right now.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.870
And it's happening.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.780
So it's better not
to miss the train,

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.400
like we say in France too.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.530
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.060
Thank you very much.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.810
