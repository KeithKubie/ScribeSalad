00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.320
I have several tips for working with
business partners and co-founders.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.270
And one of those,
probably the most important one,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.760
is establish a set of rules around
discussing difficult things.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.210
When stress levels get high,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.290
people maybe have not slept in days and
problems arise.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.410
Figuring out a framework of conversation
is essential to working through these

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.860
problems and without it businesses
can fall apart due to infighting,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.950
or just miscommunication.
