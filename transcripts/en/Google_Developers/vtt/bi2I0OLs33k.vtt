00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.770
TODD KERPELMAN:
Hello I/O viewers.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.530
Well, what better
way to follow up

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.530
an interview with a
real-life astronaut

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.730
than to check out a
virtual spaceship?

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.580
So I am here with Amanda in
the augmented reality booth,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.250
and you're going to show me
something cool from the NASA

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.750
website.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.720
AMANDA LE: Yeah.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.090
So here you can see on the
NASA website they're showing

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.250
3D models of their rovers.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.320
Here we have the
Curiosity Rover,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.810
and they're actually using
the model VR web component

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.857
to put that 3D asset
on their website.

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:31.440
TODD KERPELMAN: Well
that's very cool.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.540
Now, you said it's
a web component, so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.040
do they need to NPM install
something to get it working,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.540
or?

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.600
AMANDA LE: It's actually markup,
so very simple to just put

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.267
on your website.

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:41.225
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.120
Oh, that's very cool.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.830
And this 3D model, what
file format is that?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.450
AMANDA LE: So we
recommend using glTF,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.728
but it also supports
USDZ and GLB.

00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:51.520
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.670
And is that something most
commercial 3D modeling

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.750
tools will export to?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.430
AMANDA LE: You should be able
to export to that easily.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.990
TODD KERPELMAN: I see you've got
that little button down there

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.950
in the bottom right.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.940
What does that do?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.857
AMANDA LE: So this
actually is the new feature

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:03.810
that we're launching
at I/O today.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.020
And what it allows you
to do is open up what

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.370
we call Scene Viewer.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.377
So Scene Viewer allows
you to take this 3D model

00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:13.335
and actually place it in
your real world space.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:16.220
TODD KERPELMAN: Whoa, no way.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.720
AMANDA LE: So here you can see
the Curiosity Rover at scale.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.553
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow.

00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:23.010
It's like there's a real-life
spaceship here in the booth,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.220
but not really.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.720
It's just very-- actually
very nicely rendered,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.335
and it kind of fooled me.

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:30.210
AMANDA LE: And so you
can actually manipulate

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.180
this in your own space.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.030
So you'll see it at full
scale, but you can also

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.613
shrink it down so
that it can actually

00:01:34.613 --> 00:01:35.690
fit in your living room.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.690
TODD KERPELMAN: OK, yes.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.020
So if I want to put the
Curiosity Rover on my coffee

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.550
table, I now can, just by
shrinking it down a little bit.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.230
AMANDA LE: Yes.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.220
TODD KERPELMAN: And so how did
you get the size specification?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.840
Apparently, this
was built real life,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.310
or this is showing
it in real life

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.360
and you're able
to shrink it down?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.540
AMANDA LE: Yes.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.340
So NASA, when they
built the 3D model,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.267
decided to build it at scale.

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:56.850
So that's the model
we're referencing.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.840
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.830
Very cool.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.730
And so if I'm a developer and
I want to turn my model VR

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.920
component into this
cool scene viewer,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.608
augmented reality experience,
what do I have to do?

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:09.900
AMANDA LE: So there's no need
to build an app for this.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.740
All you actually do
is go into the markup

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.900
and you add the AR
attribute, which is literally

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.165
the letters a and r.

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:17.560
TODD KERPELMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.690
AMANDA LE: So
super simple to do.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.190
TODD KERPELMAN: I take two
letters and I get all that.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.640
AMANDA LE: Yes.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.880
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.960
Well that sounds easy.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.095
I think even I could do that.

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:26.220
Well I can use a little
pick-me-up after that demo.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.070
Let's head on over here and see
if I can find some caffeine.

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:32.620
Hey, Ashish.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.480
ASHISH SHAH: How
are you doing, Todd?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.500
TODD KERPELMAN: I am doing well.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.030
I'm already excited
for this demo,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.310
because I see there's an
Espresso machine here.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.322
So walk me [AUDIO OUT] today.

00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:41.280
ASHISH SHAH: All right.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.320
So what we are doing
in here is we're

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.440
showing an Espresso machine
coming to life in AR,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.440
using this technology
called augmented images.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.505
That's part of VR core.

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:51.630
You want to give it a spin?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.210
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's--
yes, let's check it out.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.400
ASHISH SHAH: All right.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040
So as soon as you
look at this marker.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.940
TODD KERPELMAN: So you're
showing the image there.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.640
ASHISH SHAH: Yes.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.682
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
telling you to look around

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:03.000
ASHISH SHAH: And now it's
annotated the machine

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.650
with information
about its features.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.820
TODD KERPELMAN: I can see
the little [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.640
coming to life.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.920
ASHISH SHAH: Yes.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.240
It's telling you about
those controls grinding.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.080
TODD KERPELMAN: And
my dose is controlled?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.788
ASHISH SHAH: And the
precise temperature.

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:16.530
What would you do without that?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.770
And you could actually see
an espresso being made here.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.090
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, fantastic.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.790
ASHISH SHAH: This is a really
powerful way for manufacturers

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.850
to show features
of their product

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.790
which are otherwise
just lost in text.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.825
And this really makes the
product come to life--

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:32.700
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.367
ASHISH SHAH: --in a
really powerful way.

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:37.690
And so this triggers the
experience once it recognizes.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.650
And now what happens once
this image is recognized,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.720
it starts establishing
a correspondence

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.502
between the phone and the image.

00:03:44.502 --> 00:03:45.960
TODD KERPELMAN: So
the phone always

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.220
knows exactly where
it is in response to--

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.210
ASHISH SHAH: With
respect to the image.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.502
And when I say it establishes
a correspondence in terms

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:54.240
of a pose, that's
position and orientation.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.860
So position in like
x-direction and y-direction

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.390
and in z-direction.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.990
And also the orientation in
three degrees, like pitch,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.230
yaw and roll.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.800
So the phone knows
exactly where it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.470
is with respect to the marker.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.775
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:09.420
So this kind of
works best in places

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.930
where you sort of have strict
control over the environment

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.430
in which this image is going
to appear and what's around it?

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.138
ASHISH SHAH: Yes.

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:17.339
If you're trying to
augment real things,

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.626
you want to make sure
that the image is

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.959
rigid with respect to the
things that you don't augment.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.500
TODD KERPELMAN: Gotcha.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.300
But if you just want the
image itself specifically

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.350
to come to life, that's
all you need to do.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.350
ASHISH SHAH: Absolutely.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.610
So think about a scenario
where you're at a store

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.100
and you want to see
what's inside a box.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.270
So you could use an
app to look at the box,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.493
it would recognize
the box as a marker,

00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:38.160
and you could actually
have a sneak peek

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.868
at like what's inside the box.

00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:42.410
TODD KERPELMAN: OK so like the
model could pop out of the box

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.630
and I could see--

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.505
ASHISH SHAH: Exactly.

00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:45.990
TODD KERPELMAN: --exactly what
my waffle iron or toaster--

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.160
I need stuff in my kitchen--

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.760
that's all going [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.910
ASHISH SHAH: Without
even opening it up.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.540
TODD KERPELMAN: And then I won't
get yelled at by shopkeepers.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.248
ASHISH SHAH: Yes.

00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:54.290
TODD KERPELMAN: Well,
thank you very much Ashish.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.220
I learned a lot about
augmented reality today.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.050
I'm going to grab this espresso.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.938
Oh, it's not real.

00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:00.980
But the coffee beans are.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.000
Can I eat the coffee beans?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.910
ASHISH SHAH: Yes, you can.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.150
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm going to
take a few coffee beans to go.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.760
ASHISH SHAH: You can
take the coffee beans.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.050
TODD KERPELMAN: Thank you
very much, livestream.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.030
I'm going to go get caffeinated.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.380
