00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The initial energy it has is entirely the potential energy, N which would be 2 kg,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
g which will of course be 10 or 9.8 but I'm using 10, and h which is 12 m.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now the initial energy isn't all going to be converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're going to lose some of it--we're going to subtract some of it to friction.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We're going to subtract 40 J in fact, and that quantity will be converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now we can start plugging in--when I do the algebra out, I get an answer of 14 m/s.
