00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.810
We're asked to simplify m to
the third and then that

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.600
squared all over mx to the
third all of that to the

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.580
fourth power.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.330
And they want us to
express our answer

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.490
in exponential form.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.090
And then they tell us that m
does not equal zero and x does

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.110
not equal zero.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.560
Because if they did, then this
denominator would be equal to

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.310
zero if either of them
did and then that

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.590
would just be undefined.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.600
So that's what they have to put
that little caveat there.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.170
That neither of them are going
to be equal to zero.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.890
So let's try to simplify this.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.690
Let me rewrite it.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.690
So the numerator is m to
the third squared.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:47.520
And our denominator is mx to the
third to the fourth power.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490
Now let's just work on each
of these independently.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.530
What is m to the third and then
that to the second power?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.150
Well if you raise something to
an exponent, and then raise

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.560
that whole thing to another
exponent, this is going to be

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.730
the same thing.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.720
So this numerator up here
is going to be m to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.180
the 3 times 2 power.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.340
Or m to the sixth power.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.670
We're raising it to third
and then squaring it.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.400
And if you think about it, this
expression right here--

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.950
let me just do a little
aside here.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.340
M to the third squared, there's
no magic behind why

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.280
were multiplying that.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.890
If you think about m to the
third squared, this is the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.620
same thing as m to the third
times m to the third.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.050
And if you saw something
like this, you would

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.160
add these two exponents.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.860
3 plus 3.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.140
You have exactly two 3's here.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.330
If this was 4, you would be
multiplying it four times.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.710
So you'd have four 3's.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.380
So that's why we're multiplying
these two

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.720
numbers, 3 times 2.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780
So that gives us
m to the sixth.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.660
And then the denominator here,
we have mx to the third to the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.920
fourth power.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.230
Now in general, when you have
the product of some numbers,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.720
and you're raising the entire
product to some exponent, you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.750
can raise each of the terms
to that exponent.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.610
So this denominator right here,
this is going to be m to

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.200
the fourth times x to the
third to the fourth.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.674
I'm just raising both of these
terms, m to the fourth x to

00:02:08.674 --> 00:02:10.669
the third, to the
fourth power.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.700
Now, what does this
simplify to?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.200
Well, our numerator is
still m to the sixth.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.370
I'll do one step at a time.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.135
Our denominator is
m to the fourth.

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:25.920
But we have x to the third and
then that to the fourth power.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.040
So we can multiply these.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.230
3 times 4.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.650
So this is x to the 12th power,
so times x to the 12th.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.130
Now, we have an m to the sixth
in the numerator and an m to

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.750
the fourth in the denominator.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.400
You can view this as the same
thing as m to the sixth times

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.540
m to the negative four,
either way.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.110
But we know, or hopefully we
know, that this right here can

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.130
be simplified as m to the
sixth minus 4 power.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.580
So this is going to be equal
to-- so the numerator, we

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.600
could have m to the sixth minus
4, which is m squared.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.480
That's what this
simplifies to.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.600
And the denominator we still
have an x to the 12th.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.460
And we're done.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.020
If we don't want something in
the denominator, we could

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.500
rewrite this x to the 12th in
the denominator as x to the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.890
negative 12th in
the numerator.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.660
So we could rewrite this whole
expression as being equal to m

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.390
squared times x to
the negative 12.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.180
Either of these would be
an acceptable answer.
