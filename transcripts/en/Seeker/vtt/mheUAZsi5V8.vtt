00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.699
Alo, I am Gene Terrapy and I want to pump.

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:14.139
YOU UP.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.840
It seems like sportsball isn't really about
the actual sports anymore, but more about

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.240
the drama of the players lives, and how they
made themselves into the buff pieces of gentleman

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.020
or ladymeat they are today.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
Part of that massive swirling narrative, is
the accusation that some sports stars cheat.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.530
Whether it’s blood doping, deflating the
game ball, or taking various myriad drugs;

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.840
it’s all about using science to gain the
high ground.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.940
And now, gene therapy might change athletics
forever.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.320
We've talked about gene therapy before, you
know because you subscribe to DNews.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.329
You do, subscribe to DNews, don't you?

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.370
;) Gene therapy is genetic modification of
someone who's grown, it doesn't permanently

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.059
change the genetics, but it can alter them.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.600
A retrovirus, called a vector, is genetically
engineered to enter the cells of the patient

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.719
and alter a bit of DNA -- something viruses
do naturally.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.060
Gene therapy is used to cure genetic disorders,
but this is different.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.771
Rather than infecting the person to cure something,
the vector is programmed to modify the athlete's

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:16.380
DNA and make their red blood cells carry more
oxygen, make their muscle mass increase…

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.380
or whatever.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.460
It's called gene doping, and it effectively
makes athletes super-human.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.900
The World Anti-Doping Agency -- an organization
dedicated to fairness in athletics -- created

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.220
an expert group to root out any gene doping
way before it actually started happening.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.810
They’re recognizing it as a difficult and
worrying trend in sports.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.630
Gene doping is difficult to detect as it simply
makes the athlete's body better at doing whatever

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.820
it can already do.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.869
And it's already been done...

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.530
Experiments at Harvard in 1999 created genetically
modified mice where a gene called IGF-1 was

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.759
altered; they had two copies, whereas most
mice had only one.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.450
The gene normally affects a protein called
Myostatin.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.880
The increased Myostatin levels allowed the
mice to put on more muscle mass while exercising.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.250
The genetically altered mice got 30 percent
stronger; and this is the same protein we

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.479
have so maybe humans?

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.190
But that's not all, in 2004, experiments at
the Salk Institute of Biological Studies found

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.980
the PPAR-Delta gene, which, when altered,
let mice run twice as far for nearly twice

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.280
as long as regular mice.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.920
The Harvard researchers said, "We certainly
have no plans to add the gene to human embryos,"

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.110
but of course, with gene doping, we wouldn't
actually need to.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.240
In the late 90s, cyclists at the Tour de France
were famously caught injecting their muscles

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.490
with erythropoietin (EPO) which causes increased
red blood cell production.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.450
Because the body produces it naturally, injections
are hard enough to catch, but gene doping

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.879
might make it impossible.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.180
Of course, modifying mice is a far cry from
modifying humans.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.879
The WADA announced adding an extra copy of
the EPO gene could be deadly, causing the

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.410
blood to over-thicken and become sludgy.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.190
Gene therapy, and doping is still highly experimental.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.580
Even though we've sequenced the human genome,
there's too so much information to point to

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.690
each exact gene to up athletic ability, but
scientists are looking; they've counted 220

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.690
so far.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.050
If we could safely modify the genetics of
a living human, we could potentially make

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.710
people stronger, faster, with higher endurance,
more resistant to disease and pain -- all

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.100
with things already in our own bodies.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.099
But, obviously, there are dangers to be avoided.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.900
The research base is there, and when it comes
to sports the money is there, so it's only

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.900
a matter of time.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.530
For now we can enjoy the benefits of other
insane augmentations - Toyota has been doing

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.879
some tinkering of their own with the TRD line
of Toyota Trucks.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.390
Enhanced to rule the off-road!”

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.680
If you could make yourself stronger, faster,
or whatever, would you?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:51.209
What natural thing would you want to make
super?
