00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.820
So we have three functions
that are graphed here.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.680
We have f of x graphed
in this dotted magenta.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.660
We have g of x in this green.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.240
And then we have h of x
in this dotted purple.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.310
And then we have three
potential equations

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.730
that could also be used
to define functions.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.890
And what I want you to
do is think about which

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.300
of these equations match up to
which of these function graphs.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.050
So let's go through
them one by one.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.980
So this first one is
reasonably straightforward.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.280
This is just a
straight-up quadratic.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.514
Right over here, y is equal
to 1/2 x squared minus 9/2.

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.930
And we see that the coefficient
on the second degree term,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.263
or the highest degree term
right over, here is positive.

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:41.320
It is 1/2.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.710
So this is going to be an
upward-opening parabola.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.745
It's going to look
something like that.

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:49.870
And when we look at all of
these options over here,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.340
there's only one upward
opening parabola.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.250
And that is g of x.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.080
So we know that if this has
got to be one of these three,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.580
this right over here is g of x.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.030
So we could say that g of
x is equal to 1/2 x squared

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.710
minus 9/2.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.540
Another giveaway that g of x, or
that g is being described by y

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.510
is equal to 1/2 x
squared, minus 9/2,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.650
is you see when x
is equal to 0, we

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.840
have our y-intercept
at negative 9/2,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.930
which is the same thing
as negative 4 and 1/2.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.540
And you see that is indeed the
case for g right over there.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.830
It's when x is 0, y
is negative 4 and 1/2.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.970
So we could feel pretty
confident about that.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.530
Now let's look at
these next two.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.270
And what I'm going
to do, let me try

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.300
to rewrite them in
a neutral color.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.260
So we don't use blue yet.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.140
So let's think about this one. y
is equal to negative 1/10 times

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.686
x plus 3 times x
squared minus 9.

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:46.560
Now, we could take the
trouble of multiplying

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.561
all of this stuff out.

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:50.060
Or we could just think about
what is the highest-degree term

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.630
going to look like?

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.490
And we could also think about
what does the lowest degree

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.114
term look like?

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:54.460
What is the constant term?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.620
So the highest-degree term is
going to be negative 1/10 times

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.140
x times x squared.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.480
So this is going to be y
is equal to negative 1/10

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.084
x to the third power.

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.500
Then you're going to have a
bunch of other terms in there.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.300
And then you're going to
have your lowest-- maybe I'll

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.327
write a plus although
it might be a minus,

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:17.660
but then you're going have a
bunch of other terms there.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.160
And then you're going to have
your lowest-degree term, which

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.630
is going to be negative 9
times 3, which is negative 27,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.547
times negative 1/10.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.130
Well, that's just
going to be positive

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.426
27/10, which is the
same thing as 2.7.

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:36.800
Now, just from
this, without even

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.650
knowing all of this
business in the middle,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.050
we can start to think about
what this graph is actually

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.500
going to look like.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.114
First of all, we see it is
a third-degree polynomial,

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:51.530
or it's a third-degree
expression,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.660
I guess we could say.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.020
And its coefficient on the
third-degree term is negative.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.220
So that means it's going to have
end behavior like negative x

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.790
to the third.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.730
x to the third looks like this.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.450
Negative x to the third will
look something like this.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.150
So its end behavior is
going to look like that.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.400
We could think about what
it does in the middle.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.299
It might jump up and
do something like that.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.340
But that's what it's end
behavior is going to be.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.480
It has end behavior like
negative x to the third.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.040
Now, which of these graphs
have that type of end behavior?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.550
Well, it's pretty clear that h
of x, when x is very negative,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.570
h of x is positive,
just like this.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.000
When x is very positive,
h of x is very negative.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.880
It is the only of these three
graphs that have that behavior.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.749
So we can feel pretty
confident that this is h of x.

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.290
Now, if we're not
sure, we could also

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.940
look at the y-intercept
right over here.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.210
When x is equal to 0, all
these other terms are 0.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.566
And so y is going to be 2.7.

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.690
And we see that is indeed
the case right over here.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.080
When x is 0, y is 2.7.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.250
So that gives us some
confidence as well.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.040
Now, let's look at
this third expression.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.310
And obviously we
could just deduce

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.840
that there's only one equation
left and one function left.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.590
So this has got to be f of x.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.130
But let's say we
didn't know that.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.340
Let's see how we
could reason it out.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.990
So once again, let's think
about multiplying-- figure

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.490
out what the highest
degree term is.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.073
Well, the highest-degree
term is going

00:04:20.073 --> 00:04:22.050
to be 1/10 times x
squared times x squared.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.180
So we can rewrite this
one as 1/10-- x squared

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.921
times x squared is x
to the fourth power.

00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:30.670
Then we're going to
have a bunch of terms.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.550
And then our lowest-degree term
is going to be 9 times 9 times

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.550
1/10.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.170
That's 81 divided by 10.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.290
So that is 8.1.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.966
So what type of end to
behavior is this going to have?

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:47.800
You have an even-degree
polynomial right over here,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.830
and it has a
positive coefficient.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.860
So it's going to
have end behavior

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.600
like a second-degree polynomial
with a positive coefficient.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.180
Or it's going to have end
behavior like x squared.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.570
So it's going to look--
when x is a really negative,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.840
it's going to be
really positive.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.390
And then when x is
really positive,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.990
it's going to be
really positive.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.140
So it's end behavior is
going to look like that,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.710
and it might do some
business in between.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.890
Well, which of these
graphs do that?

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.270
Well, it's pretty
clear that f definitely

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.240
has that type of end behavior.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.529
It does something a little
interesting in the middle.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.070
And if we wanted to
be sure, we could

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.840
look at this intercept
right over here.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.510
When x is 0, all these other
terms are going to be 0,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.250
and you're going to be left just
with this y-intercept, which

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.780
is 8.1.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.380
And so when x is 0
we do see, indeed,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.240
that f is sitting here at 8.1.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.040
So we can feel pretty confident
that that right over there

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.360
is f of x.
