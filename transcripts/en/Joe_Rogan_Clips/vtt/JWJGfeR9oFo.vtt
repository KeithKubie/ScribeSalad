00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.780
Lithography,
the Joe Rogan experience three and across this too,

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.820
on the screen on Twitter.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.520
What happened in that to Ted says God having an affair with a woman that her

4
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.780
husband came home early,
tried to escape through the window,

5
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:16.300
but ended up falling on a metal beam.
Oh.

6
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.070
Oh my God.
It went through his head.
How did they get the beam off there?

7
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:23.990
The saw the beam off probably.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.390
I just saw the picture of like,
what the fuck is that?
Holy Shit.

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.540
Let's try to find it.
Oh my God,
he's alive.
Yeah.
And end of this.

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.790
There's pictures of this happening in the past to Jesus Christ.

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.050
I don't want to die because of it.
Oh my God.
I went through his head.
Yeah,

12
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:42.640
it's weird.
What would people,

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.090
how people survive from injuries [inaudible] yeah,

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.100
like yeah,
when they stopped doing those,
we haven't really talked about too much,

15
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:52.060
but I remember looking it up.

16
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.590
It just would dig a hole right through your eye and scramble your brain as a

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.220
metal piece of metal

18
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.710
and they did that because you were just too annoying.
I don't know why.

19
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.520
Like people were crazy.
They would just do it.

20
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.910
They were doing them up until like 19 in the 19 hundreds and now,

21
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:09.670
I don't know if it stopped like the 50s or forties the exact time,

22
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:13.420
but what do you think they're doing now besides circumcision that people are

23
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.840
going to look back on like that and go,
what the fuck were they thinking?

24
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.360
What do you think they're doing?
No,
um,
I dunno.

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.810
It's just we keep learning different strategies to fix stuff.
Yeah,
that's true.

26
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.990
But the,
but the low bottom,
he is not even a strategy to fix stuff.

27
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:33.340
It's like chaos though.
In some cases it is.
I must have had to have,

28
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.250
but maybe it stopped them from being super violent or something that's

29
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.170
controlling.
People will probably be enough bullets.
Bullets.

30
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.460
I mean,
I don't know.
Why did they give someone a lithotomy look?
What is the,

31
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.060
what's the chief reason for giving someone a little the bottom,

32
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.810
what would you guess?
Psychosis.
Crazy stuff.
Yeah.

33
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.780
That they didn't have an answer probably for pharmaceuticals back then.

34
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:58.210
So they just said,
fucking scramble the brain somehow.

35
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.790
It's fucked up to me that it's still,
your brain would still work.

36
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.960
It's a neurological treatment of a mental disorder that involves severing the

37
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:07.750
connections between the brain's prefrontal cortex.

38
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.870
You've made it too big over here.

39
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.450
Most of connections to and from the prefrontal cortex and the anterior part of

40
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:21.000
the frontal lobes of the brain are severed.
What did they do that for Brian?
Um,

41
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.990
because when you had a personality that was when you were crazy,

42
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.650
they would take out the part of your brain,
I guess that was,
um,

43
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.610
reactive and that gives you essentially a personality.

44
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.440
So when you were at the bottom ISED you are really kind of a normal person.

45
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:41.670
Have you ever seen the movie Francis?
They gave her a Labatt me.
Wow.
Look at,

46
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:44.890
she went crazy and the bottom line,
it's a little kid.
I right the lies.

47
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.150
They did it to a little kid.
Yeah.
Horrifying.

48
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.230
Why did they do it to that little kid?
Scramble your brain.
Terrible mind.

49
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.641
If I remember right,

50
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.360
there was one guy he was doing up to like 70 a day or something like that.

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.530
That's free an hour.
Yeah.
That's what they were day long,

52
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:06.060
I think Luvata do would help you with today.
You know,
I'm reading,
uh,
uh,

53
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.220
that this Guy David,
right?

54
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.610
<v 1>Oh</v>

55
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.510
<v 0>Shit.
But there were people who,
you know,</v>

56
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:15.150
they had electric shock therapy and they were,
they were crazy.

57
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:19.000
And they would try all these things had a ton of schizophrenia,

58
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.580
which she says she has.
Yeah.

59
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:23.910
She's looking at her smiling 16 months later and they would try these things.

60
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:28.060
So before and after,
like 16,
so it worked.
The little bottom,
we work,

61
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.870
so just smile and everywhere.
Yeah.
But she would smile.

62
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:33.660
She saw a baby get run over by a car.
She would smile.

63
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.090
She saw house catch on fire.
Yeah.

64
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.570
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
