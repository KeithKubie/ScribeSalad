00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.664
Now that we know the y intercepts for these 2 equations. We can actually find

00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:09.707
out something interesting about these forms. So, here's an equation y equals mx

00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:14.487
plus b. You might have heard about it. Which part of this equation represents

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:17.655
the y intercept? Is it the y, the m, the x, or the b?
