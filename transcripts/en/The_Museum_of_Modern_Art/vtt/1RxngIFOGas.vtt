00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:14.145
- [Isabella] MOMA is
doing her retrospective

00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:18.967
as part of a series of
performance-art-focused exhibitions,

00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:22.633
and they're trying to create
a history and a lineage

00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:24.145
that hasn't really really existed.

00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:27.669
I'm really glad that Marina
is so eager to sign on

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.197
and pass it onto us and train us.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.317
- [Marina] This workshop
and exercises is a great way

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:36.268
to prepare performance artists.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.026
The idea is cleaning your own body.

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:41.710
We always used to clean the house outdoor,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.825
but indoor house never been cleaned.

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:45.221
(gentle drumming)

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:47.473
It's really interesting
to see how the performance

00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:49.589
can be present in a museum life.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.640
There will be reperformance
of five of my performances

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.459
by the young performance artists,

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:56.440
who are doing this workshop right now.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.777
- This week has been intense,
difficult, enlightening,

00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:03.260
ecstatic, and blissful.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:08.199
And at times, very frustrating as well.

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:09.086
(metronome ticks)
- [Isabella] Doing exercises

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:12.096
like a three-hour slowness exercise

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:13.966
and sleeping in the same quarters

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.345
combined with not speaking
with this group of people,

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:18.158
but being physically very vulnerable

00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:20.285
because we were naked in
front of each other sometimes,

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:22.692
and I feel like cemented us as a group

00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:26.441
in a way that we couldn't
do with five meetings

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.342
where we were talking.

00:01:28.357 --> 00:01:30.829
- I didn't quite know what
it would be like to eat gold,

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:33.957
but it was actually delicious. (laughs)

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.528
- [Rebecca] I had never eaten gold before.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:38.515
I wondered, "Could I
possibly be allergic to this

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:41.230
"or how will my body react
after not having eaten

00:01:41.243 --> 00:01:43.203
"for a few days?"

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:44.378
- [Marina] It's for me very important

00:01:44.378 --> 00:01:46.478
to be part of this workshop

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:51.378
because, I, in my own real
life, I'm not so disciplinated,

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:53.433
but I need a structure and that structure,

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:56.023
it's given by this workshop.

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.267
I really like to thank you
for doing this with me,

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:02.348
and it's not been easy.

00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:04.821
And there was moments of crisis, I know,

00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:06.945
but in the end, you've been wonderful.

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:08.384
You've done everything right.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.806
And incredibly happy and proud.
