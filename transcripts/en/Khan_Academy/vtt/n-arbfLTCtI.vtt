00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.210
So just to get us back up to
speed where I left off in the

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.740
last video, we have a bank
sitting on an asset that it

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.550
maybe originally
paid $100 for.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.320
Let's say it has
$60 liability.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.490
$40 of equity.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.570
That's when they paid for it.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.230
So this is $100.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.640
This is $60 of debt.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490
And they had $40 of equity.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.910
And these are the
toxic assets.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.570
We're just assuming
a world that only

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.360
has one set of assets.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.180
And the problem that we said
from the beginning of the

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.020
banking crisis is, that the
banks can't sell these assets

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.090
to pay off its liabilities,
its deposits, or other

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.880
debtors, for the price that
it wants to sell them at.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.200
Because obviously if they sell
this for anything less than

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.170
$60, the bank is bankrupt.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.220
So this is the bank, and it
wants to sell for greater

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.860
than-- I'll say $60.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.220
I won't say 60 cents
on the dollar, but

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.050
it's the same thing.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.560
Wants to sell for greater
than $60.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.080
While the market is willing
to pay less than

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.230
$30 for this asset.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.280
And obviously if the bank went
and sold this at the market

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.220
price and only got
$30 for this.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.540
If this whole thing became
$30, then the liabilities

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.950
become worth much more than
the asset, than the $30.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.550
And the bank is bankrupt.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.020
And so as I outlined at the
end of the last video, the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.180
current incarnation is for,
you have a public private

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.160
partnership.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.072
Let me draw their equity.

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:31.940
And let me try to draw it
a little bit better.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.980
So let's say that you have--
and I'll do the number

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.100
slightly different--
so you have $5.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.060
from a private investor.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.360
This is a review of
the last video.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600
You have $5 from the Treasury.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600
These are both the
equity investors.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.770
And then you have $50 borrowed
from the Fed.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.330
And I'm doing this a little
bit differently, so the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.160
numbers match up exactly
with what they're going

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.150
to pay for the asset.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.170
So you have $50.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.680
Let me see.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.740
So if that's $10, $50 would
be something that looks

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.360
something like that.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.030
So you have $50 that you borrow

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.264
from the Federal Reserve.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.010
And so, this entity will
have $60 here.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.545
When it gets capitalized.

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:19.795
We'll do that in green.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.040
And what they can now
do, is they can give

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.530
that $60 to the banks.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.200
Essentially paying a price that
the banks are willing to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.480
part with the assets for.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.410
And then the banks are going
to give them the assets.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.530
So now the bank has $60 of cash
that it can use to keep

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.590
its liabilities liquid.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.620
And now this entity right
here has a toxic asset,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.026
we could call it.

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:51.340
And I addressed it in the last
video, you know, why is the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.110
investor doing this?

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.100
Because they share

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.930
disproportionately in the upside.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.860
They paid $60 for this thing.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.990
And just as a real quick review,
if this thing ends up

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.590
being worth-- let's say it
ends up being worth $100.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.800
Then they owe $50 to the
Federal Reserve.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.490
That's this loan right here.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.530
To the Fed.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.670
And then they split the equity
with the Treasury.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.400
So, how much equity?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.230
There's a total of $50
of equity left.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.490
$25 for the Treasury.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.040
$25 for them, for the
private investor.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.280
So their initial investment was
$5, and it went to $25.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.880
That's awesome.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.630
Five times your money.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.500
And then in the down case.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.530
What's their down case?

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.370
Their down case is-- let's
say that toxic asset

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.480
really is worth $30.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.750
Let me draw that.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.512
And this is a review
of the last video.

00:03:43.512 --> 00:03:45.610
But it's important, because
it really bears

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.780
into what might happen.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.700
So let's say that this
is optimistic.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.576
This is pessimistic.

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:57.960
So let's say these assets
end up being worth $30.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.930
Then you have this $50
loan from the Fed.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.650
And you have no equity
left over.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.540
And the Fed essentially
is left taking

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.890
a loss on its loan.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.370
But the private investor, since
there's no equity, is

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.370
going to be left with zero.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.630
So you went from $5 to zero.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.550
But this is still a pretty
good risk/reward.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.670
Depending on how you weight
these probabilities.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.630
But a lot of people, if you
thought that there's an equal

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.950
chance of this and this
happening, you

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.010
would take this bet.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.090
If you had a 50% chance of
making five times your money,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.370
and only a 50% chance of
losing your money, the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.030
expected value here is, it would
be 0.5 times 25 plus 0.5

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.240
times zero.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.170
It would be a $12
expected value.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.130
So I would pay $5 for something
that has a $12

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.670
expected value.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.390
That's a great return.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.220
You're making 140%
on your money.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.710
You don't see returns
like that every day.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.840
Unfortunately, the probability
of these two things happening

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.400
aren't equally likely.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.160
Because obviously right now, the
market's willing to only

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.650
pay $30 for these things.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.580
The market, if they thought that
there was any chance that

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.630
these things are worth more than
$60, any chance, they'd

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.670
be trading at higher than $30.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.670
So given where the current
market is, before government

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.410
intervention, clearly no-one
thinks that there's a really

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.000
good chance of them
being worth $60.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.830
There's a much higher
probability of this scenario

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.990
occurring than this.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.900
And you could do
a spreadsheet.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.400
And you could weight
the probabilities.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.450
And if you make this probability
high enough

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.840
relative to this one, then of
course the expected value is

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.980
still going to be
less than $5.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.580
You're still expected
to lose money.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.540
And so you might say, well,
who would do that?

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.840
Even though Paul Krugman is out
there saying, you know,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.120
this is one of those heads
I win, tails you

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.970
lose type of scenarios.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.100
And that is true.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.030
In the positive scenario, the
private investor makes the

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.440
bulk of the money, alongside
the Treasury.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.120
With the Fed just getting a very
low interest rate back on

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.010
this money.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.520
While in the negative scenario,
most of the hit is

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.940
going to be taken by the Federal
Reserve with their

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.870
loan, and then the Treasury
who's an equity investor

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.530
alongside them.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.040
So that is one of these
things that Paul

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.340
Krugman is talking about.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.960
But I'd say, that even if that,
an intelligent investor,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.120
just because the risk soon.
reward is disproportionately

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.100
weighted to the other guy, they
still wouldn't want to

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.910
invest it, if this is the
more likely scenario.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.320
So the question is, who
is going to do this?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.770
And this is what I mentioned
in the last

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.860
video, could be troubling.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.560
The obvious thing is that the
banks might want to buy it

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.810
from themselves.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.510
So let me redraw everything.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.300
Because this is an important
point to make.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.050
And frankly, I don't
know how you can

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.830
prevent this from happening.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.480
If this version of Geithner's
plan ends up passing.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.800
So this is the bank's
balance sheet.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.480
Kind of their before
balance sheet.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.330
They paid $100 for
these assets.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.750
They owe $60.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.390
All liabilities, deposits,
whatever.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.460
And originally they have
$40 in equity.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.790
What the bank does is it takes
some extra money, and they

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.940
could raise equity,
or for all we know

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.760
they could raise money.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.200
I mean, the government is giving
them loans right now.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.910
This isn't fiction.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:21.200
So what you do is let's say
you borrow $7 from the

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.550
government.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.360
And this is happening.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.500
I mean, the government is giving
loans to these major

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.950
banks, to Citibank and Bank
of America, et cetera.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.960
And they'll get $7 of
cash right here.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.270
Now what the bank does is, they
create a separate entity.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.500
They can call it whatever
they want.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.920
They could put it in a hedge
fund to do this.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.850
I mean, banks are great.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.780
Special purpose entities
happen all the time.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.530
And there's nothing to stop a
bank from putting this $7 into

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.780
another entity.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.820
Another special purpose
entity.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.330
Where the bank essentially
owns the equity.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.280
And this cash went to that.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.800
And then taking this $7
and using this to

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.830
participate in the plan.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.060
In this new Geithner plan.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.550
So the bank takes that $7 that
they essentially might have

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.170
just borrowed from
the government.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.060
Participates in the plan as
the private investor.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.440
And I'll put that in quotes.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.660
And they could put a bunch of
layers here and obfuscate it.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.760
Or even get one of their hedge
fund clients to do it, by

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.480
giving them good terms
on something else.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.810
I mean, there's a million
and one ways you

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.810
could set this up.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.610
And that's why I think it's
impossible to legislate

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.059
around, or legislate
to prevent it.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.309
So they do that there.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:40.090
The Treasury will participate
side by side

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.520
as an equity investor.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.660
And then they'll borrow $86
from the Federal Reserve.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.990
That's from the Treasury.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.010
And now the bank is

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.610
essentially the private investor.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.100
They're controlling
this entity here.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.860
They're controlling entities
that control that entity.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.430
It doesn't matter.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.110
But they essentially set the
price for which this entity is

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.060
going to pay for
its own assets.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.060
So they could pay $100
for this thing.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.650
Even though everyone knows that
these things are worth

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.070
nowhere near $100.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.600
So they pay $100 for this.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.020
Take it off their
balance sheet.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.070
And then they're sitting
with $100 cash.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.740
And this is sitting there
with a toxic asset.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.200
And why would a bank do this?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.040
Well, think about it.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.010
In this reality, before any of
this happened, the banks had

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.290
100% exposure to these
toxic assets.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.420
It had this whole thing right
here, it had exposure to.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.620
And for all we know, they're
only worth $30.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.400
But the bank never wanted
to accept that reality.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.030
While in this reality,
the bank only has

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.480
$7 exposure to it.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.390
So even if this thing ends up
blowing up, who's going to

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.350
take the loss?

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.890
The bank's just going to
take a $7 loss here.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.390
And then the rest of the loss
is going to go to the

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.810
taxpayer; the Treasury and
the Federal Reserve.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.260
So this is an awesome
situation.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.730
Because in this reality when
there was a hit, if this was

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.270
worth $30 the bank would
have to take a $70 hit.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.690
While in this reality, if this
toxic asset now is only worth

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.650
$30, the bank's only going
to take a $7 hit.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.210
And the bank is going
to stay solvent.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.220
So this investment right here
is going to be wiped out.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.640
But still, the bank
got $100 in cash.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.080
So my fear is, and frankly
since there's nothing to

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.440
prevent it, it's almost a
self-fulfilling prophecy

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.830
that's going to happen.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.420
You have this big question
mark, why would a private

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.660
investor ever participate
in this?

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.280
Even if the government is kind
of giving you more of the

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.050
upside than the downside.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.510
You wouldn't participate in
it if you thought that the

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.520
downside scenario
is more likely.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.520
But you would participate in
it, if you were the actual

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.070
seller of the security.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.090
Because if you are the seller
of the security, you are

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:54.700
Citibank, you're going from
100% exposure to only 7%

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.960
exposure, and you're going
to be staying solvent.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.710
But the net effect of this is
that the Treasury and the

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.970
Federal Reserve, they got
$100 for something.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.920
Or I guess, if you take
out the $7, they

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.310
essentially got $93.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.810
Because they had to spend $7
to make this thing happen.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.100
But they got $100.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.990
So they got $93 for something
that's really worth $30.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.560
So the difference, the $63, it
essentially would be a check

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.470
that's being written from the
U.S. taxpayer to these banks.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.050
And in the magnitude that
we're talking about, it

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.650
wouldn't be a $63 check.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.020
It would be a $630
billion check.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.220
So to me, this would be kind
of the biggest travesty of

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.190
capitalism.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.870
And it would be a sad day.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.900
It would frankly just make the
AIG bonuses look trivial.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.580
The right answer is, you take
that $630 billion, make the

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.580
banks wipe out their
shareholders, and then you

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.430
recapitalize the banks
with the money.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.920
And then you start, instead of
writing the $63 or the $630

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.280
billion check directly to
the management and the

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.370
shareholders who got us into
the mess, you essentially

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.930
recapitalize the new banks.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.600
And I've written a paper
about that, and

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.580
there's a new bank plan.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.270
And distribute the shares
to the American people.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.230
And you get the same effect
without this hugely negative

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.400
repercussion of providing a huge
wealth transfer to the

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.340
very same people who
got us in the mess.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.590
Anyway, I hope people kind of
get on this story, because

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.260
it's got me pretty troubled.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.200
Anyway, see you
