00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature,
and today we're going to talk about Beloved.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.690
MFTP: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I actually like
this book.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.280
Yeah, I know you do, me from the past, because
I'm you. So you read Song of Solomon in class

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.129
the year that Tony Morrison won the Nobel
Prize and that summer you read Beloved, the

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.490
first, like, proper good book you ever read
for fun.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.000
Although in the case of Beloved, I suppose
one uses the term 'fun' loosely.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.700
So Morrison says in a foreword to the novel,
"I wanted the reader to be kidnapped, thrown

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.039
ruthlessly into an alien environment as the
first step into a shared experience with the

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.570
book's population." And that worked for you,
me from the past. You were scared and upset

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.300
and also suddenly turned on to the idea that
good novels were not just hurdles that you

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810
had to jump over in order to get a high school
diploma.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.489
Good books could also be, like, ways into
better understanding of the lives of others

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.930
and history and race and consciousness and
what the real difference is between those

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.340
who walk on two legs and those who walk on
four.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.950
MFTP: Yeah, I don't know, it was pretty good.
Wasn't that good.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.239
Aauugh you're ruining it, me from the past,
we were having a moment there.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.119
MFTP: It's just kind of confusing, like, I couldn't
figure out, like, if Beloved was a real ghost or not...?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.140
Ugh, you just have this special gift for asking the least interesting possible question about everything we read!

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.780
If you take a hard line on the question of
Beloved's quote unquote 'realness', or even

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.340
spend too much time thinking about it, you're
missing the point. I mean there are clues

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.470
in the book that speak to each perspective.
Some that suggest that Beloved is the ghost

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.299
returned in human form, and others hinting
that she is a woman who has recently escaped

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.110
sexual slavery and exploitation who happens
to just call herself Beloved.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.490
We're not supposed to know definitively whether
Beloved is really real, I mean isn't that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.799
the nature of ghosts? And it is her ghostliness
that makes her such a brilliant embodiment

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.319
of all those disremembered and
unaccounted for. Ultimately,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.720
Beloved is a symbol for the 60 million and more lost in slavery whose stories and names we will never know.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.520
[Theme Music]

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.799
So critics often call good novels, like, 'beautiful'
and 'haunting', but Beloved—both the character

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.189
and the novel—are actually haunting. For
me at least, when I'm reading this novel,

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.060
my pulse begins to quicken as I feel the presence
of unsettled wronged souls beneath and around

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.170
me. I mean, there are so many untold fates
and stories in this novel, right?

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.370
There's the 14-year-old boy who lives alone
in the woods and never remembers living anywhere

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.180
else; there are the other Pauls, the men on
Paul D's chain gang; Sethe's mother; Halle.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.980
Beloved embodies the disremembering that is
woven into life and art in the United States.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.280
I mean Morrison's story is fiction, it's full
of improbabilities and ghosts, but it's also

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.900
one of the most powerfully convincing depictions
of slavery I've ever read. Because in the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.540
process of what Sethe and Paul call 'rememory',
we're confronted with the reality of what

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.599
love looks like in a world of twisted conscience,
and we're finally left with the unassailable

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.819
resiliency of human beings to continue in
the face of all attempts to dehumanize them.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.900
"Definitions belonged to the definers, not
the defined," we read in Beloved, but in a

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.629
world where slaves were defined as inhuman—I
mean, in this story they're compared to hogs

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.760
and cattle and horses—they find ways to
humanness anyway. And that is what made slavery

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.170
untenable, not Abraham Lincoln, not Harriet
Beecher Stowe, but slaves themselves, unnamed

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.650
and unknown, who resisted and persevered,
and therein lies the hope in this very, very sad novel.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.120
So let's start with mothers. The mother-child
relationship is mythologized as, like, the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.150
most important among humans and most other
animals, but in the context of slavery, as

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.040
Morrison writes, "Unless care free, mother
love is a killer," and that is not meant figuratively.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.849
So, the central character of Beloved is Sethe,
and she was raised basically motherless in

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.879
a system of slavery that intentionally disrupted
mother-child relationships. Like baby Sethe

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.179
is fed by another woman's milk, for instance,
which is one of the reasons that having her

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.280
own milk stolen by the white men who abuse
her is so horrifying to her.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.480
Children were often sold separately from their
mothers, marriages were not recognized, and

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.200
in the era of the Fugitive Slave Act, even in freedom
Sethe's children were still claimable property.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.440
And when your children literally do not belong
to you, what does it mean to be a mom?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.760
Sethe's main mentor for mothering is her mother-in-law,
Baby Suggs, but her life has also been profoundly

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.369
disrupted by slavery's breaking of family.
In all of Baby's life, as well as Sethe's

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:25.339
own, men and women were moved around like
checkers. Anybody Baby Suggs knew, let alone

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:30.619
loved, who hadn't run off or been hanged got
rented out, loaned out, bought up, brought

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:34.619
back, stored up, mortgaged, won, stolen, or
seized.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.200
So Baby's eight children had six fathers.
What she called 'the nastiness of life' was

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.710
the shock she received upon learning that
nobody stopped playing checkers just because

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.640
the pieces included her children.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.880
So Sethe stands in this disrupted line, but
she tries to resist by holding onto her family.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.939
She gets all her children across the Ohio
River to freedom from the slave farm Sweet

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.639
Home where they were born, and she carries
one in her womb on swollen feet to freedom,

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.539
but when the slave-owner comes to Ohio 28
days later to claim them, she takes them out

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.449
back to the woodshed to kill them all before
he can take them. She only manages to kill

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.349
one, sawing through its neck. "If I hadn't
killed her," she says, "she would have died."

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.379
When explaining this to the Beloved who has
wondered into her life in the flesh, she goes

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:24.119
deeper into what she did and the intergenerational
destruction that slavery put upon the mother line:

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.339
"My plan was to take us all to the other
side, where my own mam is. They stopped me

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.529
from getting us there, but they didn't stop
you from getting here. You came right on back

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:36.869
like a good girl, like a daughter, which is
what I wanted to be and would've been if my

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:41.640
mam had been able to get out of the rice long
enough before they hanged her and let me be one."

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.220
Sethe never got the chance to be a daughter,
but she does get to be a mother, and the intensity

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.309
of her mother-love is incomprehensible to
everyone else— to her remaining daughter, Denver;

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:55.540
to her lover, Paul D; to her entire
community who ostracizes her.

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:58.469
"Your love is too thick," Paul D says to her.

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.619
He feels that she didn't have the right to
decide her children's future, to deny them

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:07.789
a future; he thinks her inhuman. "You got
two feet, Sethe, not four." But what does

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:12.960
it mean to have two feet in a system aimed
at breaking families and individuals apart,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.289
especially women, who were not meant to be
mothers and daughters, but cattle and calves?

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.099
This is made very explicit early in the novel
when it's said that sex with a slave woman

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.460
was not, for Halle, so different from sex
with a calf.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.660
To be a mother, and to allow her daughters to be
daughters, Sethe has to escape the system itself.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.740
First, for her, this means escape to the north and then, when that fails, it means escape to the other side.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:45.300
As Sethe responds to Paul D's accusation of too-thick love, "Love is or it ain't. Thin love ain't love at all."

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.220
So, what, ultimately, is the truly human
response to this oppression?

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.580
What is the proper response of the two-footed creature?
Okay, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.920
So when Beloved begins, Sethe and Denver's
house is haunted by the ghost of the dead

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:02.740
baby, and then Paul D, who lived with Sethe
at Sweet Home, arrives and in short order

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.720
begins a relationship with Sethe, rids the house of
the ghost, and takes Denver and Sethe to a carnival.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.300
And then the adult Beloved wanders into their house
18 years after the already crawling baby was killed.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.099
We slowly learn of Paul D's past, including
his horrifying time being abused in every

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:24.759
way imaginable on a chain gang, and of Sethe
and Denver's isolated life in the house they

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.550
share, while Beloved consumes more and more
of Sethe's life. After Paul D finds out that

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.700
Sethe killed her baby, the Sethe-Beloved-Denver
dynamic goes from somewhat weird to truly terrifying.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.140
They consume each other and each
others' stories, and as Beloved grows larger,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.460
Sethe grows ever smaller. Even Denver is eventually
locked out from Beloved and Sethe's mutual obsession.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.919
The novel moves among many perspectives: third-person; close in on Baby Suggs or Denver or Paul D

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:56.169
or Sethe; and then in moments, first-person
from various perspectives. And it also changes

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:01.449
tense from past to present, as if the past
isn't really past, especially to the women

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:05.709
in the novel. They cannot lock it away and
move on. Sethe's attempt to kill herself and

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:10.949
her family saves them all from a return to
slavery, but she can't escape it. As Toni

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.869
Morrison later said in an interview about
Beloved, "You can't let the past strangle

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:20.080
you if you're going to go forward. But nevertheless, the past is not going anywhere." Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.240
So Beloved ends on a somewhat hopeful note.
I mean, there's an attempted murder, but in

00:08:24.249 --> 00:08:26.629
the context of Beloved, that's actually fairly
hopeful.

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:30.679
Denver begins to care for herself and she
sees clearly both the value of holding on

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:35.120
to the mother line and the danger of holding
on to trauma. And then there's Paul D, who

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.729
once had less freedom than a rooster called
Mister, who's seen rape and death and dehumanization,

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.879
who along with his fellow slaves has been
made to feel like quote "Trespassers among

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:51.209
the human race, Watchdogs without teeth; steer
bulls without horns; gelded workhorses whose

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:56.049
neigh and whinny could not be translated in
a language responsible humans spoke."

00:08:56.049 --> 00:09:01.560
Paul D believed that to survive such a world, you
protected yourself and loved small. He picked

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:06.849
the tiniest stars out of the sky to own. "A
woman, a child, a brother?" he thinks,

00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:09.899
"A big love like that would split you wide open."

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:15.000
"Anything could stir him," we read, "and he
tried hard not to love it." But Sethe helps

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.440
him to see that quote, "To get to a place
where you could love anything you chose—not

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.730
to need permission for desire—well now,
that was freedom." And he, in return, encourages

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.440
Sethe to imagine a future, saying to her near
the end of the novel, "Me and you, we got

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.060
more yesterday than anybody. We need some
kind of tomorrow."

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.670
So in the end, Denver has learned to stand
on her own two feet and Beloved has moved

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.430
on, only after the entire community has come
to Sethe to forgive her. And Paul D opens

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:48.500
himself up to big love, to thick love, to
the love of Sethe, because quote, "he wants

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.430
to put his story next to hers." And in his
love, he describes what all the characters,

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.280
who all love each other in their own ways, do for
each other. He says, "She is a friend of my mind.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:05.260
She gather me, man. The pieces I am, she gather
them and give them back to me in all the right order."

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.480
The novel itself is a dialogue with the American
idea of itself and with the original American

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.570
sin of slavery, and it tells us something
about how to walk on two feet, not four.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.920
And yes, like any horror novel, it is revolting.
It's revolting because we are forced to look

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:26.670
at ourselves as we have been and as we still
are in many ways. We've seen this from Oedipus

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:32.450
to Slaughterhouse Five—great books can show
us the ways that man can be a wolf to man.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.950
But they also show us something of how to
go on and why.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:41.780
Morrison's genius here is in taking the tragedy
of slavery and giving it shape for us to deal with it.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.840
So often, horrors feel overwhelming to us, and
formless, and that can make them unfathomable.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.760
Near the end of the book, Morrison writes,
"Disremembered and unaccounted for,

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:55.980
she cannot be lost because no one is looking
for her. And even if they were, how can they

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:02.280
call her if they don't know her name?" But
now we do have at least one name: Beloved.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.359
