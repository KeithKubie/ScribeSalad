00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.370
Possessing a fine mind for strategy, mechanically
inclined, with true and loyal friends, and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.029
a fair amount of luck, the greatest zoo jailbreak
artist of all time, Ken Allen, was the El

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.140
Chapo of orangutans.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.109
Born at the San Diego zoo in 1971, Ken’s
early life was marked by sadness when he had

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.189
to be removed from his mother’s care, as
zookeepers felt she was on the verge of smothering

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.189
him to death.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.940
Named after two of his rescuers, Ken Willingham
and Ben Allen, after removal he became rather

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.460
comfortable with the humans who helped raise
him.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.600
Perhaps zookeepers should have anticipated
Ken’s later escapes since, even as a young

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.649
adolescent, according to the San Diego Zoo,
he would regularly unscrew the bolts in his

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.739
cage at night, roam the nursery, and then
return and put his cage back together in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.739
morning.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.789
Suspecting something was amiss, the zookeepers
ultimately caught him at this and his nightly

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.489
fun was ended.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.969
As with human teenagers, when Ken was 14 he
decided to test his boundaries, and made his

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.520
first pen escape on June 13, 1985 by climbing
up and over the retaining wall of his enclosure.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.899
Friendly and confident, Ken reportedly calmly
strolled along with patrons of the zoo observing

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.680
other animals before zookeepers learned of
his escape and were able to lead him back

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.679
to his cage, which he was seemingly perfectly
happy to re-enter.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.319
Although zoo officials feared Ken’s escape
would create a PR disaster, as he was so mild-mannered

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.460
about the whole thing, the opposite happened
and Ken ultimately became a folk hero – to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.540
the point that “Free Ken Allen” shirts
and bumper stickers began to appear, and there

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.240
was even a song, The Ballad of Ken Allen.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.569
Not wanting a repeat performance, zoo officials
beefed up security in his pen, including installing

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.009
a large moat with a massive wall to keep the
250 pound orangutan in.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.899
However, just a few weeks later, on July 29,
1985, Ken escaped again.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.599
This time, however, he decided to use his
time a bit more productively and went to the

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.040
pen holding his archenemy, an orangutan named
Otis.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.430
When zookeepers arrived, they found Ken pelting
Otis with rocks.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.770
On August 13, 1985, Ken called upon his ingenuity
again, and found a branch of sufficient size

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.319
and strength to use as like a crowbar; enlisting
the help of one of his lady friends, an orangutan

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.920
named Vickie, Ken instructed her on how to
pry open an exit using the branch.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.239
Successful, Vickie freed both of them, although
they were once again captured almost immediately.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.709
After the third escape, Ken was moved for
a time while zoo officials spent thousands

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.379
of dollars investigating his enclosure, including
even hiring experienced rock climbers to find

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.400
every finger, toe and foothold in the enclosure.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.959
Further attempts were made to improve the
design of his enclosure via attempting to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.920
watch Ken probe his pen for potential escape
spots.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.290
However, Ken soon seemed to figure out what
his captors were trying to do and simply ceased

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.599
such attempts when zookeepers were watching.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.180
In response, said individuals had to resort
to dressing up as tourists to clandestinely

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.349
observe him.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.790
Finally as a sort of general security improvement,
zookeepers ran an electric fence wire along

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.939
the top of the exterior wall of Ken’s enclosure
and turned it on.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.709
This prevented at least one escape when Ken
managed to once again make it to the top of

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.790
said wall, but this time was zapped and retreated
back into his cage, seemingly defeated for

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.790
good.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.359
Au contraire!

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.900
Ken had merely been biding his time, and two
years later he escaped when the moat’s pump

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.889
went offline, which dried it up sufficiently
for Ken to walk across and hoist himself up

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.439
and over once again.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.040
This time, according to reports, Ken didn’t
return so quietly as in previous escapes.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.239
When the fuzz came to take him back to his
home, he took off – giving the zookeepers

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.150
a bit of a fright as he was heading directly
toward the lion pens where they feared he

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.719
might climb inside.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.260
That potential crisis was averted, however,
as the zookeepers were able to catch him before

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.279
he made it there.

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.959
Seeking to distract him from attempting to
escape again, and thinking maybe he was a

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.620
bit jealous of Otis who lived with three lady
orangutans, zookeepers put four females in

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.379
with Ken, “hoping to turn his wanderlust
into just lust.”

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.870
This completely backfired, however, as Ken
recruited his new friends to join in his escapades.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.700
A few months later, two of his protégés,
Jane and Kumang, found and transformed a five-foot

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.189
squeegee left behind in the pen into a tool
to, once again, scale the wall.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.800
Jane made it all the way to the flamingos
before having to be tranquilized, but Kumang

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.060
returned to the enclosure agreeably.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.709
This was the last of Ken’s and his friends’
escapes.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.889
In total, the zoo reportedly had to spend
approximately $45,000 to make Ken’s enclosure

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.470
escape proof over the course of his escapades.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.530
Sadly, although orangutans in captivity can
live up to 60 years, Ken, only made it to

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.530
29.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.200
In 2000, he was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.090
While normally an attempt might have been
made to treat his cancer, particularly given

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.450
his young age, his case was deemed to be terminal,
so rather than put him through the difficult

00:04:42.450 --> 00:05:05.410
treatment with almost no chance of it being
successful, on December 1, 2000, he was euthanized.
