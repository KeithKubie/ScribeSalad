00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.390
When nature calls in the wild outdoors, it’s
nice to have a convenient place to do your

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.960
business. So for this project I’m going
to show you how to make a portable emergency

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.139
supply kit that could save your tush during
a natural disaster. Or at least, provide a

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.579
little cushioning for it.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.360
Let’s start this project with a 5 gallon
bucket, some heavy duty trash bags, a pool

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.780
noodle and some ultra soft toilet paper.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.510
Look closely at the handle on the bucket,
and you’ll notice that all it takes to pop

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.900
it out, is a little tug on the side.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.550
And while we’re here, it’s a really good idea
to bend the tip over with a pair of pliers

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.910
because it’ll make the handle a lot easier
to connect again, later on.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.410
Now lay the bucket down on one side and measure
around 3 fingers from the connector port,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.310
because we need to drill a small utility hole,
and this spacing should be just about perfect.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.310
I’m using a 3/16” bit, and you can see
the hole just barely goes through the top

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.440
layer, and doesn’t actually penetrate the
wall. That’s important.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.899
Now try threading the open end of the handle
through your toilet paper tube until the roll

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.880
reaches the middle. Then lock the handle back
on the bucket, by simply pushing the end into

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.260
the new connector port until it snaps in place.
Just like that we’ve got ourselves a built-in

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.579
toilet roll holder, for easy access when we
need it.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.899
Now the best way to keep our bucket clean,
is to line it with heavy duty garbage sacks.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.759
And I found some “Step Can” trash bags
at a local super center, which are a perfect fit.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.030
The ones I’m using are around 1-1/2’ x
2x1/2’ ft and will hold up to 8 gallons

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.060
of waste, which will be more than enough
to meet our needs.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.490
Push the garbage bag down into the bucket,
and secure it in place by lining the top ridge

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.979
of the pail the same way you’d line a garbage
can.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.039
The plastic liner should make a nice tight
fit, so there won’t be much chance it’ll

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.929
come off by accident.

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.499
Ok, let’s move on to making the seat.

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.279
I got an orange pool noodle from the dollar
store, and cut a piece roughly 3 ft long.

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.759
If you’re careful, you should be able to
cut a clean slit down the one of the sides

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.689
as well. And just like that, you’ve got
a nice foam padding to cushion your backside.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.669
Which should make your outdoor experience
a little more comfortable.

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:48.240
Alright the Business Bucket is just about
done. There’s just one small modification,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.139
left to make.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.849
You’ll notice that when you try to unroll
the toilet paper, it rubs on the side of the

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.419
bucket, and it’s very frustrating and difficult
to use. So to solve this challenge, we need

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:59.849
to elevate the handle, and I’m going to
do that by drilling another small hole, slightly

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.349
offset from the center.

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.659
If we use something like a small bungee cord
to lift the handle, you can see it suspends

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.459
the roll away from the bucket, which solves
the problem.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.940
Now if you don’t have a bungee cord, don’t
sweat it. You can always use an elastic, some

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.790
string, or even a wire coat hanger instead.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.870
At this point our bucket is completely finished
and ready to do business. That’s how simple

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.540
and easy it is to make an emergency Port-A-Potty.
And what’s really cool is that everything

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.440
can be stored inside the bucket, to keep the
whole system self contained and odor free.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.660
But, rather than stopping here, let’s take
the idea to the next level, with two more buckets.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.660
I found a 2 gallon pail with a lid, and a
5 quart, big mouth bucket at the hardware

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.380
store, and check this out. They’re waterproof,
which means we can fill them up with useful

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.850
supplies. I packed mine with stuff for hunting,
camping, and survival situations. And if you

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.240
pack them well, your buckets will hold an
impressive amount of equipment.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.130
For example. I included a heavy duty tarp,
with some para-cord and bungee straps, so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.700
we can make a shelter. And a bottle of rubbing
alcohol that can be used for sanitization,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.460
or make-shift camping fuel.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.440
I threw in a knife that’s got a fork and
spoon built into it, and a flashlight so we’ll

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.320
be able to use our facilities in the
dark. But that’s not all.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.850
There’s plenty of room for a small first
aid kit, and some lighters for getting a survival

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.480
fire started. And just because you can, a
pack of medical grade nitrile gloves for when

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.920
it’s time to do the dirty work.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.150
It’s truly amazing how much stuff will fit
inside. And don’t forget, the buckets themselves

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.260
are useful as well.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.170
They’re waterproof, which means you can
store materials when you’re out camping

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.200
or hunting, and look what happens when you
flip the white bucket over, and set the wide

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.340
mouth bucket on top. You’ve just created
a make-shift sink.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.240
Ok, it’s time to demonstrate how the bucket
works, and for that, let’s use a bit of

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.650
hazelnut spread and some apple juice.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.540
If you look closely, you’ll see how the
plastic lining keeps the waste contained,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.650
and is really simple to replace if it ever
gets filled up.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.390
Heavy duty bags have less chance of ripping
or leaking, and most trash bags will be able

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.210
to hold liquid waste as well, which will help
keep the inside of your bucket clean.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.600
Now speaking of clean, remember to wash your
hands thoroughly with soap and water. And

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.069
when you’re ready to dry them, there’s
a little hand towel down there as well.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.240
If you want to go the extra mile, you may
want to include a small pack of cleansing

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.750
wipes, or a bottle of moisturizing hand sanitizer.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.310
Now you may have noticed earlier, that in
my bundle of supplies I included a small gardening

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.650
trowel, and here’s why. When you cover your
deposit with a handful of leaves, and sprinkle

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.290
a layer of dirt overtop, it forms an odor
barrier that keeps your bucket from smelling

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.200
bad and attracting flies.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.019
And if for some reason you’re in a situation
where you have to use the bucket indoors,

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.609
there’s still room for an air freshener
in there as well.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.340
Alright let’s finish, up by putting everything
away.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.009
Start by tying off the garbage bag and sending
it away for disposal. You might want to keep

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.430
in mind that it is full of human compost,
and there are regulations on where it needs

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.779
to be dumped.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.439
Go ahead and load your supplies back into
the 2 gallon bucket, then snap on the watertight

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.180
lid to keep it sealed.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.060
Everything goes together if you drop the big
mouth pail in first, followed by the container

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.110
of supplies, which you should find, fit together
perfectly.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.009
Now simply pop the handle off so you can remove
the toilet paper, and set it inside the bucket.

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.169
And if you put it in the center, you’ll
still have a gap big enough to coil the pool

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.539
noodle around, and tuck it snugly inside.
Amazingly, there’s still a little room to spare.

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.680
Finish up with a lid that makes an airtight
seal, and you’ve got yourself a handy little

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.389
“bug-out-bucket”. Full of supplies that
could save your life in an emergency, and

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.489
since it doesn’t really have a shelf life,
it’ll stay water-resistant, and self contained, indefinitely.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.979
Well now you know how to use a few buckets
and some trash sacks to make a surprisingly

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.979
versatile, Business Bucket. So the next time
nature gives you a call in the wild outdoors,

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.830
you’ll have a much more convenient place
to do business.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.199
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
