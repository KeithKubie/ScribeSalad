IVAN ORDONEZ: We built Cine+
for buying cinema tickets

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.300
in an easy way.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.200
We discovered that it's
extremely difficult

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.730
to buy cinema tickets in
platforms that already exist.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.210
So that's why we wanted to
do something more simple.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.020
When I showed my family the
app, the first thing they did

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.750
was scrolling down.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.760
So they never read anything,
but they only scrolled down.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.570
So we discovered that pictures,
images are really important.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.470
People want to see
movies by poster.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.990
They relate to the content by
the first image that they see.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.350
So that's why we tried to drop
all text and wanted to make it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.550
a more visual experience.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.050
JOSE LUIS DUPINET:
The main obstacle

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.540
for creating a
business plan for us

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.320
was that we were only four
engineers that knew nothing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.140
about business plans
and how to make money.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.930
So it was very obvious to
us that if we build a great

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.430
product for selling tickets,
movie theatres were going

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.140
to throw money at us.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.870
And in our minds, it was
going to be very easy.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.560
At the end, it was not.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.060
It was nothing like that.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.510
So we started thinking
of other business plans

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.130
when we finished
building the product.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.110
Because it was very difficult
to negotiate with the movie

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.770
theaters.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.220
They didn't see us as a help.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.740
They saw us as a
competitive app.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.660
So we needed to create
something of value that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.880
doesn't involve
tickets in our app.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.960
So that made us think of other
alternatives for making money.
