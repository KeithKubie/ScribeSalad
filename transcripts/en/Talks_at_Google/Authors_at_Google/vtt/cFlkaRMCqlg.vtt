00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.679
&gt;&gt; When I ask him how he would like to be
introduced this afternoon, he also told me

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:14.710
that he is one of the world's top boomerang
specialists.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.720
Now, what that has to do with his predicting
the future -- at least he is good at predicting

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.570
what comes back at you if you throw it.
We'll see how that is useful during his speech.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.980
He's a great individual.
He started out as a peace corps volunteer

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.210
and has that kind of dedication that we know
from a lot of colleagues who have done that

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.910
as well.
So with that, I just introduce -- Jerry will

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.921
have a talk and at the end, I hope you'll
leave enough time for some questions as well.

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:48.400
Jerome Glenn: Thank you, Frank.
It's a great pleasure to be here as it is

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.200
for anybody on the planet to be at Google.
It's one of the greatest enterprises in history.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.809
Pleasure to be here.
What I'd like to do is, if anybody has a question,

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.100
ask it at the time that you want to, you know?
You don't have to wait till the very end.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.139
The Millenium Project was a very far-out idea
in the late or mid-1980's.

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:21.090
Thought was that the year 2000 would occur
and journalists would stick microphone down

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.529
the throats of various futurists around the
world and say, "Okay, tell me everything about

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:28.659
the next thousand years." or something silly
like that.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.369
And we were worried that, if we had too much
to drink the night before, we might not say

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.791
anything useful, and we may waste an opportunity
in the year 2000.

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:43.810
So the thought was, we should create some
system -- some idea -- that was important

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.650
for one generation, or one millennium gift
to the next.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.289
And the thought was to create a global participatory
think tank for humanity.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.549
There are tons of think tanks for countries.
There's think tanks for ideologies.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.249
There's think tanks for water.
There's think tanks for all kinds of stuff,

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:03.939
but there was no think tank for we human beings
as a whole.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.849
Now, you could say, "Well, doesn't the World
Bank do that?" Yes, but they do it for economics.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.360
Or don't say the World -- what about the CIA?
Well, the CIA does it for United States.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.239
But where do you go to get a picture of the
whole game?

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.019
And this was during the Cold War, so it was
not exactly an easy task.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:31.219
Fortunately, the Cold War ended when we started.
We started officially in 1996, after a three-year

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.760
feasibility study.
I don't know if there's ever been a three-year

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.109
feasibility study for anything other than
the Millennium Project.

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:43.060
And then that was -- before that was a one-year
feasibility study to answer the question that

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.660
the United Nations University asked us to
answer, which was, "Somebody must be trying

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.439
to do this already."
I mean, it's an obvious idea to have a bunch

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.090
of futurists around the world collaborating
to figure out the whole game.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.060
That's an obvious idea, it must be done by
somebody.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.849
And so far, we couldn't find anybody, so we
started it.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.439
So how do you create a think tank on behalf
of humanity?

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.280
We decided that it had to be pulled together
by U.N. systems -- you know, U.N.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.439
University, UNESCO, U.N.D.P.
But also it involved with governments.

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.960
The first funding actually came from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for the feasibility

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:28.480
study.
NGOs -- corporations -- and woe, how did we

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.230
do that?
We jumped too quickly. Be right back here.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.920
Okay.
Where's my little thing? There we go. All

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.879
right â€“
So the Millennium Project was put together

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.769
by U.N. organizations, governments, NGOs,
corporations, and universities.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.610
The idea was that, if we're going to do this
on behalf of humanity, it ought to cut across

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.450
all these institution categories.
It can't be just an academic exercise.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.519
It can't be just a political thing.
It can't be just an NGO thing.

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.829
It had to be cutting across the systems.
So we operate as what we call a 'trans-institution'.

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:11.760
Now, there's no such thing legally as a trans-institution.
We hope that we'll get some country to amend

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.910
their corporate law -- you've got nonprofit
law, profit law, and we want to have trans-institution

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.889
law.
By a 'trans-institutional law' and registered

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.490
as a trans-institution, what we mean is that
all the people doing the work, or whatever

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.210
it is -- whether it's for AIDS or ours happen
to be for the future, improving education,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.920
whatever it happens to be -- that the people
doing the work ought to come from each of

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.740
these institutional categories, but not a
majority of any one.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.300
The money should come from all these institutional
categories, but not a majority of any one.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.870
The governing body of the organization should
come from all these categories, but not a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.520
majority of any one.
And you should prove value at the end of the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.940
year in annual report or some activity to
show that you've produced value for all these

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.330
institutional categories.
Now, the trans-institution is extremely efficient

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.220
entity.
I think it will be a new kind of institution

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.870
in the future.
We've got all kinds of innovations in software,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.280
in medicine, aerodynamics, but we don't have
much innovation in institutional design.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.860
And I think this is one of them.
Because when you want to act, you can act

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.240
through any one of these categories.
When you want to do some of your water work,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.940
you can act through UNESCO, or the U.N. system,
for example.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.580
If you want to do some collective intelligence
work -- which we'll talk about -- maybe you

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.460
can act through Google.
But then you're also acted on by all these

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.419
categories.
So when the Millennium Project does work,

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.510
it wants to be influenced by all these institutional
categories and it wants to act through all

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.900
those institutional categories.
Key element here is they should be self-organizing.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.160
If I assign somebody to do it, then I got
to manage them, but these should be people

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.830
who -- One, they should be attracted to the
activity.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.690
So you can't have every corporation involved.
You can't have every government involved.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.270
It's too complex.
But those that want to play, let them self-select

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.740
so that you have enthusiasm and you get better
synergies this way.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.551
Now, we have mini trans-institutions -- not
perfect -- but mini ones around the world

00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:16.350
that are called 'nodes.' And when I use the
word 'node,' I mean an intersection of two

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.930
or more networks.
So there's networks of government players.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.710
There's networks of corporate players.
There's networks of university players.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.159
Where they intersect, we call a node.
And we have a node here in Silicon Valley.

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.690
Jack Park is a member here in the audience.
And some others in the area are working on

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.690
venture capital, software, and the things
of Silicon Valley.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.990
So the idea is, this becomes a brain-picking
system for the Millennium Project.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.000
How do you pick the brains of the world?
Well, this is our answer to that.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.630
It's also our answer to -- you hear people
talk about "Global local" all the time.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.449
This is our management answer to how you do
global/local.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.660
So that we can send a question out to these
nodes -- or these 33 nodes around the world

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.449
 -- and say, "Who knows the most about water?"
for example.

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.630
Each of these nodes -- the node is composed
of these different categories, so they can

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.139
say, "Okay, who knows the most in universities?
Who knows the most in corporations?

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.280
Who knows the most in NGOs?
Who knows the most in the U.N. representatives

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.800
here?
Who knows the most?" And then, since they're

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.729
doing it in their own cultures, they're talking
to them in Farsi or Hebrew or whatever language

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.590
it happens to be.
And they're doing the recruitment.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.330
So I'm not telling who should be in; they're
telling us who should be in.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:34.970
All right. So these nodes then is the factor
for a participatory process.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.659
They also can be headquarters for something.
For example, the tech awards here in Silicon

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:47.560
Valley was a spin-off of the Millennium Project.
And when the tech awards got going for innovations

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.941
in the five categories, we said -- some of
our players in the node here in Silicon Valley

00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:56.650
said, "Well, we ought to do something with
all these finalists in these tech awards."

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.509
So then, they help get business planning.
So it was just to get an award and some publicity

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:06.430
and applause, they now get venture capital,
business management training, innovations

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.620
from a lot of hot shots here in Silicon Valley.
But that's a contribution to the whole world.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.439
Each of these nodes is like a headquarters
for something else.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:20.969
In Mexico City, they run a similar contest
for how to address the 15 global millennium

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:25.830
challenges -- which I'll talk about in a second
 -- with high school students around the world.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.759
In Korea -- and I'll talk a little bit more
about that -- they're wanting to put together

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:33.250
a global climate change situation room.
And hopefully we'll maybe collaborate with

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.840
someone here in Google, or at least we'll
use your products in how to create a collective

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.080
intelligence for a global climate change situation
room.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.820
And if we do that correctly, that'll be something
that all the other nodes can share and maybe

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.750
the U.N. systems as well.
So this is sort of the management structure

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:53.010
of the Millennium Project.
We have two categories of things that the

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.210
project produces.
One is methods.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.730
This is Future Research Methodology version
3.0.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.570
It has 39 chapters.
More than half of the chapters have been written

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.880
by the author of the method -- or the inventor
of the method -- or someone who's contributed

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.200
significantly to that methods evolution.
It's about 1,300 pages.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.120
It's the largest collection of methods to
explore the future international peer review

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.920
that's ever been assembled anywhere and there's
not even a close second.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.270
So for those here in Google looking at future
trends and future ideas and what's next and

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.950
all that sort of stuff, here's some methods
you may want to look through to see if there's

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.320
something in there that you haven't used that
you might be able to use.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.330
The other is the state of the future.
That's the content part.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.390
And that looks like a report or a book.
It's also a management technique for us, because

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.900
I had worked for right wing, left wing, up
wing, down wing think tanks and I was tired

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.840
of the nonsense that if one think tank says
it, then another think tank says, "Well, they've

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.170
got to be wrong."
We all know that every think tank's got some

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.260
sort of value.
So we ought to create something across the

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.331
board, which is part of the evolution of the
Millennium Project.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:04.720
But one of the things that weren't being done
was, think tanks would do a report, and then

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.070
they would do another study, another report
 -- another study, another report.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.920
Or some would get together some big thing
like the Club of Rome or the inter-futures

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.130
or some big thing, big applause, and there's
no cumulative wisdom going on.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.270
There's no system to improve the improvement
of the improvement system.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.610
There's no systematic approach to that.
So we figured we would have to do a "State

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.760
of the Future" report each year.
And then, we would have to make sure that

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.390
that report is better than last year.
So what we write about water this year has

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.870
to be more important than what I wrote about
last year.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.350
So there's 13 of these things have been done
so far.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.100
So anybody can see, Is there an evolution
of knowledge and better precision and so forth,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.810
or not?
So this is our own sort of self-evaluation

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.430
tool.
It comes in two parts.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.190
One is about a hundred pages, very short summaries
of various things for people to look at that

00:10:54.190 --> 00:11:00.051
are too busy to do the academic research.
And then, the CD ROM that's got 6,700 pages.

00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:05.320
So those who want the short version, you go
to print.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.310
And those who want the details behind the
research -- What did the invitation letter

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.871
look like?
What did the questionnaire look like?

00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:16.100
What was the demographics?
all the detail behind it -- is in the CD ROM.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:25.210
So we began by saying, "What's happening in
the world that is going to become a very big

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:37.630
thing in, say, 25 years that is either not
known generally or is misunderstood?

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:42.000
What's going on? And what's that going to
look like in ten years?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.910
And what's that going to look like in 25 years?
And give us a reference."

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:51.240
So it wasn't just an opinion survey.
People had to do some work to bring in ideas.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:58.040
And we collected something like 280 developments.
And went through a long, tortuous process

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.800
of interviewing policymakers and feedback
systems.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.510
And I won't bore you with that.
We ended up with 15 issues.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.600
And our planning committee said, "That's nice.
You acted like engineers.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.410
You've identified all these issues or problems.
What about all the opportunities?

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.780
What about the good stuff?"
So the next year, we did the same sort of

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.390
process of having people ask these questions
all around the world and doing the interviews.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:25.910
We ended up with almost the same number -- 280-some-odd
developments of good things that were important

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.980
 -- either misunderstood or not known -- that
could evolve in the future.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.670
Then the third year, we put the two together
into the challenges.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:36.680
And then one of the people -- one of the planning
committee members from Finland said, "Look,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.710
stop changing please. We like your framework.
We use it in our Committee for the Future

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.250
in Parliament to do our evaluation.
If you keep changing it, it's difficult for

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.740
us."
So we haven't changed.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.670
We kept the 15 challenges since then up to
the present tense.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.580
We may still change them, but so far, we think
it's the best framework to understand what's

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.520
happening in the world.
First challenge -- and I won't go into detail

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.960
in all of these things.
There's just too much information, but you

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.710
can get it in the State of the Future.
the first -- and by the way, when I say 'first,'

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:13.120
it is not the most important.
All 15 of these challenges are important,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.790
just like your brain is important and your
heart is important and one is not more important

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.460
than the other.
But when you study biology, you know, you

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.650
get to list down the systems.
So we're listing down these systems.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.270
This is a system. They're interdependent.
If you improve one, you help the others. If

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.930
you hurt one, you hurt the others.
This is the system. This is the agenda for

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.690
humanity, but it's a system.
So don't get lost in the idea that your preferred

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.580
challenge is number six on the list.
They're all a hundred percent important.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.580
So how can sustainable development be achieved
by all, while addressing global climate change?

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.880
As you know that we probably consume more
material on the Earth since World War II than

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.190
all the years in the past.
You all know all the issues of sustainability

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.940
 -- I don't need to tell you.
We cannot continue as we are.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.730
One of the issues, though, that we'd like
more people to take seriously is this 'parts

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:08.050
per million' people talk about in carbon.
It has been discussed, Should we have 550

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.810
parts per million carbon in the atmosphere,
or should it be 450?

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:18.570
It is now about 391 parts per million, and
we already have major ice areas of the Andes

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.670
and the Himalayas and so forth around the
world going down.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.460
And that means that rivers change -- dry up.
It means that farming changes.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.660
It means, if we got mass migration coming
up, we got serious stuff.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.300
So 390 parts per million is not sustainable
now.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:40.450
To say that we have 450, to me, is a sham.
When people say it's politically -- we can't

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.450
do a better job than that politically, I'm
going, "Well, you know, nature doesn't care

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:49.650
about the politics with all due respect."
So for those of you involved in the Climate

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.980
Change Conference, I hope you hold to the
350 mark rather than the 450 mark.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.540
How could we have enough water for everybody
without conflict?

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:06.230
As some of you may know -- Frank does, I'm
sure -- over 40 percent of humanity gets its

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:16.230
water today from sources, watersheds, that
are controlled by two or more countries.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.511
And that's not necessarily so bad by itself,
but you take the next fact, and it's a real

00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:24.160
problem.
The water tables -- the water layer underneath

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.470
the ground -- on all continents are going
down and have been going down for some years.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.140
This is a very serious prescription for conflict
 -- continuing conflict.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:39.350
In China and India, what -- 40 percent of
humanity -- they're having very serious water

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.920
problems.
Our node chair in China was involved in those

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.870
water scenarios ten years ago.
And they had good case/best case/worst case/middle

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.170
case scenarios.
And in China, the water scenarios in China

00:15:54.170 --> 00:16:00.910
 -- it showed that the situation in China
would get worse the next 15 to 17 years in

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:08.230
the best case scenario.
Meaning that another 20 years, you're as bad

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.290
off as you are now, but you got a lot more
people.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:17.120
So holding political stability in China and
India -- it's going to be extremely difficult

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:23.170
just from the point of view of water -- let
alone energy problems, let alone Northwest

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:29.120
China with the Islamic situation, let alone
the rich/poor gaps going on in these countries.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.500
We -- and since I'm here in Google -- we in
the United States are living to some degree

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:41.340
in a bubble of stability, of relative peace
and so forth.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:48.250
If you look at the world in terms of what
makes instability -- list the various factors

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.930
and so forth -- and go around the world and
take a look at what's going on.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:57.450
About half the world is potentially unstable.
Doesn't mean it will go, but about half is

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.600
potentially unstable, and water is one of
the major issues on this Earth.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.400
We've got to create new forms of water.
There's all kinds of new breakthroughs coming

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.100
up.
We've got to look at all kinds of ways to

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.509
move from fresh water agriculture to salt
water.

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:16.049
If you take a look at agriculture, it turns
out that agriculture is the largest user of

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:21.860
water.
And the majority of that use of water is for

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:28.389
animals.
If you do a Google search on growing meat

00:17:28.389 --> 00:17:33.210
without animals -- or having meat without
growing animals -- you'll find out there's

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:38.559
extraordinary amount of research going on
right now to replace the use of pigs, cows,

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:44.090
goats, growing them to do meat.
We've got another 2.5 billion people coming

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.690
up on the planet before 2050.
Because of the Googles of the world and various

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.870
Internet things, we've redistributed the means
of creating wealth, which means these people

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.610
would be probably wealthier than they were
in the last 50 years.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:01.389
As wealth goes up, meat consumption goes up.
If meat consumption goes up, the water use

00:18:01.389 --> 00:18:04.961
on the land goes up.
And because there's a limited amount of land,

00:18:04.961 --> 00:18:09.759
that means the price of food will go up.
Little children need iron and protein -- as

00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:13.340
a child growing up -- for their brain to work
properly.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.919
Meat is one of the best ways to get iron and
protein together.

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:19.879
It's not the only way, but it's one of the
most efficient.

00:18:19.879 --> 00:18:23.080
People say, "Well, why not go to vegetarian?"
Okay, that's fine.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.929
But don't forget that the meat consumption
goes up in India when income goes up.

00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:31.929
So if India cannot hold it as a culture, how
can the rest of the world do it?

00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:38.570
So it seems we need to think about how we
can get protein without growing animals and

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.029
all the problems with that.
And it looks like that's going to happen.

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:46.179
There's been a lot of progress.
The first patent was filed, by the way, in

00:18:46.179 --> 00:18:51.740
the Netherlands in -- I think it was 1999
 -- six months after I gave a talk to a guy

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.190
who was from the Netherlands on the issue.
But moving from animals' production to make

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:02.049
meat to animaless production of meat, we'd
save a lot of land and a lot of water -- free

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:06.520
up fresh water.
Secondly, there's a lot of species that can

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.309
grow in salt water. A lot of plants.
Along beaches in the water, but on the beaches

00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:14.029
as well.
We can irrigate along the coastlines of the

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:18.970
world and do salt water agriculture.
That would free up also more fresh water as

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.559
well.
Now, if you can grow these plants along coastlines

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:27.490
of the world -- like the Somalis, if they
ever stop shooting each other, but places

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.500
like Somalia with baking sun coming down like
crazy.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.759
There's no vegetation in a lot of these coastlines.
It's desert areas.

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:39.080
But you can irrigate with salt water, so you
can get rid of -- not only some of the fresh

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.790
water problems with this, but one of the biggest
problems farmers have today is, "Is it going

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.299
to rain enough?" You don't have an issue of
drought.

00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:50.779
Drought doesn't matter.
You can have a drought along Somalia forever

00:19:50.779 --> 00:19:55.840
and salt water agriculture is going to have
the coastline green -- green for biofuels

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.830
 -- because algae, as you know, is the greatest
producer of biofuels by far.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.700
You can grow it like crazy in salt water and
stuff.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.370
You can have food for humans, food for animals,
and you can have paper products.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.341
And it's also a carbon sink, because your
green weed and not have it be for anything

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:10.559
else.
Anyway, these are just a couple ideas of how

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:14.980
to address the water situation.
How can population growth and resources be

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.990
brought into balance?
One quick little note on there that's not

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:23.740
being paid attention to is that most of your
population projections go up to 2050.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.730
Do your Google search to 2100 and get what
the graph looks like.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.980
It goes up to 2050 and it starts to come back
down. Why?

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.570
You have fewer -- the fertility rate goes
down, as fewer women later on having the babies,

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.870
okay?
Now, what that means is that you'll end up

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.170
with -- if those trends continue, which I
don't think they will, but we got to take

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:50.970
them seriously -- is that means that vast
majority by 2100 will be retired people.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:57.740
The social contract to handle retirement is
going up in cost around the world.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:05.190
How can you run a civilization when the majority
of people are old and retired?

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.749
I don't think that can work.
So either we got to get the fertility rate

00:21:08.749 --> 00:21:15.840
going, or we go like Japan and have a bunch
of robots, or longevity kicks in.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.379
And longevity research is progressing quite
well.

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:24.590
Some of you are probably aware of it, but
one simple, simple, simple idea is the telomeres.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.460
You know, the ends of the DNA -- telomeres.
If we learn how to manage that relationship

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.539
 -- that's a mechanical definition of aging
is, You can lose that material, you're rolling

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:34.860
out older stuff.
That's one approach.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.330
We're also finding out about how to re-stimulate
stem cells, put them back into the body in

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.059
the brain.
Maybe we can make an artificial biology, little

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:44.249
microbes that can clean out the plaque.
There's a lot of ways that are in research

00:21:44.249 --> 00:21:50.480
now.
But the long-term population problem is actually

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.159
the aging problem.
The short-term -- the next 50 years -- obviously

00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:59.249
it's the overcrowding, which then goes back
to the efficiencies, addressing these challenges

00:21:59.249 --> 00:22:03.039
very fast.
How can genuine democracy emerge from authoritarian

00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:06.989
regimes?
I'd like you to know that democracy has been

00:22:06.989 --> 00:22:10.880
 -- as you can probably guess -- a good, growing,
healthy trend.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.809
But not for the last several years.
Press freedoms have actually gone down in

00:22:15.809 --> 00:22:19.169
the last seven years.
Political freedoms have gone down -- a little

00:22:19.169 --> 00:22:21.889
bit, not a whole lot, a little bit -- in the
last two or three years.

00:22:21.889 --> 00:22:28.279
So it is not a done deal that democracy wins.
Also, it's not a gone deal that voting democracies

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:31.700
is the only form of democracy.
I mean, it seems to me we can rethink some

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.370
new forms.
Maybe some of the stuff being developed here

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.419
in Google of self-organization is a new form
of governance.

00:22:38.419 --> 00:22:42.320
How can policymaking be made more sensitive
to long-term global perspectives?

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.389
How can global convergence of information
and communication technologies work for everyone?

00:22:47.389 --> 00:22:53.110
I suppose there's a few answers in this organization.
How can ethical market economies be encouraged

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.630
to help reduce the gap between the rich and
the poor?

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.559
One thing that might be an interesting project
 -- it just ran across my mind right now for

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:05.419
Google to volunteer on -- imagine you create
a website of some sort and that you have -- in

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:10.120
a lot of poor countries, they have very well-educated
people who go and work for UNESCO or work

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.919
for the World Bank or work for Google or something
like that.

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:16.490
And they're not necessarily going back.
And they feel guilty and they give money back.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.059
There's a major activity, giving money back
to the Third World.

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:21.789
Wouldn't it be nice if they can give some
of the brain power back too?

00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:27.419
Why not do a simple, matching program between
the development needs of the person's host/original

00:23:27.419 --> 00:23:33.940
country and those hot shots in Europe, United
States, Japan, and so forth to create like

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.179
telenations?
A thought to think about.

00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:42.110
There you can use the power of the market
in developing relations as well as -- All

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.240
right, for example, let's say that you are
very good analyst on business plans.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.700
The average person in say, Malawi, doesn't
know how to do a business plan, okay?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.019
Well, maybe the development and DMAC organization
in Malawi has a little computer connection

00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:58.429
we set up some years ago, and they put in
their, "Here are some business plans."

00:23:58.429 --> 00:24:00.929
And that goes back to a Malawian let's say
working for the World Bank.

00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:04.510
For him, it's no big deal going through the
business plans and finding the mistakes, and

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.190
making some suggestions.
So the small business people in Malawi are

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.669
getting hot shot, first class, business management
consulting.

00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:13.940
For him, it's a lark. It's sort of fun.
Maybe an hour a week, he can do it.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.980
For these people, it's livelihoods. It's growth
of the country.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.820
Anyway, just think of it -- matching up the
development needs of the world through the

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:27.799
brain power of the world, and especially those
that have left those countries to start with.

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:33.450
How can the spread of new and reemerging diseases
and immune microorganisms be reduced?

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:38.690
As you may know, for the last 40 years, about
one new disease we didn't have before has

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.490
come up.
The normal model of sequencing the gene, creating

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.720
a vaccine, producing the vaccine, getting
it out -- that takes time.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.749
Even though we're down to sequencing in a
couple of weeks, very fast, it is not maybe

00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:57.740
the answer long-term.
Because if it's the case that humans are compressing

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.129
themselves into urban environments more and
more and more, and we're compressing ourselves

00:25:02.129 --> 00:25:07.950
into new forms of pollution that we didn't
have before, if we're jet-planing around the

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:13.720
world more than before, it is reasonable to
assume that the mutation and change in communicability

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.710
of serious, infectious diseases will be worse
in the future than in the past.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:24.010
And if we're going with the same old strategy,
we may not win.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.250
So another approach is -- it's coming indirectly
out of age research -- is to understand the

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.009
immune system better.
And then, understand it enough so that we

00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:37.179
can bring up the immune system to total strength,
that no matter what the agent coming in, it

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:39.509
holds it off long enough for the agent to
die.

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:43.950
So it's a temporary hold.
So imagine if Ebola or hemorrhagic fever goes

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.480
airborne.
That's a pretty nasty image of the future.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:53.730
But if you had material that could bring up
the immune system very fast, you had it like

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.580
fire extinguishers -- you know, you had fire
extinguishers in different place.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.750
You don't know where the fire is going to
be, but fire comes up, you contain it and

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.909
that's it.
Well, imagine doing that as a model for communicable

00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:07.529
diseases -- having these things around, so
if something comes up in a certain place,

00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:10.429
you can immunize that area.
You can hold the disease in that area.

00:26:10.429 --> 00:26:14.720
But we're going to have to come up with new
models of treating communicable diseases,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.710
because I don't think our current direction
is sustainable.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:24.929
How can the capacity to decide be improved
as the nature of work and institutions change?

00:26:24.929 --> 00:26:29.269
We all know that the political process is
pretty well clogged and it's awfully complex

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:33.909
and it doesn't seem to be getting unclogged.
So we need all kinds of innovations in this

00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:37.320
area.
How can shared values and new security strategies

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:43.320
reduce the ethnic conflicts, terrorism, and
use of weapons of mass destruction?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:50.330
I will tell you first of all from our experience
in doing the Millennium Project and its research

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:54.850
for the last 13 years have convinced me that
almost every nasty problem you could throw

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:58.029
out, there are some solutions.
It's a question of getting the right information,

00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:00.950
the right people, right time -- all that sort
of stuff -- and the will to do it.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.749
Most of these things I've talked about have
answers to them.

00:27:03.749 --> 00:27:05.639
You may argue about which answer, but there's
answers.

00:27:05.639 --> 00:27:13.269
Here's one that's not an easy one.
You take out the trends of artificial biology,

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:19.429
computer-aided design, and 3-D biological
printing, and the lower costs of all these

00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:24.659
capacities, you end up with the possibility
of an individual acting alone, creating a

00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:30.950
bioweapon and deploying it to wipe out an
awful lot of the world.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.320
That's not here today, but it is possible
tomorrow.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.419
How do you prevent that?
Most of the systems of deterrents are thinking

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:42.029
in terms of countries, ethnic groups, and
things like that.

00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:48.450
But what about the mentally ill person who
says, "Ah, the Bible says people were so wicked,

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.559
God wipes them out with a flood, and we start
over again."

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:53.870
Why couldn't someone come up with that same
conclusion?

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.159
Because it wouldn't need a flood; you got
other means to do it.

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:04.629
This is a serious, long-term problem to address.
And very quickly, the direction to prevent

00:28:04.629 --> 00:28:13.519
it -- not good answers -- but the direction
is, very low-cost, nano, multisensor networks

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:18.360
of nanotechnology networks -- biologicals,
radiologicals, pressure, temperature etc.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.659
so that you can start to monitor everybody
as much as possible.

00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:26.369
Every molecule change in public space wandering
direction.

00:28:26.369 --> 00:28:30.450
But that's not good enough by itself, because
 -- as you all know here -- if you could understand

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.260
something, you can digitalize it.
If you can digitalize it, you could hack it

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.999
or change it.
So that's good, but not good enough.

00:28:38.999 --> 00:28:43.529
The other is, we want to reduce the population
of crazy people who might do this.

00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:47.899
I assume all of you are not interested in
wiping out civilization, so I'm not worried

00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:50.799
about you.
You think about what percentage of the world

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:54.679
is psychotic enough that they would want to
wipe out the world?

00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:59.450
It's a small percent.
But a small percent of say in 2050, nine billion

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:05.379
people, is quite a few people.
And by 2050, that capacity I just described

00:29:05.379 --> 00:29:09.000
certainly will be around at that time.
So we want to reduce that number -- so we

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.059
can take from cognitive science, take from
learning theory, and integrate what we know

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:21.470
about how a healthy human gets evolved and
take that deadly seriously -- not just simply

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:26.649
as an education exercise, but deadly seriously
as important for all of us idealistically,

00:29:26.649 --> 00:29:29.919
but it's important.
Idealistically to take care of everybody's

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:34.080
health growing up, because it only takes one
person in this scenario, right?

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.019
So you want to reduce the numbers of people,
you want to increase the sensitivity of the

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:39.720
senses.
Those are the directions, but they're not

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.759
good answers yet.
How can changing status of women improve the

00:29:43.759 --> 00:29:48.159
human condition?
I don't know if you know it, but the largest

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:53.380
war on the planet today is men killing and
hurting women.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:30:00.119
In the United Nations, we define war as 1,000
or more deaths a year.

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:04.440
By that definition, it's the largest war.
It's bigger than the war on terrorism.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.999
It's bigger than Afghanistan.
But it's not being taken seriously.

00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:13.070
And this is an issue that's for us as a human
family to think through -- do we want to call

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.419
it a war?
I don't know if it helps or hurts, actually.

00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:21.999
But I knew that we are not -- we males especially
 -- but we as a species are not taking seriously

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:27.450
the violence toward women.
One of the fun suggestions I gave in a teleconference

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:33.759
the other day in Italy was the idea of having
martial arts as a part of the normal physical

00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:37.860
education curriculum in public schools.
And what that would mean by the time you're

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:42.649
12 years -- or 12th grade -- if you've gone
through 12 years of martial art training,

00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:49.129
you're probably a black belt or two or three
black belts, and very few men will attack

00:30:49.129 --> 00:30:54.249
a three-belt martial art master.
Now, that's not the answer to the thing, but

00:30:54.249 --> 00:30:58.750
it maybe can help deter -- just like during
the Cold War we deterred folks from having

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.760
the war.
How can trans-national organized crime networks

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.309
be stopped from becoming more powerful and
sophisticated global enterprises?

00:31:07.309 --> 00:31:13.879
If you take all the military budgets of the
world, you add them up, it's about 1.3, 1.5

00:31:13.879 --> 00:31:19.230
trillion with a T -- trillion dollars.
Organized crime is about twice that worldwide.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:25.580
I want that to sink in.
Think of the infrastructure of the militaries

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.359
of the world.
Think of the cash. Think of the personnel.

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:36.039
Think of the influence. Think of its activities.
Then double that and have it not on the radar

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:40.360
map of most futurists in the world.
It's extremely important.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:46.619
According to the World Bank, about one trillion
dollars are paid out in bribes.

00:31:46.619 --> 00:31:55.159
Let's say you knock out all the drug issues,
you knock out illegal smuggling of weapons

00:31:55.159 --> 00:31:58.909
and prostitution and various other sort of
activities, what happens?

00:31:58.909 --> 00:32:03.070
That means that that money for that activity
goes into new areas.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.190
What new areas might organized crime go into?
They might be able to buy and sell government

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:15.259
decisions, like they buy and sell heroin.
This would make democracy an illusion.

00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:21.340
We need a global, integrated strategy to address
global organized crime.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:25.500
We don't have that.
We barely have it in countries, because we

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.750
divide up the policy in different areas.
You know, this guy's working on numbers, this

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.489
person is working on illegal drug traffic,
this person's working on this.

00:32:31.489 --> 00:32:36.090
But what is the integrated global strategy?
Another task -- another challenge for us.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:40.299
How can the global energy demands be safely
and efficiently met?

00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:45.730
How can scientific and technological breakthroughs
be accelerated to improve the human condition?

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:52.539
And how can ethical considerations become
more routinely incorporated into global decisions?

00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:58.999
This is the agenda put together by over 13,
14, 15 years of various futurists and policy

00:32:58.999 --> 00:33:05.289
people around the world.
This is what we got to get done.

00:33:05.289 --> 00:33:09.200
Now, one of the first challenge in dealing
with climate change.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.820
I'm very pleased to say the Millennium Project
has been asked to help create the global climate

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:20.109
change situation room in South Korea.
We did a little study a couple of years ago

00:33:20.109 --> 00:33:24.899
on how you would create a collective intelligence
to address energy.

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:30.509
And so, we may be using that model and apply
that to the situation room being created in

00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:34.230
South Korea.
And we would invite any of the employees in

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:38.919
Google to play with us.
Because as you all know, you may design a

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:41.799
system, but when you get into it, you try
to improve it.

00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:46.869
So we hope by the time we actually put the
situation room together, it'll be a real collective

00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:49.230
intelligence that all in the world can draw
on.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:53.080
It will be a physical situation room, but
the collective intelligence behind it should

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.309
be available to everybody.
And so, we have more and more people involved

00:33:56.309 --> 00:34:00.621
in this, because this is a human family issue.
But the nice thing about the situation room

00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:05.100
 -- ______ think from just collective intelligence
 -- is that you also are taking a look at

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.690
what governments say they're doing, what the
policies are, what the gaps are, what the

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.850
limitations are, what the status is.
So that you're actually getting on phones

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:15.490
and getting arm twisters to move it.
So the purpose of the situation was to manage

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:19.110
something.
We don't have -- you can do a Google search

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:23.450
on this -- we don't have, to my knowledge,
a situation room.

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:29.179
And if you find it, I want to know it -- a
situation room to manage the global climate

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:32.870
change management issues.
We've got the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.679
Change, but that's science, research, collaboration,
with a political veneer laid on top of it.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:43.071
But where do you go to see the whole situation?
I know, you've got to go to Google to see

00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:45.500
the whole situation.
But let's -- maybe we can work together on

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.050
this one.
All right. What do I mean by 'collective intelligence'?

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:52.429
I mean an emergent property first of all.
It's not a thing itself.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:56.810
It's not all of us sitting here making decision.
I don't mean that as collective intelligence.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.640
I mean it's an emergent property.
It's something that isn't there when you start

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.930
to do it.
It emerges from the synergies among data knowledge

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:13.290
information, hardware/software experts, that
continually learns from feedback to produce

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:17.350
nearly adjusted time knowledge for better
decisions than those actions -- than those

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:21.220
elements acting alone.
That's what I mean when I say, 'collective

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.240
intelligence' -- emergent properties.
So imagine creating a collective intelligence

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.100
for climate change.
It's an emergent property and keeps growing

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.160
and improving through time.
And then you're cooking it up to decision

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.200
makers for actions, like a situation room
should do.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.620
One of the -- this is an abstract version
of maybe an interface.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:44.030
We may or may not do it this way, but this
is one of the ideas -- is that we find continually

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:47.761
that people get lost in detail and forget
the big picture.

00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:52.360
And the big picture people sometimes don't
know enough detail to make the right decisions.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.090
So this is the quandary.
So one of the things, We want to have information

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:00.240
displayed so they can always see where the
piece fits into the whole all the time.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.610
This is one of the ideas.
These may be three columns or four columns,

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.780
maybe different ways of doing the searches,
but this is one.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.630
The idea here is, How do you create a user
interface so as people do their searches -- as

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:14.390
they do their work -- they're seeing how the
part relates to the whole?

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:19.370
Another aspect of this is that -- let's say
for example, here's an information unit, or

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.100
a piece of information about photovoltaic
efficiency.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.860
What we would like is that that piece of information
is linked to the column on the right-hand

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.772
side.
First would be the overview.

00:36:29.772 --> 00:36:33.660
Let me jump ahead and come back in a second.
By overview, there's an old antique software

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.600
called CM1.
Some of you may remember it.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:41.210
There's a way if you have a question like,
"How do you make photovoltaics more efficient?

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.810
What are the three or four different categories
of research on that?

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:48.150
What are the pro and cons from each of this?
And what are the references behind it?

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.700
Why?" Because people need to see the whole
picture, but they can't be overloaded by all

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:57.170
the detail.
So this would be one kind of approach to having

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.700
an overview of an issue.
So you went back up here.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.860
So a piece of information would be linked
to its overview.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.710
Second, what are the problems and opportunities?
Where do they come from?

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:10.150
Well, we'd have groups of networks that the
Millennium Project would organize around the

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.050
world.
They would be doing discussion in various

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.720
collaborative systems, and we would be able
to identify the problems and opportunities

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.110
through that.
We'd also be doing research, What's the data

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:23.341
in forecast about that piece of information?
Are there computer simulations that you can

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.910
run?
What are the expert ratings?

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.230
We -- the Millennium Project has developed
a software called Realtime Delphites, a polling

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.840
system that updates from realtime so that
we could constantly update among experts rating

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.590
on a new piece of information as it comes
in and rank-order them, by the way, in the

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.220
display system.
What are the unresolved issues?

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:44.520
As they rate these -- if you have a bipolar
distribution, that's clearly an unresolved

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.800
issue, so it would be empirical on that.
And we'd have open, non-peer-reviewed information

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:56.380
as well.
More open -- more contemporary view here is

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:02.020
the issues-based information system that we
will probably be using.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:08.840
But the idea is to keep track of how the conversation
goes in an organized, logical structure.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.080
One of the problems with blogs is that people
repeat themselves -- it's one thing after

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.070
another, after another, after another, after
another; it's a pain in the neck -- whereas

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:21.620
this way, you would have the information being
edited if all goes well in these units -- each

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.580
is a wiki by itself.
It's going to a wiki point by itself.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.740
So that the overview of an issue is continually
updated.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.820
So it's not a database unit that sits there
dead in the water.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:36.430
It's dynamic itself.
Another is for the decision maker players.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.970
We want to be able to create some dashboards
like this, for example.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.660
So that they can know the status of a decision.
Because there's two kinds of clients for this

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.530
situation room.
One, are the people who want to understand

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.290
to know.
The other is people who make decisions.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.690
Those are two different kinds of requirements.
This is more for the paid decision makers.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.640
Like, what is a total picture on a particular
issue?

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.910
This happens to be solar power satellites.
What's the total picture I got to know in

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.270
one shot?
But then these elements are dynamic.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:11.250
They can keep changing.
My colleague in front of me -- Jack Park -- you

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.240
probably talk about this in the question/answer
period we can go into this.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:19.230
But the idea is that we want to federate all
the capabilities and have people tagging information

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.490
so that they get linked up in ways that we
didn't know were even possible.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:27.470
This is part of his idea of an emergent property.
So how could you all participate?

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:34.830
One. We'd like to talk to whomever's interested
in how we develop this situation room in Korea.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:44.140
Two. If all goes well, I hope I can get Frank
to continue to be involved in the water projects

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.070
and how Google can be involved in those scenarios
and display information systems for those

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:56.470
scenarios in the U.N. or scenarios with UNESCO.
The second is, we hope to take the 15 global

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:01.160
challenges I just went through, create a collective
intelligence for each one, and link them up.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.740
This would be a pretty good beginning of a
global brain.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:11.260
We also are teaching online courses on these
issues around the world.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.662
And I am sure that there are some new products
 -- certain things coming up in Google that

00:40:15.662 --> 00:40:18.730
we probably haven't used yet -- or know about
 -- that could make those courses even better

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.530
online.
And of course, we'd be happy to have you have

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:25.630
a sponsor.
These are the people who were behind the Millennium

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.680
Project in the past.
As I mentioned before, we get income from

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.530
different categories -- corporations, governments,
foundations, and so forth.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:38.630
And that's all I have to say.
Any questions? Yeah.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:43.990
Q [inaudible]

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:56.020
Jerome Glenn: Good. Perfecto. Perfecto.
Now, understand. Just like in your working

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.190
world, you can be overruled by somebody later
on who's got a better idea.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:07.710
But this is where I am so far on it.
Is I see like two semantic wikis in parallel.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:14.620
This one is the experts; this one is non-experts.
But they're looking at each other.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:19.089
So the people that are pulling up this stuff
in the non-expert area, they may be experts

00:41:19.089 --> 00:41:22.000
 -- we didn't know about them -- and then
they can switch over into here.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.360
So there's a relationship.
It's like a farm team for this.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.750
So if some stuff is far out over here -- no
problem -- it can be there.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:36.600
It is documenting the non-peer review stuff.
But at the same time -- my first e-mail was

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.720
1973.
I've been involved in computer communication

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.830
stuff for a long time.
And one thing I can tell you is that quality

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:49.990
as a generalization is driven out of network
systems on these collaborative group systems,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.810
because you have somebody comes in, "Wow,
this is great.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:55.360
I can improve my future, my career.
I'm going to come in here and hang out with

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.820
these hot shots."
And they say now, "What do you mean by a search

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:04.371
engine?" And we go like, "Who let him in the
door?" And then, eventually, the hot shots

00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:07.840
start to leave out.
So we want to figure out how to solve that

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:13.850
problem, because we really want to have top
brains in collaboration that haven't necessarily

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:20.680
been collaboration before for whatever reason.
But we wanted them to be able to work together

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.040
without having a lot of noise.
At the same time -- we all know -- good ideas

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.150
come out of left field, right field, up field,
down field, right?

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:32.240
So my answer so far -- until you or somebody
else comes up with a different approach -- is

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.040
to have two parallel systems, but have them
inform each other and federates so that there's

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:42.330
information can actually cut across.
But you don't ask the expert to read 50 e-mails

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.940
a day.
He'll leave.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.910
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.850
Q [inaudible]

00:42:49.850 --> 00:43:05.710
Jerome Glenn: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, little
detail.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:10.610
We've got about 1,400 pages on the 15 challenges
already.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:16.730
So yes, we'll start with a lot of stuff that
we've done over a bunch of years and sort

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:23.020
of like chumming the waters to begin with.
Yeah. No. We would dump what we have in the

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.300
system.
And that would grow very rapidly I am sure.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:30.880
Q [inaudible]

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:42.180
Jerome Glenn: Oh. Well, we've passed the recommendation
point.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:50.490
We've already been contracted. We will do
it.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:54.790
I just -- we haven't -- as a matter of fact,
right after this talk, some of the players

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:58.970
will be meeting near NASA Ames, and we're
going to be going through some of the implementation

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:04.160
steps.
So it's not that we're recommending -- we'll

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.760
be recommending to ourself how to do it.
The Korean organization has already said,

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.900
"We want you to do it."
They have seen our previous ideas.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.990
They saw the genus model.
You saw the opening slide there that have

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:20.330
already got the political people done.
So to do it or not to do it, we're past that.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:24.220
Now the question is, "How?"
Now, we've had a plan -- we have ideas, but

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.861
that doesn't mean that's what it's going to
be a year from now.

00:44:25.861 --> 00:44:28.860
I mean, we bring together a bunch of hot shots,
they're going to out-think each other.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:35.920
So we're going to be growing as we go along.
But we're starting with -- I guess maybe part

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:41.350
of your question is -- we have a initial planning
committee that we're working with.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:46.270
And we will start cranking out the software,
putting the stuff in, having the meetings,

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:48.970
changing and so forth.
So we're right now at the beginning start

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:55.490
up of it.
That's one of the good things about the timing

00:44:55.490 --> 00:45:03.401
today.
[pause] Okay? Thank you very much.

00:45:03.401 --> 00:45:03.580
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
