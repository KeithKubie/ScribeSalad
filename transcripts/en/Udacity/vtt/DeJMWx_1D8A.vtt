00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.973
Now that we've sorted out the different definitions for each type of

00:00:02.973 --> 00:00:06.634
intelligence. I want you to try to match different professions that would

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:10.980
really benefit from somebody who's highly intelligent in one of these areas.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.772
Here's a list of professions. Athlete, dancer, mechanic carpenter, navigator,

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:21.400
pilot, architect, sculptor, botanist, ecologist, biologist, psychologist,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.988
politicians, writers. People who live contemplative lives such as rabbis,

00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:36.064
priest or monks or musicians, song writers and dancers. Scientists, engineers,

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:42.388
accountants. Poets, writers, lawyers, politician and speech writers. Match each

00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:46.418
type of intelligence with a group of professions that you think would benefit

00:00:46.418 --> 00:00:52.262
most from being highly intelligent in this area. Now I know some of them come

00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:56.575
up twice so, for example dancer comes up twice here. But, look at the ones

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:00.930
around it. And taken as a group, what type of intelligence do you think would

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.159
be best?
