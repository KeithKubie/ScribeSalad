00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.254
- [Tutor] So I've got
a binomial variable X

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:05.320
and I'm gonna describe
it in very general terms,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.737
it is the number of successes

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.940
after n trials,

00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:14.561
after n trials,

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.998
where the probability of success,

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.766
success

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:28.691
for each trial

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:34.613
is P and this is a reasonable way

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:40.366
to describe really any
random, any binomial variable,

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.287
we're assuming that each of
these trials are independent,

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:45.110
the probability stays constant,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.697
we have a finite number
of trials right over here,

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:50.388
each trial results in either

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:52.365
a very clear success or a failure.

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.095
So what we're gonna focus on in this video

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:57.117
is well, what would be the expected value

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:59.117
of this binomial variable?

00:00:59.117 --> 00:01:01.617
What would the expected value,

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:04.538
expected value of X

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:07.235
be equal to?

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:10.383
And I will just cut to the
chase and tell you the answer

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:13.555
and then later in this video,
we'll prove it to ourselves

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:15.546
a little bit more mathematically.

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:18.033
The expected value of X, it turns out,

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.361
is just going to be equal
to the number of trials

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.438
times the probability of
success for each of those trials

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:26.787
and so if you wanted to make

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:28.643
that a little bit more concrete,

00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:30.143
imagine if a trial

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.249
is a Free Throw,

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.566
taking a shot from the Free Throw line,

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.899
success, success

00:01:40.246 --> 00:01:43.143
is made shot, so you
actually make the shot,

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:46.019
the ball went in the basket,

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:49.777
your probability is,
use this yellow color,

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:52.297
your probability, this would
be your Free Throw percentage,

00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:55.047
so let's say it's 30% or 0.3

00:01:56.694 --> 00:01:58.334
and let's say for the sake of argument,

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:02.242
that we're taking 10 Free
Throws, so n is equal to 10,

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:04.698
so this is making it
all a lot more concrete,

00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:08.714
so in this particular
scenario, your expected value,

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:12.881
your expected value, if X is
the number of made Free Throws,

00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:15.747
after taking 10 Free Throws

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:18.545
with a Free Throw percentage of 30%,

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:21.307
well, based on what I just told
you, it would be n times p,

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.873
it would be the number of trials

00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:27.045
times the probability of success
in any one of those trials,

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:30.727
times 0.3, which is just going to be,

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:32.557
of course equal to three.

00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:35.246
Now does that make intuitive sense?

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:36.956
Well, if you're taking 10 shots

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.587
with a 30% Free Throw percentage,

00:02:38.587 --> 00:02:39.780
it actually does feel natural

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.086
that I would expect to make three shots.

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.741
Now with that out of the way,

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:47.626
let's make ourselves feel
good about this mathematically

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.725
and we're gonna leverage some

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:51.847
of our expected value properties,

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:54.044
in particular, we're
gonna leverage the fact

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:56.356
that if I have the expected value

00:02:56.356 --> 00:02:59.664
of the sum of two
independent random variables,

00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:03.083
let's say X plus Y, it's going to be equal

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:07.474
to the expected value of X
plus the expected value of Y,

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:10.636
that we talk about in other videos

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:13.365
and so assuming this right over here,

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:16.525
let's construct a new random variable,

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.909
let's call our random variable Y

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.180
and we know the following things about Y,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.347
the probability that Y is equal to one

00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:28.706
is equal to p

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:34.778
and the probability
that Y is equal to zero

00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:36.695
is equal to one minus p

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:41.826
and these are the only two
outcomes for this random variable

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:45.052
and so you might be seeing
where this is going,

00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:46.736
you could view this random variable,

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:48.977
it's really representing one trial,

00:03:48.977 --> 00:03:51.289
it becomes one in its success,

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.644
zero when you don't have a success

00:03:53.644 --> 00:03:57.315
and so you could view our
original random variable, X

00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:00.065
right over here as being equal to

00:04:01.687 --> 00:04:05.799
Y plus Y and we're gonna have 10 of these,

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.966
so we're gonna have 10 Ys,

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:13.369
in the concrete sense, you
could view the random variable Y

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:15.694
as equaling one, if you make a Free Throw

00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:18.584
and equaling zero, if you
don't make a Free Throw,

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:21.053
it's really just representing
one of those trials

00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:24.202
and you can view X as the
sum of n of those trials,

00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:26.706
well now actually, let
me be very clear here,

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.366
I immediately went to the concrete,

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:30.395
but I really should be saying n Ys,

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.827
'cause I wanna stay
general right over here,

00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:34.077
so there are n,

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.328
n Ys right over here,

00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:40.163
this was just a particular example,

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:42.710
but I am going to try to stay general

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.845
for the rest of the video,

00:04:43.845 --> 00:04:45.407
because now we are really trying

00:04:45.407 --> 00:04:48.278
to prove this result right over here,

00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:52.486
so let's just take the
expected value of both sides,

00:04:52.486 --> 00:04:54.227
so what is it going to be?

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.060
So we get the expected value of X,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.693
of X is equal to

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:04.808
well, it's the expected
value of all of this thing,

00:05:04.808 --> 00:05:06.457
but by that property right over here

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.587
is going to be the expected value of Y

00:05:09.587 --> 00:05:12.130
plus the expected value of Y plus,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.149
and we're gonna do this n times,

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:16.660
plus the expected value of Y

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.092
and we're gonna have n
of these, so we have n

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:24.802
and so you could rewrite
this as being equal to,

00:05:24.802 --> 00:05:27.370
this is our n right over here,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.620
this is n times

00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.071
the expected value of Y.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.959
Now what is the expected value of Y?

00:05:38.515 --> 00:05:39.591
Well, this is pretty straightforward,

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.073
we can actually just do it directly,

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:44.018
the expected value of Y, let
me just write it over here,

00:05:44.018 --> 00:05:46.479
the expected value of Y

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.942
is just the probability-weighted outcome

00:05:47.942 --> 00:05:50.047
and since there's only two
discrete outcomes here,

00:05:50.047 --> 00:05:51.457
it's pretty easy to calculate,

00:05:51.457 --> 00:05:55.707
we have a probability
of p of getting a one,

00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:57.707
so it's p times one plus

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:03.114
we have a probability of one minus p

00:06:03.114 --> 00:06:04.785
of getting a zero,

00:06:04.785 --> 00:06:06.467
well, what does this simplify to?

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:07.984
Well, zero times anything, that's zero

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:11.553
and then you have one times
p, this is just equal to p,

00:06:11.553 --> 00:06:13.776
so expected value of Y is just equal to p

00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:17.113
and so there you have it, we
get the expected value of X

00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:18.809
is 10 times the expected value,

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.132
or the expected value of X is n

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:22.967
times the expected value of Y

00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:25.203
and the expected value of Y is p,

00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:28.703
so the expected value of X is equal to np,

00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:32.063
hope you feel good about that.
