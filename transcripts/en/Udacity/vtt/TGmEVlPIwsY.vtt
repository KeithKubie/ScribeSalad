00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.130
Today, we'll talk about constraint propagation, another very drawn out purpose

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.240
method. Constraint propagation is a mechanism of influence where the agent

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.860
assign values to variables to satisfy certain conditions called constraints.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.950
It is a very common method in knowledge-based AI, and there are a number of

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.460
different topics, such as planning, understanding, natural language processing,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.200
visual spatial reasoning. Today, we'll start by defining constraint propagation.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.410
Then we'll see how it helps agents makes sense of the world around it.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.000
Our examples will come mostly from understand natural language sentences,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.230
as well as visual scenes.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.600
Finally, we'll talk about some advanced issues of constraint propagation.
