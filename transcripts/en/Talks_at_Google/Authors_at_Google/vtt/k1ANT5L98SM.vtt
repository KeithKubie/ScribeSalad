00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt; Today, I'd like to introduce you to Joshua
Green who has co-authored a book with Jean

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.800
Burgess titled "YouTube: Online Video and
Participatory Culture."

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.230
Josh is a postdoctoral research fellow in
the Comparative Media Studies Program at MIT.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.830
And he is the research manager of the Convergence
Culture Consortium which is a research project

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.320
at MIT that provides strategic insight into
the contemporary media landscape for a range

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.460
of industry partners.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.930
Joshua's work focuses on new forms of television
and online video and participatory culture.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.860
And this book represents the first large-scale
survey of YouTube's content, structure and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.860
uses.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.859
So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce
Dr. Josh Green.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.550
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Thanks.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.239
Good day.

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.920
So, thanks for coming.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.319
My name is Joshua Green.

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.880
I'm going to talk about YouTube and I suppose,
you know, sort of speak up-â€“talk about the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.609
book that a colleague and I completed quite
recently.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:04.809
This is a collaboration between my research
group at MIT and Jean Burgess who is a very

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.799
old friend of mine who works at QUT in Brisbane.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:15.780
And this is an attempt to sort of grapple
with how we understand what YouTube is.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.700
We both work in the field of media studies
and cultural studies.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.400
And what we are intrigued about and what we
were trying to understand with this project

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.329
is: How do we contextualize this new thing--this
sort of blip on the landscape that seems significant?

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.320
How do we make sense of YouTube when it itself
is an incredibly complex object.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.630
How do we come to terms of what it's being
used for?

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.210
And how do we locate it within the kind of
discourses around the evolution of participation

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.530
online, the future of media and all of the
other things that YouTube is wrapped up with.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.220
And so what we did with this book and what
I'll talk about today somewhat briefly is--you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.270
know, we sort of--we asked these very--three
very simple questions: What is YouTube?

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.630
How do we make sense of it?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.200
And what ultimately are the implications of
YouTube?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.090
And, of course, these things end up being
kind of more complex.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.510
So the answers to these questions are more
complex and the questions not as simple as

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.780
we thought they might be.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.550
What we wanted to do with this project was
to push together two methodologies.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.250
We come from a media and culture studies background
which traditionally is small-scale, deep investigation,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.830
and rich interpretation of text.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.370
When you're dealing with something like YouTube,
there is a tendency to explore YouTube in

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.870
order to prove whatever it is that you might
be interested in.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.730
So, what we wanted to do was rather than look
for particular types of content or particular

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.790
types of uses on YouTube and then extrapolate
out from there and say therefore YouTube is

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.549
for political engagement or YouTube is for
cat videos, what we wanted to do was to instead

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.569
try and get a sense of the scope of YouTube,
and then try and understand how the different

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.000
bits of it work together and then sort of
mix the range of content across it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.629
And this requires a methodological innovation
that I'll talk about later.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.040
But sort of at the core of these two activities,
one was an attempt to locate YouTube within

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.939
the competing discourses that come to define
it--so, within the popular press, within the

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.880
sort of the political experience, within the
debate around activism, around media culture,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.269
around advertising, around new modes of participation.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.590
And the other thing we did was draw together
a sample of north of 4,000 videos that were

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.569
defined as most popular, and that's where
we get to some of the politics of the work

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.690
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.020
Looking at YouTube, YouTube presents us with
an opportunity to confront some of participatory

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.610
culture's most pressing problems.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.879
You know, looking at YouTube, we can engage
with questions around the unevenness of participation

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.040
and voice in this kind of democratized new
age.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.409
We can look at the apparent tensions that
emerge between commercial interests and public

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.409
good.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.860
YouTube is simultaneously, you know, a big
commercial system and also it's a repository

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.560
for our popular culture.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.860
You know, we can look at the contestation
of ethics and social norms that occurs as

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.650
belief systems clash together, you know, because
YouTube supports that sort of stuff, the way

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.400
the interests and culture differences collide
on a space that tries to support all of these

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
diverse uses.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.620
In later chapters, we focused on some of the
norms, of the most important new debates around

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.430
the creative industries, about new media,
of the new economy, issues about user-led

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.900
innovation, amateur production, questions
of labor, and the apparent tensions between

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.590
global connectedness and commercial monopolies.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.490
And so what I want to do is start by addressing--sort
of locating YouTube and starting with the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.870
very simple question which is where we started
and that is: What is YouTube?

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.900
And this becomes an increasingly complex question
because YouTube is not a singular thing.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.810
My background is in studying television.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.180
This is a quote from a guy working in the
UK called Stephen Heath.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.000
And in 1990, he was writing a chapter in a
book where he tried to define what television

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.710
is, and he goes through a range of different
ways to try and understand what television

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.840
is before coming up with the ultimate conclusion
that television is an unstable object.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.569
Depending upon how you look at it, television
changes its constitution.

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.669
You know, and so what makes television an
unstable object are the speed of its changes--if

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.410
we think about the broadcast era, every day,
there was a new version of television reinvented

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.020
for us.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.180
It has this interminable flow of content.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.710
It's very difficult to stop television and
look at it.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.660
Because if you stopped at any one minute,
you're only looking at the television from

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.680
that instance, and this becomes increasingly
more complex when we look at television across

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.830
national systems.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.389
And, finally, Heath argues it's the kind of
quantitative everydayness.

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.050
So the fact that television is this really
simple, domestic thing that is in our lounge

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.300
rooms that we don't think about a lot that
makes it an unstable object--means it's subject

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.610
to all these different definitions.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.870
You know, in the great respect, I think this
comes to define YouTube as well.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.210
You know, we can think of YouTube as a thing
but a fundamentally unstable thing.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.310
And so we know a few things about it.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.310
You know, it is massive.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:23.220
You know, these are the recent figures: You
know, it's got a 40% market share and, of

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.330
course, YouTube is rolled into Google sites.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.419
When we look at comScore Matrix, there is
a 40% market share of video streams in the

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:32.419
US.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.960
What's really significant is the next largest
player, you know, regularly commands only

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.550
a 3.7% market share.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.260
When we look at in terms of overall streams
served--YouTube is quite clearly on the Google

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.660
sites--quite clearly the thing that looks
like Pac-man.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.979
You know, and even if--and there are all of
these questions at the moment around: the

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.979
veracity and the reliability of video metrics.

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:02.750
But, you know, even if hulu is making--gaining
ground in terms of minutes served, YouTube

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.710
and the Google sites simply outstrip everyone
in terms of the shear amount of content delivered.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.190
You know, the same time, YouTube is wrapped
up in these discourses around what it means

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.889
to participate in participatory culture.

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:21.919
When Time decided that "You" were the person
of the year, they chose to represent "You"

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:22.919
as YouTube.

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.300
You know, I mean, it's--ultimately, they're
not saying YouTube is the person of the year.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.710
I don't want to beat up on Time here.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.490
You know, but the image, you know, and the
kind of iconic representation of "You" that

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.652
Time gives us is the YouTube kind.

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:40.919
You know, the prospect of broadcasting yourself
comes to define or is an easy shorthand for

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.080
what it means to participate in participatory
culture.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.340
And this is particularly interesting when
just as of last week or the week before, Time

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.970
names YouTube as one of the ten greatest technological
failures.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.600
And so on the one hand, you know, it's representative
or iconic of the potential of participatory

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600
culture.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.889
On the other hand, it can be, you know, seen
as a failure.

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.580
YouTube is a cultural archive.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:11.879
You know, it's possible to run out of nostalgic
moments to watch on YouTube before you have

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.699
even scraped the surface.

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:17.759
So these are--and this is actually a work
of my coauthor--these are three of her favorite

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.759
moments.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:22.610
You know, and these are kind of iconic moments
in the history of Australia or rather in her

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.509
recollection of what it means to be Australian.

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:31.740
At the same time, it is this platform for
incredibly diverse range of activities whether

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.630
it's something like showing off--so just how
well and how kick-ass are your skills on the

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:43.890
Guitar Hero, whether it's just instructional
video--the one up on the left is Depression

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.630
era cooking; so it's someone interviewing
their grandmother who is talking about what

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.030
it was like to grow up in the Depression which
is, of course, somewhat salient in the kind

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.030
of economic climate.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:58.260
You know, it supports these debates: the atheist
versus creationist debate--or the evolution

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.660
versus creationist debate is something that
rages long and long on YouTube.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.760
And it's also this space where you can run
into beautiful things.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.910
And as Jean likes to say--you know, the last
video on the bottom left-hand side is a love

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:17.530
song about Mario from Mario Brothers, you
know, and his pining love for Princess Peach;

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.460
and it's one of the most beautiful things
you will ever hear.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:29.000
It's also this site for innovation and this
is a recent project that is one of my favorite

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.740
uses of YouTube.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.740
Okay.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:49.600
Clips of music or the music instruments in
and of itself--so by going and sampling and

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:57.140
the grabbing and editing together, all of
these little public performances, you can

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.300
use YouTube and play it as if equal with some
other instruments.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.470
It is, you know, it is a mean-factory.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:11.760
You know, YouTube both helped us to understand,
you know, the viral video and likewise has

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:18.730
served a substantial number of those; many
of which, as in the case of "keyboard cat"

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.980
and [INDISTINCT], you know, all four of them,
get reversioned and rearticulated.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.200
As YouTube becomes--is a generative space,
and people come to it in order to reuse the

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.210
materials there in order to produce something
else.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.830
At the same time, YouTube is a platform for
the distribution of professional content.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.580
And if we look at the channels which are most
viewed, you know, we see along the top row

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.380
particularly a number of large--what we refer
throughout the book as traditional media producers.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.690
And we'll talk a little bit later about the
significance of music on YouTube.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.400
And this is something that the company itself
is pursuing, you know, particularly within

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.400
the US; and there is a range of politics around
that.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.130
You know, as the company looks, you know,
for that efficient monetizable model, you

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:11.220
know, it's increasingly presenting itself
as a space that can serve in-depth ways--professional

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.140
media produces.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.920
YouTube is wrapped up in discourses of concern.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:23.530
You know, the girl fight videos struck a particular
court in the UK particularly where YouTube

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:32.740
was implicated in the creation of cyberbullying,
in the destruction of classroom behavior.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.730
YouTube is also implicated in the death of
TV advertising.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:42.820
When WIRED wrote about the lonelygirl15 experience,
what I find so interesting about this cover

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.620
is that right up the top, you know, right
next to YouTube, they talked about the potential

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:53.110
or they implicated the potential, death of
TV advertising, even though what we saw was

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.800
an experiment in participatory culture and
online video by a bunch of film makers.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.320
But thinking about these things helps us think
about how we are reinventing, you know, the

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.740
broadcast media space.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.950
And the recent PRS debate around licensing
fees in the UK, you know, points to the way

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.520
that perhaps YouTube is being implicated in
the future of music as well.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.310
And so here we have this thing, and these
are only some of the ways that we can think

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.510
about it.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.120
I think what's significant when we're trying
to work out what YouTube is is that we realize

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.060
that YouTube itself was undetermined.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.640
When it was invented in 2005, it was launched
with incredibly humble origins.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.440
You know, it was a start-up by three former
PayPal employees, you know, who are looking

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.570
for an easy and free way to upload and publish
videos to the Web which, you know, at that

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.930
time, was something that haven't quite been
cracked yet.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.810
YouTube was one of a number of sites, many
of which looked pretty much the same.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:52.170
And there's an interesting TechCrunch article
from 2005 that compares at the time the leading

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:57.390
online video sites under the mantle, under
the header--sorry--which will be the Flickr

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.400
for video.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.730
You know, so what it was that YouTube was
trying to be was not quite determined.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.350
And I think this is apparent in the fact that--I
mean, this is a--at the back there is a screenshot

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:14.060
from the Wayback Machine's version of the
YouTube site from 2005.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.800
Perhaps it was about online dating.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.600
Perhaps that was the way, you know, that the
site was going to make its money.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.180
It was about social networking.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.320
So sharing your videos, you know, affected
or achieved a technological need.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.380
You could pass this content on to somebody
else.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.550
But how are we going to make it payroll?

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.110
Maybe people will come to it so they can meet
other people.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.690
And if we look at the very, very first video
that was ever uploaded to YouTube, I think

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:42.731
we get a sense of both the uncertainness about
the medium itself when it was launched, but

00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:46.320
also the inherent ordinariness with which
YouTube launched.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.320
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320
So here we are with one of the elephants.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:14:07.150
A cool thing about these guys is that they
have really, really, really long tusks; and

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.150
that's cool.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.150
And that's pretty much all there is to say.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.150
&gt;&gt; GREEN: So that's "Me at the zoo" which
is the first video.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.390
And I think it capitalizes--crystallizes,
draws together many of the ways many things

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.360
we think about that is wonderful about YouTube.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.300
So the argument that we pursue in the book
is that what YouTube has become now is the

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:26.880
result of a process that puts and others refer
to as consumer co-creation, that ultimately

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.790
YouTube is the thing that is it not because
of some kind of deft design, but because it

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:41.700
was a platform that was produced by the activities
and the implications of a large range of ultimately

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.480
consumers, participants within the space.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.040
And so the site's value, what it has turned
out to before, has been co-created by YouTube,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.890
Inc. which is now owned by Google.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.100
And the users who upload their content to
the Web site--the audiences who engage around

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.930
that content and this group of contributors
is incredibly diverse.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.850
And we have large media producers and rights
signers, you know, we have small to medium

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.470
enterprises who are looking for cheap distribution
or alternatives to broadcast channels.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.990
We got cultural institutions.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.020
We've got artists.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.020
We've got activists.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.510
We've got media literate fans.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.130
We've got nonprofessional and amateur media
producers.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:23.050
You know, each of these participants, along
with YouTube Inc., approach YouTube with their

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:28.950
own purposes and their own aims; and, collectively
and collaboratively, or rather, collectively,

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.770
they shape YouTube as a dynamic culture system
however imperfectly realized it may serve

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.270
any of these groups.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.850
And many of these groups are substantially
disappointed with YouTube along the way.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.850
Sometimes, it's great.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:41.910
Sometimes, it fails them outright.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.570
You know, sometimes, they can monetize their
content; sometimes, they can't.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.180
Sometimes, they can engage with other fans;
sometimes, they can't.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.280
Sometimes, they get stuff pulled down and
they don't understand why and, sometimes,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.280
they don't.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.420
You know, sometimes, it is this wonderful
things for all of these users; and, sometimes,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.990
it comes up short.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.270
And what I think is so interesting about this
is that what YouTube has become has been a

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.760
result of the participation of all of these
users even if they all don't realize that

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.180
they're all participating in the space at
the same time.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.770
I think they all treat it as if it's a space
designed for them or a space that has the

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.130
potential for them to achieve their goals.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:21.130
But, at the same time, it's supporting such
a diverse range of users that what it can

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.690
be can only be determined by the kind of pulling
and stretching that comes from the relationship

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.610
of all these groups which places a problem
then if we're trying to make sense of it.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:36.470
If we're trying to appreciate its size, its
scale, its shape, what it could be used for,

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.480
what its potentials might be, what its ultimate
value might be, you know, this diverse range

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.300
of uses and users is kind of a speed bump.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.860
And so we perhaps foolishly thought we could
solve this problem or perhaps we could at

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:56.490
least come about it; and we did so soon after
we started this project, soon after Viacom

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.110
launched its legal action against YouTube.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:04.320
Actually, this was incredibly motivating for
us because Viacom's claim was--and you'll

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.240
have to excuse me if I don't get the nuance
of it right--but Viacom's claim was, you know,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.060
that the most popular content that drives
the value of this site is ultimately produced

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.270
by large content producers.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:21.810
It's only to the realm of the claim I think
speaks to "where does the value come from"

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.130
and "what is most valuable."

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:29.290
And these claims struck us as strange because
it seems to approach YouTube in a particular

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.290
way.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.940
And so, to a certain extent, we wanted to
test that.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.690
But, really, what we were looking to try and
do was to understand how we can understand

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:41.400
popularity on the site, because that seems
to be at the heart of much legal action against

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400
YouTube.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.260
And there a lot of interesting ways to try
and understand popularity and there's a lot

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.640
of very good work--work like this that maps
over time, say, user-generated videos and

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.060
their life cycle, the number of views, how
long between when they're uploaded, when did

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.830
they peak, when did they stop slipping into
the tail.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:02.300
And, you know, this is a great robust way
to approach YouTube.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.780
It didn't satisfy us however because we're
not entirely sure how an approach like this,

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.940
you know, that runs bots on the side and that,
you know, works principally with YouTube's

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.140
nano data can account for videos like this.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.170
&gt;&gt; I'm into nuggets, ya'll.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.190
I'm into nuggets, ya'll.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.220
I'm into nuggets, ya'll.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.240
I'm into nuggets, ya'll.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.780
McNuggets, McNuggets, McNuggets, McNuggets,
McNuggets, McNuggets.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.050
Ketchup with mayo.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.320
Ketchup with mayo.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.580
Ketchup with mayo.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.580
What?

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.880
McNuggets, McNuggets, McNuggets, McNuggets,
McNuggets, McNuggets.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.390
Chicken McNuggets.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.030
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Now, this is my favorite video on
YouTube of all time.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.950
And it's my favorite video because this is
a video that I think we can see as a kind

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.260
of coalescence of many of these issues.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:02.410
But this video that we've just watched there
is ultimately an ad, a commercial for McDonalds.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.760
It runs for 30 seconds.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.240
It's great on television.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:12.700
It opens but with this proclamation that what
we're watching is actual user-generated content.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.750
And, to a certain extent, we are, right?

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.920
The rap was uploaded to YouTube independent,
you know, of the McDonalds campaign.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.790
It was spotted by a transporter at New York
who negotiated a relationship between these

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.280
two fellows and McDonalds.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:34.010
McDonalds then, you know, took it, cut in
the title cards about how many McNuggets you

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.750
could get for a dollar, and then, you know,
put it on television.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.920
So, at what point, does this stop being user-generated
content, become commercial content?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.990
At what point does this exist as commercial
content and not user-generated content?

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:52.280
Because it has a foot in both camps and, actually,
McDonalds, the success of this or the value

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.420
of this for McDonalds is that it is actual
user-generated content.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:03.420
Now, this copy is one of many that is floating
around YouTube that were not uploaded by either

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.480
of these two guys or McDonalds, but somebody
took it off their DVR and put it up on the

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.930
site; so it is circulated then by somebody
who doesn't have an interest, near as I can

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.930
tell, in either of these two camps.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.470
But things--this is an interesting bit of
content.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.090
How do we come about and appraise this video?

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.550
For me, it's visuals.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.640
It appears to be both user-generated content
and commercial material.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.920
It is uploaded by someone who appears to be
what we might think of as an ordinary user

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:36.070
of YouTube, so not a sock puppet for a large
media company Web site.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.160
So they're uploading it and sharing it because
they think it's something interesting.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.740
It then circulates through channels on YouTube
that may not be about, you know, the promotion

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.510
of commercial media, but might be about sharing
interesting things with your friends.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.840
These were some of the questions that we were
trying to sort of get at.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:57.800
And what we did then was take a sample of
4,320 of the most popular videos on YouTube

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.600
and put together what we're calling a sort
of a content survey.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.110
We appropriated some of the methodologies
from the social sciences to do a content analysis.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.380
We took a team of eight researchers.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.420
We wrote a coding book.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.470
We worked out how we could try and classify
these videos and then we looked at them all.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.740
Now, the sample is far too big to get the
kind of utter agreement that the social sciences

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.570
appreciates, but, you know, ultimately, what
we're trying to do is see what happens and

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.750
what are the tensions that emerge when you
try and do a project like this.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.280
What I think is significant about it is that
we drew the content from four of the different

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.240
categories of popularity that YouTube offers.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.420
So YouTube itself, and this is an old screenshot.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.919
So I apologize if it has changed.

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:45.020
YouTube itself offers a number of different
ways to assess how popular something is.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.870
It can be on shear reach numbers.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.590
So it can be about most viewed.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.100
But it can also be about some sort of engagement
metric.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.250
And, already, we have three or four different
types of engagement metric borne into this

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.250
sample.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:01.990
But we have: whether you favored it, so whether
you decided that it allows you to make a declarative

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:08.830
statement about who you are, whether you've
linked to another video or posted a videos

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.620
response, whether you've left a comment or
whether you've merely viewed it.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:17.280
What we did was work across these four types
of popularity to try and see, well, when you

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.220
don't just look at most viewed, what ends
up being the most popular content, how is

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.650
it used, and by whom.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.710
And so, as I said, you know, we put together
this coding book; and this is a sample of

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.710
it.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.350
And then we did all of this stuff and these
are some numbers.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.960
The numbers are fine; the pie chart's "funner".

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.520
So, across our sample, we are looking, you
know, based on this sample on the coding book

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.080
that we came up with, we're looking at something
that looks roughly like a 50-50 spread, all

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080
right?

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:50.030
Half of--roughly half of the content in our
sample appeared to come from user-generated

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.920
sources or appeared to be user-generated,
all right?

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.200
And I'll talk in a little bit about what those
definitions mean.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.300
And roughly half of it in our sample appeared
to be sort of traditional media.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.450
When we look at the uploaders--and what we
did was split out the content from the uploader;

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.630
so can we make a determination about who is
uploading what?

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.710
Can we a determination about what is the type
of content and who was putting it where?

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:19.730
Well, predominantly, our sample is dominated
by what we refer to as users, by, you know,

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:25.080
what we think of when we think of people,
ordinary people uploading content to YouTube.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.990
Now, as we discussed in the book, actually,
making a determination about what counts as

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:34.000
a "user" or not is a tricky and difficult
thing; and I'll talk a little bit about it.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.130
When we look across the different categories
of population, we get the pyramid shape, if

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.940
you arrange the bars the right way.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.220
And so we get this pyramid shape that says,
you know, on the side of the side of most

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.300
favorited and most viewed videos, we a see
a predominance of content from traditional

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.360
media sources.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.820
And this is in the sample that we put together.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.980
So, you know, on the side of the most discussed
and most responded, we tend to see a predominance

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.790
of videos that appear to be user-created.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:03.670
And so if we look at traditional content--I
should note that when we were doing this,

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:09.730
it was primary season and we were basing the
study out of Massachusetts so we were looking

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:15.760
here within the US, and we did it at a time--we
started it before the regionalization and

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.620
completed it after the regionalization.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.770
So, along the way, YouTube became a little
fractured even for our sample.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.030
You know, we see a lot of information and
opinion content when we think about traditional

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.360
media.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.950
And this makes sense if we think about what
people are doing on YouTube.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:35.580
You know, YouTube, to a great extent, follows
the mainstream news agenda when we think about

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.280
a traditional content as being uploaded there.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.690
So, you know, it's a place where you upload
the last two minutes of the football game

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.760
because you want to be able to celebrate that
moment.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.990
Midway through our sample, there was an earthquake
in Peru; and so, all of a sudden, all of these

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.420
videos about the earthquake in Peru popped
up.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.850
You know, those people try and share both
material about what's happening, but also

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.640
go to YouTube as a source of information.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.150
Now, there was a little bit, a small degree
of the sort of stuff that the large media

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.530
companies were concerned with, you know, the
uploading of content as a way to get around

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.510
official distribution channels.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:18.000
But what we found, that it was often content
that came from outside of the US or in languages

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.080
other than English, and, ultimately, I suspected,
it's serving diasporic audiences, so audiences

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.390
who don't really have access to this content
within their region but there is a language

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.990
community, a viewing community that might
be transnational.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:36.180
You know, and this brings us to the Susan
Boyle event, you know, which for anyone living

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:42.360
outside of the US or perhaps I should be honest,
for anyone living in Australia, you know,

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.950
who grew up watching a broadcast system that
featured a lot of imported content.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:53.890
This idea of going somewhere online because
there's a major news event to which, you know,

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.980
you don't have access to the content is a
really ordinary way to try and keep up with

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.590
the discussions that are going on.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.790
But the Susan Boyle thing points, I think,
to the interrelationship when you're thinking

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:08.970
about traditional content on YouTube between
some of the mainstream news agenda and content

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:09.970
flows.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.380
So Susan Boyle becomes an event partly because
it's on YouTube; but it ends up on YouTube

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.900
partly because it's a major event; and so
the two were sort of linked together in a

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.590
cycle.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.600
So we find traditional content used to mark
tastes--sorry--to perform tastes, to mark

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.700
occasions, to catch up on events, and to comment
on sort of what is the best bit.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.690
And I'll talk a little briefly at the end
about the comment process.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:40.800
You know, when we think about the preponderance
of music videos on YouTube and also the, in

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.730
our sample, the large amount of traditional
content that appeared in the most favorited

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.310
category, it makes a whole lot of sense.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:55.670
Sticking a music video in your profile page
is a key way in which we express some sort

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.130
of identity.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.440
Music has long been linked to the performance
and the construction of identity across social

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.440
networking.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:10.150
And so, you know, that we see UMG and other
music labels appearing way up the top of the

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.220
most viewed list on YouTube makes sense.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.280
You know, it's part of what we do.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.580
If we look at user-created content, we see
almost the flipside.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.670
You know, in our sample, the user-created
content was dominated by vlogging that kind

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:28.160
of--what I think is probably emblematic of
YouTube for the performance to camera.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.360
But there is, of course, you know, wonderful
diversity when we look at user-created content,

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:40.240
from, you know, the lip-syncing girls in their
bedroom through the performances like Ty's

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.920
or those little bits of, those little oddities
like two otters holding hands, you know, where

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.840
we use YouTube to share this kind of--and
celebrate these trivial moments; but, at the

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.290
same time, we see this other kind of performance--sorry--art
video art pieces.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:00.300
So, the little Mario picture is just this
YouTube thing that happens.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.490
It's called "YouTube Poop."

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:10.090
And what it's comprised of are a lot of rapid
cuts of usually generally very bad, 1990s,

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:14.540
Saturday morning cartoons although they are
starting to branch out now into episodes of

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.540
Naruto and whatnot.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:23.370
And it's put together in almost nonsensical
fashion--the idea is to juxtapose these little

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.370
bits of content.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:29.130
Hopefully, if you're lucky, you can get it
to sound like they are swearing; but it is

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.330
this incredibly large YouTube phenomena.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:36.860
And it doesn't make any sense outside of YouTube
because what it represents, I think, is a

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.750
demonstration of your technological prowess,
you know, the same way that game play videos

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:45.650
that we might see uploaded, you know, demonstrate
how well you can jump a bike in Grand Theft

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:46.850
Auto.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:51.630
YouTube is a place where we see this kind
of playfulness with the tools of video editing

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.260
that now have been democratized.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:59.820
And I think the other thing we see when we
look at vlogging particularly is an incredible

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:05.760
reflexivity about the way that YouTube works
and about the identity of being a YouTube

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760
vlogger.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.179
And so this is a little video by--actually,
a short segment of this--by an Australian

00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:12.610
vlogger who vlogs in the name, communitychannel.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:18.600
And her vlogs are a mix between--a lot of
times, often comment on what's happening on

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.110
YouTube itself and the identity of YouTube
vloggers.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:34.630
&gt;&gt; So I would like to ask you guys: Do you
get the same thing because I find what people

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:42.150
ask me extremely odd?

00:29:42.150 --> 00:30:08.510
And for some reason everywhere I go, it doesn't
matter whose, they have the same notions of

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.993
what goes on on YouTube.

00:30:11.993 --> 00:30:12.993
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:30:12.993 --> 00:30:13.993
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:30:13.993 --> 00:30:14.993
&gt;&gt; So, listen, David told me that you do YouTube
videos.

00:30:14.993 --> 00:30:15.993
&gt;&gt; Oh, did he?

00:30:15.993 --> 00:30:16.993
&gt;&gt; That's so weird, right?

00:30:16.993 --> 00:30:17.993
What do you talk about?

00:30:17.993 --> 00:30:18.993
&gt;&gt; Just stuff.

00:30:18.993 --> 00:30:19.993
&gt;&gt; Do you ever, you know...

00:30:19.993 --> 00:30:20.993
&gt;&gt; What?

00:30:20.993 --> 00:30:21.993
&gt;&gt; You know, do you ever, you know...

00:30:21.993 --> 00:30:22.993
&gt;&gt; No.

00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:23.993
What?

00:30:23.993 --> 00:30:24.993
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:30:24.993 --> 00:30:25.993
You know, do you have a...

00:30:25.993 --> 00:30:26.993
&gt;&gt; What?

00:30:26.993 --> 00:30:27.993
&gt;&gt; You know, you just press to dial-8000 down
there.

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:28.993
I'll make all your wishes come true.

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:29.993
&gt;&gt; No, I don't...

00:30:29.993 --> 00:30:30.993
&gt;&gt; GREEN: She goes on to--and the entire video
goes for a good number of minutes to confront

00:30:30.993 --> 00:30:31.993
and I suppose correct some of the perceptions
about what it means to be a vlogger, about

00:30:31.993 --> 00:30:32.993
the motivations, you know, for all of these
people to broadcast themselves.

00:30:32.993 --> 00:30:33.993
And so I want to sort of start moving into
this sort of the wrap-up of all these and

00:30:33.993 --> 00:30:35.920
I want to talk about what the implications,
you know, all of YouTube might be for the

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.120
media space and also what are the challenges
and that sort of things with some of the challenges

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.980
YouTube faces as it moves forward.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.110
I really like binaries.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.750
I think binaries are a great way to think
things through.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:52.580
And when I think about YouTube, you know,
it forces us to think about the growing relationship

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:57.340
between, you know, professional production
and amateur production, between promotional

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:05.740
uses of content or platforms and social uses,
between, you know, the value of impressions

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:10.660
and the value of expressions, which we still
don't yet have an effective way to value,

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.820
between--the difference between being engaged
with something and how we might measure engagement

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:19.179
through the sorts of matrix that make the
world go round and what it means to participate

00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:24.650
in a community in a system; but also the relationships
between distribution channels and making use

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:29.090
of a platform like YouTube, you know, as if
it was a distribution channel and what the

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.240
politics and potentials of platforms might
be.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:39.660
YouTube has, I think, a lumpy relationship,
say, with the transition of television to

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.780
the online space.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:46.640
You know, this is hulu, in case anyone of
you didn't realize; and, you know, this is

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.480
ultimately the large, big media's response
to YouTube.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.890
I thought it's fascinating when hulu was being
put together, the discussion in the trade

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.640
press was all about putting together a YouTube
killer.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.260
And yet what hulu does and what YouTube do,
very, very different things.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:09.640
And online distribution platform tuned for,
say, a broadcast model is very, very different

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.260
to what YouTube might be.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:17.080
And I want to just take a minute to just quote
Quincy Smith who I think is one of the cleverest

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080
people in this space.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.091
Here's a presentation from a little while
ago now where he is talking about CBS' response

00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:25.400
to a content appearing on YouTube.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.640
&gt;&gt; SMITH: CBS channel on YouTube who's putting
clips up on Letterman all day long--he interviewed

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.450
Paris Hilton a couple of weeks ago--and somebody
named MangoFace94 ripped it off and uploaded

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.450
the thing.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:40.320
And right when they were like 8,000 lawyers
just primed at the pump to kill probably the

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.090
number one fan of Letterman, thankfully, the
media company got this sight of mind clear

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.330
to say: Why don't we embrace it?

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.031
If we can wrap around a safe, clean, well-lit
environment to monetize this thing, what's

00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:53.890
the difference between at MangoFace94 and
CBS' editors?

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.640
The users have seen what they can do with
it.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.390
So, how--are you going to tell the users they
can't do anything more?

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.390
That's ridiculous.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.549
Media needs to be more comfortable with users
as editors.

00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:07.140
&gt;&gt; GREEN: He says--there are two very interesting
things I just want to pick out for a second.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.000
First of all, I both agree and disagree with
Quincy Smith.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.679
I think he is one of the cleverest people
in the space.

00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:15.590
I think this little presentation--and this
is excerpt from an Ad Age video--is quite

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.590
revealing.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.940
You know, he says, look, if we're going to
deal with MangoFace94 who might be the number

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.910
one fan of Letterman, then maybe we should
embrace it.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:28.670
If we can wrap around a safe, clean, well-lit
environment to monetize this thing, what's

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.929
the difference between MangoFace94 and CBS'
editors?

00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:38.400
And the difference is that I'm not sure that
MangoFace94 cares about the existence of safe,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.980
clean, well-lit, monetizable environment.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.360
You know, and I think, fundamentally, that
represents one of the challenges that YouTube

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.500
faces going forward.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.860
hulu was an attempt to create a safe, clean,
well-lit environment that you can wrap stuff

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.170
around and blah, blah, blah.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:57.100
I agree however that media needs to be more
comfortable with uses as editors.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:01.280
What that might mean however is a different
orientation to the way we derive value from

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.410
the space, to the way that we think about
the ultimate purpose and value of this kind

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:10.990
of online experience especially because--and
this is an article from Ad Age that is about

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:19.290
six months after Quincy's presentation, unofficial
streams, unofficial uploads of Letterman's

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:23.109
clips are still outranking the official streams
from CBS.

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:29.580
You know, and part of that is because perhaps
the fans know better about what the market

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.380
wants.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.830
And part of it, you know, might be because
it's actually in CBS' favor to embrace these

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.790
guys as editors and let it go.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:42.980
What I think this forces us to think about
however is how we think about uploading content

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.429
to YouTube, you know, what it means to participate.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:50.160
You know, I'd like to point out, of course,
that not all uploading is always regardless

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.830
of what the content is.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:56.409
But the reason I say this is because I don't
think that all uploading is necessarily publishing.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:01.160
I think we need to move beyond the broadcast
model which is fundamentally oriented around

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.160
distribution.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.710
A lot of the uploading of, say, traditional
media content or even, you know, shots of

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:12.220
a panda sneezing at the zoo to YouTube is
an attempt to share something.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:16.390
But what it reveals to us beyond, you know,
the fact that while people like to share stuff

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.170
is what it means to be a media audience member.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.220
So audienceship always happens behind close
doors.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:28.330
You know, the great problem with the broadcast
space is that can't actually see people watching

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:29.330
television.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.060
It's something that they've done and is completed
as soon as it's over.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.620
You can measure how many people turn the television
set on, right?

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:40.460
But even, you know, most of the large-scale
biometrics that we have treat viewing as if

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.700
it was a singular thing.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.830
If the set is on, then you must be watching
it.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.030
What does "watching it" mean?

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.630
Well, you're obviously sitting there looking
at what's happening, not you doing the ironing,

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.800
not you going into the bathroom, not you getting
a cup of tea, not you sitting there with the

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.100
television on while you prepare your presentation
or have a chat with your friend.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.230
What YouTube allows us to see, I think, is
the experience of audienceship because if

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.450
I upload two minutes of the Family Guy, I'm
perhaps not trying to publish those two minutes

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.840
of Family Guy.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.030
Maybe what I'm doing is the participatory
culture equivalent of walking to the office

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.240
and reenacting two minutes of the Family Guy,
right?

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.180
Actually, doing some works at QUT, there's
a lot about the fact that audiences in the

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:26.350
current age no longer need to rely on auxiliary
media forms to speak back to the media system.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.890
So it used to be, if you are dissatisfied
with something or if you love something, you

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.030
might write a letter to the editor of your
newspaper, right?

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.250
And then perhaps you went on to the Internet
when the Internets were invented and you might

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.960
write a screed or participate in a discussion.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.790
We're currently in a moment where if you are
in love with something or you are dissatisfied

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.500
with something, you can actually access that
material itself.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.010
Media has become audio-visual content, has
become tangible.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:57.180
And so what we get is a situation where users
can do the very things and produce content

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.050
that not only looks like but is the very content
to which they were responding.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:05.490
Well, that's where we need to reevaluate what
we think about when we think about what it

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.830
means to be an audience member, what it means
to be a publisher.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:13.369
I think the other thing we need to think about
is that not all users on YouTube especially

00:37:13.369 --> 00:37:15.030
are necessarily amateurs.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.050
This is the Ford Models site although this
is a bit of a dated shot.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:22.980
But Ford Models has a great YouTube channel.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.060
I really, really like it.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.560
A lot of the content is content you might
see somewhere else.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.020
All right, so if we had the Fashion channel,
a lot of the content, this sort of stuff we

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.100
might see there.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.920
Yeah, but YouTube-- Ford Models puts it up.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.530
They own the rights to it.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.790
They also sell redistribution rights and the
rights elsewhere.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:44.170
We need to think of Ford Models as a user,
the same way we think of the people in the

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.450
room, you know, the casual users; and we need
to break down, I think, the idea that, you

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.490
know, on one side of the fence is large media,
and on the other side of the fence is everybody

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.860
else because in the YouTube world, on one
side of the fence is YouTube Inc.; on the

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.480
other side of the fence is everybody else.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.550
And, yes, you know, we have a diversity.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.920
We've got large media producers and small
media producers.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.530
We've got good content and we've got bad content.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:11.220
You know, but what we have is an incredibly
diverse user pool.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.430
And when we look at, you know, uploads across
the popularity category in our sample, we

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:21.330
see both a large number of--and this is--the
little numbers are the numbers of videos uploaded

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:26.340
so both a large number of large media producers
who are actively using the site; but we also

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.160
come across the sites like No Good TV.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.820
Now, No Good TV produces lavish style content.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.170
You know, it's the sort of stuff you might
se on Spike.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.370
They show up to interview Will Ferrell and
they get their two and half minutes like everybody

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:41.300
else; but it's online distribution only, all
right?

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.710
They are what otherwise we would have thought
of as an independent media company--you know,

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.410
independent producer.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:51.990
Something like YouTube forces us to reevaluate
whether they represent the kind of traditional

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:55.780
fold or whether they are more like, you know,
the sort of casual users.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.130
And this is especially true when we think
about the kind of entrepreneurial vloggers

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:06.220
out there so people like Marina Orlova who
does--and I can't pronounce it.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.359
So she has the definition or origin of words.

00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:12.120
And it's--no, philology.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.240
I used to say it--okay.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.560
So that's what she does, and she is incredibly
successful.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:26.060
But her mode is inherently consistent with
the way that vlogging works on YouTube.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.050
So she responds to her audiences.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.890
She responds to comments.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.340
She gives shout-outs across the vlogging community.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.440
She shows up in other people's videos and
she delivers her content.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.430
She produces and she engages in a mode of
production that might be akin to the sorts

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.620
of stuff that we see with Oprah.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.460
You know, both of them produce a program that's
oriented around conversation.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:54.640
And yet Oprah's YouTube channel is principally
designed not to respond to the YouTube community

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.570
but to drive content--to drive viewers back
to television.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:02.110
And so I think not only do we need to think
about not all users being amateurs, I think

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:06.660
we need to think about not all vlogging or
uploading--so not all vlogging are user-created

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:13.630
production being something that's, A, monetized
through commercials or ads or, B, something

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.290
that's just people telling us what they think
about stuff.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:18.820
Much of it is a business.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:24.090
And if we look at the most subscribed users
over time, we see a distinction between the

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.290
most viewed.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.750
So this was just from last night.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.790
If we look at, you know, at most viewed, we
see large media companies.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:36.550
If we look at most subscribed, we sure it
might be, say, lured audiences, we see a larger

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.109
number of this kind of entrepreneurial vloggers.

00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:42.980
And so now we've come to the sort of the concluding
point.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.030
And let's take a minute to talk about the
sort of uncertain futures that YouTube faces

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.900
as it moves forward.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:55.930
Speaking at Mipcom last year, Chad Hurley
talked about YouTube being a site for empowerment.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:02.310
You know, it empowers consumers of online
video, it empowers advertisers, and it empowers

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.810
content owners.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:10.710
I think this discourse of empowerment is active
and a fine, you know, description of the space.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:15.790
I think this discourse of empowerment and
the users that it's trying--those three stakeholders

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:20.300
that it's trying to serve stretches YouTube
in ways that it's not entirely sure how to

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.700
respond to and puts it in a really tough position.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.370
So looking at it, you know, the overall impression
is that of a company negotiating a range,

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:32.849
especially once it's nationalized, is a range
of competing national regulatory structures

00:41:32.849 --> 00:41:37.840
and corporate demands while at the same time
maintaining a brand image that's based ultimately

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.400
on sort of universal accessibility.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:45.390
And so tensions arise on YouTube around the
need to control which market certain content

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:51.440
can be accessed by or navigate content regulations,
censorship ratings in particular states.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.510
Increasingly, it appears that these tensions
are resolved through the selective use of

00:41:55.510 --> 00:42:02.210
content, specific geographical filters but
with no real responsibility to disclose the

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:07.960
details or reasoning behind many of these
decisions to users, and users, generally none

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:14.110
the wiser, when content suddenly isn't available
in their region or when they can't get YouTube

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:15.510
altogether.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:21.250
YouTube has challenges that try to manage,
you know, the interests and provide for these

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:27.820
large media producers while at the same time
responding to the user base that ultimately

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.710
it's where livelihood rests on.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.200
And this is a user base that knows a lot about
YouTube but also sometimes seems kept out

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.290
in the dark from decisions that are made or
the motivations that are made.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:43.109
And this user base includes, I think, large
media producers and, you know, the young people

00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:44.410
at home.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:48.900
So, moving forward, YouTube needs to work
out how to negotiate these tensions or they

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:54.150
will tear it apart especially, you know, when
we get estimations as we had recently about

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:58.400
how much money YouTube is going to lose in
the next four quarters.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.790
I think, at the end of the day, we need to
realize however that YouTube serves a fundamental

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.810
and important cultural service.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:13.810
As much as it is a site that offers great
opportunity for monetization and commercial

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:19.700
value, it is also a site where much of the
new culture activity is being played out.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:27.849
I think YouTube has a responsibility to try
and weigh out how it keeps itself alive and

00:43:27.849 --> 00:43:32.500
the services it provides, you know, to commercial
media users with its responsibility and I

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.730
suppose some sort of public service obligation
that it respect the fact that it is a site

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.170
where people are rewriting popular culture.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.060
And I'm more than happy now to take questions
because that's all that I've prepared.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:49.720
So I'm sorry it ends with a bit of a thump
but such is the way.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.440
Thank you.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.289
If people have questions, we ask that you
use the mike.

00:43:58.289 --> 00:44:00.820
&gt;&gt; BRANDON: Thanks so much.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.349
My name is Brandon.

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:05.160
I sell advertising on YouTube.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Excellent.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:13.130
&gt;&gt; BRANDON: And one thing that I often tell
people about how to be successful on YouTube

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.900
as a, you know, as a channel, as an individual
is to have been here about three years ago

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.270
or at least to have been on YouTube about
three years ago.

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:24.500
I mean, if you look at that list of most subscribed
channels, that's--they all have been around

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.500
for awhile.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.500
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Yeah.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.410
&gt;&gt; BRANDON: What would you say, what are other
things that they have in common?

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:29.869
So if somebody is starting up now...

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:30.869
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Yeah.

00:44:30.869 --> 00:44:33.530
&gt;&gt; BRANDON: What, you know, whether they are
a brand or an individual, could propel them

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:34.530
to the top?

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.530
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Yeah.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.690
So I think YouTube is a great collection of
fragments.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:44.410
You know, and so I think, you know, the first
thing about success is having a clear sense

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.940
of what success might mean on the site.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.250
I think sometimes people come to it and look
for incredible reach.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:55.670
And what YouTube could be very good for is
providing targeted reach and very, very good

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:56.670
targeted reach.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.619
In order for you to do that--but I think you
need to understand who are the other big players

00:45:00.619 --> 00:45:03.460
in your little niche.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:08.070
And so, you know, I've always said, the answer's
probably to look to the key vloggers.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:11.860
You know, they are the people who innovate
the space; but they're also the people who

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.550
understand, I think, the way the space operates.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:20.720
And when you look at what they do, often,
the most successful ones are participants

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720
in the space.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720
So they're not just uploading content.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.650
You know, they're getting involved in debates
that are going on.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.970
They're responsive to other videos.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:33.570
So, it's not just about them broadcasting
themselves; but active broadcasting is actually

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.190
one that requires some kind of response to
your audience.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:41.580
And so it's not inherent--it's not altogether
conversational but it's certainly not that

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.849
broadcast yourself and let's sort of--let's
just push it out.

00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:47.670
So, yes, I agree, you know, get here three
years ago, you know, and grow up in the place

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.630
or learn from the people who have growing
up in the space.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:51.880
How do they respond to their communities?

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.510
What's the language they use?

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.340
What do they offer up?

00:45:55.340 --> 00:46:01.220
And there was a video awhile ago that some
people uploaded that's a glitch from an EA

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.460
sports game where Tiger Woods appears to walk
on water.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:09.940
And, you know, some people uploaded it and
it become incredibly popular and was, at one

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:15.869
point, ranked as the fourteenth most viewed
video within the video game community on YouTube.

00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:18.480
So the company that manages EA sees this.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.780
They happen to have Tiger Wood lying around
in a closet, something.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.751
They take him out, you know, and they shot
a spot with him apparently walking on water.

00:46:25.751 --> 00:46:30.470
What they then do is grab the original video
and edit the two together, drop an overlay

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.369
that says, "Look, you know, you thought it
was just in the video game, well, actually,

00:46:33.369 --> 00:46:34.860
it is not a glitch.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.990
Check it out.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.050
You know, here's Tiger Woods walking on water."

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:42.580
You upload it, you know, you upload it to
YouTube as they did and, you know, it goes

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.030
up the charts, for that, you know, video game
community.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:50.200
Well, what that does was both acknowledge
that the community is significant producing

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.470
content, you know, and it's not just sitting
there, listening to what is being pushed out,

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:56.599
it acknowledges the important people.

00:46:56.599 --> 00:47:00.350
So, you know, they took the video and actually
said, "This video is significant because you

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.620
all liked it so we're going to do what you
do.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:07.240
You know, we're going to use the resources
at our disposal and let the sorts of things

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.240
that you're doing.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:14.200
So I think it's a good example of, you know,
a corporate effort that, you know, that responds

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.010
to the sort of the culture logics of the way
the place operates.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.550
Hi.

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.090
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.040
So YouTube is such an evolving platform.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.570
And I'm sure in the months that you've been
writing the book, you've seen a lot of the

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:32.230
changes, you know, of long-form content and
new advertising form as of promoted videos

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.140
and pre-roll and new homepage units.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.760
So what kind of challenges did that present
you as you were writing the book?

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.450
And also, what do you think the next book
on YouTube might be about?

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.020
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Right.

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:49.530
So, the challenges that posed to us--well,
the academic, probably the book publishing

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.119
cycle moves a lot slower than YouTube does.

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:58.869
And, you know, I was kicking myself after
we had sent the book to the publisher when

00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:02.980
agreements that we had referred to in the
book fell apart between YouTube and certain

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.089
corporate partners, you know.

00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:07.740
And so some of the challenges that we found
in writing the book is that YouTube has a

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:13.710
tendency to just change so, you know, you'd
wake up one morning as I did--I think it was

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:18.440
the 6th of July last year--and all of a sudden
there's all of these regions on YouTube--maybe

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.970
in the year before.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:25.270
And, you know, when I went to bed, there was
one YouTube and when I woke up in the morning,

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:28.470
you know, there were a whole bunch and they
just kept getting more, you know.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:34.240
And, you know, from--all of a sudden, we had
to confront the fact that YouTube is generally

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.849
the politics of being transnational.

00:48:36.849 --> 00:48:41.540
We hadn't anticipated that it was going to
happen, you know, and we think we read most

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.390
of the things that YouTube says it's going
to do.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.390
We knew it was in the works.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:48.330
You know, it's the same with a lot of the
community management policies, you know, that

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:51.530
I think sometimes catch people by surprise
because people aren't necessarily when the

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.099
changes are going to happen.

00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:57.700
And so, for us, that was the greatest challenge,
you know, that and the fact that many of the

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:02.570
things that you say become irrelevant when--or
fundamentally affected by, you know, YouTube

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:08.570
opening up in the US and attempts to leave
a long-form content, you know, or agreements

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:09.920
are finally reached.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:15.150
The next book about YouTube, I think, will
address needs to engage with the relationship

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.940
between YouTube and the rest of the world.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.911
This is a book written by two Australians;
one of them happens to live the US.

00:49:20.911 --> 00:49:28.570
But, you know, this is a book that doesn't
quite get to partly because of the time we

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:34.589
were writing, the challenges that YouTube
has as it becomes some sort of a global entity.

00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:39.680
So, you know, local broadcasters are regulated
quite heavily in many regions of the world

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:48.570
by content laws, by advertising laws, by regulation
restrictions, regulations and restrictions.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.750
YouTube has to confront that as it works in
different markets.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:58.390
It's a source of frustration to many people
who don't understand why and who perhaps see

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:04.120
YouTube as letting them down because this
content isn't available in your region and

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.190
the question is why.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:09.050
You know, because in Germany, it might not
be available for a range of reasons that have

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:14.510
to do with the way the nation regulate its
media representations.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:19.580
You know, in other regions, it may be because
there isn't a licensing agreement.

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:23.630
And I think that is a particular source of
conflict that is still being worked out and

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:26.089
looms large as YouTube moves forward.

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:28.440
&gt;&gt; And can we have a copy of your presentation?

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.440
&gt;&gt; GREEN: Yes.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.810
I'll talk to you about that later.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:36.190
Oh, and the book over here, if anyone would
like them, and I suppose I'll sign it if you

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.410
like.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:41.530
Yeah, on the table over here, and there are
some in the library as well.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:42.530
Hi.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.530
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.130
So one thing that we often talk with our partners,
our advertisers about is understanding how

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:53.030
to evaluate the collective of these comments
or favorites or whatnot.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:58.720
So I know that you took a look across like
the top 4,000 that were like rising to the

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.930
top, but did you ever look at any way about,
like, at one specific video and/or multiple

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:09.190
specific videos and then attempt to, like,
place--like, ideally, what I'd like to be

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:15.460
able to do is place different metrics or values
to those different things and then have a

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:21.760
way to monitor them instead of only being
able to look at the most viewed list.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:29.500
So did you all apply any sort of like code
or algorithm to specific, you know, actions

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:33.099
that happen against the video?

00:51:33.099 --> 00:51:36.260
&gt;&gt; GREEN: No, because we looked at videos--individual
videos in-depth.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.660
We didn't develop any kind of code or algorithm
to apply across the board.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:46.740
We looked at some individual videos in-depth
and sort of looked at their response and those

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.780
sorts of things.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:52.560
I'd be happy after this or at some other point
to talk to you about that because I have some

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.460
ideas; they're just not altogether probably
formed right enough to be sent out across

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.890
the whole world.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:02.080
But I'd be happy to sit down because I do
think it's possible to do.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.010
And I think there are number of kind of canny
ways that you can go about doing it.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:09.060
All right.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:18.570
Well, it's like, you know, five to twelve--five
to one now.

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:20.160
So I'll be at lunch.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.430
Thanks all for coming.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.549
And there are books and I will sign them.
