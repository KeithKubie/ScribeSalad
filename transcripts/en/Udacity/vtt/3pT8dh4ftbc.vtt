00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.060
I hope our discussion of the big problems in AI didn't scare you off,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.396
let's bring the discussion down, closer to work.

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:11.467
And talk about a few fundamental characteristics of AI problems. Number one,

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:16.600
in many AI problems, data arrives incrementally not all the data comes

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.330
right at the beginning. Number two, problems often have a recurring pattern,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.860
the same kinds of problems occur again and again. Number three,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.500
problems occur at many different levels of abstraction. Problem number four,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.720
many interesting AI problems are computationally intractable. Number five,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.630
the world is dynamic, it's constantly changing but knowledge of

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.960
the world is relative to static. Number six, the world is open ended but

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.110
knowledge of the world is relatively limited. So, the question then becomes,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.300
how can we design air agents that can address air problems with

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.060
these characteristics, those are the challenges we'll discuss in this course
