00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:09.094
A shabby man named Estragon,

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:12.924
sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot.

00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:14.804
He’s soon joined by his friend Vladimir,

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.104
who reminds his anxious companion that

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:20.564
they must wait here for someone called Godot.

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:23.964
So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:26.484
when Godot will come, why they’re waiting,

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.794
and whether they’re even at the right tree.

00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:32.994
From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger -

00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:35.504
but it’s considered a play that changed

00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:37.634
the face of modern drama.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:41.963
Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955,

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:45.623
it offers a simple but stirring question -

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:49.873
what should the characters do?

00:00:49.873 --> 00:00:52.963
Estragon: Don’t let's do anything. It's safer.

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:56.663
Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says.

00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:57.993
Estragon: Who?

00:00:57.993 --> 00:00:59.663
Vladimir: Godot.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.693
Estragon: Good idea.

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:04.223
Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are

00:01:04.223 --> 00:01:07.163
key features of the Theatre of the Absurd,

00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:10.413
a movement which emerged after the Second World War

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:12.263
and found artists struggling

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:15.183
to find meaning in devastation.

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:19.343
The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language

00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:21.853
to question their meaning and share

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:25.633
their profound uncertainty on stage.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.613
While this may sound grim,

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:30.793
the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor.

00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:33.373
This is reflected in Beckett’s unique approach

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:35.493
to genre in Waiting for Godot,

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:39.633
which he branded “a tragicomedy in two acts."

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.083
Tragically, the characters are locked in an

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:45.203
existential conundrum: they wait in vain

00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:47.963
for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose,

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:49.863
but their only sense of purpose

00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:52.583
comes from the act of waiting,

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:55.263
While they wait, they sink into boredom,

00:01:55.263 --> 00:02:00.253
express religious dread and contemplate suicide.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.683
But comically, there is a jagged humor to their predicament,

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:06.513
which comes across in their language and movements.

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:09.733
Their interactions are filled with bizarre wordplay,

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.613
repetition and double entendres,

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:14.723
as well as physical clowning, singing and dancing,

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:17.325
and frantically swapping their hats.

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.955
It’s often unclear whether the audience is supposed to

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:22.835
laugh or cry - or whether Beckett saw

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:25.855
any difference between the two.

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:27.915
Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English,

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:30.895
French and Italian before moving to Paris,

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:33.605
where he spent most of his life writing theatre,

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:35.705
poetry and prose.

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.575
While Beckett had a lifelong love of language,

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:42.575
he also made space for silence by incorporating gaps,

00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:46.575
pauses and moments of emptiness into his work.

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:50.265
This was a key feature of his trademark

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:53.155
uneven tempo and black humor,

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:56.405
which became popular throughout the Theatre of the Absurd.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:58.885
He also cultivated a mysterious persona,

00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:02.235
and refused to confirm or deny any speculations

00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:04.585
about the meaning of his work.

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:06.175
This kept audiences guessing,

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:09.395
increasing their fascination with his surreal worlds

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:12.427
and enigmatic characters.

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:15.287
The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot

00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:17.547
endlessly open to interpretation.

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.767
Critics have offered countless readings of the play,

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.387
resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:27.627
that mirrors the plot of the drama itself.

00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:30.727
It's been read as an allegory of the Cold War,

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:33.217
the French Resistance,

00:03:33.217 --> 00:03:36.227
and Britain’s colonization of Ireland.

00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:38.317
The dynamic of the two protagonists has

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.467
also sparked intense debate.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.307
They’ve been read as survivors of the apocalypse,

00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:45.817
an aging couple, two impotent friends,

00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:51.537
and even as personifications of Freud’s ego and id.

00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:53.707
Famously, Beckett said the only thing he could

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:56.707
be sure of was that Vladimir and Estragon

00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:59.667
were "wearing bowler hats."

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.567
Like the critical speculation and maddening plot,

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.227
their language often goes in circles as the two

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:08.405
bicker and banter, lose their train of thought,

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:11.285
and pick up right where they left off:

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:14.335
Vladimir: We could start all over again perhaps

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:16.475
Estragon: That should be easy

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:19.395
Vladimir: It’s the start that’s difficult

00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:21.815
Estragon: You can start from anything

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.285
Vladimir: Yes, but you have to decide.

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:28.175
Beckett reminds us that just like our daily lives,

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:31.245
the world onstage doesn’t always make sense.

00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:34.925
It can explore both reality and illusion,

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:37.025
the familiar and the strange.

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:40.555
And although a tidy narrative still appeals,

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:45.575
the best theatre keeps us thinking – and waiting.
