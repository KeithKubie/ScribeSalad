00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.310
We've seen in the
last several videos,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.324
you start off with any
crazy distribution.

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:06.490
It doesn't have to be crazy.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.156
It could be a nice,
normal distribution.

00:00:08.156 --> 00:00:09.890
But to really make
the point that you

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.200
don't have to have a
normal distribution,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.340
I like to use crazy ones.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.720
So let's say you have some
kind of crazy distribution

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.011
that looks something like that.

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:17.230
It could look like anything.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.604
So we've seen
multiple times, you

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:20.970
take samples from this
crazy distribution.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.030
So let's say you were to take
samples of n is equal to 10.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.240
So we take 10 instances
of this random variable,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.300
average them out, and
then plot our average.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.630
We get one instance there.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.692
We keep doing that.

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:39.400
We do that again.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.280
We take 10 samples from
this random variable,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.490
average them, plot them again.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.420
Eventually, you do this
a gazillion times--

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.110
in theory, infinite
number of times--

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.030
and you're going to
approach the sampling

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.679
distribution of the sample mean.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.220
And n equals 10,
it's not going to be

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.810
a perfect normal distribution,
but it's going to be close.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.750
It would be perfect
only if n was infinity.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.044
But let's say we eventually--
all of our samples,

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:06.710
we get a lot of
averages that are there.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.585
That stacks up there.

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:08.459
That stacks up there.

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.220
And eventually, we'll
approach something

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.284
that looks something like that.

00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:14.700
And we've seen
from the last video

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.440
that, one, if-- let's say
we were to do it again.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.200
And this time, let's say
that n is equal to 20.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.126
One, the distribution that we
get is going to be more normal.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.500
And maybe in future
videos, we'll

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.456
delve even deeper into things
like kurtosis and skew.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.830
But it's going to
be more normal.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.620
But even more important here,
or I guess even more obviously

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.570
to us than we saw,
then, in the experiment,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.620
it's going to have a
lower standard deviation.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.411
So they're all going
to have the same mean.

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:43.450
Let's say the mean here is 5.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.420
Then the mean here is
also going to be 5.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.860
The mean of our sampling
distribution of the sample mean

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.977
is going to be 5.

00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:50.310
It doesn't matter what our n is.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.162
If our n is 20, it's
still going to be 5.

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:53.620
But our standard
deviation is going

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.817
to be less in either
of these scenarios.

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:57.400
And we saw that just
by experimenting.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.100
It might look like this.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.683
It's going to be
more normal, but it's

00:01:59.683 --> 00:02:01.490
going to have a tighter
standard deviation.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.360
So maybe it'll look like that.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.720
And if we did it with an
even larger sample size--

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.560
let me do that in
a different color.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.509
If we do that with an
even larger sample size,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.110
n is equal to 100,
what we're going to get

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.160
is something that fits the
normal distribution even

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.940
better.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.880
We take 100 instances
of this random variable,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.207
average them, plot it.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.790
100 instances of
this random variable,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.780
average them, plot it.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.082
We just keep doing that.

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:27.040
If we keep doing that,
what we're going to have

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.050
is something that's even more
normal than either of these.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.500
So it's going to
be a much closer

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.610
fit to a true
normal distribution,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.710
but even more obvious
to the human eye,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.760
it's going to be even tighter.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.325
So it's going to be a very
low standard deviation.

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:41.950
It's going to look
something like that.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.500
I'll show you that on the
simulation app probably later

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.860
in this video.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.750
So two things happen.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.716
As you increase your
sample size for every time

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:53.590
you do the average, two
things are happening.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.200
You're becoming more normal,
and your standard deviation

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.030
is getting smaller.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.950
So the question might arise,
well, is there a formula?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.200
So if I know the
standard deviation--

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.670
so this is my standard deviation
of just my original probability

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.410
density function.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.970
This is the mean of my original
probability density function.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.040
So if I know the
standard deviation,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.240
and I know n is going
to change depending

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.880
on how many samples I'm taking
every time I do a sample mean.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.910
If I know my standard deviation,
or maybe if I know my variance.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.269
The variance is just the
standard deviation squared.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.810
If you don't remember
that, you might

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.770
want to review those videos.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.100
But if I know the variance
of my original distribution,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.219
and if I know what my n
is, how many samples I'm

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.510
going to take every time
before I average them in order

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.160
to plot one thing in my sampling
distribution of my sample mean,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.480
is there a way to predict what
the mean of these distributions

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.000
are?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.160
The standard deviation
of these distributions.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.350
And to make it so you don't get
confused between that and that,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.370
let me say the variance.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.520
If you know the variance,
you can figure out

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.070
the standard deviation
because one is just

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.400
the square root of the other.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.310
So this is the variance of
our original distribution.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.292
Now, to show that this is
the variance of our sampling

00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:11.750
distribution of our sample
mean, we'll write it right here.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.480
This is the variance
of our sample mean.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.140
Remember, our true mean is
this, that the Greek letter

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.140
mu is our true mean.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.610
This is equal to the mean.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.430
While an x with a line
over it means sample mean.

00:04:31.224 --> 00:04:32.640
So here, what we're
saying is this

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.136
is the variance of
our sample means.

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:37.010
Now, this is going to
be a true distribution.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.200
This isn't an estimate.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.620
If we magically knew
the distribution,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.080
there's some true variance here.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.030
And of course, the mean--
so this has a mean.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.450
This, right here-- if we can
just get our notation right--

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.340
this is the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sampling

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.840
mean.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.920
So this is the
mean of our means.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.020
It just happens to
be the same thing.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.914
This is the mean of
our sample means.

00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:04.580
It's going to be the
same thing as that,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.171
especially if we do the
trial over and over again.

00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:08.670
But anyway, the
point of this video,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.530
is there any way to figure
out this variance given

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.640
the variance of the original
distribution and your n?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.770
And it turns out, there is.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.420
And I'm not going
to do a proof here.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.920
I really want to give
you the intuition of it.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.628
And I think you already
do have the sense

00:05:21.628 --> 00:05:25.600
that every trial you take, if
you take 100, you're much more

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.400
likely, when you average those
out, to get close to the true

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.070
mean than if you took
an n of 2 or an n of 5.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.150
You're just very unlikely
to be far away if you

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.720
took 100 trials as
opposed to taking five.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.350
So I think you know
that, in some way,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.740
it should be inversely
proportional to n.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.412
The larger your n, the
smaller a standard deviation.

00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:45.870
And it actually turns out it's
about as simple as possible.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.994
It's one of those magical
things about mathematics.

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:50.180
And I'll prove it
to you one day.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.150
I want to give you a
working knowledge first.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.780
With statistics, I'm
always struggling

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.155
whether I should be formal in
giving you rigorous proofs,

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.864
but I've come to the
conclusion that it's

00:05:57.864 --> 00:05:59.904
more important to get the
working knowledge first

00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:02.740
in statistics, and then, later,
once you've gotten all of that

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.330
down, we can get into
the real deep math of it

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.310
and prove it to you.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.856
But I think experimental proofs
are all you need for right now,

00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:12.230
using those simulations to
show that they're really true.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.900
So it turns out that the
variance of your sampling

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.910
distribution of
your sample mean is

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.450
equal to the variance of
your original distribution--

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.350
that guy right
there-- divided by n.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.490
That's all it is.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.410
So if this up here has a
variance of-- let's say

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.020
this up here has
a variance of 20.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.730
I'm just making that number up.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.440
And then let's say your n is 20.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.720
Then the variance of your
sampling distribution

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.850
of your sample mean
for an n of 20-- well,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.065
you're just going to take
the variance up here--

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:46.020
your variance is 20--
divided by your n, 20.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.880
So here, your variance
is going to be

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.239
20 divided by 20,
which is equal to 1.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.280
This is the variance of
your original probability

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.350
distribution.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.709
And this is your n.

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:57.500
What's your standard
deviation going to be?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.560
What's going to be the
square root of that?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.970
Standard deviation is going
to be the square root of 1.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.490
Well, that's also going to be 1.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.140
So we could also write this.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:12.260
We could take the square root
of both sides of this and say,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.520
the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.770
of the sample mean is often
called the standard deviation

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.547
of the mean, and
it's also called--

00:07:19.547 --> 00:07:22.130
I'm going to write this down--
the standard error of the mean.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.370
All of these things I just
mentioned, these all just mean

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.400
the standard deviation
of the sampling

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.920
distribution of the sample mean.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.400
That's why this is confusing.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.397
Because you use the
word "mean" and "sample"

00:07:37.397 --> 00:07:38.230
over and over again.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.920
And if it confuses
you, let me know.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.170
I'll do another video or
pause and repeat or whatever.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.253
But if we just take the
square root of both sides,

00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:46.640
the standard error of the
mean, or the standard deviation

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.960
of the sampling distribution
of the sample mean,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.440
is equal to the
standard deviation

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.350
of your original function,
of your original probability

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.870
density function, which
could be very non-normal,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.920
divided by the square root of n.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.540
I just took the square root of
both sides of this equation.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.020
Personally, I like
to remember this,

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.900
that the variance is just
inversely proportional to n,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.380
and then I like to
go back to this,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.004
because this is very
simple in my head.

00:08:12.004 --> 00:08:13.760
You just take the
variance divided by n.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.480
Oh, and if I want the
standard deviation,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.271
I just take the square
roots of both sides,

00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:18.610
and I get this formula.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:23.980
So here, when n is 20,
the standard deviation

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.350
of the sampling distribution
of the sample mean

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.440
is going to be 1.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.520
Here, when n is
100, our variance--

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.240
so our variance of the sampling
mean of the sample distribution

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.419
or our variance of the mean, of
the sample mean, we could say,

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:43.360
is going to be equal to 20, this
guy's variance, divided by n.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.990
So it equals-- n is 100--
so it equals one fifth.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.260
Now, this guy's
standard deviation

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.201
or the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution

00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:55.450
of the sample mean, or the
standard error of the mean,

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.950
is going to the
square root of that.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.820
So 1 over the square root of 5.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.400
And so this guy will
have to be a little bit

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.055
under one half the
standard deviation,

00:09:04.055 --> 00:09:05.930
while this guy had a
standard deviation of 1.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.500
So you see it's
definitely thinner.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.280
Now, I know what you're saying.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.738
Well, Sal, you just
gave a formula.

00:09:09.738 --> 00:09:11.260
I don't necessarily believe you.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.130
Well, let's see
if we can prove it

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.110
to ourselves using
the simulation.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.870
So just for fun, I'll just
mess with this distribution

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.840
a little bit.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.464
So that's my new distribution.

00:09:23.464 --> 00:09:24.880
And let me take
an n-- let me take

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.540
two things it's easy to
take the square root of,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.470
because we're looking
at standard deviations.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.340
So let's say we take
an n of 16 and n of 25.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.552
And let's do 10,000 trials.

00:09:35.552 --> 00:09:37.260
So in this case, every
one of the trials,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.968
we're going to take
16 samples from here,

00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:41.850
average them, plot it here,
and then do a frequency plot.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.850
Here, we're going to do a 25 at
a time and then average them.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.960
I'll do it once animated
just to remember.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.670
So I'm taking 16
samples, plot it there.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.540
I take 16 samples, as described
by this probability density

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.240
function, or 25 now.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.120
Plot it down here.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.230
Now, if I do that 10,000
times, what do I get?

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.520
What do I get?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.040
All right.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.326
So here, just visually, you can
tell just when n was larger,

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:08.950
the standard deviation
here is smaller.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.450
This is more squeezed together.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.260
But actually, let's
write this stuff down.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.760
Let's see if I can
remember it here.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.450
Here, n is 6.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.840
So in this random distribution
I made, my standard deviation

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.180
was 9.3.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.520
I'm going to remember these.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.610
Our standard deviation for
the original thing was 9.3.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.650
And so standard
deviation here was 2.3,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.620
and the standard
deviation here is 1.87.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.982
Let's see if it
conforms to our formula.

00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:35.065
So I'm going to take this
off screen for a second,

00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:39.060
and I'm going to go back
and do some mathematics.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.890
So I have this on
my other screen

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.960
so I can remember those numbers.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.980
So, in the trial we just
did, my wacky distribution

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:56.510
had a standard deviation of 9.3.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.092
When n was equal to 16--
just doing the experiment,

00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:03.050
doing a bunch of trials
and averaging and doing

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.650
all the thing-- we got
the standard deviation

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.650
of the sampling distribution
of the sample mean,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.080
or the standard
error of the mean.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.590
We experimentally
determined it to be 2.33.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.180
And then when n
is equal to 25, we

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.930
got the standard error of
the mean being equal to 1.87.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.460
Let's see if it conforms
to our formulas.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.510
So we know that the
variance-- or we could almost

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.270
say the variance of the
mean or the standard error--

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.549
the variance of the sampling
distribution of the sample mean

00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:41.090
is equal to the variance of our
original distribution divided

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.930
by n.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.150
Take the square
roots of both sides.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.690
Then you get standard
error of the mean

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.860
is equal to standard deviation
of your original distribution,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.850
divided by the square root of n.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.490
So let's see if this works
out for these two things.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.830
So if I were to take 9.3--
so let me do this case.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:04.100
So 9.3 divided by the
square root of 16-- n

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.110
is 16-- so divided by the
square root of 16, which is 4.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.440
What do I get?

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.710
So 9.3 divided by 4.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.980
Let me get a little
calculator out here.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.970
Let's see.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.070
We want to divide
9.3 divided by 4.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.070
9.3 divided by our square
root of n-- n was 16,

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:32.110
so divided by 4--
is equal to 2.32.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:41.590
So this is equal to 2.32, which
is pretty darn close to 2.33.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.190
This was after 10,000 trials.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.690
Maybe right after
this I'll see what

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.950
happens if we did 20,000
or 30,000 trials where

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.130
we take samples of
16 and average them.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.550
Now let's look at this.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.760
Here, we would take 9.3.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.440
So let me draw a
little line here.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.190
Maybe scroll over.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.470
That might be better.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.210
So we take our
standard deviation

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.770
of our original
distribution-- so just

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.960
that formula that we've
derived right here

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.110
would tell us that our
standard error should

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.720
be equal to the
standard deviation

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.940
of our original
distribution, 9.3,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.460
divided by the square root of
n, divided by square root of 25.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.560
4 was just the
square root of 16.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.220
So this is equal to
9.3 divided by 5.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.340
And let's see if it's 1.87.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.490
So let me get my
calculator back.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:36.430
So if I take 9.3 divided
by 5, what do I get?

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.870
1.86, which is
very close to 1.87.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:49.690
So we got in this case 1.86.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.310
So as you can see, what
we got experimentally

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.659
was almost exactly-- and
this is after 10,000 trials--

00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:56.700
of what you would expect.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.830
Let's do another 10,000.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.250
So you got another
10,000 trials.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.600
Well, we're still
in the ballpark.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.016
We're not going
to-- maybe I can't

00:14:03.016 --> 00:14:07.520
hope to get the exact
number rounded or whatever.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.890
But, as you can see,
hopefully that'll be pretty

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.600
satisfying to you, that the
variance of the sampling

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.120
distribution of the
sample mean is just

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.254
going to be equal
to the variance

00:14:21.254 --> 00:14:22.920
of your original
distribution, no matter

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.160
how wacky that
distribution might be,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.720
divided by your sample size,
by the number of samples you

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.281
take for every basket
that you average,

00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:35.030
I guess is the best
way to think about it.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.590
And sometimes this
can get confusing,

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.600
because you are taking samples
of averages based on samples.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.730
So when someone says
sample size, you're like,

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.020
is sample size the
number of times

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.990
I took averages or
the number of things

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.880
I'm taking averages
of each time?

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.180
And it doesn't hurt
to clarify that.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.930
Normally when they
talk about sample size,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.260
they're talking about n.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.370
And, at least in my head,
when I think of the trials

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.260
as you take a sample
of size of 16,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.120
you average it,
that's one trial.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.802
And you plot it.

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:03.760
Then you do it again,
and you do another trial.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.110
And you do it over
and over again.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.193
But anyway, hopefully this
makes everything clear.

00:15:07.193 --> 00:15:09.050
And then you now
also understand how

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:14.040
to get to the standard
error of the mean.
