 A few years ago, I just wore black, 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.200
 my inner state also became black. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.790
 But when I discovered the neon, I was really happy. 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.200
 I like this color. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.644
 And I began to dress again in color. 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.760
 It really became a craze, 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.777
 I started doing my neon creations. 

00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:19.800
 How are you doing here? The current has caught me several times. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.575
 That gives me the liveliness. 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.977
 The lights of neon really fascinate me 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.222
 because they are more than a stationary art work. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.978
 They have this gas leaping inside the pipes. 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.772
 When placing the neon in a very dark environment 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.983
 Suddenly he becomes beautiful. 

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.844
 It helps me to see the world under a new light 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.885
 and approaches more people. 

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:49.134
 Josefin is also the Creative Director for Forza Football, 

00:00:49.143 --> 00:00:52.193
 where it creates football apps that bring fans closer to the game. 

00:00:52.193 --> 00:00:53.380
 Josefin Eklund. 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.991
 Artist of neon lights. 

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.267
 Creative apps. 

00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:58.791
 Evaluation of application creators around the world. 

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.271
