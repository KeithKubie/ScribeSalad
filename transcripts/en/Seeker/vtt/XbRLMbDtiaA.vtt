00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.070
We all have bone marrow but do we even need
it?

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.070
Yes.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.500
Very much yes.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.519
Hey there skeletons hiding inside sacks of
meat, Jules here for DNews!

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.360
I’m here to talk about bone marrow transplants,
but we have to know what bone marrow is in

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.360
the first place.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.349
In our bodies, there are these super cool
types of cells called “stem cells”.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.240
We’ve talked about them before, but in a
nutshell, these cells have the potential to

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.810
turn into other types of cell that makes up
the human body.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.150
One of the places we have stem cells is in
our bone marrow.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.290
Bone marrow is soft and fatty tissue that
resides inside your bones and stores the stem

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.610
cells that ultimately become blood cells.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.329
That’s red blood cells, which deliver oxygen
throughout the body, white blood cells, which

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
fight pathogens in your blood, like bacteria,
and platelets which help clot up your blood

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.480
when you get injured.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.280
But there are certain diseases that attack
these cells, like multiple myeloma, which

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.960
is cancer of the plasma cells, and leukemia,
which causes abnormal white blood cells.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.140
To treat these diseases, doctors often first
give patients high dose chemotherapy or radiation

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.870
treatments, which is intended to kill or disable
most of the damaged, cancerous cells.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.860
But now, while patients may no longer have
bad cells, they have very few good ones left

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.860
either.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.410
That’s where the bone marrow transplant
comes in; it is an effort to restart healthy

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.410
cell production.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.950
There are three types of transplants: first,
autologous, which means the marrow came from

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.410
the patient’s own body, and was extracted
before chemo and radiation.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.540
Another type is an allogeneic transplant,
where allo means “other” since another

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.800
person is donating their bone marrow.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.020
Problematically, the marrow has to come from
someone with closely matching genes, like

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.020
a relative.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
This is because most cells in your body have
a particular protein marker telling your immune

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830
system that they belong to you.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.650
If the donor doesn’t have the same marker
as you, your body might consider the new marrow

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.450
an invader, and with effectively no immune
cells left, that’s deathly dangerous.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.520
The last, and most controversial type of transplant,
is an “umbilical cord blood” transplant.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.450
This is where stem cells are removed directly
from a newborn child’s umbilical cord and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.240
placenta, and because the cells are so immature,
they don’t need to be genetically identical

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.320
the same way adult stem cells do.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.170
But despite the near-miraculous use of these
stem cells to cure blood diseases, there is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.500
still one big barrier for many patients: access
to healthy cells.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.130
For those who cannot use their own, there
are Bone Marrow registries.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.830
There’s a stigma about how painful it is
to donate, but according to the National Marrow

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.420
Donor Program, bone marrow donation is usually
a surgical outpatient procedure with anesthesia,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.860
with no pain during the extraction.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.810
Doctors use a needle to remove liquid marrow
from your pelvic bone.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.020
Yes, I know this looks painful, but apparently
it typically isn’t.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.170
And don’t worry, it’s only about 1 to
5% of your marrow, and it’ll regenerate

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.920
within just four to six weeks.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.750
However, the after effects can include back
or hip pain, fatigue, muscle pain, headache,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.360
and bruising at the incision site.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.542
On the receiving end, the cells from the donor
marrow sample are inserted through a direct

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:55.680
catheter line into the bloodstream.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.380
They find their way to the patient’s marrow
and begin to make healthy blood cells.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.620
While more than 27 million people are registered
as bone marrow donors, there are significant

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.860
issues in getting bone marrow to certain ethnic
groups with more diversity in their genetic

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.860
line.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.280
People of European descent have less genetic
diversity, and register in larger numbers,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.500
meaning that there are more matches to be
made.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.430
Meanwhile, other ethnicities, such as African
and Hispanic people tend to register less,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.890
and require more unique genetic matches.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.850
Today, bone marrow transplants save thousands
of people each year, and just in the United

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.900
States roughly 20,000 such procedures are
performed.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.070
But with as many as 70% of those needing a
transplant unable to find a matching relative,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.740
bone marrow registration is more important
than ever.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.600
Go out and get registered.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.459
Just like organ transplants, bone marrow transplants
can fail if the donor and the recipient aren’t

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.459
matched well.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.900
But what if there was a way to alter your
immune system so that you could receive an

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.209
organ from an incompatible donor?

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.930
We have a story about how this could happen
with kidneys, right here.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.350
