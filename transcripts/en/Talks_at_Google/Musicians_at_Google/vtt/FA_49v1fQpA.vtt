ROHITASH RAO: So
thanks for coming.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.350
This is crazy, because you're
here at Google, looking at me.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.750
I can't see any of you,
which is probably good.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.490
Before I get into
this particular show,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.010
I just want to give you
a quick little back story

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.260
of where this idea comes from.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.310
So years and years ago, I did
this animated short film called

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.780
"Battle of the Album Covers."

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.330
And the idea behind
this film was

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.230
I took pretty much all
of your famous album

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.310
covers and had them
all fight each other.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.630
So in the film, Billy Joel
throws the first stone

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.340
on his cover of the
album "Glass Houses."

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.520
And the rock goes
through the window,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.965
and it hits the mannequins
in Yazoo's album cover

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:54.210
of "Upstairs at Eric's."

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.942
And it's just like
a battle ensues.

00:00:57.942 --> 00:00:58.900
In fact, you know what?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.320
Why don't we play
that film first,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.930
so you can kind of get a taste
of why I love albums so much.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.552

and then I'll come back.

[CHEERING]

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.950
So basically, I did
that about 10 years ago.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.170
And the majority of those
albums are actually my albums.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.000
And it was an idea I had since
I was 16, when I was lying

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.560
my albums on my bedroom floor.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.260
And I'm like, you know what?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.590
That album could
fight with that album.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.260
And that guy would
fight that guy.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.250
And suddenly, it
just became an idea.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.740
In fact, can we go to
the slides, real quick?

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.760
I'm going to show you
a picture of my bedroom

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.040
when I was 16 years old.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.320
That's how it looked.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.234
It was very empty.

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:30.650
So this was my
room when I was 16.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.540
For me, when I discovered
music, I really

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.970
discovered all the things
that came with music,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.190
like the albums, the posters,
the stickers, the flyers--

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.000
I was obsessed.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.140
And I always say that, for me,
record stores were my first art

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.740
galleries.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.046
Because it's all the things
I loved in one place.

00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:56.670
And I thought it was
just so inspiring.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.299
I'm sure you guys
remember these stores

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:04.340
when you were growing up?

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.860
Or some of them
are still around.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.140
But these were my--

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.590
it felt like home every
time I was in this place.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.720
So this is where I grew
up-- in Rancho Cucamonga.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.310
I've got one high
school friend here?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.518

00:05:20.518 --> 00:05:21.880

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.350
I'll get to that.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.130
I'll get to that.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.444
But basically, this
was my childhood.

00:05:30.444 --> 00:05:32.610
And I think that what I
liked about where we grew up

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.510
was that there was so much
time with nothing to do.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.560
And I think that a lot of--

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.247
the music really seemed
to fill that world.

00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.080
Everything seemed to
have a soundtrack where

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.520
we were growing up.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.700
And before I go any
further, I just wanted to--

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.050
one of the best things
growing up when I was a kid

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.450
was this show called "Dr.
Demento," which was on KROCK.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.660
And "Dr. Demento" turned
me on to such great artists

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.940
as Weird Al Yankovic.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.000
And there was another
great artist back then that

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.340
was called Barnes and Barnes.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.964
I don't know if you
ever heard of them.

00:06:08.964 --> 00:06:12.570
They did this really
cool video for this song

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.694
called "Fish Heads."

00:06:13.694 --> 00:06:15.610
Have you ever heard--
you guys know this song?

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.050
If you don't know it,
you could look it up.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.240
And for me, this was
like the two things

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.540
I loved the most in the
world-- music and comedy.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.180
And I thought there's
something here.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.570
And I loved that these
artists were already doing it.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.300
So I want to give a shout
out to some of the best band

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.310
names I've ever heard of--

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.730
Scritti Politti, Blancmange,
Sigue Sigue Sputnik,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.270
Poi Dog Pondering--

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.340
I mean, Poi Dog Pondering--
where does that come from?

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.020
Oingo Boingo, which is also
one of the coolest album

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.250
covers, I would say.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.200
And my favorite, I Love You
But I've Chosen Darkness.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.669
That's a real band.

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:57.210
I don't know.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.270
I've seen them in concert
just so I could buy the shirt.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.220
So I started making
my own album covers.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.219
I'm like, you know what?

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.553
This is everything I want to do.

00:07:05.553 --> 00:07:08.052
So these are just some of the
album covers I started making.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:09.610
And suddenly, every
single photograph

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.500
I took, every
single illustration

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.340
I did, every single doodle I
sketched became an album cover.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.800
And now, nothing is sacred.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.380
I will make an album
cover with anything.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.870
And suddenly, everywhere I
go, and everything I read,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.659
and every text I seem to get
seems to be a band title.

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:28.450
It seems to be the
coolest name for a band.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.220
And now, everything I
do is about just this.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.730
I probably make an
album at every meal,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.320
now, just because
I can't help it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.050
Now, for the best part--

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.560
the music.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.650
Jared-- I met Jared
about 10 years ago.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.820
Maybe six years ago.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's been a while.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.010
ROHITASH RAO: It's been a while.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.343
Because this is how I met Jared.

00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:59.990
I met Jared because I did
an animated TV pilot for Fox

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.660
that Jared and
JinglePunk scored.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.240
It was called, funny
enough, "Rancho Cucamonga,"

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.740
which goes back to
exactly where I come from.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.800
So the pilot was basically
about an Indian family

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.060
growing up in Cucamonga.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.020
And Jared happened to
be the brilliant guy who

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.340
brought the music to life.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.620
So I said to Jared, listen,
I have this crazy idea called

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.350
Rohit Records.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.150
And I need musicians.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.104
And you're awesome
and funny and cool.

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.270
Why don't you do some music?

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.950
And Jared goes,
we actually happen

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.960
to have a bunch of
music lying around.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.640
Why don't we just work on it?

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.510
And then, we started
talking about it.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.799
And that became what's going to
be the "Rohit Records Greatest

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.100

which is coming out.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.539
Actually, it's done today.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.280
Today was the day the
press was finished.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.152
So it actually will be
released in about a week.

00:08:46.152 --> 00:08:47.360
And we're selling this album.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.880
If you want to pre-buy this
album, talk to me or Jared.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.080
We'll figure it out.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.420
But this is what
this has become.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.410
Now, we have music to go along
with those crazy album covers.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:03.200
So tonight you're going to
see six one-hit-wonder bands

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.410
[CHEERING]

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.900
They are going to
rock your socks off

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.184
as only the Rohit Records
label musicians can.

00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:17.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.506
Don't you like that I wrote
all this down somewhere,

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:20.880
and I didn't even
read any of it.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.395
I didn't even need this.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.620
This doesn't even matter.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.835
AUDIENCE: We love you, Ro.

00:09:26.835 --> 00:09:30.425
ROHITASH RAO: Oh, you're
awesome, whoever said that.

00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:31.300
I can't see anything.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.020
I just see the time, which
says I should get off.

00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:37.530
Are you going to come
on now, or are you

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.350
going to come on in a minute?

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.835
DEL BOCA VISTA: We're ready.

00:09:39.835 --> 00:09:41.808
ROHITASH RAO: Should
I announce the band?

00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:43.272
[CHEERING]

00:09:43.272 --> 00:09:45.712
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:48.020
ROHITASH RAO: All right,
I'll just leave this up here.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.800
This is the first song
of the first band that's

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.090
going to come up tonight.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.360
And I made an album cover
for each of these bands.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.850
So this is the album cover for
the first band, called Del Boca

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:58.635
Vista.

00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:00.010
And they're going
to kick it off.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.072
So as they play, I'm
going to show you

00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:03.280
the rest of the album covers.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.520
Thanks for coming.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.630
I appreciate your time.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.200
Thanks for coming all the way
to Venice on a Friday night.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.880
I hope you have a good time.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.930
