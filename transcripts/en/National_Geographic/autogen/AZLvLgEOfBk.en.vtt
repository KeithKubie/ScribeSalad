female which is nursing their little
ones if you look at the trunk when is

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:36.730
ones if you look at the trunk when is
 

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.420
ones if you look at the trunk when is
trying to pick up some leaves you will

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:39.430
trying to pick up some leaves you will
 

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.040
trying to pick up some leaves you will
see that this trunk does not have the

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.050
see that this trunk does not have the
 

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.530
see that this trunk does not have the
knobs sometimes elephants you will see

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:43.540
knobs sometimes elephants you will see
 

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.950
knobs sometimes elephants you will see
the trunk having some kind of knobs on

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960
the trunk having some kind of knobs on
 

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.410
the trunk having some kind of knobs on
it when is having the knobs it is a sign

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:49.420
it when is having the knobs it is a sign
 

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.220
it when is having the knobs it is a sign
of a milk deficiency normally you will

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:53.230
of a milk deficiency normally you will
 

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.230
of a milk deficiency normally you will
see those kind of knobs by the small

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240
see those kind of knobs by the small
 

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.410
see those kind of knobs by the small
ones if the mother dies when having a

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:58.420
ones if the mother dies when having a
 

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.230
ones if the mother dies when having a
lactating small one if that small one is

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240
lactating small one if that small one is
 

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.200
lactating small one if that small one is
not gonna get a lot of milk you will see

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.210
not gonna get a lot of milk you will see
 

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.050
not gonna get a lot of milk you will see
the milk deficiency in the sign of the

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:07.060
the milk deficiency in the sign of the
 

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.420
the milk deficiency in the sign of the
symptoms will be the knobs on the trunk

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:09.430
symptoms will be the knobs on the trunk
 

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.060
symptoms will be the knobs on the trunk
so about elephants they are so very

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.070
so about elephants they are so very
 

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.250
so about elephants they are so very
social in such a way that the other

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:14.260
social in such a way that the other
 

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.980
social in such a way that the other
lactating females can also nest the

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:16.990
lactating females can also nest the
 

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:28.140
lactating females can also nest the
little one when the mother is dead

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.150
 
 

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:34.920
 
so the little ones they are going to be

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:34.930
 
 

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.310

the elephants they eat quite a lot the

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080
the elephants they eat quite a lot the
 

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.830
the elephants they eat quite a lot the
elephants eat approximately 400

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840
elephants eat approximately 400
 

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.590
elephants eat approximately 400
kilograms a day and from the 400

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600
kilograms a day and from the 400
 

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.020
kilograms a day and from the 400
kilograms they eat there only just to go

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.030
kilograms they eat there only just to go
 

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.150
kilograms they eat there only just to go
they are only just going to digest for

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:49.160
they are only just going to digest for
 

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.890
they are only just going to digest for
the eight percent and forty eight

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:50.900
the eight percent and forty eight
 

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.160
the eight percent and forty eight
percent is a too little that is why the

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.170
percent is a too little that is why the
 

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.590
percent is a too little that is why the
insects my favorite insects such as dung

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600
insects my favorite insects such as dung
 

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.020
insects my favorite insects such as dung
beetles they prey on elephant dung

00:28:59.020 --> 00:28:59.030
beetles they prey on elephant dung
 

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.910
beetles they prey on elephant dung
because there is quite a lot of whole

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:00.920
because there is quite a lot of whole
 

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.790
because there is quite a lot of whole
nutrients available in their droppings

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:03.800
nutrients available in their droppings
 

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.070
nutrients available in their droppings
so there's droppings looks very much

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080
so there's droppings looks very much
 

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.380
so there's droppings looks very much
green and if you open them not finally

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:08.390
green and if you open them not finally
 

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:18.920
green and if you open them not finally
digested and reach in terms of water

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:18.930
 
 

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:25.540
 
so if we check there you will see that

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:25.550
 
 

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.100
 
King say that is true

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.110
King say that is true
 

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.590
King say that is true
it is quite a lot so it's a sign to us

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600
it is quite a lot so it's a sign to us
 

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.960
it is quite a lot so it's a sign to us
that elephants and needs quite a lot of

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:32.970
that elephants and needs quite a lot of
 

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:37.040
that elephants and needs quite a lot of
vegetation to survive so it is punishing

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.050
vegetation to survive so it is punishing
 

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:38.720
vegetation to survive so it is punishing
the elephants having the elephants in

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:38.730
the elephants having the elephants in
 

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.840
the elephants having the elephants in
the area which is not having a lot of a

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:41.850
the area which is not having a lot of a
 

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.390
the area which is not having a lot of a
lot of trees and a lot of grass for them

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:44.400
lot of trees and a lot of grass for them
 

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.350
lot of trees and a lot of grass for them
to eat so and they drink 150 to 200

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360
to eat so and they drink 150 to 200
 

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.080
to eat so and they drink 150 to 200
liters a day so it's not only about the

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:51.090
liters a day so it's not only about the
 

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.300
liters a day so it's not only about the
trees they must also have to be quite a

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:53.310
trees they must also have to be quite a
 

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.960
trees they must also have to be quite a
lot of water availability so that they

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:56.970
lot of water availability so that they
 

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.470
lot of water availability so that they
can be able to digest the trees nicely

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480
can be able to digest the trees nicely
 

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.750
can be able to digest the trees nicely
some people will tell you elephant is

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760
some people will tell you elephant is
 

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.030
some people will tell you elephant is
got a poor digestive system and I don't

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.040
got a poor digestive system and I don't
 

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.890
got a poor digestive system and I don't
think they've got a poor digestive

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:06.900
think they've got a poor digestive
 

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.170
think they've got a poor digestive
system that is how they digest that

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:09.180
system that is how they digest that
 

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.720
system that is how they digest that
they've got to defecate after every 45

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:11.730
they've got to defecate after every 45
 

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.750
they've got to defecate after every 45
minutes so every 45 minutes you will see

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760
minutes so every 45 minutes you will see
 

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.910
minutes so every 45 minutes you will see
the droppings coming out so that is

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:16.920
the droppings coming out so that is
 

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.400
the droppings coming out so that is
clear that they do digest the food and

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:19.410
clear that they do digest the food and
 

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.100
clear that they do digest the food and
this food has to come out after a very

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:22.110
this food has to come out after a very
 

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:28.190
this food has to come out after a very
short period so you can see now it's

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200
short period so you can see now it's
 

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:35.390
short period so you can see now it's
time to eat the grass child of the

universe fortunately the thorns by the
 

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.180
universe fortunately the thorns by the
trees don't really affect the elephants

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:41.190
trees don't really affect the elephants
 

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.250
trees don't really affect the elephants
and the inner parts of the elephant

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260

boss sickle Bush is a spine tree a spine
is that modified stem which has got some

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860
is that modified stem which has got some
 

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.710
is that modified stem which has got some
of the leaves growing on them and it's

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720
of the leaves growing on them and it's
 

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.960
of the leaves growing on them and it's
very hard sometimes you can even punch

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:02.970
very hard sometimes you can even punch
 

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.630
very hard sometimes you can even punch
your tyres by driving over the elephant

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640
your tyres by driving over the elephant
 

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:14.170
your tyres by driving over the elephant
dance that is how strong the spine is

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:14.180
 
 

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.420
 
so it's not ideal at all to drive over

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:17.430
so it's not ideal at all to drive over
 

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:20.690
so it's not ideal at all to drive over
the elephant dance but apart from

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700
the elephant dance but apart from
 

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.540
the elephant dance but apart from
running away from the thorns and spines

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:23.550
running away from the thorns and spines
 

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.880
running away from the thorns and spines
by this time of the year after their

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:25.890
by this time of the year after their
 

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.520
by this time of the year after their
heavy rainy season the dung beetles are

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:28.530
heavy rainy season the dung beetles are
 

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.950
heavy rainy season the dung beetles are
back and some of the dung beetles they

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960
back and some of the dung beetles they
 

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.320
back and some of the dung beetles they
feed from underneath dead stop droppings

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:33.330
feed from underneath dead stop droppings
 

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.780
feed from underneath dead stop droppings
and as I have indicated earlier they

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:35.790
and as I have indicated earlier they
 

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.910
and as I have indicated earlier they
prefer the elephant dung and because of

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:37.920
prefer the elephant dung and because of
 

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.730
prefer the elephant dung and because of
that they stay underneath the elephant

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740
that they stay underneath the elephant
 

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.820
that they stay underneath the elephant
dung droppings so you must have to avoid

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:43.830
dung droppings so you must have to avoid
 

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.280
dung droppings so you must have to avoid
driving over the elephant dance by all

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:46.290
driving over the elephant dance by all
 

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.950
driving over the elephant dance by all
means otherwise you are going to kill

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960
means otherwise you are going to kill
 

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.340
means otherwise you are going to kill
the significant insects such as dung

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:52.350
the significant insects such as dung
 

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.240
the significant insects such as dung
beetles who are here in order to

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:55.250
beetles who are here in order to
 

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.940
beetles who are here in order to
facilitate a lot of decomposition in the

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.290
 
so you can see that a very big animal

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:12.300
so you can see that a very big animal
 

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.840
so you can see that a very big animal
can easily hide behind this bushes so

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:14.850
can easily hide behind this bushes so
 

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.690
can easily hide behind this bushes so
now let's cross over to the Maasai Mara

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700
now let's cross over to the Maasai Mara
 

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:27.760
now let's cross over to the Maasai Mara
where David is waiting also to take over

back to Serengeti National Park in

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380
back to Serengeti National Park in
 

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:03.140
back to Serengeti National Park in
Tanzania this is the African Buffalo its

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:24.660
 
you

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:24.670
 
 

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.880
 
so you can see that these elephants are

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:27.890
so you can see that these elephants are
 

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.220
so you can see that these elephants are
slowly moving much more towards our side

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:30.230
slowly moving much more towards our side
 

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.830
slowly moving much more towards our side
I can see that some of these head

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840
I can see that some of these head
 

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.410
I can see that some of these head
members are slowly making their way in

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:35.420
members are slowly making their way in
 

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.690
members are slowly making their way in
it's just that they are being kept busy

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:37.700
it's just that they are being kept busy
 

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.990
it's just that they are being kept busy
by these trees they are getting excited

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000
by these trees they are getting excited
 

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.720
by these trees they are getting excited
with the nutritious trees so I'm just

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:43.730
with the nutritious trees so I'm just
 

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.430
with the nutritious trees so I'm just
gonna try and pull forward a little bit

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440
gonna try and pull forward a little bit
 

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.460
gonna try and pull forward a little bit
as the big one is now approaching a nice

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:48.470
as the big one is now approaching a nice
 

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.190
as the big one is now approaching a nice
and very clear space so we're going to

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200
and very clear space so we're going to
 

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:58.430
and very clear space so we're going to
have a good sighting from there

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440
 
 

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:07.460
 
here they are nice and close so you can

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:07.470
here they are nice and close so you can
 

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.409
here they are nice and close so you can
see that they are just coming from the

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419
see that they are just coming from the
 

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:22.399
see that they are just coming from the
mudbath a child of the universe the

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:22.409
mudbath a child of the universe the
 

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.970
mudbath a child of the universe the
trees is just that a lot of people they

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980
trees is just that a lot of people they
 

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.940
trees is just that a lot of people they
give a different temps when it comes to

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:28.950
give a different temps when it comes to
 

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:31.190
give a different temps when it comes to
the chemicals produced by these trees

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200
the chemicals produced by these trees
 

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.889
the chemicals produced by these trees
some will tell you the trees they

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899
some will tell you the trees they
 

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:36.349
some will tell you the trees they
release a tree fennel in order to

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359
release a tree fennel in order to
 

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:38.720
release a tree fennel in order to
regulate browsing some will tell you

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:38.730
regulate browsing some will tell you
 

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.240
regulate browsing some will tell you
they produce something called a prompt

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:41.250
they produce something called a prompt
 

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.329
they produce something called a prompt
aconitine and some will tell you the

00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339
aconitine and some will tell you the
 

00:34:44.339 --> 00:34:47.089
aconitine and some will tell you the
tree produce attaining all these things

00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099
tree produce attaining all these things
 

00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:50.389
tree produce attaining all these things
they serve same purpose which is a

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399
they serve same purpose which is a
 

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:52.700
they serve same purpose which is a
regulation of the browsing activities on

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:52.710
regulation of the browsing activities on
 

00:34:52.710 --> 00:35:04.030
regulation of the browsing activities on
this face

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040
 
 

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.700
 
so you can see that now these elephants

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:06.710
so you can see that now these elephants
 

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.850
so you can see that now these elephants
are feeding on the grass is not only

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:09.860
are feeding on the grass is not only
 

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.390
are feeding on the grass is not only
specifically feeding on trees so it's a

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400
specifically feeding on trees so it's a
 

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.270
specifically feeding on trees so it's a
confirmation of effect that elephant our

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280
confirmation of effect that elephant our
 

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.360
confirmation of effect that elephant our
Baraka feeders they are not even taking

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:19.370
Baraka feeders they are not even taking
 

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.220
Baraka feeders they are not even taking
the grass is completely from the ground

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:21.230
the grass is completely from the ground
 

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.220
the grass is completely from the ground
sometimes when the shortage of food

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:24.230
sometimes when the shortage of food
 

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.440
sometimes when the shortage of food
availability you will see them taking

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:26.450
availability you will see them taking
 

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.170
availability you will see them taking
the whole plant and shake it in order to

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:29.180
the whole plant and shake it in order to
 

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.350
the whole plant and shake it in order to
get rid of the sand before they take the

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:32.360
get rid of the sand before they take the
 

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.840
get rid of the sand before they take the
grass toodle to the mouth but now they

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:34.850
grass toodle to the mouth but now they
 

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.940
grass toodle to the mouth but now they
are just taking the top part every time

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:36.950
are just taking the top part every time
 

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.100
are just taking the top part every time
taking the top part which is something

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:39.110
taking the top part which is something
 

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.980
taking the top part which is something
good so this shows that elephants they

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:41.990
good so this shows that elephants they
 

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.650
good so this shows that elephants they
do play a significant role when it comes

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:44.660
do play a significant role when it comes
 

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.860
do play a significant role when it comes
to the stimulation of the growth by the

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:47.870
to the stimulation of the growth by the
 

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:57.880
to the stimulation of the growth by the
grasses

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:57.890
 
 

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.980
 
so now let's across over to the Maasai

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:00.990
so now let's across over to the Maasai
 

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.490
so now let's across over to the Maasai
Mara

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500
Mara
 

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.370

where the Buffaloes are also having some

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380
where the Buffaloes are also having some
 

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:15.980
where the Buffaloes are also having some
grasses at the moment difference between

buffaloes and elephants when it comes to

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:18.690
buffaloes and elephants when it comes to
 

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.589
buffaloes and elephants when it comes to
feeding the elephants will variously

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599
feeding the elephants will variously
 

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:25.370
feeding the elephants will variously
diversify and in terms of drought we

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380
diversify and in terms of drought we
 

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.740
diversify and in terms of drought we
have always seen should say the two

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:27.750
have always seen should say the two
 

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.460
have always seen should say the two
species die because of starvation

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:30.470
species die because of starvation
 

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.770
species die because of starvation
elephants may die last elephants are

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780
elephants may die last elephants are
 

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.289

and that is the eastern side of the Mara

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660
and that is the eastern side of the Mara
 

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.329
and that is the eastern side of the Mara
triangle and what we're seeing are very

00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339
triangle and what we're seeing are very
 

00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:59.510
triangle and what we're seeing are very
thick and heavy clouds an indication

00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520
thick and heavy clouds an indication
 

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.930
thick and heavy clouds an indication
that it might be a bit too much later

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:01.940
that it might be a bit too much later
 

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.470
that it might be a bit too much later
but from where we are so far so good as

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480
but from where we are so far so good as
 

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.299
but from where we are so far so good as
Tristan was saying earlier we are on the

00:37:08.299 --> 00:37:08.309
Tristan was saying earlier we are on the
 

00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:11.630
Tristan was saying earlier we are on the
onset of the short rains in Kenya LT in

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640
onset of the short rains in Kenya LT in
 

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.089

so every other day I would say we have

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:17.970
so every other day I would say we have
 

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.970
so every other day I would say we have
had about 40 60 millimetres of rainfall

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980
had about 40 60 millimetres of rainfall
 

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.400
had about 40 60 millimetres of rainfall
that's my guess and there a couple of

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:22.410
that's my guess and there a couple of
 

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.160
that's my guess and there a couple of
days we have had like a whole 36 hours

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:25.170
days we have had like a whole 36 hours
 

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:30.020
days we have had like a whole 36 hours
or frein now that reminds me of June

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:30.030
or frein now that reminds me of June

sub-adults doesn't look like any adult
females within that group I don't think

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:09.560
females within that group I don't think
 

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.200
females within that group I don't think
and they're all just kind of having a

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:11.210
and they're all just kind of having a
 

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:12.790
and they're all just kind of having a
bit of a look but the storm is blowing

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800
bit of a look but the storm is blowing
 

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.040
bit of a look but the storm is blowing
in and you can see the Lions are a lot

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.050
in and you can see the Lions are a lot
 

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.290
in and you can see the Lions are a lot
more away awake than when we first got

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:17.300
more away awake than when we first got
 

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.660
more away awake than when we first got
you now if you look at this storm what's

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:19.670
you now if you look at this storm what's
 

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.520
you now if you look at this storm what's
going to happen is this should sweep in

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:21.530
going to happen is this should sweep in
 

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:23.530
going to happen is this should sweep in
kind of and come along this escarpment

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:23.540
kind of and come along this escarpment
 

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.300
kind of and come along this escarpment
it often does so it often comes along

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:25.310
it often does so it often comes along
 

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.130
it often does so it often comes along
the escarpment here and it starts to

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:27.140
the escarpment here and it starts to
 

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.750
the escarpment here and it starts to
then kind of rain along here and if it

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760
then kind of rain along here and if it
 

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.910
then kind of rain along here and if it
does that well then the conditions are

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920
does that well then the conditions are
 

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.500
does that well then the conditions are
right for lions because one is this

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:32.510
right for lions because one is this
 

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.060
right for lions because one is this
going to be wouldn't which is going to

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:34.070
going to be wouldn't which is going to
 

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.530
going to be wouldn't which is going to
make it very difficult for things like

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:35.540
make it very difficult for things like
 

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.710
make it very difficult for things like
zebra or water back or giraffe which are

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720
zebra or water back or giraffe which are
 

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.840
zebra or water back or giraffe which are
all around this area warthogs to hear

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:40.850
all around this area warthogs to hear
 

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.730
all around this area warthogs to hear
anything the other thing is that you're

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:42.740
anything the other thing is that you're
 

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.160
anything the other thing is that you're
going to get a rain which makes it very

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:45.170
going to get a rain which makes it very
 

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.560
going to get a rain which makes it very
difficult to see and so the Lions then

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:47.570
difficult to see and so the Lions then
 

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:49.060
difficult to see and so the Lions then
utilize that to the advantage it also

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:49.070
utilize that to the advantage it also
 

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.800
utilize that to the advantage it also
gets a lot darker and so they blend in a

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:50.810
gets a lot darker and so they blend in a
 

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.570
gets a lot darker and so they blend in a
little bit better and that could be the

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:52.580
little bit better and that could be the
 

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.890
little bit better and that could be the
perfect kind of thing for them I'm just

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:53.900
perfect kind of thing for them I'm just
 

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.110
perfect kind of thing for them I'm just
sad and in some respects is that that

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:56.120
sad and in some respects is that that
 

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.270
sad and in some respects is that that
buffalo herd is not still milling around

00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280
buffalo herd is not still milling around
 

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.820

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.800
has gotten they must have gone back down
towards the marsh area and it's a bit of

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:05.810
towards the marsh area and it's a bit of
 

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:06.850
towards the marsh area and it's a bit of
a shame because in these conditions

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:06.860
a shame because in these conditions
 

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.830
a shame because in these conditions
Lions I think these lions would have had

Lions I think these lions would have had
 

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.480
Lions I think these lions would have had
a crack at those Buffalo it would have

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:10.490
a crack at those Buffalo it would have
 

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.390
a crack at those Buffalo it would have
been a really interesting kind of

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400
been a really interesting kind of
 

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.920
been a really interesting kind of
development and watching how they would

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:14.930
development and watching how they would
 

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:16.480
development and watching how they would
have gone about it given that there's a

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:16.490
have gone about it given that there's a
 

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.190
have gone about it given that there's a
lot of sub-adults yeah I would have been

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200
lot of sub-adults yeah I would have been
 

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.570
lot of sub-adults yeah I would have been
intrigued to watch them try and hunt

so it provides the perfect backdrop for
 

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.420
so it provides the perfect backdrop for
where they are and what you'll probably

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:45.430
where they are and what you'll probably
 

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.579
where they are and what you'll probably
find is I have a funny feeling that

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:47.589
find is I have a funny feeling that

gonna hand their way up the escarpment
 

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.160
gonna hand their way up the escarpment
which obviously means we're not going to

the left-hand line it's is where that

00:53:43.559 --> 00:53:43.569
the left-hand line it's is where that
 

00:53:43.569 --> 00:53:47.729
the left-hand line it's is where that
rainbow will roughly be there it is this

00:53:47.729 --> 00:53:47.739
rainbow will roughly be there it is this
 

00:53:47.739 --> 00:53:49.410
rainbow will roughly be there it is this
so money is trying to kind of get it

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:49.420
so money is trying to kind of get it

00:54:01.869 --> 00:54:04.049
going across the plains I think it'll be

business exactly that will do but you
 

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:14.430
business exactly that will do but you
can see they're definitely a lot more

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440
can see they're definitely a lot more

00:54:16.859 --> 00:54:16.869
alert than what we had when we finished
 

00:54:16.869 --> 00:54:18.359
alert than what we had when we finished
driving this morning it's exactly what

00:54:18.359 --> 00:54:18.369
driving this morning it's exactly what
 

00:54:18.369 --> 00:54:19.499
driving this morning it's exactly what
we thought the view they would do so

00:54:19.499 --> 00:54:19.509
we thought the view they would do so
 

00:54:19.509 --> 00:54:21.359
we thought the view they would do so
it's kind of raced up and now when the

00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:21.369
it's kind of raced up and now when the
 

00:54:21.369 --> 00:54:22.829
it's kind of raced up and now when the
weather starts to turn with the heat

00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839
weather starts to turn with the heat
 

00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:24.299
weather starts to turn with the heat
that we had today it was bound to happen

00:54:24.299 --> 00:54:24.309
that we had today it was bound to happen
 

00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:27.150
that we had today it was bound to happen
and start to now come into you know

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.160
and start to now come into you know
 

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.499
and start to now come into you know
their own and start to think about

00:54:28.499 --> 00:54:28.509
their own and start to think about
 

00:54:28.509 --> 00:54:31.799
their own and start to think about
finding and looking for any sort of

00:54:31.799 --> 00:54:31.809
finding and looking for any sort of
 

00:54:31.809 --> 00:54:38.190
finding and looking for any sort of
sustenance the fake in it

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200
 
 

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.270
 
so Cathy in in Juma you see them going

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280
so Cathy in in Juma you see them going
 

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.280
so Cathy in in Juma you see them going
for shelter very quickly and there's

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:44.290
for shelter very quickly and there's
 

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:46.110
for shelter very quickly and there's
water back right up on the ridge that

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:46.120
water back right up on the ridge that
 

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.820
water back right up on the ridge that
they probably are watching at the moment

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:47.830
they probably are watching at the moment
 

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:49.980
they probably are watching at the moment
so in Juma you'll find they'll get under

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:49.990
so in Juma you'll find they'll get under
 

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:51.570
so in Juma you'll find they'll get under
the concern they'll just kind of curl up

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:51.580
the concern they'll just kind of curl up
 

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.760
the concern they'll just kind of curl up
in there here in the Mara sometimes the

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:53.770
in there here in the Mara sometimes the
 

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:55.170
in there here in the Mara sometimes the
nearest tree is quite far away and so

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:55.180
nearest tree is quite far away and so
 

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.490
nearest tree is quite far away and so
sometimes they just tough it out they

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:56.500
sometimes they just tough it out they
 

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.010
sometimes they just tough it out they
just sit then they get pelted or they'll

00:54:59.010 --> 00:54:59.020
just sit then they get pelted or they'll
 

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.840
just sit then they get pelted or they'll
try and get to the nearest big tree in

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:00.850
try and get to the nearest big tree in
 

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.430
try and get to the nearest big tree in
which case they'll kind of get under and

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440
which case they'll kind of get under and
 

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.530
which case they'll kind of get under and
they'll just lie there and I mean they

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:04.540
they'll just lie there and I mean they
 

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.730
they'll just lie there and I mean they
still get wait there's really very

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:05.740
still get wait there's really very
 

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.980
still get wait there's really very
little in the way of cover for a lot of

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:07.990
little in the way of cover for a lot of
 

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.080
little in the way of cover for a lot of
the the cats Archer they unfortunately

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.090
the the cats Archer they unfortunately
 

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.850
the the cats Archer they unfortunately
unless they're very close to forested

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:11.860
unless they're very close to forested
 

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.530
unless they're very close to forested
section they're going to just get wet

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:13.540
section they're going to just get wet
 

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:14.640
section they're going to just get wet
and the problem with being in the

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:14.650
and the problem with being in the
 

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:16.710
and the problem with being in the
forested areas is that those are very

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720
forested areas is that those are very
 

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.920
forested areas is that those are very
prone to flash flooding effect and so

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:19.930
prone to flash flooding effect and so
 

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.060
prone to flash flooding effect and so
it's actually not the great place for

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:21.070
it's actually not the great place for
 

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:22.890
it's actually not the great place for
them to be either so they just have to

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:22.900
them to be either so they just have to
 

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.050
them to be either so they just have to
be toughened and take it and they so

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.060
be toughened and take it and they so
 

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.430
be toughened and take it and they so
used to it these lines I mean they've

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440
used to it these lines I mean they've
 

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.620
used to it these lines I mean they've
been getting hit by rain for most of

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:28.630
been getting hit by rain for most of
 

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:30.210
been getting hit by rain for most of
their lives now you'll see the last two

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:30.220
their lives now you'll see the last two
 

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.370
their lives now you'll see the last two
that we left all the way back down there

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:32.380
that we left all the way back down there
 

00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.830
that we left all the way back down there
where we first started they on their way

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:34.840
where we first started they on their way
 

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.540
where we first started they on their way
so that's the young male and the little

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:36.550
so that's the young male and the little
 

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.310
so that's the young male and the little
young female and they're kind of moving

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:38.320
young female and they're kind of moving
 

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.830
young female and they're kind of moving
up towards us as well at the moment

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:40.840
up towards us as well at the moment
 

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.620
up towards us as well at the moment
which is good so the whole pod should

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:43.630
which is good so the whole pod should
 

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:45.300
which is good so the whole pod should
come together now if you want to know

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:45.310
come together now if you want to know
 

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:46.890
come together now if you want to know
where the kind of kitc were male is he's

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:46.900
where the kind of kitc were male is he's
 

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.840
where the kind of kitc were male is he's
pretty much directly across from where

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:48.850
pretty much directly across from where
 

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:51.120
pretty much directly across from where
we are now so on just on the other side

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:51.130
we are now so on just on the other side
 

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:55.590
we are now so on just on the other side
of the forest so if you look at those

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:55.600
of the forest so if you look at those
 

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.060
of the forest so if you look at those
guys just on the other side of the

00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.070
guys just on the other side of the
 

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:58.380
guys just on the other side of the
forest area that's where the Kitchener

00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:58.390
forest area that's where the Kitchener
 

00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:59.970
forest area that's where the Kitchener
male is at the moment we saw a whole

00:55:59.970 --> 00:55:59.980
male is at the moment we saw a whole
 

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.110

bunch of Kazi and I could see him

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:01.120
bunch of Kazi and I could see him
 

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.520
bunch of Kazi and I could see him
through my binaries when we drove fast

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:02.530
through my binaries when we drove fast
 

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:03.840
through my binaries when we drove fast
but I wanted to come to the side just to

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:03.850
but I wanted to come to the side just to

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.220
 
so there's quite a lot of impalas in the

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:56.230
so there's quite a lot of impalas in the
 

01:05:56.230 --> 01:06:01.830
so there's quite a lot of impalas in the
area where we are at the moment a lot of

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:01.840
area where we are at the moment a lot of
 

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.900
area where we are at the moment a lot of
impalas in the area and when there's too

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:03.910
impalas in the area and when there's too
 

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:06.270
impalas in the area and when there's too
much impalas like this it gives me a lot

01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:06.280
much impalas like this it gives me a lot
 

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.880
much impalas like this it gives me a lot

heading to maybe we can be able to see

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:07.910
heading to maybe we can be able to see
 

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:22.150

somewhere here and we were just gonna
 

01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.930
somewhere here and we were just gonna
try and go to the nearest water hole

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940
try and go to the nearest water hole
 

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.820
try and go to the nearest water hole
which is the cheetah cheetah maybe we

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:34.830
which is the cheetah cheetah maybe we
 

01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:36.520
which is the cheetah cheetah maybe we
might be lucky when we get there

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:36.530
might be lucky when we get there
 

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.660
might be lucky when we get there
otherwise I've got to come back and

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:38.670
otherwise I've got to come back and
 

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:53.400
otherwise I've got to come back and
carry on by the juma side

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:53.410
 
 

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.540
 
and niconico

night can see very well what helps the
 

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.890
night can see very well what helps the
animals which are much more active

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:08.900
animals which are much more active
 

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.020
animals which are much more active
during the night to see well is the

leopards and other cats sometimes dogs
as well you will see their good whiskers

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:19.970
as well you will see their good whiskers
 

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.599
as well you will see their good whiskers
here those whiskers are called a very

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:22.609
here those whiskers are called a very
 

01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:25.120
here those whiskers are called a very
CIO those whiskers are not there just

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:25.130
CIO those whiskers are not there just
 

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:27.849
CIO those whiskers are not there just
for decoration they are there to serve a

01:08:27.849 --> 01:08:27.859
for decoration they are there to serve a
 

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:30.520
for decoration they are there to serve a
very significant purpose because they

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:30.530
very significant purpose because they
 

01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:33.970
very significant purpose because they
are connected with the brain they can be

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:33.980
are connected with the brain they can be
 

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:37.780
are connected with the brain they can be
able to pick up what is coming in front

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:37.790
able to pick up what is coming in front
 

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:39.910
able to pick up what is coming in front
and measure the space in within the

01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920
and measure the space in within the
 

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.250
and measure the space in within the
trees as they are walking at night so

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:42.260
trees as they are walking at night so
 

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.740
trees as they are walking at night so
those whiskers are connected with the

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:44.750
those whiskers are connected with the
 

01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:47.289
those whiskers are connected with the
nervous coordination which then conveyed

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:47.299
nervous coordination which then conveyed
 

01:08:47.299 --> 01:08:49.630
nervous coordination which then conveyed
which is getting the message from the

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640
which is getting the message from the
 

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.420
which is getting the message from the
brain in order to alert the animal about

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:52.430
brain in order to alert the animal about
 

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:57.760
brain in order to alert the animal about
the surrounding at night and some beds

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:57.770
the surrounding at night and some beds
 

01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:00.550
the surrounding at night and some beds
as well they do have those kind of

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560
as well they do have those kind of
 

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.650
as well they do have those kind of
whiskers it's just that they are not

01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:02.660
whiskers it's just that they are not
 

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:14.030
whiskers it's just that they are not
called whiskers by the bed

01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040
 
 

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.670
 
so we are now slowly approaching the

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:17.680
so we are now slowly approaching the
 

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.800
so we are now slowly approaching the
cheetah cheetah without all you can see

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:19.810
cheetah cheetah without all you can see
 

01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:21.870
cheetah cheetah without all you can see
right in the middle of the road we have

right in the middle of the road we have
 

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.540
right in the middle of the road we have
got the Egyptian Gil which is saving is

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:24.550
got the Egyptian Gil which is saving is
 

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:26.820
got the Egyptian Gil which is saving is
a big sign that we are not far away from

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:26.830
a big sign that we are not far away from
 

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:29.900

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:02.730
 
 

01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:05.640
 
so again if ours are some of those beds

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:05.650
so again if ours are some of those beds
 

01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:07.380
so again if ours are some of those beds
which will always give you an alarm call

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:07.390
which will always give you an alarm call
 

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:10.200
which will always give you an alarm call
and then it's very easy to distinguish

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:10.210
and then it's very easy to distinguish
 

01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:11.940
and then it's very easy to distinguish
their call from the rest of the beds

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:11.950
their call from the rest of the beds
 

01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:14.370
their call from the rest of the beds
they don't have same call they have got

01:24:14.370 --> 01:24:14.380
they don't have same call they have got
 

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.620
they don't have same call they have got
different kind of course and when they

different kind of course and when they
are not happy about something they are

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:18.670
are not happy about something they are
 

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.970
are not happy about something they are
going to be vocal and making use of a

going to be vocal and making use of a
 

01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:33.690
going to be vocal and making use of a
very unique call

01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:33.700

clients get a little bit more kind of
 

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.410
clients get a little bit more kind of

those two off I think they'll watch them
 

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.500
those two off I think they'll watch them
but I don't think they'll actually have

aware that they are lines around and
 

01:26:02.210 --> 01:26:04.270
aware that they are lines around and
that's why they just slowly kind of

01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280
that's why they just slowly kind of
 

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.310
that's why they just slowly kind of
walking along making sure that there's

01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320
walking along making sure that there's
 

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.530
walking along making sure that there's
no others that are close by every now

01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440
 
 

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.810
 
so I wonder because where we are now

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:22.820
so I wonder because where we are now
 

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:29.470
so I wonder because where we are now
could very well be the window of pride I

01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480
could very well be the window of pride I
 

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.000
could very well be the window of pride I
mean we know the pride that could be

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:31.010
mean we know the pride that could be
 

01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:33.250
mean we know the pride that could be
here as well so it might even be one of

01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:33.260
here as well so it might even be one of
 

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:36.370
here as well so it might even be one of
them that's around which is intriguing

01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:36.380

01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060
different a Gary I agree this is a nice
 

01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.660
different a Gary I agree this is a nice
Impala look at the side of the bodies

01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:05.670
Impala look at the side of the bodies
 

01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:07.640
Impala look at the side of the bodies
you can see those three colors which

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:07.650
you can see those three colors which
 

01:38:07.650 --> 01:38:09.669
you can see those three colors which
break these animals into

01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679
break these animals into
 

01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:11.810
break these animals into
three-dimensional shapes and this

01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820
three-dimensional shapes and this
 

01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:15.110
three-dimensional shapes and this
confuse the Predators the most you know

01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:15.120
confuse the Predators the most you know
 

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.260
confuse the Predators the most you know
the animals they employ the

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:18.270
the animals they employ the
 

01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:21.050
the animals they employ the
anti-predator strategies normally these

01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060
anti-predator strategies normally these
 

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:23.209
anti-predator strategies normally these
anti predatory strategies are part of

01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219
anti predatory strategies are part of
 

01:38:23.219 --> 01:38:26.360
anti predatory strategies are part of
what is called crypsis which is just a

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:26.370
what is called crypsis which is just a
 

01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:28.490
what is called crypsis which is just a
strategy employed by the animals to

01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500
strategy employed by the animals to
 

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.350
strategy employed by the animals to
avoid the detection by the predator

01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360
avoid the detection by the predator
 

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.229
avoid the detection by the predator
these strategies are not perfect because

01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239
these strategies are not perfect because
 

01:38:33.239 --> 01:38:35.689
these strategies are not perfect because
mostly they can only work when the

01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699
mostly they can only work when the
 

01:38:35.699 --> 01:38:38.030
mostly they can only work when the
animal is not moving once the animals

01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040
animal is not moving once the animals
 

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.669
animal is not moving once the animals
start moving is going to destroy the

01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679
start moving is going to destroy the
 

01:38:40.679 --> 01:38:43.310
start moving is going to destroy the
strategy and the predator is going to be

01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320
strategy and the predator is going to be
 

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:47.120
strategy and the predator is going to be
able to see it so the animals such as

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:47.130
able to see it so the animals such as
 

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:49.700
able to see it so the animals such as
the zebras those ones are clever because

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:49.710
the zebras those ones are clever because
 

01:38:49.710 --> 01:38:52.520
the zebras those ones are clever because
they employ something called a dazzle

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:52.530
they employ something called a dazzle
 

01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:55.010
they employ something called a dazzle

the motion where when they're running is
 

01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:00.830
the motion where when they're running is
when they are confusing the Predators so

01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840
when they are confusing the Predators so
 

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.560
when they are confusing the Predators so
they don't use that strategy when they

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:03.570
they don't use that strategy when they
 

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:06.379
they don't use that strategy when they
are stationary when they are running the

01:39:06.379 --> 01:39:06.389
are stationary when they are running the
 

01:39:06.389 --> 01:39:08.930
are stationary when they are running the
stripes dazzles and when the stripes are

01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940
stripes dazzles and when the stripes are
 

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.340
stripes dazzles and when the stripes are
doing that

01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:10.350
doing that
 

01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:13.360
doing that
they give the predator a contradictory

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:13.370
they give the predator a contradictory
 

01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:16.430
they give the predator a contradictory
directional signals so they get confused

01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440
directional signals so they get confused
 

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.100
directional signals so they get confused
on where these animals is going and it's

01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:19.110
on where these animals is going and it's
 

01:39:19.110 --> 01:39:21.230
on where these animals is going and it's
always very difficult for a predator to

01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:21.240
always very difficult for a predator to
 

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:33.610
always very difficult for a predator to
single one out

01:39:33.610 --> 01:39:33.620
 
 

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:37.370
 
so are now less occurs over the Maasai

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.380
so are now less occurs over the Maasai
 

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.700
so are now less occurs over the Maasai

heads are starting to go into that
 

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.070
heads are starting to go into that
typical lion fashion where they start to

01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080
typical lion fashion where they start to
 

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.960
typical lion fashion where they start to
droop a little bit so they kind of look

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:56.970
droop a little bit so they kind of look

they look very unhappy with life so
 

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.200
they look very unhappy with life so
that's where we're at at the moment

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:06.210
that's where we're at at the moment
 

01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:09.050
that's where we're at at the moment
where guys are getting rained on and you

01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060
where guys are getting rained on and you
 

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.100
where guys are getting rained on and you
can see what we were talking about

01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:10.110
can see what we were talking about
 

01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:11.510
can see what we were talking about
earlier everyone is asking about rain

01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520
earlier everyone is asking about rain
 

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.160
earlier everyone is asking about rain
and whether or not they move or do they

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:13.170
and whether or not they move or do they
 

01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.140
and whether or not they move or do they
not like it you can see it's raining now

01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:15.150
not like it you can see it's raining now
 

01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:16.430
not like it you can see it's raining now
and they haven't moved at all so they

01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440
and they haven't moved at all so they
 

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.140
and they haven't moved at all so they
haven't run to the tree you just know

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:18.150
haven't run to the tree you just know
 

01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:19.760
haven't run to the tree you just know
that it's part and parcel so they're

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:19.770
that it's part and parcel so they're
 

01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:21.470
that it's part and parcel so they're
just such air they take it and then they

01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480
just such air they take it and then they
 

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.300
just such air they take it and then they
hope that once it's done they can wake

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:23.310
hope that once it's done they can wake
 

01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:25.460
hope that once it's done they can wake
up and start to kind of move around the

01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:25.470
up and start to kind of move around the
 

01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:26.960
up and start to kind of move around the
lioness that was far in the distance

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:26.970
lioness that was far in the distance
 

01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:28.430
lioness that was far in the distance
still hasn't joined I can't see her

01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440
still hasn't joined I can't see her
 

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.470
still hasn't joined I can't see her
anymore but she hasn't arrived here so

01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480
anymore but she hasn't arrived here so
 

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.670
anymore but she hasn't arrived here so
that's gonna be interesting to see

01:40:31.670 --> 01:40:31.680
that's gonna be interesting to see
 

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.230
that's gonna be interesting to see
whether or not she does start to move in

01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:33.240
whether or not she does start to move in
 

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:35.150
whether or not she does start to move in
this direction and then this story is

01:40:35.150 --> 01:40:35.160
this direction and then this story is
 

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.710
this direction and then this story is
one line is that is weighted not with

01:40:36.710 --> 01:40:36.720
one line is that is weighted not with
 

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.260
one line is that is weighted not with
the group at the moment but the rain is

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:39.270
the group at the moment but the rain is
 

01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:41.870
the group at the moment but the rain is
pelting down and for now these guys are

01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880
pelting down and for now these guys are
 

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.430
pelting down and for now these guys are
sitting I think if we had had a buffalo

01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440
sitting I think if we had had a buffalo
 

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.620
sitting I think if we had had a buffalo
herd here now eirick and we would have

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:45.630
herd here now eirick and we would have
 

01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:49.190
herd here now eirick and we would have
maybe seen some action and seen them

01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:49.200
maybe seen some action and seen them
 

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.840
maybe seen some action and seen them
starting to try and go after them they

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:50.850
starting to try and go after them they
 

01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:53.000
starting to try and go after them they
often do hunt Buffalo in the rain but

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:53.010
often do hunt Buffalo in the rain but
 

01:40:53.010 --> 01:40:55.130
often do hunt Buffalo in the rain but
with nothing really around other than

01:40:55.130 --> 01:40:55.140
with nothing really around other than
 

01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:56.720
with nothing really around other than
those giraffe which we've discussed is

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:56.730
those giraffe which we've discussed is
 

01:40:56.730 --> 01:40:58.670
those giraffe which we've discussed is
not really on the list for the whole

01:40:58.670 --> 01:40:58.680
not really on the list for the whole
 

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:01.310
not really on the list for the whole
hour losses as big giraffe go I mean if

01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320
hour losses as big giraffe go I mean if
 

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.170
hour losses as big giraffe go I mean if
it was a small draft maybe so they can I

01:41:03.170 --> 01:41:03.180
it was a small draft maybe so they can I
 

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.610
it was a small draft maybe so they can I
think weighted out and as it gets a

01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620
think weighted out and as it gets a
 

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.140
think weighted out and as it gets a
little dark and after the rain it's gone

01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:06.150
little dark and after the rain it's gone
 

01:41:06.150 --> 01:41:07.790
little dark and after the rain it's gone
then I think we're gonna start to see

01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800
then I think we're gonna start to see
 

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.330
then I think we're gonna start to see
these guys moving about and starting to

01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:11.340
these guys moving about and starting to
 

01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:13.430
these guys moving about and starting to
kind of look for for some sort of food

01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440
kind of look for for some sort of food
 

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.030
kind of look for for some sort of food
which would be nice

01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040
which would be nice
 

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.680

two-phase but most cats don't like to be
wet so I'm intrigued to see how this

01:47:32.690 --> 01:47:32.700
wet so I'm intrigued to see how this
 

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.340
wet so I'm intrigued to see how this
goes and whether or not you're

01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:34.350
goes and whether or not you're
 

01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:35.840
goes and whether or not you're
successful in the fact that you can slow

will be able to do it but otherwise your
 

01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:43.370
will be able to do it but otherwise your
experiment is going to be a bit flawed

01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380

and then they should form a coalition

02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:10.900
and then they should form a coalition
 

02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:13.660
and then they should form a coalition
how many in each coalition would be

02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:13.670

interesting it I mean if if seven of
them which is what I counted this

02:24:18.730 --> 02:24:18.740

I counted seven Oni if there's seven of
them then that is a big coalition and

02:24:27.730 --> 02:24:27.740
them then that is a big coalition and
 

02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:29.291
them then that is a big coalition and
whether they stick together I'm not sure

02:24:29.291 --> 02:24:29.301
whether they stick together I'm not sure

think we should take this to a lot more

02:27:13.380 --> 02:27:13.390
think we should take this to a lot more
 

02:27:13.390 --> 02:27:15.630
think we should take this to a lot more
people because one is it is incredibly

02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:15.640
people because one is it is incredibly
 

02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:17.820

with it is even more rare so this is
something that we are not going to get

02:27:23.130 --> 02:27:23.140
something that we are not going to get
 

02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:25.200
something that we are not going to get
very often at all and I hope that

02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:25.210
very often at all and I hope that
 

02:27:25.210 --> 02:27:26.250
very often at all and I hope that
they're not going to leave it alone now

insane guys this is a penguin that is

02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:32.960
insane guys this is a penguin that is
 

02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:35.320

so this is very special rights now I

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:45.110
so this is very special rights now I
 

02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:46.840
so this is very special rights now I
think we can go live anyway even though

02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:46.850
think we can go live anyway even though
 

02:28:46.850 --> 02:28:48.940
think we can go live anyway even though
it's not moving let's try and see it

02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:48.950
it's not moving let's try and see it
 

02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:50.950
it's not moving let's try and see it
will come out unfold it eventually it's

02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:50.960
will come out unfold it eventually it's
 

02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:52.360
will come out unfold it eventually it's
not going to stay like that favorite

02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:52.370
not going to stay like that favorite
 

02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:54.220
not going to stay like that favorite
just probably thinks the Lions are still

02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:54.230
just probably thinks the Lions are still
 

02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:56.590
just probably thinks the Lions are still
around so we can still go live and we'll

02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:56.600
around so we can still go live and we'll
 

02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:58.030
around so we can still go live and we'll
discuss the whole thing while the lines

02:28:58.030 --> 02:28:58.040
discuss the whole thing while the lines
 

02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:11.380
discuss the whole thing while the lines
are still close by

02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:11.390
 
 

02:29:11.390 --> 02:29:13.939
 
well good evening everybody and welcome

02:29:13.939 --> 02:29:13.949
well good evening everybody and welcome
 

02:29:13.949 --> 02:29:17.359
well good evening everybody and welcome
to the Maasai Mara and with a very very

02:29:17.359 --> 02:29:17.369
to the Maasai Mara and with a very very
 

02:29:17.369 --> 02:29:20.119
to the Maasai Mara and with a very very
very special animal we've just managed

02:29:20.119 --> 02:29:20.129
very special animal we've just managed
 

02:29:20.129 --> 02:29:22.429
very special animal we've just managed
to find a Pangolin which is curled up in

02:29:22.429 --> 02:29:22.439
to find a Pangolin which is curled up in
 

02:29:22.439 --> 02:29:23.899
to find a Pangolin which is curled up in
a very tight ball at the moment and the

02:29:23.899 --> 02:29:23.909
a very tight ball at the moment and the
 

02:29:23.909 --> 02:29:25.609
a very tight ball at the moment and the
reason why is because lions were

02:29:25.609 --> 02:29:25.619
reason why is because lions were
 

02:29:25.619 --> 02:29:26.960
reason why is because lions were
actually playing with it we didn't

02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:26.970
actually playing with it we didn't
 

02:29:26.970 --> 02:29:28.729
actually playing with it we didn't
realize what the Lions had and we drove

02:29:28.729 --> 02:29:28.739
realize what the Lions had and we drove
 

02:29:28.739 --> 02:29:30.559
realize what the Lions had and we drove
up and they had found this Pangolin and

02:29:30.559 --> 02:29:30.569
up and they had found this Pangolin and
 

02:29:30.569 --> 02:29:31.819
up and they had found this Pangolin and
they were trying to chew into the

02:29:31.819 --> 02:29:31.829
they were trying to chew into the
 

02:29:31.829 --> 02:29:33.469
they were trying to chew into the
penguin but it was too kind of curled up

02:29:33.469 --> 02:29:33.479
penguin but it was too kind of curled up
 

02:29:33.479 --> 02:29:36.199
penguin but it was too kind of curled up
and it's armour plating was too tough

02:29:36.199 --> 02:29:36.209
and it's armour plating was too tough
 

02:29:36.209 --> 02:29:38.029
and it's armour plating was too tough
for it and so the Lions have moved off

02:29:38.029 --> 02:29:38.039
for it and so the Lions have moved off
 

02:29:38.039 --> 02:29:39.859
for it and so the Lions have moved off
and we've sat with the penguin now in

02:29:39.859 --> 02:29:39.869
and we've sat with the penguin now in
 

02:29:39.869 --> 02:29:41.269
and we've sat with the penguin now in
the hope that it's going to start

02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279
the hope that it's going to start
 

02:29:41.279 --> 02:29:43.219
the hope that it's going to start
unraveling and we'll start to get it to

02:29:43.219 --> 02:29:43.229
unraveling and we'll start to get it to
 

02:29:43.229 --> 02:29:46.309
unraveling and we'll start to get it to
move now penguins are an incredible

02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319
move now penguins are an incredible
 

02:29:46.319 --> 02:29:47.989
move now penguins are an incredible
animal they're not something that we get

02:29:47.989 --> 02:29:47.999
animal they're not something that we get
 

02:29:47.999 --> 02:29:50.869
animal they're not something that we get
to see very often at all in fact they're

02:29:50.869 --> 02:29:50.879
to see very often at all in fact they're
 

02:29:50.879 --> 02:29:53.179
to see very often at all in fact they're
an animal that is incredibly rare as the

02:29:53.179 --> 02:29:53.189
an animal that is incredibly rare as the
 

02:29:53.189 --> 02:29:55.279
an animal that is incredibly rare as the
most trafficked animal in the world

02:29:55.279 --> 02:29:55.289
most trafficked animal in the world
 

02:29:55.289 --> 02:29:56.779
most trafficked animal in the world
these days and so they are vitally

02:29:56.779 --> 02:29:56.789
these days and so they are vitally
 

02:29:56.789 --> 02:29:58.519
these days and so they are vitally
important that we actually when we get

02:29:58.519 --> 02:29:58.529
important that we actually when we get
 

02:29:58.529 --> 02:30:01.010
important that we actually when we get
to see one which is like I say extremely

02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020
to see one which is like I say extremely
 

02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:03.139
to see one which is like I say extremely
rare this is only the second time that

02:30:03.139 --> 02:30:03.149
rare this is only the second time that
 

02:30:03.149 --> 02:30:04.909
rare this is only the second time that
we've managed to get a Pangolin on this

02:30:04.909 --> 02:30:04.919
we've managed to get a Pangolin on this
 

02:30:04.919 --> 02:30:07.429
we've managed to get a Pangolin on this
particular product that we produce in

02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439
particular product that we produce in
 

02:30:07.439 --> 02:30:09.739
particular product that we produce in
almost 10 years so that gives you an

02:30:09.739 --> 02:30:09.749
almost 10 years so that gives you an
 

02:30:09.749 --> 02:30:11.899
almost 10 years so that gives you an
idea of how rare these guys are they are

02:30:11.899 --> 02:30:11.909
idea of how rare these guys are they are
 

02:30:11.909 --> 02:30:14.929
idea of how rare these guys are they are
not common at all and so the thing is is

02:30:14.929 --> 02:30:14.939
not common at all and so the thing is is
 

02:30:14.939 --> 02:30:16.750
not common at all and so the thing is is
that they are used for these scales now

02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:16.760
that they are used for these scales now
 

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:18.830
that they are used for these scales now
let's see if it's going to move I

02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840
let's see if it's going to move I
 

02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:20.359
let's see if it's going to move I
thought I saw it just twitch slightly

02:30:20.359 --> 02:30:20.369
thought I saw it just twitch slightly
 

02:30:20.369 --> 02:30:22.130
thought I saw it just twitch slightly
what you'll find with these guys is they

02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:22.140
what you'll find with these guys is they
 

02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:24.080
what you'll find with these guys is they
roll up into this defensive ball and

02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:24.090
roll up into this defensive ball and
 

02:30:24.090 --> 02:30:26.119
roll up into this defensive ball and
they've got this long tail so the tail

02:30:26.119 --> 02:30:26.129
they've got this long tail so the tail
 

02:30:26.129 --> 02:30:27.529
they've got this long tail so the tail
is what's closest to us at the moment

02:30:27.529 --> 02:30:27.539
is what's closest to us at the moment
 

02:30:27.539 --> 02:30:29.599
is what's closest to us at the moment
very difficult to make out and what's

02:30:29.599 --> 02:30:29.609
very difficult to make out and what's
 

02:30:29.609 --> 02:30:31.040
very difficult to make out and what's
actually going on but the tail is

02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:31.050
actually going on but the tail is
 

02:30:31.050 --> 02:30:33.080
actually going on but the tail is
closest to us and it rolls round and

02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:33.090
closest to us and it rolls round and
 

02:30:33.090 --> 02:30:35.119
closest to us and it rolls round and
protects their head and the head tucks

02:30:35.119 --> 02:30:35.129
protects their head and the head tucks
 

02:30:35.129 --> 02:30:39.679
protects their head and the head tucks
in and those hard scales will protect

02:30:39.679 --> 02:30:39.689
in and those hard scales will protect
 

02:30:39.689 --> 02:30:41.630
in and those hard scales will protect
the soft underbelly where the legs and

02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:41.640
the soft underbelly where the legs and
 

02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:43.279
the soft underbelly where the legs and
the face is so that they don't get hurt

02:30:43.279 --> 02:30:43.289
the face is so that they don't get hurt
 

02:30:43.289 --> 02:30:45.290
the face is so that they don't get hurt
when things like lions come across them

02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:45.300
when things like lions come across them
 

02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:46.460
when things like lions come across them
because they're not fast animals and

02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:46.470
because they're not fast animals and
 

02:30:46.470 --> 02:30:47.149
because they're not fast animals and
this does happen

02:30:47.149 --> 02:30:47.159
this does happen
 

02:30:47.159 --> 02:30:49.519
this does happen
nori can it breathe like that yes so if

02:30:49.519 --> 02:30:49.529
nori can it breathe like that yes so if
 

02:30:49.529 --> 02:30:50.899
nori can it breathe like that yes so if
you have a look it's it's a bit tricky

02:30:50.899 --> 02:30:50.909
you have a look it's it's a bit tricky
 

02:30:50.909 --> 02:30:52.699
you have a look it's it's a bit tricky
to see bits in the middle of that there

02:30:52.699 --> 02:30:52.709
to see bits in the middle of that there
 

02:30:52.709 --> 02:30:54.050
to see bits in the middle of that there
you'll see that there's a sort of

02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:54.060
you'll see that there's a sort of
 

02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:56.090
you'll see that there's a sort of
contour which is the the tail coming

02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:56.100
contour which is the the tail coming
 

02:30:56.100 --> 02:30:57.949
contour which is the the tail coming
round and in it this is almost like a

02:30:57.949 --> 02:30:57.959
round and in it this is almost like a
 

02:30:57.959 --> 02:30:59.599
round and in it this is almost like a
little gap that goes down now that's is

02:30:59.599 --> 02:30:59.609
little gap that goes down now that's is
 

02:30:59.609 --> 02:31:01.819
little gap that goes down now that's is
where the actual kind of face will be

02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:01.829
where the actual kind of face will be
 

02:31:01.829 --> 02:31:03.349
where the actual kind of face will be
and so there is air getting in there and

02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359
and so there is air getting in there and
 

02:31:03.359 --> 02:31:05.479
and so there is air getting in there and
they can breathe I've luckily seen quite

02:31:05.479 --> 02:31:05.489
they can breathe I've luckily seen quite
 

02:31:05.489 --> 02:31:07.880

a few pangolins in my time and every

02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:07.890
a few pangolins in my time and every
 

02:31:07.890 --> 02:31:09.139
a few pangolins in my time and every
time they roll up like this they can't

02:31:09.139 --> 02:31:09.149
time they roll up like this they can't
 

02:31:09.149 --> 02:31:10.639
time they roll up like this they can't
stay like this for quite a long time

02:31:10.639 --> 02:31:10.649
stay like this for quite a long time
 

02:31:10.649 --> 02:31:12.229
stay like this for quite a long time
particularly if lions have been around

particularly if lions have been around
 

02:31:12.239 --> 02:31:14.840

when they really sure that the Lions are
 

02:31:18.209 --> 02:31:19.369
when they really sure that the Lions are
gone they might even be curled up

when they really showed that the Lions
 

02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:25.190
when they really showed that the Lions
had disappeared will they then unravel

had disappeared will they then unravel
 

02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:27.650
had disappeared will they then unravel
themselves and they'll start to move and

02:31:27.650 --> 02:31:27.660
themselves and they'll start to move and
 

02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:30.050

thought maybe they've gotten a tortoise

02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:36.150
thought maybe they've gotten a tortoise
 

02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:38.480
thought maybe they've gotten a tortoise
but tortoises aren't out at night and so

02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:38.490
but tortoises aren't out at night and so

Pangolin well penguins will spend their
 

02:32:05.340 --> 02:32:08.140
Pangolin well penguins will spend their
time feeding mostly of things like

02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:08.150
time feeding mostly of things like

four limbs that almost look a little bit

02:32:14.990 --> 02:32:15.000
four limbs that almost look a little bit
 

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.370
four limbs that almost look a little bit
like t-rex when they walk so they're on

02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:16.380
like t-rex when they walk so they're on
 

02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:18.620
like t-rex when they walk so they're on
their back legs to front legs and they

02:32:18.620 --> 02:32:18.630
their back legs to front legs and they
 

02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:20.480
their back legs to front legs and they
have long claws and the claws they'll

02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:20.490
have long claws and the claws they'll
 

02:32:20.490 --> 02:32:23.030
have long claws and the claws they'll
then scrape at the mounts and they open

02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040
then scrape at the mounts and they open
 

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:24.380
then scrape at the mounts and they open
it up and then they have this tongue

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:24.390
it up and then they have this tongue
 

02:32:24.390 --> 02:32:26.420
it up and then they have this tongue
that is pretty much the length of their

02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:26.430
that is pretty much the length of their
 

02:32:26.430 --> 02:32:28.490
that is pretty much the length of their
body so it almost attaches close to

02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500
body so it almost attaches close to
 

02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:30.800
body so it almost attaches close to
their back legs their hips and it kind

02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:30.810
their back legs their hips and it kind
 

02:32:30.810 --> 02:32:32.480
their back legs their hips and it kind
of comes out and it will go down and

02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:32.490
of comes out and it will go down and
 

02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:34.130
of comes out and it will go down and
it's very sticky and it will pull out

02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140
it's very sticky and it will pull out
 

02:32:34.140 --> 02:32:36.020
it's very sticky and it will pull out
those little insects and bring them back

02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:36.030
those little insects and bring them back
 

02:32:36.030 --> 02:32:37.700
those little insects and bring them back
into the mouth and they'll in feed off

02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:37.710
into the mouth and they'll in feed off
 

02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:39.500
into the mouth and they'll in feed off
that and so that's probably why this one

02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:39.510
that and so that's probably why this one
 

02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:41.570
that and so that's probably why this one
is out today after the bit of rain that

02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580
is out today after the bit of rain that
 

02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:44.060
is out today after the bit of rain that
we've had that's going to mean that it's

02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:44.070
we've had that's going to mean that it's
 

02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:48.830
we've had that's going to mean that it's
going to going to show the soils can be

02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840
going to going to show the soils can be
 

02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:50.180
going to going to show the soils can be
softer much easier to dig I just want to

02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:50.190
softer much easier to dig I just want to
 

02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:51.890
softer much easier to dig I just want to
move slightly so you can see if maybe we

02:32:51.890 --> 02:32:51.900
move slightly so you can see if maybe we
 

02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:54.170
move slightly so you can see if maybe we
can just get a view of any Lions that

02:32:54.170 --> 02:32:54.180
can just get a view of any Lions that
 

02:32:54.180 --> 02:32:56.270
can just get a view of any Lions that
might be around the Lions look like they

02:32:56.270 --> 02:32:56.280
might be around the Lions look like they
 

02:32:56.280 --> 02:32:58.730
might be around the Lions look like they
kind of moved off unfortunately into the

02:32:58.730 --> 02:32:58.740
kind of moved off unfortunately into the
 

02:32:58.740 --> 02:33:01.100
kind of moved off unfortunately into the
distance they got fed up of trying to

02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:01.110
distance they got fed up of trying to
 

02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:04.280
distance they got fed up of trying to
kind of go towards this Pangolin and try

02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:04.290
kind of go towards this Pangolin and try
 

02:33:04.290 --> 02:33:06.500
kind of go towards this Pangolin and try
to sort of eat it now they went off in

02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:06.510
to sort of eat it now they went off in
 

02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:08.540
to sort of eat it now they went off in
that distance there you can see as a bit

02:33:08.540 --> 02:33:08.550
that distance there you can see as a bit
 

02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:09.770
that distance there you can see as a bit
of rain that's falling I'm gonna use my

02:33:09.770 --> 02:33:09.780
of rain that's falling I'm gonna use my
 

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:11.780
of rain that's falling I'm gonna use my
spotlight just to give money a bit of

02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:11.790
spotlight just to give money a bit of
 

02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:13.969
spotlight just to give money a bit of
help but unfortunately the Lions have

02:33:13.969 --> 02:33:13.979
help but unfortunately the Lions have
 

02:33:13.979 --> 02:33:19.100
help but unfortunately the Lions have
really disappeared last one I saw is

02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:19.110
really disappeared last one I saw is
 

02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:21.650

grass so we're just gonna get I know I'm

02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:50.170
grass so we're just gonna get I know I'm
 

02:33:50.170 --> 02:33:51.600
grass so we're just gonna get I know I'm
gonna go round a little bit so that we

02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:51.610
gonna go round a little bit so that we
 

02:33:51.610 --> 02:33:54.300
gonna go round a little bit so that we
can see a bit better so we're a little

02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:54.310
can see a bit better so we're a little
 

02:33:54.310 --> 02:33:57.060
can see a bit better so we're a little
bit higher than what the grass is we

02:33:57.060 --> 02:33:57.070
bit higher than what the grass is we
 

02:33:57.070 --> 02:33:58.920
bit higher than what the grass is we
should be able to see a little bit

02:33:58.920 --> 02:33:58.930
should be able to see a little bit
 

02:33:58.930 --> 02:34:00.570
should be able to see a little bit
better so yeah Graham we're right up in

02:34:00.570 --> 02:34:00.580
better so yeah Graham we're right up in
 

02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:01.320
better so yeah Graham we're right up in
the north

02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:01.330
the north
 

02:34:01.330 --> 02:34:04.890
the north
there we go now crystal are penguins

02:34:04.890 --> 02:34:04.900
there we go now crystal are penguins
 

02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:07.710
there we go now crystal are penguins
nocturnal not strictly they are active

02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:07.720
nocturnal not strictly they are active
 

02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:09.420
nocturnal not strictly they are active
more at night so they do like to move

02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:09.430
more at night so they do like to move
 

02:34:09.430 --> 02:34:12.420
more at night so they do like to move
around a lot in the evenings because

02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:12.430
around a lot in the evenings because
 

02:34:12.430 --> 02:34:13.830
around a lot in the evenings because
it's a lot easier for them to go and

02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840
it's a lot easier for them to go and
 

02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.210
it's a lot easier for them to go and
they don't get harassed and spotted as

02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:15.220
they don't get harassed and spotted as
 

02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:17.040
they don't get harassed and spotted as
easily but they are not strictly

02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:17.050
easily but they are not strictly
 

02:34:17.050 --> 02:34:18.570
easily but they are not strictly
nocturnal they can be seen during the

02:34:18.570 --> 02:34:18.580
nocturnal they can be seen during the
 

02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:21.570
nocturnal they can be seen during the
day and I have seen of the this is now

02:34:21.570 --> 02:34:21.580
day and I have seen of the this is now
 

02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:24.800
day and I have seen of the this is now
my 8 from 9th Pangolin that I've seen

02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:24.810
my 8 from 9th Pangolin that I've seen
 

02:34:24.810 --> 02:34:26.190
my 8 from 9th Pangolin that I've seen
two of them

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200
two of them
 

02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:27.690
two of them
we're during the day the rest of all

02:34:27.690 --> 02:34:27.700
we're during the day the rest of all
 

02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:30.270
we're during the day the rest of all
being at night so funny enough out of

02:34:30.270 --> 02:34:30.280
being at night so funny enough out of
 

02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:32.430
being at night so funny enough out of
the Penguins that I've seen to have been

02:34:32.430 --> 02:34:32.440
the Penguins that I've seen to have been
 

02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:34.710
the Penguins that I've seen to have been
accosted by lipids and this one now by

02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:34.720
accosted by lipids and this one now by
 

02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:36.750
accosted by lipids and this one now by
lions and you can see that armour

02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:36.760
lions and you can see that armour
 

02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:38.640
lions and you can see that armour
plating normos looks like a pinecone and

02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:38.650
plating normos looks like a pinecone and
 

02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:41.250
plating normos looks like a pinecone and
that you can see here and basically that

02:34:41.250 --> 02:34:41.260
that you can see here and basically that
 

02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:43.860
that you can see here and basically that
armour plating is like your fingernail

02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:43.870
armour plating is like your fingernail
 

02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:47.520
armour plating is like your fingernail
but incredibly thick so if you had to go

02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:47.530
but incredibly thick so if you had to go
 

02:34:47.530 --> 02:34:49.830
but incredibly thick so if you had to go
and kind of touch that it almost feels

02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840
and kind of touch that it almost feels
 

02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:51.750
and kind of touch that it almost feels
like oh man you can knock on it and it

02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:51.760
like oh man you can knock on it and it
 

02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:53.970
like oh man you can knock on it and it
would be very very hard and that's why

02:34:53.970 --> 02:34:53.980
would be very very hard and that's why
 

02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:55.410
would be very very hard and that's why
the Lions actually leave it alone is

02:34:55.410 --> 02:34:55.420
the Lions actually leave it alone is
 

02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:57.150
the Lions actually leave it alone is
because their mouths just can't get a

02:34:57.150 --> 02:34:57.160
because their mouths just can't get a
 

02:34:57.160 --> 02:34:58.560
because their mouths just can't get a
purchase on it is because of the

02:34:58.560 --> 02:34:58.570
purchase on it is because of the
 

02:34:58.570 --> 02:35:00.270
purchase on it is because of the
hardness and specially tonight when it's

02:35:00.270 --> 02:35:00.280
hardness and specially tonight when it's
 

02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:02.100
hardness and specially tonight when it's
wet so it's slippery and they the teeth

02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:02.110
wet so it's slippery and they the teeth
 

02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:04.230
wet so it's slippery and they the teeth
are just gonna slide on that keratin

02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:04.240
are just gonna slide on that keratin
 

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:06.540
are just gonna slide on that keratin
kind of armor plating and that's why I

02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:06.550
kind of armor plating and that's why I
 

02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:07.740
kind of armor plating and that's why I
eventually they're just going to leave

02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:07.750
eventually they're just going to leave
 

02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:12.260
eventually they're just going to leave
it alone they get frustrated and move on

02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:12.270
 
 

02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:16.080
 
both so penguins are solitary only see

02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:16.090
both so penguins are solitary only see
 

02:35:16.090 --> 02:35:17.460
both so penguins are solitary only see
them by themselves unless of course they

02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:17.470
them by themselves unless of course they
 

02:35:17.470 --> 02:35:19.380
them by themselves unless of course they
have a pup which will mean that they

02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:19.390
have a pup which will mean that they
 

02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:20.970
have a pup which will mean that they
have the little baby and often the baby

02:35:20.970 --> 02:35:20.980
have the little baby and often the baby
 

02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:22.770
have the little baby and often the baby
rides on their back which is super cute

02:35:22.770 --> 02:35:22.780
rides on their back which is super cute
 

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.450
rides on their back which is super cute
that little baby Pangolin is the cutest

02:35:24.450 --> 02:35:24.460
that little baby Pangolin is the cutest
 

02:35:24.460 --> 02:35:26.340
that little baby Pangolin is the cutest
little thing in the world and they'll

02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:26.350
little thing in the world and they'll
 

02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:28.710
little thing in the world and they'll
ride on the back of mom but you're

02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720
ride on the back of mom but you're
 

02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:30.240
ride on the back of mom but you're
solitary otherwise you won't see them in

02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:30.250
solitary otherwise you won't see them in
 

02:35:30.250 --> 02:35:31.530
solitary otherwise you won't see them in
pairs unless of course you very

02:35:31.530 --> 02:35:31.540
pairs unless of course you very
 

02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:33.240
pairs unless of course you very
fortunate and you find mating penguins

02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:33.250
fortunate and you find mating penguins
 

02:35:33.250 --> 02:35:35.580
fortunate and you find mating penguins
which is well then you must go play the

02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:35.590
which is well then you must go play the
 

02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:37.410
which is well then you must go play the
lottery that night because you're gonna

02:35:37.410 --> 02:35:37.420
lottery that night because you're gonna
 

02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:39.341
lottery that night because you're gonna
get very lucky

02:35:39.341 --> 02:35:39.351
get very lucky
 

02:35:39.351 --> 02:35:41.520
get very lucky
so Stephanie it's obviously very

02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:41.530
so Stephanie it's obviously very
 

02:35:41.530 --> 02:35:43.720
so Stephanie it's obviously very
difficult for you to be able to get any

02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:43.730
difficult for you to be able to get any
 

02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:46.930
difficult for you to be able to get any
idea of a sense of scale before these

02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:46.940
idea of a sense of scale before these
 

02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:50.041
idea of a sense of scale before these
guys and so basically in terms of size

02:35:50.041 --> 02:35:50.051
guys and so basically in terms of size
 

02:35:50.051 --> 02:35:53.770
guys and so basically in terms of size
if it was to unravel and to basically

02:35:53.770 --> 02:35:53.780
if it was to unravel and to basically
 

02:35:53.780 --> 02:35:56.320
if it was to unravel and to basically
stand and and it have its tail dead

02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:56.330
stand and and it have its tail dead
 

02:35:56.330 --> 02:35:59.200
stand and and it have its tail dead
straight and its nose out it would be

02:35:59.200 --> 02:35:59.210
straight and its nose out it would be
 

02:35:59.210 --> 02:36:01.270
straight and its nose out it would be
probably from the dashboard so from

02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280
probably from the dashboard so from
 

02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:03.490
probably from the dashboard so from
about there to the end of the dashboard

02:36:03.490 --> 02:36:03.500
about there to the end of the dashboard
 

02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:05.461
about there to the end of the dashboard
so there abouts what's that

02:36:05.461 --> 02:36:05.471
so there abouts what's that
 

02:36:05.471 --> 02:36:09.730
so there abouts what's that
maybe my arm's length so just over about

02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:09.740
maybe my arm's length so just over about
 

02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:12.461
maybe my arm's length so just over about
a meter from the tip of the tail now I

02:36:12.461 --> 02:36:12.471
a meter from the tip of the tail now I
 

02:36:12.471 --> 02:36:14.980
a meter from the tip of the tail now I
actually do have a photo of one that I

02:36:14.980 --> 02:36:14.990
actually do have a photo of one that I
 

02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:17.171
actually do have a photo of one that I
can show you in there and Revels now

02:36:17.171 --> 02:36:17.181
can show you in there and Revels now
 

02:36:17.181 --> 02:36:18.520
can show you in there and Revels now
this particular species that we're

02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:18.530
this particular species that we're
 

02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:20.921
this particular species that we're
seeing I'm just trying to see where I

02:36:20.921 --> 02:36:20.931
seeing I'm just trying to see where I
 

02:36:20.931 --> 02:36:24.610
seeing I'm just trying to see where I
can get a photo for you this particular

02:36:24.610 --> 02:36:24.620
can get a photo for you this particular
 

02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:26.890
can get a photo for you this particular
species is called a Timmons ground

02:36:26.890 --> 02:36:26.900
species is called a Timmons ground
 

02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:30.400
species is called a Timmons ground
Pangolin which is the species that you

02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:30.410
Pangolin which is the species that you
 

02:36:30.410 --> 02:36:32.650
Pangolin which is the species that you
get here in East Africa down towards

02:36:32.650 --> 02:36:32.660
get here in East Africa down towards
 

02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:35.080
get here in East Africa down towards
South Africa you get them then in the

02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:35.090
South Africa you get them then in the
 

02:36:35.090 --> 02:36:37.900
South Africa you get them then in the
Congo and and forest areas of South

02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:37.910
Congo and and forest areas of South
 

02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:40.030
Congo and and forest areas of South
Africa I mean out of Africa sorry you

02:36:40.030 --> 02:36:40.040
Africa I mean out of Africa sorry you
 

02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:42.580
Africa I mean out of Africa sorry you
will get black build pangolins tree

02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:42.590
will get black build pangolins tree
 

02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:44.200
will get black build pangolins tree
pangolins and so a few other different

02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:44.210
pangolins and so a few other different
 

02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:48.341
pangolins and so a few other different
species as well Kathy they are voracious

02:36:48.341 --> 02:36:48.351
species as well Kathy they are voracious
 

02:36:48.351 --> 02:36:50.140
species as well Kathy they are voracious
you have to be very careful they all

02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:50.150
you have to be very careful they all
 

02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:51.430
you have to be very careful they all
attack you at the moment now I'm

02:36:51.430 --> 02:36:51.440
attack you at the moment now I'm
 

02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:53.501
attack you at the moment now I'm
checking there well not attack a person

02:36:53.501 --> 02:36:53.511
checking there well not attack a person
 

02:36:53.511 --> 02:36:56.680
checking there well not attack a person
they are all completely harmless to

02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:56.690
they are all completely harmless to
 

02:36:56.690 --> 02:36:59.261
they are all completely harmless to
people so basically and that's what

02:36:59.261 --> 02:36:59.271
people so basically and that's what
 

02:36:59.271 --> 02:37:01.751
people so basically and that's what
makes them a bit of why they so

02:37:01.751 --> 02:37:01.761
makes them a bit of why they so
 

02:37:01.761 --> 02:37:03.490
makes them a bit of why they so
threatened is because they don't really

02:37:03.490 --> 02:37:03.500
threatened is because they don't really
 

02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:05.440
threatened is because they don't really
have any defence people come across this

02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:05.450
have any defence people come across this
 

02:37:05.450 --> 02:37:06.970
have any defence people come across this
animal it's got nothing that it can do

02:37:06.970 --> 02:37:06.980
animal it's got nothing that it can do
 

02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:08.320
animal it's got nothing that it can do
other than roll into a ball like this

02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:08.330
other than roll into a ball like this
 

02:37:08.330 --> 02:37:09.850
other than roll into a ball like this
now which works really well for

02:37:09.850 --> 02:37:09.860
now which works really well for
 

02:37:09.860 --> 02:37:11.830
now which works really well for
predators that are natural to them but

02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840
predators that are natural to them but
 

02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:13.990
predators that are natural to them but
as people obviously you know we can we

02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000
as people obviously you know we can we
 

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.001
as people obviously you know we can we
can get through that and so no they

02:37:16.001 --> 02:37:16.011
can get through that and so no they
 

02:37:16.011 --> 02:37:18.280
can get through that and so no they
don't release any sort of gas they don't

02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:18.290
don't release any sort of gas they don't
 

02:37:18.290 --> 02:37:20.020
don't release any sort of gas they don't
release any sort of substance that can

02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:20.030
release any sort of substance that can
 

02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:21.461
release any sort of substance that can
burn your skin or anything like that the

02:37:21.461 --> 02:37:21.471
burn your skin or anything like that the
 

02:37:21.471 --> 02:37:22.720
burn your skin or anything like that the
only thing they can do is roll in this

02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:22.730
only thing they can do is roll in this
 

02:37:22.730 --> 02:37:24.430
only thing they can do is roll in this
ball but I will tell you something is if

02:37:24.430 --> 02:37:24.440
ball but I will tell you something is if
 

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:26.350
ball but I will tell you something is if
you pick them up and they agitate it

02:37:26.350 --> 02:37:26.360
you pick them up and they agitate it
 

02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:27.370
you pick them up and they agitate it
what they do is they want to survive

02:37:27.370 --> 02:37:27.380
what they do is they want to survive
 

02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:31.180
what they do is they want to survive
break their body and those scales move

02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:31.190
break their body and those scales move
 

02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:33.041
break their body and those scales move
and they actually can lacerate your

02:37:33.041 --> 02:37:33.051
and they actually can lacerate your
 

02:37:33.051 --> 02:37:34.390
and they actually can lacerate your
hands quite quickly you can see how

02:37:34.390 --> 02:37:34.400
hands quite quickly you can see how
 

02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:36.220
hands quite quickly you can see how
chipped and broken those scales are and

02:37:36.220 --> 02:37:36.230
chipped and broken those scales are and
 

02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:38.230
chipped and broken those scales are and
that's all kind of going to cut you up

02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240
that's all kind of going to cut you up
 

02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:39.881
that's all kind of going to cut you up
if you try and pick them up so normally

02:37:39.881 --> 02:37:39.891
if you try and pick them up so normally
 

02:37:39.891 --> 02:37:41.171
if you try and pick them up so normally
what happens is people grab them with

02:37:41.171 --> 02:37:41.181
what happens is people grab them with
 

02:37:41.181 --> 02:37:43.961
what happens is people grab them with
bags into bags and then they they take

02:37:43.961 --> 02:37:43.971
bags into bags and then they they take
 

02:37:43.971 --> 02:37:45.970
bags into bags and then they they take
them out of the reserves illegally and

02:37:45.970 --> 02:37:45.980
them out of the reserves illegally and
 

02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:47.740
them out of the reserves illegally and
then from there normally is they are

02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:47.750
then from there normally is they are
 

02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:50.140
then from there normally is they are
boiled whole like this and in the scales

02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:50.150
boiled whole like this and in the scales
 

02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:52.301
boiled whole like this and in the scales
are pulled off and used so it's a bit of

02:37:52.301 --> 02:37:52.311
are pulled off and used so it's a bit of
 

02:37:52.311 --> 02:37:52.840
are pulled off and used so it's a bit of
a

02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:52.850
a
 

02:37:52.850 --> 02:37:54.519
a
a problem and like I said they are the

02:37:54.519 --> 02:37:54.529
a problem and like I said they are the
 

02:37:54.529 --> 02:37:56.620
a problem and like I said they are the
most trafficked animal in the world

02:37:56.620 --> 02:37:56.630
most trafficked animal in the world
 

02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:59.229
most trafficked animal in the world
currently which is pretty scary so it's

02:37:59.229 --> 02:37:59.239
currently which is pretty scary so it's
 

02:37:59.239 --> 02:38:02.609
currently which is pretty scary so it's
a horrible thing to think that we've got

02:38:02.609 --> 02:38:02.619
a horrible thing to think that we've got
 

02:38:02.619 --> 02:38:04.750
a horrible thing to think that we've got
animals out here that are being poached

02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760
animals out here that are being poached
 

02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:06.399
animals out here that are being poached
at the rate that they are and tons and

02:38:06.399 --> 02:38:06.409
at the rate that they are and tons and
 

02:38:06.409 --> 02:38:08.769
at the rate that they are and tons and
tons and tons of Pangolin scales are

02:38:08.769 --> 02:38:08.779
tons and tons of Pangolin scales are
 

02:38:08.779 --> 02:38:12.939
tons and tons of Pangolin scales are
leaving Indonesia and Africa every every

to armadillos well no not really they're

02:38:18.219 --> 02:38:18.229
to armadillos well no not really they're
 

02:38:18.229 --> 02:38:20.889
to armadillos well no not really they're
not the same species armadillo has a

02:38:20.889 --> 02:38:20.899
not the same species armadillo has a
 

02:38:20.899 --> 02:38:23.080
not the same species armadillo has a
kind of softish body in comparison to

02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:23.090
kind of softish body in comparison to
 

02:38:23.090 --> 02:38:24.820
kind of softish body in comparison to
these guys so they're in their own

02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:24.830
these guys so they're in their own
 

02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:26.559
these guys so they're in their own
little grouping altogether now I'm

02:38:26.559 --> 02:38:26.569
little grouping altogether now I'm
 

02:38:26.569 --> 02:38:28.870
little grouping altogether now I'm
trying to find okay there we go so I

02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880
trying to find okay there we go so I
 

02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:30.580
trying to find okay there we go so I
found a photo of it that I can show you

02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:30.590
found a photo of it that I can show you
 

02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:33.099
found a photo of it that I can show you
guys I just want to quickly adjust the

02:38:33.099 --> 02:38:33.109
guys I just want to quickly adjust the
 

02:38:33.109 --> 02:38:34.540
guys I just want to quickly adjust the
brightness so that we can actually see

02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:34.550
brightness so that we can actually see
 

02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:36.399
brightness so that we can actually see
my phone is decided because it's dark

02:38:36.399 --> 02:38:36.409
my phone is decided because it's dark
 

02:38:36.409 --> 02:38:37.809
my phone is decided because it's dark
that it must have a very low brightness

02:38:37.809 --> 02:38:37.819
that it must have a very low brightness
 

02:38:37.819 --> 02:38:40.149
that it must have a very low brightness
so we'll just try to get that up there

02:38:40.149 --> 02:38:40.159
so we'll just try to get that up there
 

02:38:40.159 --> 02:38:42.729
so we'll just try to get that up there
we go okay so basically this is what

02:38:42.729 --> 02:38:42.739
we go okay so basically this is what
 

02:38:42.739 --> 02:38:45.960
we go okay so basically this is what
these guys look like when they are

02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:45.970
these guys look like when they are
 

02:38:45.970 --> 02:38:50.109
these guys look like when they are
unraveled so they're very very scaly and

02:38:50.109 --> 02:38:50.119
unraveled so they're very very scaly and
 

02:38:50.119 --> 02:38:52.179
unraveled so they're very very scaly and
you can see a long long long tail now

02:38:52.179 --> 02:38:52.189
you can see a long long long tail now
 

02:38:52.189 --> 02:38:54.250
you can see a long long long tail now
that tail needs to be long one to

02:38:54.250 --> 02:38:54.260
that tail needs to be long one to
 

02:38:54.260 --> 02:38:55.510
that tail needs to be long one to
balance them because they walk on their

02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520
balance them because they walk on their
 

02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:56.950
balance them because they walk on their
back legs only you see their front legs

02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960
back legs only you see their front legs
 

02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.450
back legs only you see their front legs
are carried forward almost like a t-rex

02:38:58.450 --> 02:38:58.460
are carried forward almost like a t-rex
 

02:38:58.460 --> 02:39:01.510
are carried forward almost like a t-rex
and in this back tail will actually wrap

02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520
and in this back tail will actually wrap
 

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:03.460
and in this back tail will actually wrap
around like we're seeing now to protect

02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:03.470
around like we're seeing now to protect
 

02:39:03.470 --> 02:39:05.170
around like we're seeing now to protect

this is not a higher is a picture but we
 

02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:10.780
this is not a higher is a picture but we
can zoom in a little bit you can see

02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:10.790
can zoom in a little bit you can see
 

02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:13.719
can zoom in a little bit you can see

tongue will come out of that snot there
 

02:39:21.470 --> 02:39:23.290
tongue will come out of that snot there
and they'll then pick it up and go back

02:39:23.290 --> 02:39:23.300
and they'll then pick it up and go back
 

02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:25.570
and they'll then pick it up and go back
in which is absolutely amazing

02:39:25.570 --> 02:39:25.580
in which is absolutely amazing

years out in the wilderness is of
 

02:39:43.159 --> 02:39:45.189
years out in the wilderness is of
various parts of Africa to only have

02:39:45.189 --> 02:39:45.199
various parts of Africa to only have
 

02:39:45.199 --> 02:39:47.740
various parts of Africa to only have
seen 8 or 9 of them in that time gives

02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:47.750
seen 8 or 9 of them in that time gives
 

02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:49.719
seen 8 or 9 of them in that time gives
you an idea of how rare they are and I

worked before they reckon met with
 

02:40:19.789 --> 02:40:21.819
worked before they reckon met with
pangolins that this is how they do

02:40:21.819 --> 02:40:21.829
pangolins that this is how they do
 

02:40:21.829 --> 02:40:23.290
pangolins that this is how they do
they'll curl up like this if they've

02:40:23.290 --> 02:40:23.300
they'll curl up like this if they've
 

02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:25.269
they'll curl up like this if they've
been attacked by a predator and they sit

02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279
been attacked by a predator and they sit
 

02:40:25.279 --> 02:40:27.340
been attacked by a predator and they sit
like this and if you're talking and

02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:27.350
like this and if you're talking and
 

02:40:27.350 --> 02:40:28.599
like this and if you're talking and
those kind of things they stay like that

02:40:28.599 --> 02:40:28.609
those kind of things they stay like that
 

02:40:28.609 --> 02:40:31.059
those kind of things they stay like that
as soon as you if you want them to move

02:40:31.059 --> 02:40:31.069
as soon as you if you want them to move
 

02:40:31.069 --> 02:40:32.920
as soon as you if you want them to move
they always say that you start your car

02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:32.930
they always say that you start your car
 

02:40:32.930 --> 02:40:34.599
they always say that you start your car
now I'm not sure that that's true

02:40:34.599 --> 02:40:34.609
now I'm not sure that that's true
 

02:40:34.609 --> 02:40:36.489
now I'm not sure that that's true
because we started our car just now and

02:40:36.489 --> 02:40:36.499
because we started our car just now and
 

02:40:36.499 --> 02:40:38.800
because we started our car just now and
it didn't move it just decided to stay

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:38.810
it didn't move it just decided to stay
 

02:40:38.810 --> 02:40:40.119
it didn't move it just decided to stay
killed up I think it's got the fright of

02:40:40.119 --> 02:40:40.129
killed up I think it's got the fright of
 

02:40:40.129 --> 02:40:42.580
killed up I think it's got the fright of
its life and I would too if I had had 13

02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:42.590
its life and I would too if I had had 13
 

02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:45.010
its life and I would too if I had had 13
lines on top of me as well at one point

02:40:45.010 --> 02:40:45.020
lines on top of me as well at one point
 

02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:46.929
lines on top of me as well at one point
so there was I think at one point there

02:40:46.929 --> 02:40:46.939
so there was I think at one point there
 

02:40:46.939 --> 02:40:48.519
so there was I think at one point there
was six of them but like I said we had

02:40:48.519 --> 02:40:48.529
was six of them but like I said we had
 

02:40:48.529 --> 02:40:49.689
was six of them but like I said we had
no idea what they were doing they just

02:40:49.689 --> 02:40:49.699
no idea what they were doing they just
 

02:40:49.699 --> 02:40:50.920
no idea what they were doing they just
look like they were grooming each other

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:50.930
look like they were grooming each other
 

02:40:50.930 --> 02:40:54.550
look like they were grooming each other
and it couldn't really see what was

02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560
and it couldn't really see what was
 

02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:56.109
and it couldn't really see what was
actually going on and so I was kind of

02:40:56.109 --> 02:40:56.119
actually going on and so I was kind of
 

02:40:56.119 --> 02:40:57.670
actually going on and so I was kind of
thinking to myself you know they

02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680
thinking to myself you know they
 

02:40:57.680 --> 02:40:59.500
thinking to myself you know they
grooming quite a lot and then I some of

02:40:59.500 --> 02:40:59.510
grooming quite a lot and then I some of
 

02:40:59.510 --> 02:41:00.880
grooming quite a lot and then I some of
them started to leave and others stayed

02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:00.890
them started to leave and others stayed
 

02:41:00.890 --> 02:41:02.469
them started to leave and others stayed
behind and I thought no there's

02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479
behind and I thought no there's
 

02:41:02.479 --> 02:41:04.210
behind and I thought no there's
something wrong here because lions

02:41:04.210 --> 02:41:04.220
something wrong here because lions
 

02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:06.639
something wrong here because lions
typically if one goes they may all start

02:41:06.639 --> 02:41:06.649
typically if one goes they may all start
 

02:41:06.649 --> 02:41:09.819
typically if one goes they may all start
to get up and start to move around but

02:41:09.819 --> 02:41:09.829
to get up and start to move around but
 

02:41:09.829 --> 02:41:13.779
to get up and start to move around but
yet this one kind of a lot of them

02:41:13.779 --> 02:41:13.789
yet this one kind of a lot of them
 

02:41:13.789 --> 02:41:17.080
yet this one kind of a lot of them
stayed behind and so I thought to myself

02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:17.090
stayed behind and so I thought to myself
 

02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:19.210
stayed behind and so I thought to myself
well maybe it's something else that

02:41:19.210 --> 02:41:19.220
well maybe it's something else that
 

02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:23.199
well maybe it's something else that
they've managed to find and so we kind

02:41:23.199 --> 02:41:23.209
they've managed to find and so we kind
 

02:41:23.209 --> 02:41:24.670
they've managed to find and so we kind
of came a little bit closer and it was a

02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:24.680
of came a little bit closer and it was a
 

02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:25.569
of came a little bit closer and it was a
penguin which is crazy

02:41:25.569 --> 02:41:25.579
penguin which is crazy
 

02:41:25.579 --> 02:41:27.550
penguin which is crazy
now I call it the life span for these

02:41:27.550 --> 02:41:27.560
now I call it the life span for these
 

02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:31.869
now I call it the life span for these
guys tricky they saw understudied but

02:41:31.869 --> 02:41:31.879
guys tricky they saw understudied but
 

02:41:31.879 --> 02:41:33.699
guys tricky they saw understudied but
reckoned to be about twenty years so I'm

02:41:33.699 --> 02:41:33.709
reckoned to be about twenty years so I'm
 

02:41:33.709 --> 02:41:35.019
reckoned to be about twenty years so I'm
anywhere between sort of eighteen and

02:41:35.019 --> 02:41:35.029
anywhere between sort of eighteen and
 

02:41:35.029 --> 02:41:37.029
anywhere between sort of eighteen and
twenty years would be about the right

02:41:37.029 --> 02:41:37.039
twenty years would be about the right
 

02:41:37.039 --> 02:41:40.179
twenty years would be about the right
lifespan for these guys but like I say

02:41:40.179 --> 02:41:40.189
lifespan for these guys but like I say
 

02:41:40.189 --> 02:41:43.269
lifespan for these guys but like I say
because they're so shy and so reclusive

02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279
because they're so shy and so reclusive
 

02:41:43.279 --> 02:41:45.489
because they're so shy and so reclusive
there's so little that really known

02:41:45.489 --> 02:41:45.499
there's so little that really known
 

02:41:45.499 --> 02:41:46.899
there's so little that really known
about penguins and there's only a

02:41:46.899 --> 02:41:46.909
about penguins and there's only a
 

02:41:46.909 --> 02:41:48.279
about penguins and there's only a
handful of people that have actually

02:41:48.279 --> 02:41:48.289
handful of people that have actually
 

02:41:48.289 --> 02:41:49.929
handful of people that have actually
studied this particular species of

02:41:49.929 --> 02:41:49.939
studied this particular species of
 

02:41:49.939 --> 02:41:52.929
studied this particular species of
Pangolin with any sort of success and

02:41:52.929 --> 02:41:52.939
Pangolin with any sort of success and
 

02:41:52.939 --> 02:41:54.670
Pangolin with any sort of success and
and because it's around at night it

02:41:54.670 --> 02:41:54.680
and because it's around at night it
 

02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:56.590
and because it's around at night it
makes it even more tricky to find and

02:41:56.590 --> 02:41:56.600
makes it even more tricky to find and
 

02:41:56.600 --> 02:41:58.449
makes it even more tricky to find and
the one guy that did study them was a

02:41:58.449 --> 02:41:58.459
the one guy that did study them was a
 

02:41:58.459 --> 02:42:00.429
the one guy that did study them was a
guy that worked in the sabi sands Game

02:42:00.429 --> 02:42:00.439
guy that worked in the sabi sands Game
 

02:42:00.439 --> 02:42:02.649

his name is Jonathan SWAT and he's

02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:08.510
his name is Jonathan SWAT and he's
 

02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:09.609
his name is Jonathan SWAT and he's
written them some really interesting

02:42:09.609 --> 02:42:09.619
written them some really interesting
 

02:42:09.619 --> 02:42:11.349
written them some really interesting
stuff about penguins but used to go out

02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359
stuff about penguins but used to go out
 

02:42:11.359 --> 02:42:13.569
stuff about penguins but used to go out
on foot and used to track penguins that

02:42:13.569 --> 02:42:13.579
on foot and used to track penguins that
 

02:42:13.579 --> 02:42:15.340
on foot and used to track penguins that
he had tagged and he would walk around

02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:15.350
he had tagged and he would walk around
 

02:42:15.350 --> 02:42:17.559
he had tagged and he would walk around
at night with a spotlight by himself now

02:42:17.559 --> 02:42:17.569
at night with a spotlight by himself now
 

02:42:17.569 --> 02:42:19.479
at night with a spotlight by himself now
you walk around in the bush it is not a

02:42:19.479 --> 02:42:19.489
you walk around in the bush it is not a
 

02:42:19.489 --> 02:42:20.530
you walk around in the bush it is not a
very pleasant experience

02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:20.540
very pleasant experience
 

02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:22.090
very pleasant experience
you got to walk through elephants

02:42:22.090 --> 02:42:22.100
you got to walk through elephants
 

02:42:22.100 --> 02:42:24.610
you got to walk through elephants
leopard lion hyenas just to follow these

02:42:24.610 --> 02:42:24.620
leopard lion hyenas just to follow these
 

02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:25.720
leopard lion hyenas just to follow these
guys around and so it makes it

02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:25.730
guys around and so it makes it
 

02:42:25.730 --> 02:42:27.761
guys around and so it makes it
incredibly tough and the problem with

02:42:27.761 --> 02:42:27.771
incredibly tough and the problem with
 

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:29.590
incredibly tough and the problem with
them is that they spend an advanced

02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600
them is that they spend an advanced
 

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:32.830
them is that they spend an advanced
majority of their time hanging around

02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:32.840
majority of their time hanging around
 

02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:34.600
majority of their time hanging around
and so money is just having a little

02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:34.610
and so money is just having a little
 

02:42:34.610 --> 02:42:36.940
and so money is just having a little
scan trying to see if the lines are

02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:36.950
scan trying to see if the lines are
 

02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:39.790
scan trying to see if the lines are
anywhere near the vast majority of their

02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:39.800
anywhere near the vast majority of their
 

02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:42.610
anywhere near the vast majority of their
time moving and darker conditions and so

02:42:42.610 --> 02:42:42.620
time moving and darker conditions and so
 

02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:44.410
time moving and darker conditions and so
they also move in places we ain't

02:42:44.410 --> 02:42:44.420
they also move in places we ain't
 

02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:46.450
they also move in places we ain't
vehicles of going to really struggle to

02:42:46.450 --> 02:42:46.460
vehicles of going to really struggle to
 

02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:48.940
vehicles of going to really struggle to
go and so unfortunately you know they

02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:48.950
go and so unfortunately you know they
 

02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:50.920
go and so unfortunately you know they
they're one of those species that it's

02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:50.930
they're one of those species that it's
 

02:42:50.930 --> 02:42:54.011
they're one of those species that it's
very tricky to actually be able to study

02:42:54.011 --> 02:42:54.021
very tricky to actually be able to study
 

02:42:54.021 --> 02:42:55.810
very tricky to actually be able to study
and so that's why there's very little on

02:42:55.810 --> 02:42:55.820
and so that's why there's very little on
 

02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:57.940
and so that's why there's very little on
it but I actually can't believe that

02:42:57.940 --> 02:42:57.950
it but I actually can't believe that
 

02:42:57.950 --> 02:42:59.950
it but I actually can't believe that
we've seen a Pangolin tonight like I

02:42:59.950 --> 02:42:59.960
we've seen a Pangolin tonight like I
 

02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:02.230
we've seen a Pangolin tonight like I
like I say it's not the most riveting in

02:43:02.230 --> 02:43:02.240
like I say it's not the most riveting in
 

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:07.090
like I say it's not the most riveting in
terms of its movements but to be able to

02:43:07.090 --> 02:43:07.100
terms of its movements but to be able to
 

02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:09.610
terms of its movements but to be able to
see this is so special now Connor what

02:43:09.610 --> 02:43:09.620
see this is so special now Connor what
 

02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:11.160
see this is so special now Connor what
is the rarest species of Pangolin

02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:11.170
is the rarest species of Pangolin
 

02:43:11.170 --> 02:43:15.520
is the rarest species of Pangolin
probably oh I mean I I read an article

02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:15.530
probably oh I mean I I read an article
 

02:43:15.530 --> 02:43:17.261
probably oh I mean I I read an article
about this the other day and because

02:43:17.261 --> 02:43:17.271
about this the other day and because
 

02:43:17.271 --> 02:43:20.380
about this the other day and because
they so sort of understudied apparently

02:43:20.380 --> 02:43:20.390
they so sort of understudied apparently
 

02:43:20.390 --> 02:43:22.600
they so sort of understudied apparently
it's I think it's the black bellied I

02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:22.610
it's I think it's the black bellied I
 

02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:24.370
it's I think it's the black bellied I
might be wrong so I have a black belly -

02:43:24.370 --> 02:43:24.380
might be wrong so I have a black belly -
 

02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:25.720
might be wrong so I have a black belly -
a white belly penguin one of the two of

02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:25.730
a white belly penguin one of the two of
 

02:43:25.730 --> 02:43:29.770
a white belly penguin one of the two of
them that is the rarest if I'm correct

02:43:29.770 --> 02:43:29.780
them that is the rarest if I'm correct
 

02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:31.540
them that is the rarest if I'm correct
I'm I'm just going to double check that

02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:31.550
I'm I'm just going to double check that
 

02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:34.390
I'm I'm just going to double check that
though but this particular one here is

02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:34.400
though but this particular one here is
 

02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:37.830
though but this particular one here is
not as sort of high up on the list of

02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840
not as sort of high up on the list of
 

02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:40.480
not as sort of high up on the list of
rarities they are quite widespread and

02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:40.490
rarities they are quite widespread and
 

02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:41.830
rarities they are quite widespread and
there's probably a lot more of these

02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840
there's probably a lot more of these
 

02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:44.830
there's probably a lot more of these
than we even know it's just when you

02:43:44.830 --> 02:43:44.840
than we even know it's just when you
 

02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:47.650
than we even know it's just when you
drive along not many people are going to

spot that in Ross like this we just

02:43:49.210 --> 02:43:49.220
spot that in Ross like this we just
 

02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:50.800
spot that in Ross like this we just
leave fortunate that Lions played with

this thing would have been almost zero

02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080
this thing would have been almost zero

in the grass when it's curled up like
 

02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:57.370
in the grass when it's curled up like
that it looks just like a rock in during

that it looks just like a rock in during
 

02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:59.710
that it looks just like a rock in during
the day you would have zero idea that

02:43:59.710 --> 02:43:59.720
the day you would have zero idea that
 

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:01.210
the day you would have zero idea that
that is a Pangolin unless of course

that is a Pangolin unless of course

you've got close enough that you could

you've got close enough that you could
 

02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:04.750
you've got close enough that you could
see the scales and so they've easily

02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760
see the scales and so they've easily
 

02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:06.340
see the scales and so they've easily
overlooked and so actual numbers of

02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:06.350
overlooked and so actual numbers of
 

02:44:06.350 --> 02:44:08.410
overlooked and so actual numbers of
Pangolin are probably not as well known

02:44:08.410 --> 02:44:08.420
Pangolin are probably not as well known
 

02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:10.690
Pangolin are probably not as well known
now here in these environments we've got

02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:10.700
now here in these environments we've got
 

02:44:10.700 --> 02:44:12.220
now here in these environments we've got
cross rooms where we can probably spot

02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:12.230
cross rooms where we can probably spot
 

02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:13.570
cross rooms where we can probably spot
them a bit easier but you miss remorse

02:44:13.570 --> 02:44:13.580
them a bit easier but you miss remorse

02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:03.389
friend is a mock that is about the only
action that keeps seen from this penguin

02:46:03.389 --> 02:46:03.399
action that keeps seen from this penguin
 

02:46:03.399 --> 02:46:05.189
action that keeps seen from this penguin
that keeps bounding around on it and I'm

02:46:05.189 --> 02:46:05.199
that keeps bounding around on it and I'm
 

02:46:05.199 --> 02:46:07.139
that keeps bounding around on it and I'm
hoping it is going to and revel I don't

02:46:07.139 --> 02:46:07.149
hoping it is going to and revel I don't
 

02:46:07.149 --> 02:46:08.370

02:46:08.370 --> 02:46:08.380
think it's hurt by the Lions before
 

02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:10.800

anybody thinks that it's dead I don't

02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:10.810
anybody thinks that it's dead I don't
 

02:46:10.810 --> 02:46:13.889
anybody thinks that it's dead I don't
think that's the case I just think that

02:46:13.889 --> 02:46:13.899
think that's the case I just think that
 

02:46:13.899 --> 02:46:15.990
think that's the case I just think that
what's happened is it's it's so kind of

02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000
what's happened is it's it's so kind of
 

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.429
what's happened is it's it's so kind of
been played with so much that it just

02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439
been played with so much that it just
 

02:46:17.439 --> 02:46:19.109
been played with so much that it just
feels very nervous and it can probably

02:46:19.109 --> 02:46:19.119
feels very nervous and it can probably
 

02:46:19.119 --> 02:46:21.240
feels very nervous and it can probably
still hear me talking and that's why

02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:21.250
still hear me talking and that's why
 

02:46:21.250 --> 02:46:23.760
still hear me talking and that's why
it's like this and it's just sitting and

02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:23.770
it's like this and it's just sitting and
 

02:46:23.770 --> 02:46:25.859
it's like this and it's just sitting and
it's really kind of feeling as though

02:46:25.859 --> 02:46:25.869
it's really kind of feeling as though
 

02:46:25.869 --> 02:46:28.139
it's really kind of feeling as though
it's being a bit kind of surrounded by

02:46:28.139 --> 02:46:28.149
it's being a bit kind of surrounded by
 

02:46:28.149 --> 02:46:30.179
it's being a bit kind of surrounded by
something and so maybe if we just you

said quietly never know if maybe just
 

02:46:34.149 --> 02:46:36.870
said quietly never know if maybe just
maybe this little creature will actually

penguin unravelled that night actually
 

02:52:16.391 --> 02:52:19.230
penguin unravelled that night actually
is that same shot and the guys were

02:52:19.230 --> 02:52:19.240
is that same shot and the guys were
 

02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:20.910
is that same shot and the guys were
telling me a lot of the local guys and I

02:52:20.910 --> 02:52:20.920
telling me a lot of the local guys and I
 

02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:22.051

don't notice it you might be able to

02:52:22.051 --> 02:52:22.061
don't notice it you might be able to
 

02:52:22.061 --> 02:52:24.360
don't notice it you might be able to
confirm this but that they were saying

02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:24.370
confirm this but that they were saying
 

02:52:24.370 --> 02:52:26.850

penguin gets seen and that it is a sign

02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:29.830
penguin gets seen and that it is a sign
 

02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:32.910
penguin gets seen and that it is a sign
of that person is still there and it's

02:52:32.910 --> 02:52:32.920
of that person is still there and it's
 

02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:36.210
of that person is still there and it's
almost like a message from them which is

02:52:36.210 --> 02:52:36.220
almost like a message from them which is
 

02:52:36.220 --> 02:52:38.520
almost like a message from them which is
very very interesting because today

02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:38.530
very very interesting because today
 

02:52:38.530 --> 02:52:41.040
very very interesting because today
funny enough a somebody that I know and

02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:41.050
funny enough a somebody that I know and
 

02:52:41.050 --> 02:52:42.841
funny enough a somebody that I know and
a friend of actually Sebastian that is a

02:52:42.841 --> 02:52:42.851
a friend of actually Sebastian that is a

guide was was unfortunately killed by an
 

02:52:45.340 --> 02:52:47.490
guide was was unfortunately killed by an
elephant yesterday and so it makes you

02:52:47.490 --> 02:52:47.500
elephant yesterday and so it makes you
 

02:52:47.500 --> 02:52:49.500
elephant yesterday and so it makes you
wonder this is the fourth penguin that

02:52:49.500 --> 02:52:49.510
wonder this is the fourth penguin that
 

02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:51.240
wonder this is the fourth penguin that
I've seen the day after somewhere all

02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:51.250
I've seen the day after somewhere all
 

02:52:51.250 --> 02:52:53.040
I've seen the day after somewhere all
day although after that somebody has

02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:53.050
day although after that somebody has
 

02:52:53.050 --> 02:52:56.100
day although after that somebody has
passed away which is a very kind of

02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:56.110
passed away which is a very kind of
 

02:52:56.110 --> 02:52:59.881
passed away which is a very kind of
weird weird thing in many respects and I

02:52:59.881 --> 02:52:59.891
weird weird thing in many respects and I
 

02:52:59.891 --> 02:53:01.950
weird weird thing in many respects and I
don't really know it could just be

02:53:01.950 --> 02:53:01.960
don't really know it could just be
 

02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:03.600
don't really know it could just be
coincidence completely but this is what

02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:03.610
coincidence completely but this is what
 

02:53:03.610 --> 02:53:05.190
coincidence completely but this is what
the guys told me and what they believe

02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.200
the guys told me and what they believe
 

02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:09.980
the guys told me and what they believe
and it's I suppose one of those things

02:53:09.980 --> 02:53:09.990
and it's I suppose one of those things
 

02:53:09.990 --> 02:53:13.801
and it's I suppose one of those things
you know it's a it's a interesting kind

02:53:13.801 --> 02:53:13.811
you know it's a it's a interesting kind
 

02:53:13.811 --> 02:53:15.660
you know it's a it's a interesting kind
of take on things now I'm really hoping

02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:15.670
of take on things now I'm really hoping
 

02:53:15.670 --> 02:53:17.040
of take on things now I'm really hoping
that this penguin decides that it's

02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:17.050
that this penguin decides that it's
 

02:53:17.050 --> 02:53:20.599
that this penguin decides that it's
going to unravel if we guys

02:53:20.599 --> 02:53:20.609
 
 

02:53:20.609 --> 02:53:23.539
 
and and kind of show itself orphanage

02:53:23.539 --> 02:53:23.549
and and kind of show itself orphanage
 

02:53:23.549 --> 02:53:24.829
and and kind of show itself orphanage
you can actually see it and the main

02:53:24.829 --> 02:53:24.839
you can actually see it and the main
 

02:53:24.839 --> 02:53:26.929
you can actually see it and the main
reason why I wanted to actually move is

02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:26.939
reason why I wanted to actually move is
 

02:53:26.939 --> 02:53:29.510
reason why I wanted to actually move is
that you can then listen to it and

02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520
that you can then listen to it and
 

02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:31.609
that you can then listen to it and
listening to a Pangolin sounds really

02:53:31.609 --> 02:53:31.619
listening to a Pangolin sounds really
 

02:53:31.619 --> 02:53:33.559
listening to a Pangolin sounds really
odd it's not that they call or make a

02:53:33.559 --> 02:53:33.569
odd it's not that they call or make a
 

02:53:33.569 --> 02:53:36.859
odd it's not that they call or make a
noise but when these guys walk um they

02:53:36.859 --> 02:53:36.869
noise but when these guys walk um they
 

02:53:36.869 --> 02:53:40.459
noise but when these guys walk um they
have the scraping sound as these kind of

02:53:40.459 --> 02:53:40.469
have the scraping sound as these kind of
 

02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:42.919
have the scraping sound as these kind of
plates shift and move you can hear the

02:53:42.919 --> 02:53:42.929
plates shift and move you can hear the
 

02:53:42.929 --> 02:53:44.449
plates shift and move you can hear the
scraping of them together and it's a

02:53:44.449 --> 02:53:44.459
scraping of them together and it's a
 

02:53:44.459 --> 02:53:46.249
scraping of them together and it's a
really cool sound it - obviously very

02:53:46.249 --> 02:53:46.259
really cool sound it - obviously very
 

02:53:46.259 --> 02:53:48.919
really cool sound it - obviously very
unique to them and it's not something

02:53:48.919 --> 02:53:48.929
unique to them and it's not something
 

02:53:48.929 --> 02:53:50.659
unique to them and it's not something
that a lot of people here so I'm hoping

02:53:50.659 --> 02:53:50.669
that a lot of people here so I'm hoping
 

02:53:50.669 --> 02:53:52.550
that a lot of people here so I'm hoping
that they will do that now Lady Bird you

02:53:52.550 --> 02:53:52.560
that they will do that now Lady Bird you
 

02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:55.339
that they will do that now Lady Bird you

and stuff for the guys was just saying
 

02:54:20.789 --> 02:54:22.399
and stuff for the guys was just saying
it's it's almost a sign of that person

02:54:22.399 --> 02:54:22.409
it's it's almost a sign of that person

it's okay well you know we store out in
a bar so that's what they say and I

02:54:28.010 --> 02:54:28.020
a bar so that's what they say and I
 

02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:30.079
a bar so that's what they say and I
don't know if anyone else has had that

02:54:30.079 --> 02:54:30.089
don't know if anyone else has had that
 

02:54:30.089 --> 02:54:31.459
don't know if anyone else has had that
experience and a lack of a certain you

02:54:31.459 --> 02:54:31.469
experience and a lack of a certain you
 

02:54:31.469 --> 02:54:33.559

that can verify if it's in his culture
 

02:54:35.669 --> 02:54:36.769
that can verify if it's in his culture
because obviously Sydney's cultures

that's you know you you obviously don't

02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439
that's you know you you obviously don't
 

02:54:49.439 --> 02:54:52.399
that's you know you you obviously don't
really kind of give it too much notice

02:54:52.399 --> 02:54:52.409
really kind of give it too much notice
 

02:54:52.409 --> 02:54:54.739
really kind of give it too much notice
when you kind of hear it but then when

02:54:54.739 --> 02:54:54.749
when you kind of hear it but then when
 

02:54:54.749 --> 02:54:56.179
when you kind of hear it but then when
they start adding up it starts to become

02:54:56.179 --> 02:54:56.189
they start adding up it starts to become
 

02:54:56.189 --> 02:54:58.459
they start adding up it starts to become
a weird coincidence in many respects all

just weird hearts happened at four of

02:55:08.659 --> 02:55:08.669
just weird hearts happened at four of
 

02:55:08.669 --> 02:55:09.949
just weird hearts happened at four of
the times that I've seen a panga and

02:55:09.949 --> 02:55:09.959
the times that I've seen a panga and
 

02:55:09.959 --> 02:55:12.379
the times that I've seen a panga and
somebody has kind of passed away within

somebody has kind of passed away within
 

02:55:12.389 --> 02:55:16.459
somebody has kind of passed away within
a few days or day before seeing one so

02:55:16.459 --> 02:55:16.469
a few days or day before seeing one so
 

02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:20.779
a few days or day before seeing one so
very weird um but unfortunately I could

02:55:20.779 --> 02:55:20.789
very weird um but unfortunately I could
 

02:55:20.789 --> 02:55:22.429
very weird um but unfortunately I could
say it's still curled up I was really

02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439
say it's still curled up I was really
 

02:55:22.439 --> 02:55:24.139
say it's still curled up I was really
hoping that it's going to kind of come

02:55:24.139 --> 02:55:24.149
hoping that it's going to kind of come
 

02:55:24.149 --> 02:55:27.050
hoping that it's going to kind of come
out and walk around for you and we get

02:55:27.050 --> 02:55:27.060
out and walk around for you and we get
 

02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:28.200
out and walk around for you and we get
to see it

02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:28.210
to see it
 

02:55:28.210 --> 02:55:31.740
to see it
but that initial kind of part where we

02:55:31.740 --> 02:55:31.750
but that initial kind of part where we
 

02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:34.460
but that initial kind of part where we
saw it with the line is just absolutely

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:34.470
saw it with the line is just absolutely
 

02:55:34.470 --> 02:55:37.050
saw it with the line is just absolutely
ridiculous stall to see that line kind

02:55:37.050 --> 02:55:37.060
ridiculous stall to see that line kind
 

02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:39.270
ridiculous stall to see that line kind
of with its pores on a Pangolin is

02:55:39.270 --> 02:55:39.280
of with its pores on a Pangolin is
 

02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:41.760
of with its pores on a Pangolin is
something that is very very rare to see

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:41.770
something that is very very rare to see

it's definitely moved a little bit
that's the first sign of movement we've

03:00:03.149 --> 03:00:03.159
that's the first sign of movement we've
 

03:00:03.159 --> 03:00:05.969
that's the first sign of movement we've
had since we first spotted it now come

03:00:05.969 --> 03:00:05.979
had since we first spotted it now come
 

03:00:05.979 --> 03:00:09.780
had since we first spotted it now come
on

03:00:12.599 --> 03:00:12.609
maybe it's all the Matsu and it's
 

03:00:12.609 --> 03:00:16.320
maybe it's all the Matsu and it's
listening to us hopefully now we will if

03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:16.330
listening to us hopefully now we will if

listening to us hopefully now we will if
we see it starting to kind of move a bit

03:00:18.269 --> 03:00:18.279
we see it starting to kind of move a bit
 

03:00:18.279 --> 03:00:20.340
we see it starting to kind of move a bit
more and a bit more then eventually we

03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:20.350
more and a bit more then eventually we

so don't worry if there is sign of
 

03:00:23.950 --> 03:00:25.200
so don't worry if there is sign of
movement or not going to cut you guys

03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:25.210
movement or not going to cut you guys
 

03:00:25.210 --> 03:00:28.469
movement or not going to cut you guys
off and leave you there so hopefully it

off and leave you there so hopefully it
 

03:00:28.479 --> 03:00:30.360
off and leave you there so hopefully it
will unravel but definitely little sign

03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:30.370
will unravel but definitely little sign
 

03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:33.150
will unravel but definitely little sign
of movement there slowly but surely it

03:00:33.150 --> 03:00:33.160
of movement there slowly but surely it
 

03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:36.719
of movement there slowly but surely it

she wanna you say you've never heard of

03:06:20.679 --> 03:06:20.689
she wanna you say you've never heard of
 

03:06:20.689 --> 03:06:22.929
she wanna you say you've never heard of
a penguin until now and that's precisely

03:06:22.929 --> 03:06:22.939
a penguin until now and that's precisely
 

03:06:22.939 --> 03:06:25.750
a penguin until now and that's precisely
what I was hoping for is why I would

03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760
what I was hoping for is why I would
 

03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:28.960
what I was hoping for is why I would
hope to get penguin sightings is because

03:06:28.960 --> 03:06:28.970
hope to get penguin sightings is because
 

03:06:28.970 --> 03:06:32.170
hope to get penguin sightings is because
they so little that so many people have

03:06:32.170 --> 03:06:32.180
they so little that so many people have
 

03:06:32.180 --> 03:06:33.819
they so little that so many people have
no idea what a penguin is and when they

03:06:33.819 --> 03:06:33.829
no idea what a penguin is and when they
 

03:06:33.829 --> 03:06:35.679
no idea what a penguin is and when they
see a penguin they always lump it with

03:06:35.679 --> 03:06:35.689
see a penguin they always lump it with
 

03:06:35.689 --> 03:06:37.330
see a penguin they always lump it with
an armadillo and it's not an armadillo

03:06:37.330 --> 03:06:37.340
an armadillo and it's not an armadillo
 

03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:39.790
an armadillo and it's not an armadillo
it's not in any way the same animal it

03:06:39.790 --> 03:06:39.800
it's not in any way the same animal it
 

03:06:39.800 --> 03:06:41.410
it's not in any way the same animal it
doesn't occur in the same places and it

03:06:41.410 --> 03:06:41.420
doesn't occur in the same places and it
 

03:06:41.420 --> 03:06:43.059
doesn't occur in the same places and it
certainly is in a far worse off state

03:06:43.059 --> 03:06:43.069
certainly is in a far worse off state
 

03:06:43.069 --> 03:06:44.979
certainly is in a far worse off state
than when armadillos are so when people

03:06:44.979 --> 03:06:44.989
than when armadillos are so when people
 

03:06:44.989 --> 03:06:46.899
than when armadillos are so when people
see it they may start to ask questions

03:06:46.899 --> 03:06:46.909
see it they may start to ask questions
 

03:06:46.909 --> 03:06:48.460
see it they may start to ask questions
about it they start to look into it they

03:06:48.460 --> 03:06:48.470
about it they start to look into it they
 

03:06:48.470 --> 03:06:49.960
about it they start to look into it they
start to realize these things and

03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:49.970
start to realize these things and
 

03:06:49.970 --> 03:06:52.300
start to realize these things and
hopefully that can turn the tide and we

03:06:52.300 --> 03:06:52.310
hopefully that can turn the tide and we
 

03:06:52.310 --> 03:06:53.500
hopefully that can turn the tide and we
can start to actually protect these

03:06:53.500 --> 03:06:53.510
can start to actually protect these
 

03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:54.910
can start to actually protect these
