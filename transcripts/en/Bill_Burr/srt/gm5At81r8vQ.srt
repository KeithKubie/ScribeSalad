1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,560
like a boss.
Um,

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,220
speaking of which actually watched this
documentary my wife take was talking to

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,140
that,
the charisma of Adolf Hitler on PBS.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,360
And it was this fascinating thing how
they talked about just what is charisma.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,940
Charisma does not exist
on its own in anyone.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,300
It exists only in an interaction between
an individual and an audience and

7
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:36,780
individual like Hitler. He was telling
the audience what they wanted to hear,

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,983
you know,

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,640
and they had this whole thing was
saying how like Hitler could not,

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,130
I had just no functioning
relationships with anybody one on one,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,530
but he just crushed it in front of a
crowd and how he would make them wait and

12
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:57,830
all of that shit is fucking hilarious.
Like he's waiting to start his speech.

13
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:01,130
Everyone's cheering and he's just
standing there until they're dead silent.

14
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:01,964
You know,

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,160
Hitler Talk to the German Nation as
chancellor on the 10th of February,

16
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:10,880
1933 thousands were in the hall,
in front of him,

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,950
and millions were listening on radio,

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,190
but Hitler made them all wait.

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,210
You reminded me one time,
Nia took,

20
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,100
I took Nia to go see Erika Badu and she
comes out and everyone wants you to sing,

21
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:40,310
and she spends the first five minutes
just walking around lighting the incense.

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,960
So I'm watching Hitler, Gosh, she got this
from Hitler to the same fucking thing.

23
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,090
Everybody's, I go, Whoa, we
need to behave ourselves,

24
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:50,000
and then the performance will begin.

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,710
But they had all these creepy
fucking speeches that he was getting.

26
00:01:55,711 --> 00:02:00,600
He was doing this thing where he was
going, there's a group of people among us

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,153
who

28
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,350
can basically live anywhere.
They do business anywhere.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,150
It doesn't matter them to them. They
live in Paris. Next month, they'll live,

30
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,230
they'll live in fucking
Vienna. Then they'll live here
and blah, blah, blah, blah,

31
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:21,730
blah, with no ties to that hole, and
he just keeps spoon feeding them.

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,030
Do you know he won't come out and say it,
this group of people,

33
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:31,500
because they have no
attachment to Germany,

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,490
you know, but blah, blah, blah, blah.
Then finally sent me, the crowd goes,

35
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,530
Joe yelled out,
Jews and it learned,

36
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,080
never addressed it,
and then just kept going.

37
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,710
I believe

38
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,143
[inaudible]

39
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,860
[inaudible] and it was, I you have
to see this to it is the creepiest,

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,120
absolutely, absolutely creepy fucking
thing I've ever seen in my life. And then,

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,930
uh,
but I would,

42
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,930
I would be lying to you if I didn't tell
you that I learned some things as far

43
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:23,310
as performance in front of a crowd.
I mean, you got to give it up.

44
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:28,240
The guy was a beast. I don't, I don't
even remotely agree with the guys message.

45
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,430
But Jesus Christ,

46
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,650
the guys going out in front of a crowd,
you know,

47
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,690
a Kevin Hart size fucking crowd
and doesn't say a fucking word.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,390
He doesn't get to do as the exact
opposite of the clippers game :

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,570
Makes some noise.
Jesus Christ.

50
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:47,500
Okay.

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,830
Hitler's got to come back and start
running the NBA there. I said it,

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I said if he can just get past the fact
that 99% of the players are African

53
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,530
American, I think he could do
some great things for the league.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,060
I think he quieted down.
Alright, sorry. Anyways,

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,880
so I will be going to eastern Europe.
That's what I was trying to say.

56
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,190
Or Europe in general. The
UK. There we go. All right.

57
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,910
The Kabbalah reading mother fucker.
Get the fuck out of my house.

58
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,110
Yeah.

59
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,330
See this?
That means not welcomed.
