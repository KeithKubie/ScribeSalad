00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.590
Mixing water with electricity is typically
discouraged, and for good reason, but in this

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.040
project we're pumping electricity into water,
and a bit of drain cleaner to create a poor

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.040
mans power controller. You might have heard
of a Variac. This is the Scariac.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.199
In a couple of other projects, we fashioned
a homemade stick welder using parts we salvaged

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.409
from old appliances. I powered the device
with 240 VAC, and that was plenty of power,

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.030
but we still needed a way to adjust the current.
I built this device to control alternating

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.270
current, so we have the ability to play with
adjustable power settings, on a budget. 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.000
Now this concept is about as dangerous as sticking
two live wires in a bucket of water,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.250
it can be deadly, so it's important to know,
and understand the risks. To build this Scariac

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.030
we'll need a 4 gallon container to hold our
electrolyte, and I like this one because it's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.220
got a lid that snaps on tight. I cut a piece
of board so that it measures at 16"x14" because

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.120
that fits on top, leaving a 3" overhang on
the side. I made this plastic template for

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.050
marking holes for where the switch and outlet
will go, and a few other markings based on

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.740
these measurements. To cut the holes out,
let's drill the corners first, then use a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.130
jigsaw to cut the sides. We can use the light
switch as a template for marking where the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.420
two holes will need to be drilled. This part
is optional, but let's go ahead and finish

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.360
the edges with a 1/2" rounding bit on the
router table. By profiling the tops and bottoms

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.080
of all the edges, we're left with a nice smooth
finish. Next, we'll need 2 pieces of 2"x2",

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.360
and I had these ones left over, from when
we made, our mousetrap hand guns, which you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.420
can see in a different project. I drilled
a hole through the sides of the blocks 1/2"

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.280
from the top, and cut them down to 1-1/4"
so they looked like this. These blocks will

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.140
need to be secured flush with the top of the
center hole, so let's trace the edges and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.909
drill 4 pilot holes on diagonals. They'll
eventually be held in place with screws from

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.709
the bottom side. I gave these parts a paint
job, and now the panel board is complete,

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.480
and we can move on to constructing the power
lever. All the parts for the power lever are

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.700
laid out here, and you can see they're mainly
1/2" PVC parts, as well as these other miscellaneous

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.510
bits of hardware. Now we can get to work priming
and cementing the PVC together so that we

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.980
end up with 2 sections that look like this.
They'll be fit together later on, but here

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.260
you can get a basic idea of how it's gonna work. We'll need to mark, and drill a hole

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.959
right through the lower part of the "T", then
make the hole bigger on the inner sides. The

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.240
hole has to be just big enough to allow the
head of a 2-1/2" bolt to pass through. Here

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.360
you can see I added a metal washer, and a
beveled rubber washer on the inside. At this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.010
point, the 2 parts of the handle can be cemented
together, and the excess glue wiped away.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.020
I decided to paint the handle red to give
it a nice contrast against the black.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.739
We can add a rubber washer

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.319
to the bolt first, and the block gets pushed
on next, until you see about 1/4" of the bolt

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.030
poking out on the end. I added a washer and
a wing-nut to hold it in place, and now we

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.090
have the ability to adjust the tension of
the power lever. Now that our blocks are attached,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.830
let's push the bottom part of the handle through
the hole, and secure the blocks to the board

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.680
using the screws we lined up earlier. At this
point, we're ready to wire up the electrical,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.450
and this is how it's going to look when it's
finished. I started with two 17" pieces of

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.810
1/2" copper tubing. Let's make 4 markings
at 3, 4-1/2, 12-1/2, and 14". That should

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.430
leave us with an 8" gap between the middle
markings. Now we can use a hammer or bench

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.310
vise to compress the copper, allowing us to
bend it over easily. When all the markings

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.940
have been compressed, including the tips,
the electrode can be formed into a rectangle,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.970
and should look like this. I've drilled a
hole through the center of the tips, continuing

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.500
into the tube itself, but only through one
side of it. For this electrode, let's add

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.709
a 4" plastic PVC riser, so that it lines up
flush with one of the edges. Then we can put

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.040
a screw right through it, so it's held between
the two pieces of copper. The other end of

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.870
this riser can screw into the bottom of our
power lever, making sure the copper bar is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.180
facing forward. The other 4" riser gets added
into the power lever, and can be secured to

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.120
the copper as well. To form the 2nd electrode
holder, I added a PVC cap to a 6" PVC riser,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.559
and used a belt sander, to grind away at the
top until it was completely flat. With the

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:39.550
power lever in the full upright position,
we can get a feel for where the longer risers

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.210
will need to be attached. Using 2 screws for
each riser, we can bite down into the riser

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.249
caps, securing them in position. Now the second
electrode can be added, adjusting it so it's

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.789
the same height as the first , and of course
2 more screws will fix the copper in place.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.860
Now it's time to rig up the wiring for this
contraption. I've got some 12 gauge cable,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.419
and a 2 prong plug. The plug opens up allowing
us to connect our 2 wires, and screws back

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.749
together, completing this end of the cable.
The black wire from the cable runs to the

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:14.129
light switch first, and connects to the screw
on the far side. The wire is cut, and connected

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.819
to the other screw on the switch, then continues
to this hole drilled through the board. On

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.680
the top side, you can see the wire is bent
over in an arch, and goes back through the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.020
board, where it continues to the electrode
on the power lever. The electrode wire can

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.720
simply be connected by looping it behind the existing screw and fastening tight.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.280
Let's use another piece of the black wire and connect
it to the other electrode in the same way.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.440
You can see this wire connects to the outlet,
and gets held on with one of the gold screws.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.619
This silver screw is connected to the white
wire running from the cable, and this completes

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:50.089
our electrical work. At this point we can
fasten the light switch and the outlet onto

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:54.830
the control board, and add the faceplates
for a finishing touch. This control panel

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.219
is fully functional, but if you wanted to
add a little more safety, you

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.099
could add a replaceable fuse, or even wire
up a circuit breaker. To finish up the system

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.349
we'll just need to modify this lid. We can
use a rotary tool with a cutting wheel to

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.159
cut along the inner edges leaving just the
rim intact. The inside hole has to be large

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.349
enough to allow both electrodes to fit in
freely, and when it's centered on the top,

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:21.520
we can screw together the 4 corners, so it's
all attached. This way, it clamps into position

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.099
perfectly every time. I wanted to add a piece
of trim around the power lever, so I stopped

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.849
at the grocery store and picked up a container
of bean dip. The empty container is exactly

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.139
the right size, and with just a little cutting,
and two pieces of double sided sticky tape,

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.659
it mounts right behind the power lever. Our
last step is to mix the electrolyte. I'm using

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:45.460
about 2 gallons of tap water, and that fills
the container up half way. To make the water

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.660
more conductive, we'll be using this crystal
drain cleaner because it's 100% lye.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.060
This  stuff is so dangerous and so potent, that we'll only need 1/4 teaspoon mixed into the entire solution.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.779
Now we can secure the control board in place,
connect the plug to a power source, and test

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:06.159
it out. Let's make sure the power lever is
pushed fully forward, before the switch is

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.569
turned on. Now the system is powered, and
you can see that if we gently pull the lever

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:15.189
back, the light begins to glow dimly. And
if we pull it all the way back, it increases

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:20.149
to full intensity. The switch is a kill switch
and will cut all the power to the system in

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:25.899
an instant. The main purpose of this contraption,
is to regulate current to our electrical devices.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:30.740
Adding just a little power to an angle grinder
will cause the device to spin very slowly.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.220
But pulling back on the lever will increase
the power until it reaches full speed.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.420
The control panel has this loop of black wire,
that allows us to monitor the amperage, in

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:44.289
high power applications, like the arc welding
project. You can see that if we pull back

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:49.259
on the lever, the current climbs higher. An
interesting observation is that the voltage

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:53.949
is pretty much constant through the entire
cycle. The system can handle extremely high

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:59.609
electrical loads, and in contrast, it can
also make a table saw turn at a snails pace.

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:04.639
Pushing forward on the lever increases the
electrolytic resistance, and as a result,

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:09.959
the equipment slows down, or comes to a full
stop. Well now you know, how to control electricity

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:14.909
with water and a bit of drain cleaner. Remember,
that this has the power to kill you, and that's

00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:19.369
why it's called the Scariac. If you liked
this project, perhaps you'll like some of

00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:22.520
my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
