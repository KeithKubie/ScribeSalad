00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.010 align:start position:0%
like that's what would happen for him to
 

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.380 align:start position:0%
like that's what would happen for him to
go<00:08:05.130><c> on</c><00:08:05.160><c> that</c><00:08:05.460><c> was</c><00:08:05.580><c> the</c><00:08:05.640><c> first</c><00:08:05.850><c> time</c><00:08:06.030><c> a</c><00:08:06.060><c> big</c>
