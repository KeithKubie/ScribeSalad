00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.320
This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by SquareSpace 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.420
Venus was the Roman goddess of love, and honestly,
if you’ve ever seen it after sunset, hanging

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.870
like a diamond in the twilight, the planet
Venus is stunningly beautiful.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.810
The only problem? Venus is hell.

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.710
Venus is the second rock from the Sun, closer
to the Sun than Earth is. It’s the third

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.649
brightest natural object in the sky after
the Sun and Moon, and it’s shockingly bright

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.529
when you see it, in fact, a lot of the time
when people see it they think it’s an airplane.

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:45.449
Some folks—and this is true—even report
it as a UFO.

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.179
Like Mercury, it never gets far from the Sun;
at best it can reach about 45° away. If you

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.479
want to see it, the best time to look is after
sunset or before sunrise.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
Through a telescope, Venus can be seen to
undergo phases just like the Moon and Mercury

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.170
do, too. When it’s on the far side of its
orbit from Earth, we see the illuminated face,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.110
so it looks full. As it rounds the Sun and
approaches Earth in its orbit, it gets bigger

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.540
from our point of view, because it’s getting
closer, but it also wanes; it’s gibbous,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.400
then half full, then a crescent.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.640
When it gets between the Sun and Earth, it’s
as close as it can get to us, about 45 million

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.340
kilometers away. It’s a very thin crescent
at that point, but close enough to us that

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.720
you can see the phase easily with just binoculars.
Ironically, even though we see only a small

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.140
portion of it illuminated then, it appears
so big that it’s actually brighter than

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.810
when it’s full but far away.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.540
The orbit of Venus around the Sun is tipped
with respect to the Earth’s by a little

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.470
over 3°. So, like the Moon as seen from Earth,
Venus usually passes above or below the Sun

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.240
in the sky as it laps the Earth and pulls
ahead in its orbit.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.890
But again, just like with the Moon, sometimes
things line up just right and Venus passes

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.790
directly across the Sun’s face. This event
is called a transit. During a solar eclipse

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.660
the Moon can completely block the Sun, but
Venus is much farther away, so it can only

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.720
block about a tenth of a percent of the Sun.
We see the planet as an inky black circle

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.360
against the Sun’s face.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.600
Transits were very important centuries ago.
Scientists realized that by precisely timing

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.700
the start and end of a Venus transit, and
applying a little geometry, they could figure

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.489
out how far away Venus was, and use that like
a meter stick to measure the size of the entire

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.670
solar system. Grand expeditions were sent
to remote parts of the Earth where the transits

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.650
were visible, but it turns out Earth’s atmosphere
blurs the disk of Venus just enough that exact

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.719
timing of the transit isn’t possible.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.849
Scientists had to wait until we could use
radar and other methods to get the exact distances

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.069
to planets in the solar system, but transits
are still pretty amazing to watch. They’re

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.409
very rare: the way the orbits of Venus and
Earth align, they happen in pairs separated

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.769
by eight years, but then don’t happen again
for over a century. The last pair of Venus

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.249
transits happened in 2004 and 2012. I was
fortunate enough to see both the 2004 and

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:58.999
2012 transits and they were totally cool.
But the next one? December 10, 2117. If you

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.129
missed the last two, sorry about that.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.659
Venus is actually so bright sometimes that
it can be seen in broad daylight; I’ve done

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.999
this myself. So here’s an obvious question:
Why is Venus so bright? Telescopic observations

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.469
show it to be a nearly featureless white disk,
completely covered in a thick cloud layer,

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.329
reflecting almost all of the sunlight that
falls on it. OK, great, so that’s why it’s

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.960
bright, but then why are its clouds so thick?

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.009
Well, it turns out that Venus might be nice
to look at from a distance, but up close,

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.779
yikes.

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.760
In some ways, Venus is the planet in the solar
system most similar to Earth. It’s only

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.260
a wee bit smaller — 12,100 kilometers across,
about 95% the width of the Earth — and has

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.279
80% the Earth’s mass. But if it’s a twin
of Earth, it’s the evil twin.

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:45.349
Venus is closer to the Sun. At a distance
of about 110 million kilometers, 2/3rds the

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.689
distance of the Earth from the Sun, you’d
expect it to be warmer. What you might not

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:56.389
expect is that its surface temperature is 460°
Celsius— that’s 860° F, hot enough to melt lead.

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.580
And it gets worse. Its air is almost entirely
composed of carbon dioxide, and atmospheric

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.510
pressure on Venus is a crushing 90 times that
of Earth’s! As if that’s not bad enough,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.350
it rains sulfuric acid, too, but it’s so hot the
drops evaporate before hitting the ground.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.090
Yep. Venus is hell.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.720
Why? How did it get so hot? It turns out Venus
is a victim of a runaway greenhouse effect.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.780
A long time ago, Venus may have been more
temperate, and might have even had liquid

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.600
water oceans. But the Sun was cooler when
it was younger, and as it aged it got hotter.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.940
At some point, the thinking goes, the Sun
warmed Venus enough that its oceans started

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.430
to evaporate. Water vapor is an excellent
greenhouse gas, so Venus’s heating accelerated.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.139
It got so hot the oceans boiled away. Any
carbon dioxide dissolved in the water was

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.210
released to the atmosphere, heating the planet
even further, and thickening the atmosphere

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.060
hugely. It got so hot that the CO2 even got
baked out of the rocks, which was like, well,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.690
throwing gasoline on a raging fire. The greenhouse
effect raged out of control at that point.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.370
Venus lacks a magnetic field, so it has no
protection from the solar wind blasting past

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.440
it. Over billions of years, this stripped
a lot of the lighter elements from the atmosphere,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.699
as well as all of the water. The resulting
atmospheric chemistry is pretty screwy compared

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.020
to Earth. Sulfur dioxide is a popular molecule
there, and clouds form from sulfuric acid.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.300
Those clouds are high off of the surface,
and very white and reflective.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.810
It’s pretty incredible to think about. The
Sun warmed, so Venus warmed, and then a cascading

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.669
series of events lead to it being a ridiculously
hostile environment due to the runaway greenhouse

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.340
effect. Even though Mercury is closer to the
Sun, Venus is way hotter!

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.889
Given that, the last thing you might expect
on Venus is… snow. Well, possibly; observations

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.800
show that there’s something shiny on the
mountaintops, and snow fits the bill. But

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.139
it’s not water ice like on Earth. As the
thinking goes, at lower elevations, minerals

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.889
like bismuthinite and galena would be vaporized
by the heat. They’d then circulate up into

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.379
the atmosphere and deposit onto the surface
at mountaintops where it’s cooler. If this

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.970
is correct, then Venus is so bizarre it literally
snows metal there!

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.360
There’s other weird stuff going on at Venus,
too. For one thing, it has an incredibly slow

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.139
rotation rate: One day on Venus is about 243
Earth days! It rotates so slowly that at its

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.879
equator, you could jog faster than the planet
spins. Its slow spin is probably why it has

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.939
no magnetic field, too, since rotation is
critical in generating the magnetic fields

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.610
of objects like the Earth and the Sun.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.720
Not only that, but the planet spins backwards!
This is called retrograde motion, and in a

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.110
sense it means Venus’s north pole got swapped
with its south pole: It flipped over.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.220
It’s not clear why that happened. A lot
of ideas have been proposed, including a giant

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.659
collision that skidded the planet’s spin
to a halt, but as of right now, Venus’s

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:42.099
lazy rotation is still not completely understood.

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.789
If you could survive it, living on Venus would
be really odd. The thick clouds mean it’s

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.599
about as bright as twilight on Earth, despite being
closer to the Sun. The thick atmosphere also

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.459
means surface temperature is about the same
everywhere on the planet, pole to equator.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.280
Due to its backwards rotation, the Sun would
rise in the west, and due to the slow rotation

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.769
its day is actually longer than its year!
Calendars on Venus would be a mess.

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:08.509
But calendars would probably be the least
of your worries if you had to live there.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.100
Incidentally, Venus has no moon. Being closer
to the Sun, it’s possible that any moon

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.110
it may have once had would have been perturbed
by the Sun’s gravity, and was eventually

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.080
tossed out of Venus’s grasp. It’s also possible
it simply never had one to begin with.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.479
And here’s another fun fact: Venus is the
most spherical of all the planets. Because

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:30.159
it rotates so slowly, it doesn’t bulge out
at the equator from centrifugal force like

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:34.180
Earth does. The diameter from pole to pole
is almost exactly the same as it is through

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.639
the equator.
We don’t have a lot of data about the interior

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.629
of Venus, though given its similar composition
and size to Earth, it’s not too crazy to

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:46.099
think it has a core, mantle, and crust like
we do. But even given the weird atmosphere,

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.699
the surface of Venus is really different than
ours.

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.710
Venus doesn’t have tectonic activity like
Earth does; it’s thought that water helps

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.180
drive that, and Venus long ago lost its water
to the greenhouse effect. Still, the surface

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.040
appears to be very young; about a thousand
impact craters have been found, and they’re

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.700
evenly distributed around the planet. The
majority appear to be in pretty good shape,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.849
they haven’t been eroded much, indicating
they aren’t terribly old. Not only that,

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:13.089
but the erosion we do see seems to be about
the same for all these craters, indicating

00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:14.660
they’re all roughly the same age!

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.300
That’s weird! This all points to some sort
of catastrophic event that resurfaced the

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:23.789
planet roughly half a billion years ago. Any
features older than that were wiped out, and

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:28.780
then big impacts over time created the craters we
see now. But what could repave an entire planet?

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:35.380
A big clue can be found by counting volcanoes
on Venus: There are 167 bigger than 100 kilometers

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.880
in diameter, a huge number. These volcanoes
could, over time, pump out enough lava to

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.950
cover the entire surface of Venus. There’s
also a lot of indirect evidence that volcanic

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:51.350
activity is ongoing, now, today: One mountain
on Venus, called Idunn Mons, is seen to be

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.170
abnormally warm, for example, indicating it
might have magma under its peak. Also, sulfur

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.260
dioxide levels dropped a lot in the 1980s,
which may indicate a big volcanic event happened

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.810
in the 1970s, blasting out lots of the gas,
which then subsided. It’s possible, though

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:12.560
somewhat speculative, that the entire planet
is a supervolcano, a ginormous pressure cooker

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.510
of barely-constrained magma. Every few hundred
million years, the whole surface lets go in

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.209
a colossal eruption, covering everything in
lava. Yikes.

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:26.089
Some volcanic features on Venus are different
than on Earth. Without tectonics, slow bubbling

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:31.060
leaks of lava from the interior of the planet
can continue in one spot for a long time.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.360
This creates what are called “pancake domes”:
huge, flat, low domes. Many are dozens of

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.790
kilometers across, but less than a kilometer
high. The lava that formed them was probably

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.709
really viscous, which is why the domes are
flattened and spread out. The searing surface

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:48.300
temperature of Venus probably kept the lava
hot and helped it spread out more, too.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.600
Oh, and one final note: under international
agreement, surface features on Venus—

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.019
mountains, plains, craters, and so on—are
all named after women or goddesses of various

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:02.399
cultures. This is an homage to the planet
itself being named after a goddess, of course,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.019
but also? It’s just cool.

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:08.610
Today you learned that Venus is the same size
as Earth, but with a super thick atmosphere.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.190
A runaway greenhouse effect makes it the hottest
planet in the solar system. It has the slowest

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:19.130
rotation of any planet, and spins backwards.
Tremendous volcanic activity ages ago resurfaced

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.610
the entire planet, and it still may be active
today.
