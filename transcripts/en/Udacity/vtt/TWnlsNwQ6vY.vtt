00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.750
Another goal of the internet was distributed management.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.390
And there are many examples where distributed management

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.920
has played out. In addressing, we have routing

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.440
registries. For example, in North America we have

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.860
ARIN, or the American Registry for Internet Numbers.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.230
And in Europe that same organization is called

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.390
RIPE. DNS allows each independent organization to manage

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.210
its own names and BGP allows each independently

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.000
operated network to configure its own routing policy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.200
This means that no single entity needs to be

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.140
in charge and thus allows for organic growth

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.250
and stable management. On the downside, the internet has

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.730
no single owner or responsible party. And as

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.220
Clark said, some of the most significant problems with

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.860
the internet relate to the lack of sufficient tools

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.230
for distributed management, especially in the area of routing.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.620
In such a network where management is distributed

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.300
it can often be very difficult to figure

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.650
out who or what is causing a problem

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.720
and worse, local action such as misconfiguration in a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.930
single local network can have global effects. The

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.180
other three design goals that Clark discusses are

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.270
cost effectiveness, ease of attachment, and accountability. It's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.400
reasonable to argue that the network design is fairly

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.590
cost effective as is and current trends are

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.920
aiming to exploit redundancy even more. For example, we

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.900
will learn about content distributions and distributed web

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.750
caches that aim to achieve better cost effectiveness for

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.880
distributing content to users. Ease of attachment was

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.290
arguably a huge success. IP is essentially plug and

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.100
play. Anything with a working IP stack can

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.570
connect to the internet. There's a really important lesson

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.610
here, which is that if one lowers the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.100
barrier to innovation, people will get creative about

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.190
the types of devices and applications that can

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.225
run on top of the internet. Additionally, the narrow

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:54.620
waist of IP allows the network to run

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.650
on a wide variety of physical layers ranging from

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.510
fiber, to cable, to wireless and so forth.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.570
Accountability, or the ability to essentially bill, was mentioned

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.870
in some of the early papers on TCP/IP but it really wasn't prioritized.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.150
Datagram networks can make accounting really

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.940
tricky. Phone networks had a much easier

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.440
time figuring out how to bill users. Payments and billing on the internet

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.710
are much less precise and we'll talk about these more in later lectures.
