00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.994
this is the equation that we can write. If we add the amount of time to go

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:09.019
upstream, the amount of time to go downstream. That should sum to our total

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.180
time which is 16 15th hours. Nice work if you figured that out.
