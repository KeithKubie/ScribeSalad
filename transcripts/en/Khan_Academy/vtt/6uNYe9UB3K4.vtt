00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.019
We've already seen that
by 1925 Benito Mussolini

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.220
was the absolute
dictator of Italy.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.810
He was now Il Duce,
or the leader.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.510
And him and the
fascists would then

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.360
proceed to consolidate
more and more power.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.160
And they would use
the threat of force.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.520
They did use the state
security apparatus

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.090
to enforce their will.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.620
They took over the press.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.550
They banned all other parties.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.850
But there was also
a popular sentiment

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.510
that was supporting them.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.409
People wanted a strong-- or
there were elements in Italy

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.200
that were in favor of a strong
leader, a charismatic leader,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.710
like Mussolini.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.230
But then as we
get into the '30s,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.240
in particular the
mid-1930s, Mussolini

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.140
starts to become more aggressive
in terms of foreign policy.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.330
And this eventually leads to him
becoming less and less popular.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.780
And also leads him to
getting more and more

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.269
aligned with the Germans.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.060
You might remember,
going into World War I,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.140
he actually wanted to
fight in World War I

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.850
on the side of the entente,
which Italy eventually does do.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.440
And throughout
this entire period,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.680
he does not want to rock
the boat with Great Britain

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.590
and France.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.830
But as his imperial
ambitions grow,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.460
he'll find that he has more
in common with Nazi Germany--

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.280
or he's finding more
sympathy with Nazi Germany--

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.610
than he is with the
British and French.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.530
And so we go to 1935,
so we're obviously

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.730
skipping a huge gap
right over here.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.150
But as we get into
1935, Mussolini

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.200
feels that it's time
to really exercise

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.980
his imperial ambitions.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.600
Italy already had holdings
in northeast Africa.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.050
It had colonies in Eritrea,
Italian Somaliland.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.360
And he had aspirations
to take over Ethiopia.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.130
Ethiopia, at this
point in time, was

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.000
one of the few
African nations that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.140
was not essentially
colonized, or not

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.380
being controlled,
by a European power.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.530
It was at the time Ethiopia
was called Abyssinia.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.860
And so in 1935,
the Italians invade

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.480
Abyssinia, invade Ethiopia.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.930
And not only is it a
very aggressive invasion,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.990
it's also a very cruel invasion.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.850
They use chemical warfare.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.610
It's very ugly.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.370
Many, many, many civilians die.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.760
And this isn't taken well by
the other powers of Europe,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.160
in particular Great
Britain and France.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.750
But you might remember, based
on what we learned about

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.950
in Nazi Germany, that they
were in no mood to start wars.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.680
They were kind of in
an appeasement mode.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.510
And even with Italy they
were willing to make

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.100
a secret agreement,
the Hoare-Laval.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.730
And this was a
secret agreement that

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.870
actually would have allowed
Italy to maintain control

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.870
over significant
chunks of Ethiopia.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.080
But this was eventually
leaked to the public.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.570
And the British and
French public at this time

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.960
did not tolerate this.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.740
And so this whole incident,
the Italians invading Ethiopia,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.790
the unpopularity of this amongst
the civilians in Great Britain

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.430
and in France, this further
distanced those countries

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.300
from Italy.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.430
And the only major
nation that was not

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.260
opposed to Italy's invasion
of Ethiopia was Germany.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.080
And so this started to bring
Mussolini-- who in the 1920s

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.050
did not think much
of Hitler-- started

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.650
to bring him closer and
closer and closer to Hitler.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.100
And their invasion of Ethiopia
would continue into the start

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.880
and through World War II.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.240
And it's a famously cruel
attempted colonization,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.250
or invasion.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.480
But these trends continue,
his imperialistic tendencies,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.670
his alignment with more
and more nationalistic

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.700
nations in Europe.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.170
In 1936, you have the Spanish
Civil War breaking out.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.100
And Mussolini decides to
support the Nationalists led

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.540
by Francisco Franco, who
eventually comes to power.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.370
But Mussolini decides
to support him.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.275
And this isn't a super popular
thing amongst the Italians.

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:20.899
They're like, what are we doing
in these other countries trying

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.520
to fight other people's war?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.370
But he decides to
support the Nationalists.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.170
And once again, this brings
him closer to the Germans

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.280
and further away from Great
Britain and the French who

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.830
are not supportive
of Francisco Franco.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.490
Then you forward
to 1937, and as you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.910
remember Mussolini was
vehemently anti-communist,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.980
vehemently anti-socialist.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.430
So were the Nazis.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.390
So were the Japanese.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:05:00.510
And so in 1937, Italy joins
the Anti-Comintern Pact

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.750
with Germany and Japan.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.760
And this is essentially
the nascent Axis powers.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.210
And this literally stands for
anti-International Communism.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.400
So they're going to join
together and aggressively fight

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.690
communism wherever it might
show, international communism.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.700
And this would eventually be
the basis of the Axis powers

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.370
as we go into World War II.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.940
And so then we get into 1939.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.070
And by 1939 Germany is
already aggressively expanding

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.280
its territory.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.920
It had already executed
on the Anschluss.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.530
It had merged with
Austria, or you

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.750
could say it had
unified with Austria.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.500
It had already taken
over the Sudetenland.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.150
It was in process of taking
over a significant part

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.560
of Czechoslovakia.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.400
And Mussolini wanted in
on the action as well.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.175
So in 1939, he decides
to invade Albania.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.610
And this, right
over here-- in case

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.670
you don't know where
Albania is-- this

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.039
is a map of Europe at the time.

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.330
And Albania is right over here.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.440
They're able to overrun
Albania very quickly.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.050
The king deposed the king.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.310
And so Mussolini is
exercising, once again,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.415
his imperial ambitions.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:26.300
He's getting closer and closer
to the Nazis, who are frankly

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.180
the main sympathizers with
what Mussolini is trying to do.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.450
And so by May of that year--
the invasion of Albania

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.330
is in April-- but
by May of that year

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.820
you have a final formal military
alliance with the Nazis called

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.140
the Pact of Steel.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.640
And as you might remember,
this is only a few months--

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.590
so this is in May-- this
is only a few months

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.270
before the Nazi
invasion of Poland,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.360
which is the catalyst for
the beginning of World War

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.450
II in Europe.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.170
Italy didn't immediately
enter World War II

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.110
in September of 1939 when
the Nazis invade Poland.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.150
Similar to what Italy
did in World War I,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.050
it was waiting to
see which side seemed

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.410
to be in a better position.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.630
By 1940, it felt that a
Nazi victory was imminent.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.150
And it decides to declare
war on Britain and France.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:33.620
So declares war on
Britain and France.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.000
And this is the formal
entry of the Italians

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.390
into World War II as
part of the Axis powers.
