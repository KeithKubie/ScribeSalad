&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.450 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT, YOU
KNOW, EARLY ON I KIND OF DIDN'T

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:54.253 align:start position:0% line:91%
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, PARTLY
BECAUSE I'M TRIUMPH THE

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:54.720 align:start position:0% line:91%
INSULT COMIC DOG'S HAND UP THE
ASS. AND I KIND OF LIKE

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.189 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Jon: HELLO!

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:07.333 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S
BETTER PEOPLE JUST LOOK AT ME AS

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
AN ASSHOLE, YOU KNOW?

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:14.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO IF THEY WERE TO SEE
YOU AS HUMAN --

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:15.775 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH WELL, IT'S KIND OF
CREEPY ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:17.844 line:91%
I DO THE VOICE. BUT I FIGURED,
LIKE AT THIS POINT THIS SHOW HAS

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:18.578 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOTTEN SO BIG.
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.779 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND IMPORTANT.
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:24.984 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT LET'S JUST PICTURE IT AS
A COMEDY, AS A CHARITY EVENT

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:31.190 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
RUN BY AN ASSHOLE. WHAT IF A

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:36.095 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMEONE WHO'S DISTURBS
BUT WELL MEANING?

CONDUIT THROUGH WHICH THIS YOUNG
MAN OWEN COMMUNICATES HIS

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.072 align:start position:0% line:91%

AUTISM. 
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.113 line:91%

WORKING ON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.949 line:91%
MY WIFE AND I COULDN'T GET OUR
KID INTO ANY KIND OF SCHOOL OR

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.015 line:91%
THIS MOMENT WHERE SHE RECEIVES
SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE AND SHE

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.550 align:start position:0% line:85%
SMILES. AND PEOPLE --

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:12.751 align:start position:0% line:91%

POSSIBLE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT. YEP.
