- Hey guys, what's up,
I'm Hanna Dickinson

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.837 line:0%
and I'm here hangin' and
bangin' at Clusterfest.

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.405
I'm just looking for
good food, fun times,

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.240
and creative ways to
disappoint my parents.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.042
(party music)

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.310 align:start size:81% position:19%
Hey what's up,
I'm here with Ben.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.745 align:start size:84% position:16%
I actually slept
with a Ben last year

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.846
who never called me back,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.047
so why do you think that is?

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.782 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Did you tell
him your real name

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.217
or did you use the fake
name that you told me

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.852 align:start size:84% position:16%
just before we
started filming this?

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:19.919
- And what name was that?

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:20.854
- Bovis?

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.389
- So are you single, what's up?

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.656
- I am not single.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:24.591
- What do you do?

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.658
- Finance for a tech company.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.160
- No, that sounds great for me.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.029
How much money do
you make a year?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.597 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I can't count
that high, honestly.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.965
- Are you single?

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.233
- No.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.868 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You guys, we need
to screen these people

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.536
before we talk to them.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.171
- Are you single,
what's happening?

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.139
- No.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.641
- What does your girlfriend do?

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.475
- I'm not straight.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.010
- So what's up Steph?

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.844
- Hungover.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.813 line:0%
- Are you dating anyone?

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:47.647 line:0%
- No.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.149 line:0%
- That is a yes.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.917 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Are there any comedians
here you wanna make out with?

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:52.452
- A few.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.953
Are they gonna watch this,
I don't wanna say the name.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.088
- Jon Stewart?

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.389
- No, Nick Kroll.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.290
- He's definitely
not watching this.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.758
- Yeah I know.

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.759 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- I'm here with very
funny comedian Ali Siddiq.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.560 line:0%
How are you doing?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.028
- I'm doing magnificent.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.530
- Ooh, that's nice.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.765
- I'm gonna say a bunch
of weird stuff tonight.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.033 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What do you
consider weird stuff?

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.535 align:start size:81% position:19%
'Cause I say a
lot of weird shit.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.103
- But I don't like having
sex with pregnant women.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.337 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't think
that that's weird.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.572 align:start size:81% position:19%
I think that might
be a universal,

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.773
I don't know if we're
allowed to say that.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:14.607
- There's a lot of
men who like sleeping

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.875
with pregnant women.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.878
- Well I look pregnant
after a full meal, so,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.313
that's a turn on for me.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.850 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, I would have sex
with a slightly full woman.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.653 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, we've eaten, and now
we're trying to exercise.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.021
- So have you guys
ever had a threesome?

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.855
- No.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:29.956
- No.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:30.890
Yeah, no.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.225
- That was like a nervous one,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
like you have definitely
fallen into one.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.295
I've been kicked
out of a threesome.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.529
It's a long story.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.431 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm actually here
with Action Bronson.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.766
- My name's Rusty.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.067
- So what do you
do for a living?

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.202
- I'm retired.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.837
- What did you do before?

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.305
- I actually was a cook.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.674
- Does chef mean you deal drugs?

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.175
- Um, no, I'm on drugs.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.944 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you single,
or what's happening?

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.178
- Very single.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.480
- That sounds like
an invitation for me.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.314
- Do you both work in tech?

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.849
- I work 100% in tech.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.350
- You look like a guy
who works in tech.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.718
How much money do you guys make?

00:01:58.718 --> 00:01:59.786
(both laugh)

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.554
- I make tech money.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.989
- Yeah but I don't
know what that means.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.258
I make digital money.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.860
- Enough to live
in San Francisco.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.027
- Ooh all right.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:08.962
What about you?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.230
- I don't make tech money.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.631
- What do you do,
are you a barista?

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.932
- No, a little bit
better than that.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:13.833
- Urban Outfitters?

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:14.667
What do you do?

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.002
- I work for the city.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.003
- That's worse than
Urban Outfitters.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:18.838
(laughing)

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
Where's your girlfriend,
I don't see her?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.708
- She goes to a
different school.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:22.775
- How long have you
guys been together?

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.710
- What time is it?

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.678
- Ooh, is that my window?

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.415
- You might have a little
window of opportunity here.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.618 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I mean, girl's revenge
is always the worst,

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.019
you know what I mean?

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.387 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm not looking to get
chopped up into little pieces.

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:35.822
Do you guys have sunscreen on?

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.724 align:start size:94% position:6%
I can tell you're a
ginger, you might need it.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.225
- I don't, no.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.593 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What part of your body would
you like to be rubbed down?

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.629
Or I mean, protected?

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.563
Sorry.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.831
- Just my neck and arms for now

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.466
'cause I'm pretty
covered otherwise.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.035
- All right, can we get some...

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.271
I'm really good with my hands.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.772
I don't know, it's weird.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.474
Do you wanna try to pick me up?

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.275
Wow!

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.945
- Yo, me and Hanna are out.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.482
(drum and keyboard hit)
