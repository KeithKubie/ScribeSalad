00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.570
- What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.850
is compare the fraction
7/10 to the fraction 8/9.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.930
And, like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.470
and see if you can figure
out where these things--

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.010
one of these is larger than the other,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.330
or whether they are equal.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.570
So, for me in this video, I
want to think about it visually.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.750
And I'm going to do that
using wholes of the same size

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390
that are circles.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.770
So let me draw them or
let me get them, here.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.250
So there you go, so these
are wholes of the same size.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.530
I'm gonna compare 7/10 of
this whole of the circle

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.430
to 8/9 or this whole.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.890
Which is a circle of the exact same size.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.030
If you're comparing 7/10 of a small circle

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.350
to 8/9 of a bigger circle
or 7/10 of a big circle

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.010
to 8/9 of a smaller circle
or a different shape,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.770
then you really can't make the comparison.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.970
But we're gonna compare
7/10 of the same whole

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.950
to 8/9 of the same whole.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.750
Now, you can see the way
that I've pre-drawn it.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750
The circles are the same size,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.010
but I have divided them into a
different number of sections.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.710
Here, since I have
10ths, I've divided into,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.930
you see that I've divided it
into, one, two, three, four,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.590
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten sections.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.690
Over here, since we're dealing with 9ths,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.370
you can see I've divided
it into one, two, three,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.710
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine sections.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.570
But let's think about
what 7/10 represents.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.450
It represents 7 of these 10 sections.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.590
So let me color them in.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.270
Let me get my coloring in tool.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.190
So that represents one, two, three four,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.850
five, six, seven out of the ten sections.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.750
Now what about 8/9?

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.090
8/9 is going to represent 8
of these 9 equal sections.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.450
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.910
seven, eight of those sections.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.050
So which one of these is larger?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.810
Which one is larger?

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.810
Well you can see very clearly,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.470
remember we're using 8/9 of the same whole

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.830
and 7/10 of that exact same whole.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.870
You see that we have
colored in more in magenta,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.330
or this pinkish color
than we have in blue.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.670
So 8/9 is the larger of these two.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.010
Or we could say that
7/10 is less than 8/9.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.890
And once again, the way I
remember what symbol to use,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.770
we always want it opening to the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.950
larger of the two number or the little,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.010
the tip is going to be pointing to the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.530
smaller of the two number.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.120
So, 7/10 is less than 8/9.
