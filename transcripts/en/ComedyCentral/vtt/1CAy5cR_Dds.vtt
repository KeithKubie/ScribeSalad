00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.703
All right, to help me
with today's exam,

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:04.938
please welcome our new
nightly show optics expert,

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:07.307
real-life eye surgeon
and Kentucky senator Rand Paul.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.409
(cheers and applause)

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.112
All right.
Welcome to the show, Rand.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.114
Have a seat.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.782
(cheers and applause)

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.384
Our crowd. Oh, yeah.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.987
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.089
Thanks. Uh, thanks
for taking the time

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.425
to be on our... our... being
our Nightly Show optics expert.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.960
Okay, so, uh, I mean, I assumed

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.862
you'd be too busy
with the presidential debates.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.731
And I'm gonna be,
like, a correspondent, right?

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:33.133
Uh, Larry, you're breaking up
a little bit. Could you...?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.868
-WILMORE: No, no, no,
you're sitting right here. -No?

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.136
Oh, I'm right here
being the... Okay.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.038
WILMORE: Yeah. Exactly.
Uh, okay, so...

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.373
(laughs)

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:42.609
So, now,
as an eye surgeon, uh...

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.412
uh, what's your take
on Donald Trump?

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.383
-(laughter)
-Well, you know, Larry,

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:53.754
have you ever had a speck
of dirt fly into your eye?

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.689
Yeah, I mean,
that's really annoying, yup.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.057
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.192
Annoying, irritating.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.061
Might even make you cry.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.329
(laughter)

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.798
Sure. Sure.
I'm with you.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:08.402
-But if the dirt doesn't go
away... -WILMORE: Mm-hmm.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.538
...it'll keep scratching away
at your cornea

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:15.275
until it eventually blinds you
with all its filth, and then,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.811
it makes fun of you on CNN.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.646
(laughter)

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.883
Think you got a little personal
in there, uh...

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:26.420
I got it. So you're saying
the eye is a conservative voter,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.455
and Donald Trump is
the speck of dirt, right?

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.158
-No, Larry.
-WILMORE: Uh-uh?

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:33.560
Donald Trump is
a delusional narcissist

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.696
and an orange-faced windbag.

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.698
-(laughter and groaning)
-WILMORE: Huh.

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:39.599
(applause and cheering)

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.169
WILMORE:
Yeah?

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:46.206
A speck of dirt is way
more qualified to be president.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.208
-(applause and cheering)
-Well said.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:50.110
Our new correspondent,
Rand Paul, everybody.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.378
Thank you.

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:52.913
Thank you. You're breaking up
a bit, Larry.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.381
-WILMORE: No, you don't have
to do that. -Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.249
Well, thanks for having fun
with us.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.884
Do you have time to answer
a couple questions, actually?

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.286
That-that was very good.
Did you have fun doing it?

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:00.687
If... Are they easy... easy
questions? -Very easy questions.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.123
-All right, all right.
-Uh, this is very easy.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.459
Why are you running
in the Republican Party?

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.194
I don't understand that.

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.929
I mean, you're pro-weed.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.231
-Uh, you're like...
-No, no, no.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.233
-I'm just not anti-weed.
-No, you're pro-weed. You're...

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.568
No, no, no,
I'm just not anti-weed.

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.436
-No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
-Okay. Whatever you say.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.005
You-you help people
with their glaucoma.

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.273
-You're pro-weed, right? Okay.
-(laughter)

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.275
Anti-prison industrial complex.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.678
You've talked, uh, very
eloquently about prison reform.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.046
Is there, like, a middle ground

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:27.581
-of people that you're looking
for... -Well...

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:28.815
...that aren't Republican,
aren't Democrat?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.283
Are there people in there?
Like, huge...?

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.052
There are people from both sides
that we're trying to get.

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:33.453
Yeah. Okay.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.789
From the right, there are people
who believe in economic liberty.

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.559
From the left, there are people
who believe in personal liberty.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.628
And really what we're trying
to do is join liberty together

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:43.864
to say, you know what?
Across the board,

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:45.932
-government ought to stay out
of your life. -WILMORE: Uh-huh.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.703
Jeb Bush said he'd go back in
time and kill baby Hitler, okay?

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.405
Um, would you go back in time

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.273
and stop baby Trump
from being born?

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.275
(laughter)

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.578
You know, I'm not sure I would
say that Trump is Hitler.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.081
-Goebbels maybe.
-WILMORE: I'm not saying that.

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.649
Goebbels maybe,
but I'm not saying Hitler.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.351
-I'm not going there.
-Really? So, you're really...

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.619
You're going there, then.

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.920
No, no, no.
I've said he wasn't Hitler.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.922
-WILMORE: No, you just went
there. -No, no, no, I...

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:12.192
I steadfastly said he was
not Hitler, but maybe Goebbels.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.861
But I have seriously
compared him to Gollum

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.263
from The Lord of the Rings.

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:17.831
Yes, I understand
where Gollum is from, right.

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:18.999
-You know, "My precious."
-Yes.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.667
You know, the ring,
the ring of power.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.669
That's very scary what
you just did, by the way.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.571
-Yeah, I know. I know.
-(laughter)

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.140
-But what I've been trying
to tell people... -Yes.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.443
-What worries most
about Trump... -What is that?

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.445
...other than all
of the other crazy things

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:34.514
is that I believe that
he wants power, and I believe,

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:36.850
from my point of view,
that power corrupts,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.519
and that the whole purpose
of our founding fathers

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.555
and our country was
to contain power.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.990
The Constitution was to restrain
the size of government...

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.992
-WILMORE: Mm-hmm.
-...and keep power at a minimum.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.761
And I don't want power
to gravitate

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.696
to a Republican or a Democrat.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:52.733
-Yes, go ahead.
-(applause and cheering)

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.434
You are certainly
your own candidate.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.670
You don't... you don't seem
to follow any side.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.272
You follow your own path, and
I think that's really something.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.141
All right, are you ready
to play Keep It 100?

00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:02.809
To answer
a Keep It 100 question?

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.144
-That. Okay.
-(applause and cheering)

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:06.379
-PAUL: Was I really good
at this game? -Yes. No.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.848
-You have to do this.
-Oh, yeah.

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:09.449
You have to keep your answer
100% real.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.518
Ready? Okay,
other than Donald Trump--

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.453
you can't mention Trump, okay--

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.888
who is the biggest dick

00:04:14.888 --> 00:04:17.257
of all the GOP candidates
right now?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.327
And I know you have an answer.

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.629
Larry, I think
you're breaking up here.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.465
-Um, can you, uh, help us,
uh...? -WILMORE: Who is it?

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.834
-Come on. Who is it?
-(audience shouting out)

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.169
You know, before...

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.104
Just say Ted Cruz. Just say it.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.672
He's the biggest tool, right?

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.141
Just say,
"Ted Cruz is a tool, Larry."

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:35.609
-Yeah.
-Just say that.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.778
-See, before we came on here...
-Just say, Ted Cruz is a tool.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.412
Please, just say it. Just
say it, damn it! Just say it!

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.481
Before we came on here...

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.650
-Before... before... -WILMORE:
Just say Ted Cruz is a tool.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.052
-Ah.
-Rand Paul, everybody!
135
00:04:46,052 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
-That's all we got.
-(applause and cheering)
