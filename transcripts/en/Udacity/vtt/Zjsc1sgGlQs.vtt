00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay. So we've already talked about one way to visualize a mass bobbing on a spring.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let me draw that picture up here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay. So we're thinking about this mass going up from Xmax to -Xmax.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And we've talked about this interpretation over here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But this was a graph of position versus velocity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What if I want to know position versus time? Well, time = 0.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Our mass started up here at Xmax. Remember the period was 2 seconds.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
After 2 seconds, well, one cycle one period means that the mass

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
has returned to its original starting point.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What happened after 1 second halfway between these two?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Well after 1 second, our object was way down here all the way to -Xmax.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
After 0.5 seconds, the object passes through equilibrium

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so we're going to draw out the position on this 0 line and same with after 1.5 seconds.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It turns out that if you fill in more and more parts of this graph, more and more dots,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you'll see a shape start to emerge.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And you can fill in those dots using the math we learned just in the previous video.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is a graph of position versus time, which we call x(t) and this is a wonderful equation.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's just that we have some maximum, let's call this amplitude,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that's modified by this function sin(ωt+π/2).

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And this is just some function that whenever I plug in the t,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it gives me a number between -1 and 1 and it repeats forever.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now, I'm going to draw some potential graphs for the velocity as a function of time.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I want you to tell me which one is the best.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I've drawn you some graphs. No, it's not just a bunch of pretty pictures.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Though I agree they are very beautiful.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This may look confusing but the way to read this graph is to look one color at a time.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We know that the blue graph depicts a position versus time.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And what we want now is velocity versus time and there's four candidates.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well there's the blue graph. Maybe you think it has the exact same graph as positioned.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There's the green and the pink and the red.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, I want you to look through these and think which makes sense.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And the best thing to do will be to look at this diagram and think. Okay.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If our motion is starting up here and progressing around this phase diagram,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which of these graphs best makes sense for the velocity as function of time?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And think, does the particle start with velocity?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Or does it start with positive, negative, zero velocity?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
When is the velocity negative? When is it positive?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Everything you can learn from this, you should be able to see reflected in this graph somehow.

00:02:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Go ahead and take a stab at it. This is a tricky question.
