00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.770
Classify quadrilateral ABCD.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.380
Choose the option that best
suits the quadrilateral.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.530
We're going to pick whether it's
a square, rhombus, rectangle,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.710
parallelogram, trapezoid,
none of the above.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.920
And I'm assuming we're
going to pick the most

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.000
specific one possible, because
obviously all squares are

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.670
rhombuses, or rhombi,
I guess you'd say.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.900
Not all rhombi are squares.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.910
All squares are also rectangles.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.370
All squares, rhombi, and
rectangles are parallelograms.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.720
So we want to be as specific
as possible in picking this.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.492
So let's see, point
A is at 1 comma 6.

00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:37.950
I encourage you to
pause this video

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.560
and actually try this on your
own before seeing how I do it,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.290
but I'll just proceed.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.030
So that's point A
right over there.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.520
Point B is at
negative 5 comma 2.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.440
That's point B.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.640
Point C is at-- just had
some carbonated water,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.740
so some air is coming up.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.970
Point C is at
negative 7 comma 8.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.920
So that is point C
right over there.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.450
And then finally, point
D is at 2 comma 11.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.830
And actually that kind
of goes off the screen.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.940
This is 10, 11 would
be right like this.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.840
So that would be 2 comma 11.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.640
If we were to extend
this, this is 10

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.060
and this is 11 right up here.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.010
2 comma 11.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.460
So let's see what this
quadrilateral looks like.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.170
You have this line right
over here, this line right

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.130
over there, that line
right over there,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:48.040
and then you have
this line like this,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.492
and then you have
this like this.

00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:52.950
So right off the bat, well it's
definitely a quadrilateral.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.440
I have four sides.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.340
But the key question, are
any of these sides parallel

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.420
to any of the other sides?

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.366
So just looking at it, side CB
is clearly not parallel to AD.

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:10.270
You just can look at it.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.950
Now it also looks like
CD is not parallel to BA,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.760
but maybe I just drew it badly.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.980
Maybe they actually
are parallel.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.847
So let's see if we
can verify that.

00:02:21.847 --> 00:02:23.930
So the way to tell whether
two things are parallel

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.790
is to actually figure
out their slopes.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.460
So let's first figure out
the slope of AB, or BA.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.530
So let's figure
out our slope here.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.020
Your slope is going
to be the change

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.350
in y over your change in x.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.260
And in this case,
you could think of it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.210
as we're starting at the
point negative 5 comma 2,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.210
and we're ending at
the point 1 comma 6.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.710
So what's our change in y?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.800
Our change in y, we
go from 2-- we're

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.450
going from 2 all the way to 6.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.880
Or you could say it's 6 minus
2, our change in y is 4.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.540
What's our change in x?

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.510
Well we go from negative 5
to 1, so we increased by 6.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.090
Or another way of thinking
about it, 1 minus negative 5,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.580
well that's going
to be equal to 6.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.590
So our slope here is 2/3.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.990
It's 2/3.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.160
Every time we move 3
in the x direction,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.960
we go up 2 in the y direction.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.200
Move 3 in the x direction,
go up 2 in the y direction.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.410
Now let's think about
line CD up here.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.620
What is our slope?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.180
Our change in y over change
in x is going to be equal to,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.690
let's see.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.940
Our change in-- let's figure
out our change in x first.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.070
Our change in x, we're
going from negative 7

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.250
comma 8 all the
way to 2 comma 11.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.270
So our change in x, we're
going from negative 7 to 2.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.460
Or we could say 2
minus negative 7.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.930
So we are increasing by 9.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.620
That's our change in x.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.720
So that's going
to be equal to 9.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.029
And then our change in y, well
it looks like we've gone up.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.910
We've gone from 8 to
11, so we've gone up 3.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.870
Or we could say 11 minus 8.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.150
Notice, endpoint
minus start point.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.500
Endpoint minus start point.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.490
You have to do that on the
top and the bottom, otherwise

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.990
you're not going to actually
be calculating your change in y

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.130
over change in x.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.690
But you notice our change,
when our x increases by 9,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.630
our y increased by 3.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.640
So the slope here
is equal to 1/3.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.010
So these actually
have different slopes.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.410
So none of these lines are
parallel to each other.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.190
So this isn't even
a parallelogram.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.390
This isn't even a trapezoid.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.950
Parallelogram, you have to have
two pairs of parallel sides.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.530
Trapezoid, you have to have
one pair of parallel sides.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.520
This isn't the case for any of
these, or none of these sides

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.370
are parallel.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.395
So we would go with
none of the above.
