00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.290
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.920
- Good afternoon.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.300
Yes.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.860
My name is Hisa Kuriyama.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.010
I am the Faculty Director for
the Humanities at the Radcliffe

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.059
Institute.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.140
And I'd certainly like to
welcome you, and thank you

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.650
for coming this afternoon.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.390
I also want to congratulate
you for being here.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.480
Here you are on a beautiful
October afternoon, October 22,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.890
2018.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.470
Hopefully, this will be an
event that you'll remember

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.110
for the rest of your lives.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.810
You're very fortunate
to be here for, I think,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.510
what will be a memorable event.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.280
The fact that you're
here, I think,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.510
probably shows that you already
know the great pleasures

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.010
you have in store.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.450
We're welcoming,
first, Solmaz Sharif,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.260
who I think probably most
of you know something about.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.150
But let me just remind you.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.530
She is currently the Jones
lecturer in the Stanford

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.250
Creative Writing Program
and really one of the rising

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.580
stars in American poetry.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.950
Her first collection
of poetry, Look--

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.050
from which she'll be
reading from today--

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.510
was a finalist for the
National Book Award

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.560
and was named a New York
Times notable book of 2016,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.650
Publisher's Weekly
best book of 2016,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.310
The Washington Post best poetry
collection of 2016 and one

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.960
of The New Yorker's
books we loved in 2016.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.340
It's won her numerous
literary fellowships.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.240
And I think you'll see
why this afternoon.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.389
We're also privileged to have
Evie Shockley, another very

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.600
distinguished poet
and Radcliffe Fellow,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.910
with us to discuss
some Solamaz's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.020
poetry after her reading.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.750
Evie herself is a
prize-winning poet.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.090
And her collection,
Semiautomatic,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.180
was a finalist for the
Pulitzer Prize in poetry

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.150
and The Los Angeles Times
book prize in poetry.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.730
She's also a scholar of
African-American literature

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.700
and is a professor at
Rutgers University.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.400
We're happy to have Solmaz here
not only just because she's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.980
generously agreed to
give this poetry reading,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.770
but also she's with us for
this whole month working

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.690
on the papers of June Jordan,
who was one of her professors

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.160
at UC Berkeley.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.360
And as you may know,
June Jordan was

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:27.410
one of the great poets of
our times and, not least,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.070
a very eloquent
reader of poetry.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.950
And her papers at the
[? selection ?] do

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.480
include not only--

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.220
as I learned just now--

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.580
papers from her
childhood, but also

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.390
include an extensive series
of recordings of her readings

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.090
and her interviews.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.920
I mention this
because I think this

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.510
is one of the things that makes
poetry readings so interesting

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.170
and engaging, that our
encounter with most poets

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.660
is with the printed page.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.820
But here we have the
opportunity to really hear

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.060
the music that's latent in the
periods, the commas, the line

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.950
breaks, and in her work, Look.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.550
Solmaz utilizes not
only these conventions,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.959
but also it makes important use
of things like italicization

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.860
and capitalization.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.150
And I'm very curious to
hear how that translates

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.030
into the spoken word.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.290
And I mention this
not least because I

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.350
think it's important to
think about poetry readings

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.280
especially, but also lectures
in general, as participatory

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.290
events.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.100
So she's reading for us,
which is a opportunity for us.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.260
But as listeners, I think
it's important to think

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.210
about listening as an activity.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.760
And I want to conclude by
giving you a short passage

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.360
by [INAUDIBLE],, the French
historian of the 19th century,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.860
who, in his inaugural lecture
at the College de France,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.710
was thanking the people who
were transcribing his lecture

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.330
but also expressing
certain misgivings.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.370
This is December 29, 1842.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.490
He says, "You may
think that only one

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.820
person is speaking here.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.160
But you would be wrong.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.580
You are speaking, too.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.500
I act, and you react.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.050
I teach, and you teach me.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.590
I can feel your
objections, your approval.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.670
How?

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.370
It's impossible to say.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.880
It is the mystery of great
crowns, the flash of exchange,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.250
the interaction of minds.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.410
Teaching is not an exhibition.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.750
It is the fertile, mutual
communication between a speaker

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.870
and an audience.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.020
Let's explore together."

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.740
So with that, I'd
like you to all

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.590
welcome enthusiastically
our speaker, Solmaz Sharif.

00:06:21.304 --> 00:06:22.220
- Thank you, everyone.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.100
Hello.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.690
I am just so
overjoyed to be here.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.150
And I thank you so
much for coming.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.890
I'm going to start
by reading some poems

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.530
from my first collection,
which is called Look.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.790
And then maybe I'll close with
a couple newer poems at the end.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.860
But Look is a book that
deals in part with the US

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.530
Department of Defense's
Dictionary of Military

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.700
and Associated Terms.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.630
The US Department of Defense
has its own internal dictionary

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.780
that aims to supplement
standard English dictionaries,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.660
amending the definitions
that we might find

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.610
there to fit their context.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.840
So for example, the
word "look" itself

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.730
has been redefined by the
Department of Defense to mean,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.160
in mine warfare, a period
during which a mine circuit is

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.300
receptive of an influence.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.870
And the influence is
obviously the person

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.970
that is stepping on the mine.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.760
So the definition
gives us a kind

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.920
of example of the twisted
syntax, and the euphemism,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.730
and everything that really goes
into creating a language that

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.910
will allow for violence.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:48.230
And I have always been obsessed
with state-sponsored language,

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.550
and how violence
against a bodies

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.990
is premeditated in a
violence against language,

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.790
how that intersects with
the role of the poet

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.720
as a caretaker of
language if nothing else,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.800
and what it might mean to
make the language of the state

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.780
reckon with the
language of the lyric

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.630
and the language of the self.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.400
And so that's where it
starts with this book.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.590
Maybe to give us a sense
of the this DOD language,

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.100
I'll actually read a poem that's
called "Perception Management."

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.180
It's an abridged list
of actual operation

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.600
names taken from the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.078
"Perception Management.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.830
Antica Babylonia, Baghdad,

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:48.160
Suicide Kings, Gun Barrel

Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.140
"Look."

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.710
"It matters what
you call a thing.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.600
Exquisite-- a lover
called me exquisite.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.120
Whereas, well, if I
were from your culture

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.940
living in this country, said the
man outside the 2004 Republican

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.580
National Convention, I would put
up with that for this country.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.080
Whereas, I felt the
need to clarify,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.746
you would put up with
torture, you mean?

00:10:05.746 --> 00:10:07.740
And he proclaimed, yes.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.050
Whereas, what is your life?

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.330
Whereas, years after they
look down from their jets

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.390
and declare my mother's
[INAUDIBLE] block probably

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.660
destroyed, we walked by the
villas, the faces of buildings

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.420
torn off into dioramas,
and recorded it

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.910
on a handheld camcorder.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.300
Whereas, it could take
as long as 16 seconds

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.690
between the trigger pulled
in Las Vegas and the Hellfire

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.180
Missile landing
in Mazar-i-Sharif,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.340
after which they will
ask, did we hit a child?

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.640
No, a dog, they will
answer themselves.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.580
Whereas, the federal judge at
the sentencing hearing said,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.480
I want to make sure I pronounced
the defendant's name correctly.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.470
Whereas, this lover
would pronounce my name,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.630
and call me exquisite,
and lay the floor lamp

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.080
across the floor,
softening even the light.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.140
Whereas, the lover made my
heat rise, rise so that,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.120
if heat sensors
were trained on me,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.790
they could read my thermal
shadow through the roof

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.410
and through the wardrobe.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.010
Whereas, it's not like
seeing a dead body walking

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.179
to the grocery store here.

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:07.970
It's not like that.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.530
It's a rock.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.230
You know it's a rock.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.646
It's kind of, like, acceptable
to see that there and not--

00:11:11.646 --> 00:11:16.130
it was kind of like seeing a
dead dog or a dead cat lying.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.010
Whereas, I thought if you
would look at my exquisite face

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.130
or my father's, he
would reconsider.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.070
Whereas, you mean I
should be disappeared

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.140
because of my family name?

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.000
And he answered, yes,
that's exactly what I

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.696
mean, adding that his wife
helped draft the Patriot Act.

00:11:33.696 --> 00:11:35.070
Whereas, the
federal judge wanted

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.280
to be sure he was pronouncing
the defendant's name correctly

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.140
and said he had read
all the exhibits, which

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.080
included the letter I wrote to
cast the defendant in a loving

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.760
light.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.040
Whereas, today, we celebrate
things like his transfer

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.930
to a detention center
closer to home.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.770
Whereas, his son has
moved across the country.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.260
Whereas, I made nothing happen.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.360
Whereas, you know not what
shall be on the morrow.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.100
For what is your life?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.200
It is even a thermal shadow.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.700
It appears so little and then
vanishes from the screen.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.870
Whereas, I cannot
control my own heat.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.740
And it can take as
long as 16 seconds

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.160
between the trigger, the
Hellfire Missile, and a dog,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.820
they will answer themselves.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.750
Whereas, a dog, they will say.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:24.350
Now therefore, let it
matter what we call a thing.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.020
Let it be the exquisite face
for at least 16 seconds.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.220
Let me look at you.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.820
Let me look at you in a light
that takes years to get here."

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.050
"Deception Story."

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:53.110
"Friends describe my disposition
as stoic, like a dead fish,

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.200
an ex said.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.030
Distance is a
funny drug and used

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.580
to make me a distressed
person, one who

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.770
cried in bedrooms and airports.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.440
Once, I bawled so
hard at the border

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.500
even the man with the stamps
and holster said, don't cry.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.910
You'll be home soon.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.990
My distribution over the globe
debated and set to quota.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.940
A nation can only
handle so many of me.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.170
Ditching class, I break into
my friend's dad's mansion

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.840
and swim in the Beverly
Hills pool in a borrowed

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.660
T-shirt, a brief diversion.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.880
My body breaking the
chlorinated surface

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.140
makes it momentarily my house,
my division of driveway gate

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.870
and alarm codes, my
dress-rehearsed doctrine

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.540
of pool boys, and
ping pong, and water

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.680
delivered on the backs of
sequinned Sparkletts trucks.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.910
Over here, Dolly, an
agent will call out

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.870
then pat the hair at
your hot, black dome.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.150
After explaining what
she will touch, backs

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.990
of the hands of the
breast and buttocks,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.540
the hand goes
inside my waistband.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.300
And my heart goes
dormant, a dead fish.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.110
The last female assist,
I decided to hit on.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.840
My life in the American
dream is a downgrade,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.790
a mere draft of home.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.310
Correction-- it
satisfies as drag.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.820
It is snarling what
I carve of it alone."

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.780
I have an uncle--

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:25.780
or had-- an uncle who was a
draftee in the Iran-Iraq War

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.730
and was killed.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.700
And I never met him.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.390
And I learned that,
when he was killed,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.470
he had a slim photo
album on his body.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.350
And I also learned that
he had sent letters

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.690
from the front lines
home to his family.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.540
And so I used those
materials, and basically

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.880
whatever I could
get my hands on,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.210
whatever Wikipedia entry, or
little historical document

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.610
that I could find to
try to piece together,

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.530
understand this life.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.529
And I wrote a long
elegy out of this.

00:14:58.529 --> 00:14:59.820
It's called "Personal Effects."

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.820
And I'll just read a
few sections of that.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.710
It opens with an
epigraph by Susan Sontag.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.320
"Like guns in cars, cameras
are fantasy machines

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.953
whose use is addictive.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.990
I place a photograph of my uncle
on my computer desktop, which

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.080
means I learned to ignore it.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.160
He stands by a tank, helmet
tilting to his right,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.640
bootlaces tightened as if
stitching together a wound.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.250
Alive, the hand
brings up a cigarette

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.920
we won't see him taste.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.080
Last night, I smoked
one on the steps

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.670
outside my barn apartment.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.130
I promise, I broke myself.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.100
He promised himself
he wouldn't and did.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.390
I smell my fingers.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.990
And I'm smelling his hands
of smoke and gunpowder,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.330
hands that promised
they wouldn't but did.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.630
You were not ready.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.520
But they issued the shovel,
and the rifle, and you dug.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.010
But to watch you sitting
there between the sandbags.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.090
But to watch the sand
spilling out the bullet holes.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.430
But what did they expect?

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.870
But what did they really think
a sheet of metal could prevent?

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.290
But I sat rolling
little ears of pasta

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.820
off my thumb like helmets.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.160
But it was not a
table of fallen men.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.320
But my hand registered fatigue.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.620
But the men in fatigues were
tired of sleeping in shifts.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.960
But you snuck into
town and dialed home

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.390
until you wrote your
fingers were tired.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.370
But the code for
Shiraz was down.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.050
But all of Shiraz was down.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.150
But the sheet lightning
above the Ferris wheel

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.050
of rusted bolts.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.480
But I'm sure they are
all right, you wrote.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.190
Well, to reassure yourself.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.610
But the wind like an old mouth
shaking the unnamed evergreen

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.000
outside my window.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.801
But what I mean is I'd like
very much to talk a bit.

00:16:52.801 --> 00:16:53.300
Hello.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.150
Daily, I sit with
the language they've

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.820
made of our language
to neutralize

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.300
the capability of the
low-dollar-value items

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.369
like you.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.230
You are what is referred
to as a casualty,

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.130
unclear whether from a catalytic
or frontal attack, unclear

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.890
the final time you were
addressed thou beloved.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:27.569
It was, for us, a catastrophic
event, just destroyed.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:32.080
Died of wounds
received in action.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.720
Yes, there was early warning.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.580
You said you were especially
scared of mortar rounds.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.140
In execution
planning, they weighed

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.390
the losses, the
sustainability, and budgeted

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.920
for X number of you.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.290
They budgeted for the
phone call to your mother

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.200
and weighed that against
the amount saved in rations,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.210
and your taste for
cigarettes, and the tea

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.230
you poured your
boys, and the tea

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.870
would have poured
me approaching,

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.330
hello, the change you
collected in jars,

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.460
jumping a bit as
the family learns

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.380
to slam the home's
various doors.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.020
What I see are your
hands peeling apples,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.690
the skin curling to
the floor and one long

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:22.790
unravel, a spit-up film reel
loosened from its canister.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.970
And I'm not even sure they
are apples, quince, pear,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.650
some desert potato with a stem.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.450
From the number
of peels, I assume

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.910
you're feeding the
other men in your tent.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.200
Your head is down.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.980
Maybe the cameraman
asks you to look at him

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.850
and you couldn't stomach it.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.590
Maybe around you today they
fell until you didn't understand

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.840
how you hadn't been hit.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.570
I decide you were happy for
the knife in your hands,

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.670
the white dust on
your bare feet.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.400
I am happy to see your
bare feet in this photo.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.390
They are the only
things that made me cry.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.260
It's that they existed and that
they, appalling, look so dead

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.089
already.

00:19:08.089 --> 00:19:09.880
I think it's fair to
say you want something

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.421
to do with your hands, whether
or not the photographer placed

00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:15.190
the apples in front of you,
whether or not they are apples,

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.690
whether or not
earlier that day you

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:21.430
saw a friend's lungs peeking
out the back of his throat.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.670
I cannot name the weapons
leaning on the wall behind you.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.610
Kalashnikovs, Howitzers,
as you write a letter.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.130
I wrote, I burned my
finger on the broiler

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.982
and smelled trenches, my
uncle pissing himself.

00:19:32.982 --> 00:19:33.940
How can she write that?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.390
She doesn't know, a friend,
a daughter of a Vietnam vet,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.320
told another friend, another
daughter of a Vietnam vet.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.940
I write him daily.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.790
And so I learn to ignore him.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.280
And so I begin to
list pocket contents

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.070
as if filing an autopsy report.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.280
And I place in his hands
a metal tongue of a fly.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.300
And I place in his hands a metal
tongue of a tank control board.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.320
And I place in his hands a Bic
lighter and loose-leaf paper.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.410
And I place in his hands
a trigger, a shudder.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.560
And still, not even a
bar of his laughter.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.140
And by April, the
script in his letters

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.000
grew tighter, barbed, men
in a shoulder-width trench.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.020
And when I sounded out
'mean' to mean landmine,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.300
a hole appeared in his letter,
and I couldn't look at it.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.970
And I drove into a
pothole after a pothole.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.330
And I drove past 100
balloons held down in a net.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.380
And gone even the
netting over his helmet.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.510
And alive, we
bring out his hands

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.420
to hold together his neck.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.850
And I place in his
hands his head.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.780
And I place in his
hands my hands.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.920
And I place in his eyes look
we share in the rear view.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.400
And a place between
us a bar of laughter.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.850
And I place between us the
looking and the telling

00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.690
they want dead."

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.100
So I was asked to
write a nature poem.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.850
And I tried to write one.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.740
And it's called "Inspiration
Point Berkeley," which

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.600
is a place in Tilden Regional
Park in Berkeley, California

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.530
and has this great peace grove.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:41.000
Anyway, it did not stay
in nature for very long.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.180
But one of the things
that I was thinking about

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:51.670
as I was writing this poem
is if settler colonialism

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.610
was a certain kind of
sentence, what might it be?

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.410
And then it became
very clear to me

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.740
immediately that it would
be a run-on sentence that

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.610
is grabbing as much as
possible comma by comma.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.610
And of course-- or
maybe not of course--

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.840
but I am interested in the
ways that, quote unquote, "land

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.450
preservation," and the
construction of parks,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.920
and the maintenance of parks is
lined up and lines up with land

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.170
grabs in a settler
colonial project

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:26.800
that aims to create a land
that is seen as free of people.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.993
So, "Inspiration
Point Berkeley."

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.180
"Consider Kissinger, the
honorary globetrotter of Harlem

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.390
who spins on fingertip
the world as a balloon,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.850
the buffoon erected
and beplaqued here

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.340
by the Rotary Club as evergreen.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.780
And in this peace grove planted
alongside Waldheim and Nixon,

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.750
Bush, Herbert Walker,
and Mother Teresa, one

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.930
Pope, one Dalai
Lama, one Dr. King.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.010
Kissinger, who is the one
the bunnies in Hughes mansion

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:06.260
voted MILF, and is named here in
our great tradition of naming,

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.140
as on the Anza expedition
the Conquistadors dropped

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.850
armored mission,
after armored, mission

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.480
after saints, Luis Obispo,
Francisco, et cetera.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.010
Up this Western coast,
my lover and myself

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.600
now, by cleared path regard,
hardly touching each other

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.750
or the invasive grasses
the Conquistadors also

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.330
brought, perhaps by
boot sole, perhaps

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:30.080
by taste, as we like to do
to tote, and plant, and raise

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.650
a home we can recognize,
even when we want a new.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.620
We two innovators
who love to recognize

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.850
each other by shoulder stoop,
by tone, behind closed door,

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.980
or down beyond the trail bend.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.290
And so the grasses
are Mediterranean,

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.680
as were the Spanish in what was
before their former windows,

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.730
as is Vista Point, which is
where we are asked to stand

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:57.860
to see before us land unnamed
and imagine ourselves,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.120
we twin atoms, as the didactics
that the trail heads suggest,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.690
witnessing the native flora
that, before eucalyptus

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.070
and other pacification,
flourished here,

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.920
didactics that provide a
painted rendition of the lands,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.640
wild flowered and alive,
before the Spanish came.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.260
And we came behind them.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.740
And there is not a [? wan ?]
in the painting, not a bowl

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.030
or blanket, not a toe
or term of endearment,

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.530
not a mother, not a swimmer
in the painted pre-Spanish San

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.490
Pablo creek.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.930
Though, there are
realistically-rendered salmon.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.000
There is nothing that has
nothing to do with this."

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.380
The first two lines
of this poem are

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.370
lifted from a translation
of Ovid's "Ibis"

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.210
poem, which is a cursed
poem that he wrote in exile.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:03.540
And it's written in the
middle of these poems that

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.410
are really pathetic
and heartbreaking pleas

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.410
to be allowed back home.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.750
But then there's this
elaborate curse that comes in.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.530
And so I left the lines.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.870
"Desired Appreciation."

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.210
Until now, now that
I've reached my 30s,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.540
all my muses' poetry has
been harmless, American,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.670
and diplomatic.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.410
A learned helplessness is
what psychologists call it,

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.040
my docile desired state.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.950
I've been largely
well-behaved and gracious.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.340
I've learned the doctors
learned of learned helplessness

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.290
by shocking dogs.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.450
Eventually, we things give up.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.580
Am I grateful to be here?

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.390
Someone eventually asks
if I love this country.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.180
In between the
helplessness, the agents,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.730
the nation must
administer a bit of hope,

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.330
must meet basic dietary needs,
Ensure, by tube, by nose,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.720
by throat, by other orifice.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.370
Must a fist-bump a janitor.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.470
Must muss up some
kid's hair and let him

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.079
loose around the Oval Office.

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:07.620
Click, click.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.370
It could be cameras or the
teeth of handcuffs closing

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.900
to fix the arms overhead.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.850
There must be a doctor
on hand to ensure

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.100
the shoulders do not dislocate.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.359
And there must be Prince's
"Raspberry Beret."

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:21.900
Click, click.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.530
It could be Morse code tapped
out against a coffin wall

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.990
to the neighboring coffin.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.180
Outside my window,
the snow lights

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.190
cobalt for a bit at dusk.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.870
And I'm surprised
every second of it.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.930
I'd never seen the
country like this.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.620
Somehow, I can't say yes.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.310
This is a beautiful country.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.430
I have not cast my eyes
over it before, that

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.340
is in this direction.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.510
It's how John Brown put
it when he looked out

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.390
from the scaffold.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.890
I feel like I must muzzle
myself, I told my psychiatrist.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.150
So you feel dangerous? she said.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.330
Yes.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.000
So you feel like a threat?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.460
Yes.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.367
Why was I so
surprised to hear it?"

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:24.800
That poem led me down a rabbit
hole of self-help texts,

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.500
and the self-improvement
industry,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.160
and, specifically,
all the ways that we

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.970
are asked to change or
alter the language that we

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:40.010
use to describe the world around
us in order to make ourselves

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.940
better subjects and in
order to be able to tolerate

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.680
what is surrounding us.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:51.030
So I see it as a
inverse of "Look."

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.640
I'm looking, basically,
at how power insists

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.170
upon our own personal inner
language, and the language

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.730
that we use to speak
to one another,

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.310
and the challenge that
we present ourselves with

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:08.240
to be altered in order to live.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.600
So this poem, called
"Social Skills Training,"

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.600
begins with two lines that are--

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.790
I was reading those studies that
are kind of like negotiation

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:20.510
tactics.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.370
If you want to get
this thing done,

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.400
word it this way, not this way.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.630
And so they're lifted
from two such studies.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.870
And you'll see.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.457
"Social Skills Training."

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.970
"Studies suggest, 'How
may I help you, officer?'

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.460
is the single most disarming
thing to say and not,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.590
'What's the problem?'

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.870
Studies suggest it's
best to help reply

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.380
'my pleasure' and
not 'no problem.'

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.690
Studies suggest it's best
not to mention problem

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.880
in front of power, even
to say there is none.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.420
Gloria Steinem says, women
lose power as they age.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.970
And yet, the loudest voice
in my head is my mother.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.130
Studies show the
model we have in mind

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.380
isn't the mother that exists.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.070
Mine says, what the
fuck are you crying for?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.560
Studies show, the baby monkey
will pick the fake monkey

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.380
with fake fur over the
fur-less wire monkey with milk

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.130
without contest.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.670
Studies show, to negate a
thing is to think it anyway.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:20.750
I'm not sad.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.770
I'm not sad.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.980
Studies recommend regular
expressions of gratitude

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.330
and internal check-ins.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.130
Studies define assertiveness
as self-respect cut

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.310
with the deference.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.800
Enough, the wire mother says.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.930
History is a kind of study.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.050
History says, we
forgave the executioner.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.820
Before we mopped the blood,
we asked, Lord, judge,

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.910
have I executed well?

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.830
Studies suggest, yes.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.620
What the fuck are you
crying for, officer?

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.440
the wire mother teaches me to
say, while studies suggest,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.690
Solmaz, have you thanked
your executioner today?

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:10.810
Dear [? Aleph, ?] like Ovid,
I'll have no last words.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:15.200
This is what it means
to die among barbarians.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.370
Bar, bar, bar was how the
Greeks heard our speech--

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.170
sheep, beasts.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.380
And so we became barbarians.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.040
We make them reveal the
brutes they are, [? Aleph. ?]

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.270
By the things we make them name.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:36.650
David, they tell me, is the
one one should aspire to.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.490
But ever since I
first heard them say,

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.760
Philistine, I've known I am
Goliath if I am anything.

00:30:48.232 --> 00:30:49.204
America.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.480
I had to.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.990
I learned it.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.556
It was if.

00:30:59.556 --> 00:31:02.470
If was nice.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.380
I said, sure, one more thing--

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.860
one more thing.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.280
Eat, it said.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.030
It felt good.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.760
I was dead.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.500
I learned it.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.718
I had to."

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.980
I'll read one last
poem to close.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.890
And then we'll move on into
a conversation, I hope.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.480
This poem is called
"The Master's House."

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:45.180
"To wave from the porch, to let
go of the garage, to disrobe,

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.542
to recall Ethel Rosenberg's
green, polka-dotted dress.

00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:51.660
To call your father
and say, I'd forgotten

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.630
how nice everyone in
these red states can be.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.600
To hear him say, yes, as long
as you don't move in next door.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.380
To recall every drawn curtain in
the apartments you have lived.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.170
To find yourself, at
33, at a vast expanse

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.160
with nary a pirates of
guidance, with nary a voice,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.520
a muse, a model.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.024
To finally admit out loud
then, I want to go home.

00:32:13.024 --> 00:32:15.190
To have a dinner party of
intellectuals with a bell,

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.650
long arm, lightly
tongued at each setting.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.770
To sport your done gown,
to revel in face serums,

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.260
to be a well-calibrated
burn victim,

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.890
to fight the signs of aging,
to assure financial health.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.670
To be lavender sachets, and
cedar lining, and all the ways

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.950
the rich might hide their rot.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.370
To eye the master's bone China.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.160
To pour diuretic in his
coffee and think this erosive

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.040
to the state.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.690
To disrobe when
the agent asks you.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:47.310
To find a spot on any
wall to stare into.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.250
To develop the ability to leave
an entire nation thusly just

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.940
by staring at a spot on the
wall as the lead vested agent

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.820
names, article by
article, what to remove.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.030
To do this in order to do the
other thing, the wild thing.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.280
To say, this is my filmdom,
the master's house.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.440
And I gazed upon
it, and it is good.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.720
To discuss
desalinization plants.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.390
To date, briefly,
a banker, a lapsed

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.000
Marxist and hear him
on the phone speaking

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.100
in billions of
dollars, its residue

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.990
over the clear bulbs
of his eyes as he

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.660
turns to look upon your nudity.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.360
To fantasize publishing a poem
in The New Yorker eviscerating

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.010
his little need.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.140
To set a bell at each
intellectual's table setting,

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.750
ringing idea after idea,
and be a simple-footed help

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.190
rushing to say, yes?

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.500
To disrobe when the
agent asks you to.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.990
To find a spot on any
wall to stare into,

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.200
to develop the ability to leave
an entire nation thusly just

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.210
by staring at a
spot on the wall.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.860
To say, this is my filmdom.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.180
To recall the settler who, from
behind, his mobile phone said,

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.490
I'm filming you for God.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.920
To recall this sad God, God
of the mobile phone camera,

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.890
God of the small black
globe and pixilated eye

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.035
above the blackjack table at
Harrah's and the metal tooth

00:33:59.035 --> 00:34:02.560
pit at Qalandia
Checkpoint the same.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.350
To recall the Texan that held
the shotgun to your father's

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.739
chest sending him falling
backward, pleading.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.730
And the words come
to him in Farsi.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:15.630
To be jealous of this, his
most desperate language.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.199
To lament the fact of your
lamentations in English,

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.980
English being your first defeat.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.100
To finally admit out loud
then, I want to go home.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.429
To know, for example, in
Farsi, the present perfect

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:34.330
is called the relational
past and is used, at times,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.510
to describe a historic
event whose effect is still

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.342
relevant today,
transcending the past.

00:34:40.342 --> 00:34:44.340
To say, for example,
[SPEAKING FARSI],,

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.949
translates to the
Shah was a dictator.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:50.699
But more literally, the
Shah is was a dictator.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:53.310
To have a tense of "is
was," the residue of it

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.159
over the clear
bulb of your eyes.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.280
To walk, cemetery after
cemetery, in these states

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.070
and nary a gravestone
reading Solmaz.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.100
To know no nation will
be home until one does.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.360
To do this in order to do the
other thing, the wild thing,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.688
though you've
forgotten what it was."

00:35:10.688 --> 00:35:11.686
Thank you.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.445
- Thank you, just thank you.

00:35:40.445 --> 00:35:43.560
Oh, I can't believe
this is the first time

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.520
I've heard you read--

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.290
- Oh, my gosh.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.270
- --live, so to speak.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:55.230
So I am deeply honored
and delighted to be here

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.015
to talk with you
about your work.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.920
How many have read some of Look
beyond what we heard today?

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.310
Yes, all right, this is
the audience we need.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.180
And I hope the rest
of you will join us.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:17.970
So I actually want to start with
one of the lines from your book

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:24.700
that I consider the most
load-bearing line or one

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.200
of the most load-bearing lines.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.900
It's in the title poem, "Look."

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.430
It comes near the end.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.250
You read it today.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:40.580
"Now therefore, let it
matter what we call a thing."

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.770
The project of this
book, in so many ways,

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:48.830
is to have the reader confront
that proposition about the use

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:55.400
and meaning of
language, and to really

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:01.700
think about what it
means to use language,

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:07.820
and why there's such an urgency
around that project for you.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.440
Could you talk a
little bit about what

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.760
it means to be a poet
writing in English

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.790
in the context of this book?

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.300
- Yeah.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.925
OK.

00:37:20.925 --> 00:37:22.550
I want to say something
about that line

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.590
that you pointed out
first, if that's OK.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.890
The first poem,
"Look," I wrote--

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.680
I worked on this book
for about eight years.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.900
And I wrote that poem
late in the game.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.280
So I got to basically
go back and say, what's

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.140
the opening poem of the book?

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.850
And I thought, what
is the argument

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.230
that I want to make, actually?

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.060
What is it that I want to enact?

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.450
And then I also thought,
this is not just

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.920
the opening poem to a book.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.260
But it's the opening
poem to the first book

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.580
of hopefully a life of books.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:00.740
And so I challenged myself
with the question of,

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.170
what is a statement
that you can make

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.740
that you feel like your
entire writing life will

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.990
be held in that statement?

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:16.050
And what is the role of the poet
as you see it or understand it?

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:20.570
And it simply was that it
matters what you call a thing.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:21.860
And it should matter.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:28.280
And my role as a poet, in part,
is to remain vigilant over that

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.750
kind of mattering and the kind
of care and attention that is

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.320
behind language and the words
that we use to describe each

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.650
other-- or not--

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.040
and to point to its absence.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:46.190
My relationship to English, in
particular, is a difficult one.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.560
English is, in many
ways, the language

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:54.050
of my own dispossession
and exile.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:58.750
I feel pretty
inadequate in English.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:04.700
Or I feel like I am not saying--

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.710
yeah.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:12.710
But I think that sense of lack,
or this idea that I can't quite

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.540
say what I need to
say, and I don't know

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.620
enough words in this
language to name my life

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.950
is something that
led me to poetry.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:26.300
Because when one
has only a few words

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.610
to describe one's
whole life, then one

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.440
has to become very
creative in how

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.590
you place those
words, to communicate

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.380
that the totality
of your thought,

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:39.410
and your mind, and your heart.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.360
So that's also part of it.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.670
- Yeah, and English,
do you consider it

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.680
your first language?

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.840
- I consider it my
second language.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:54.110
Though, I spent
the first two years

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:59.150
of my life learning
Farsi at home, basically.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.770
But that was in the US.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.800
So English was always around,
and in my ear, and everything.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:10.160
But it was the language that
I then had to learn, I think,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:10.900
after Farsi.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.490
Yeah.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:12.830
- Right, right.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:16.220
And so that
magnifies the problem

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.930
that writers like Ntozake
Shange and NourbeSe Philip

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.200
have also talked
about, which is--

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.030
and you referred to this--

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:31.490
this language being a
language in which you are--

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.106
did you say dehumanized?

00:40:34.106 --> 00:40:35.230
- One could say that, yeah.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.530
- One could say that--

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.920
in which some of us have
been colonized or enslaved.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:45.170
And as a writer, you
have to come to the page,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:49.790
and think about how to use words
that either didn't have you

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:55.910
in mind or did have you
in mind in different ways.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.920
- What did he say today?

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.030
What kind of Middle
East am I today?

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.060
Anybody?

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.120
John?

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:03.710
Unknown!

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.360
Thank you, yes.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.330
There are known knowns,
and known unknowns,

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.870
and other unknown
Middle Easterners.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.660
- OK.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:19.490
Yes, the depths to which
language can descend.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:25.580
So I'm also thinking
a lot about the idea

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.670
of defining terms,
and redefining them,

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.635
and the occlusion of meaning.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.270
But then also, what
it means to write in--

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.140
let me say it like this.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.440
If you come to writing with
a certain kind of skepticism

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.630
or wariness about the
kind of cynical way

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.630
that the language
can be used, how

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.730
do you find your
way to what might

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.350
be possible in a language?

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.740
What are the possibilities
of language for you?

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:08.740
- I think the
possibilities of language

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.800
are the possibilities
of power itself--

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.150
and in that way, huge, and
endless, and terrifying,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:20.530
but also terrific, perhaps,
if it is kept alive,

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:25.070
and if it is kept in
constant rotation,

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.390
and if it is as messy,
and as collectively

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.970
described and
realized as possible.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.670
And I think that
that's part of my role

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:39.420
is to keep language agitated
in that way if I can.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:48.550
And I think that I live for the
moment where a thing is named,

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.700
and there's a spark
of recognition.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.640
But that naming has not
yet become calcified--

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.540
or a thing that then is
pinning something down,

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.530
and becomes something
to a definition,

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.950
or a meaning to police
in any kind of way.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:07.490
And poetry feels, to me, to
be one medium where that is--

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.360
it's a requirement
of poetry, almost,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.340
just to keep language
that agitated and alive.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:17.730
And so politically, I think
that that is really important.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:20.380
And the possibilities
are endless in that way.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:24.580
- I love that word "agitation"
for the political meanings

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.700
it brings, as well as
the sense of that's

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.010
what a washing machine does.

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:29.910
It's agitating.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:35.470
So you're cleaning it somehow
of some of that baggage.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.980
There are so many places
to go once you raise

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.710
the idea of the political,
which your poetry does

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:46.480
from the beginning.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.210
We could talk about June Jordan
as an influence, to what extent

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:56.290
she might be responsible
for a pathway to showing you

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:58.400
what you could do with poetry.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.462
- Every extent, yeah.

00:43:59.462 --> 00:43:59.962
- Yeah.

00:43:59.962 --> 00:44:01.950
[LAUGHING]

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:04.050
Put that on the table.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.450
And also, just what--

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.260
you gestured to
how long you were

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.690
working on this book,
which came out in 2016.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.540
You started, I think, in 2011.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.930
- 2007, 2008.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.090
- Oh, right, right.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:21.610
OK, so it seems
to me, as someone

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:27.830
who sees you as a kindred
spirit in poetic terms,

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:32.500
that what it meant to write
"political poetry" in 2007

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:37.550
or even 2011 is a different
thing than what it means today

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.000
and the way that
word might circulate.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.630
So I would like to
just throw that at you.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.090
Do you embrace the
term political poet?

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.882
What did it mean to you then?

00:44:50.882 --> 00:44:52.090
What does it mean to you now?

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:52.714
Has it changed?

00:44:59.202 --> 00:45:01.160
- Put simply, the role
of the political poet it

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.470
is to speak truth to power.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:08.780
And so that is something
I'm invested in

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.570
and a term that I use
to describe myself

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.590
and my process for a long time.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.480
And I have been advised
on numerous occasions

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.770
by various people
to not use the term,

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:25.970
in part because it is seen
as potentially pigeonholing

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.040
and limiting.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.480
But I'm not worried
about that, honestly.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.880
It doesn't faze me
in any real way.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.950
I have noticed, I think, a shift
in the reception of or even

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:45.800
just the use of that term,
political poetry, in the US,

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:50.900
particularly in this
post-2016 Trump era, where,

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.585
for many people--

00:45:52.585 --> 00:45:53.210
or some people.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.490
I'm not sure the number--

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.290
this was a moment of crisis.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:01.280
So, how did we end up here?

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.600
While for some of
us or many of us,

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.840
it was a continuation
of what we had already

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.280
seen to be true in many ways.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.060
And in that crisis, I
think, many American writers

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:19.440
started to ask, where
are our political poets?

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.609
And well, we've been
here the whole time.

00:46:23.609 --> 00:46:24.650
And we have been writing.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:29.510
And June Jordan is one of those
people that is a political

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:34.820
poet, and is sorely
under-taught,

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:43.850
and has modeled so many ethical
and political positions that,

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:48.470
really, I think it would behoove
us all to spend time with her

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:49.540
work at this point--

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.170
and at any point, really.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.450
Her influence on me
has been tremendous.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.740
I actually never got a
chance to work with her.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.830
Her name was on the
schedule of classes

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:03.480
when I signed up for
Poetry for the People.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.420
And when I showed up
to the first class,

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.340
she was on medical leave.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.230
And this interesting
thing happened--

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:16.380
so Poetry for the
People, that semester,

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.040
they were teaching poems
in African/African-American

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.340
traditions,
Asian/Asian-American traditions.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.320
I can't remember
the third group.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.260
But the fascinating
thing was happening

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.090
where it was like,
she'll be here next week

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:31.640
to do a guest lecture
on this thing.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.650
Because that thing
is clearly the thing

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:37.250
that she should be giving
a guest lecture on.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:42.290
And every week, every topic in
this global body of literature

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:47.405
seemed to be the precise lecture
that she should be giving.

00:47:47.405 --> 00:47:53.240
And I thought, wow, the scope of
that mind and that sensibility.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.560
But week by week, she
was unable to come.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.770
And she died that summer.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:02.930
But I'm spending time
right now on her papers.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:06.920
And there's notes on an early
class that she gave on Brecht.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.399
And there's a quote of
his that she's written--

00:48:10.399 --> 00:48:11.190
I don't know where.

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:12.920
So if somebody knows
where this quote is from,

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.836
please do let me know.

00:48:13.836 --> 00:48:15.980
Because it's just been
this scrap in there--

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:21.790
but where Rex says, evil
has a physical address.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:27.640
And I think of June's
insistence on specificity,

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:35.360
on naming FBI, CIA, Lumumba,
Nkrumah, using actual names

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.160
to locate not just
evil, but celebration.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.790
And that insistence
on specificity

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:45.010
is really something
that's guided me,

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.580
and something that
I'm invested in,

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.870
and I also think that
perhaps something that

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:54.860
has been repressed
in American letters

00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:01.190
writ large as a lesser
than or a writing that

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.430
refuses to transcend
the specific

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:07.430
into this universal realm.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.220
And so part of my
answer to those critics

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.730
who might be asking, where
are our political poets,

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:17.810
it's, what in poetry
have you valued thus far?

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.620
And how have your values
repressed political possibility

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.500
in American poetry if
you're not seeing it?

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.300
- Right.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.980
What do we reward?

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.610
And what do we disseminate
and perpetuate?

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:35.480
June Jordan is having something
of a renaissance right now

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.750
for reasons including the
fact that her papers have been

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.430
opened up here at Radcliffe.

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.140
And I have so many
friends who've

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:49.460
come and been with you
virtually in the stacks

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.400
or in the archives.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.420
And so it's an exciting moment.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.930
She seemed to be prescient about
everything and, as you said,

00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:00.770
have something to say meaningful
and powerful about some so many

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.740
of the things that
we're confronting.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.540
I'm going to try to shift
gears, probably roughly.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.240
Because there's a whole
other aspect of your work

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:15.920
that I want to
bring to the fore.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.160
And maybe one of the
ways to do that is--

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.430
you talked about
naming and specificity.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:27.350
And it made me think about how
much her poetry uses lists.

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.940
You also use lists.

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:34.760
And you are a virtuoso in a
number of different forms,

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.320
like lists, the epistolary poem.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.770
You use syllabics.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.970
You, of course, do
this marvelous tour

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:48.330
of "the definition poem."

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:53.440
You seem to reach for a
number of different tools

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.730
to bring out the things
that concern you.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:01.885
Could you talk a little bit
about the form of your poetry?

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:08.620
But also, because it's
connected to the ideas

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.560
that we were talking about
in terms of the political

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.580
and what's rewarded--

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:18.650
Sonia Sanchez has said that
she used form, specifically

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:24.820
rhyme royal, to write about the
death of her brother from AIDS.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:30.230
She used form as a way
of managing her grief

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:35.090
to keep something poetic
happening as opposed to just

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.680
the meltdown on the page.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.230
Could you talk about your use
of form generally, but also

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:43.850
in relation to what
I can only Imagine

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:48.320
is the intense grief under
which you were writing

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.466
or about what you
were writing in Look?

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.920
- My relationship to form
is restless, and nomadic,

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.320
and constantly shifting.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.060
I rarely write in
inherited forms

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.450
but instead come up
with formal restrictions

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:17.180
to place on my poems as the
poems have decided them for me.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.330
And when I think of form, I
think of form as power enacted.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.050
And I think that form can be
one place where we can diagnose

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:26.810
the ways that power
might be interrupting

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:30.200
speech, or preventing speech
from reaching where it needs

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.050
to reach, breaking the music.

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:35.870
I'm drawn to syllabics
that are non-accentual,

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:40.250
because they are supposedly
such an unnatural thing that you

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:41.580
could do to English language.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.380
They are basically order
for the sake of order,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.410
just random numbers that have
decided what a line will be,

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:50.580
or not be, and where it
ends, and where it doesn't.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.900
And I find that my own
relationship to English

00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:00.375
is closer to that than
to a free-verse position.

00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.900
- A lyric position.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.830
- Or a lyric position, yeah.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:16.420
And so I don't know
that it enabled--

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:20.290
I'm trying to figure out my
forms relationship to grief

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:21.820
and to that kind of holding.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:27.310
I do know that, if I feel like
I am doing something in order

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:32.860
to make the thing that I'm doing
somehow more tolerable for me,

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.450
my own impulse is
then to stop doing it.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:39.430
So if I had been doing it, I
was doing it without knowing,

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:40.340
if that makes sense.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:40.930
- That's interesting.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.190
So it's the opposite for you.

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:44.620
You want something raw.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.460
- Yes.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.190
- Yeah.

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:52.540
That's a very vulnerable
position to place yourself.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.050
And do you find that--

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:58.990
how do you think about that
idea of rawness in relation

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:00.610
to creation?

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:04.150
Is poetry about beauty for you?

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:09.370
Or how would you define
beauty in the context

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:14.140
of that kind of creative act?

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:18.060
- I don't define beauty.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.520
I don't think much of beauty.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.260
I don't think much about it.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.220
I think much of it.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.290
I don't think much of
beauty, I don't think.

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:35.760
I think the thing
I'm more after truth.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.870
And maybe it's beauty.

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:45.250
But what I'm after is
an intensity of regard,

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:52.060
and attention, and experience,
and naming in a way

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.410
that heightens our awareness
of our own precarity

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:59.050
and our own mortality.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:04.150
And perhaps, sometimes, that
finds beauty but not always.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.240
And that's not really
the kind of anchoring

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.540
or guiding star for me
in that way, actually.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.880
- This is not emotion
recalled and tranquility.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.812
- Yeah.

00:55:13.812 --> 00:55:15.210
[LAUGHING]

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:16.655
- Right.

00:55:16.655 --> 00:55:18.760
I want to keep an
eye on the time.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:25.310
We want to have some time for
questions from the audience.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:30.635
But I will take this opportunity
to maybe ask you one or two

00:55:30.635 --> 00:55:31.135
more.

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.290
Can you talk a little
bit more about the way

00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:44.490
you use form in your poetry, not
in relation to inherited form,

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:47.220
but the look of your
poems on the page.

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:50.460
I was really struck by
Hisa's opening comments

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.310
about taking notice
of the way you

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:57.960
use the small caps to
signal these terms,

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:03.580
that you're drawing from the
US Department of Defense's

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.940
Definitions Dictionary.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.010
But we don't hear them.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:15.690
So there are other poems in
which you use blank space

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:22.440
to represent censorship, or to
represent an untranslatability,

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.700
perhaps other things.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:29.850
I don't think you read any
of those particular moments.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.590
Are they readable?

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:36.090
What is the meaning of silence
in your poetry in relation

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:37.320
to language?

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.660
And how do you think
about that visual form?

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:45.600
- So I have a number of
poems in the book that

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:49.140
are imagined letters to
a Guantanamo detainee.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.690
And it's called
"Reaching Guantanamo."

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:55.800
And I wrote it after I was
reading a New York Times

00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.240
article about the mental
health status of detainees.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.310
And this was in 2008.

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:05.270
And there was a line
in passing that said,

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:08.970
mail that reaches Guantanamo
detainees is heavily redacted

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:10.090
by the Joint Task Force.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:13.300
And it moved on from there.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.230
So I wrote a series of imagined
letters with redactions.

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.340
And the redactions are just
noted by white space as opposed

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.290
to a black bar.

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.330
There's something about
the white space that

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.250
also feels more
terrifying to me,

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:28.567
because you can't quite
tell where it ends.

00:57:28.567 --> 00:57:30.150
Like at the end of
the line, you don't

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:32.640
know if the white
space is continuing.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.930
And it's not as
defined and contained.

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.900
And for me, in
those poems, it was

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:46.500
important to really name and
honor the spiritual violence

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:51.060
that's carried out by
these acts of censorship,

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:55.500
and how they are
designed to, in fact,

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.380
make a prisoner then
question their own reality,

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:04.308
and what is before them on the
letter, and in front of them.

00:58:04.308 --> 00:58:09.450
When I read those poems,
my voice just drops out.

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:12.560
And I leave silence there.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.290
And I do think it's
possible to read.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:19.740
In terms of the DOD terms that
I use where I use small caps,

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:23.700
I wanted there to be multiple
experiences of the work.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.630
So there's one
experience that one has

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:29.370
when I read the poems out loud.

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:32.130
And then one can then go and
look at them on the page.

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:35.060
And there will be another
veil that's dropped over it.

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.195
And it's a veil that's
pointing to the violence that's

00:58:38.195 --> 00:58:40.740
just shimmering
underneath the language

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.650
that we're using
this whole time.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:47.250
And I liked the idea of having
a doubled experience of reading

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:52.650
the poems and having them be
somewhat deceptively one thing

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:54.840
in a reading and then
another thing in the book.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:00.450
And also, the experience of
reading the book and the way

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:02.486
that the line
breaks are happening

00:59:02.486 --> 00:59:04.860
is very different than the
way I read the poems out loud.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:10.380
And so one can kind of see,
visually, these moments

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.980
of more, like, violent
interdiction in the poems

00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.720
themselves, which was
important to me for this book.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.720
- It's really effective.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.150
There's so many moments
in the book that

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.660
leave me silent or speechless.

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:29.490
I think one of the poems that
probably grips me the most--

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:34.070
this is back to one of
the definitional poems--

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:34.750
"Theater."

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:42.900
There's something about-- the
speaker of this poem narrates

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.430
his own death, basically.

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:47.880
And of course, you could
think about Randall Jarell.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:54.970
But you remake that idea
in such a powerful way--

00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:58.200
the meaning of the word theater
in terms of theater of war,

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.380
and the meaning of theater
in terms of acting.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.920
And it all comes
together so amazingly.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.305
I just had to have
a moment to gush.

01:00:07.305 --> 01:00:08.520
- Thanks.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.580
- So before we open
it up for questions,

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.230
I'm going to ask
you an open-ended--

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:16.850
perhaps difficult-- question.

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:20.330
And that is, what was the
most difficult thing for you

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.415
in writing Look--

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.400
most difficult and
most challenging?

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.170
- I think the most
difficult thing

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:35.080
remains the reality
of the violence

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.590
that Look is talking
about and looking at.

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:45.570
And there is a quote in
here from a Frank Birdart

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:48.470
poem written in the
voice of Nijinsky,

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.700
the ballet dancer that
famously attempted

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:55.080
to choreograph World War
I to upset his audience

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.540
and lost his mind.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:04.110
And I think of that movement
and that dance that doesn't

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:05.910
actually exist anymore--

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:12.820
that I know-- as the muse behind
my own process and position

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.730
in writing this book,
which makes it and made

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:26.040
it necessarily overwhelming
and so difficult--

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.960
but as it must be.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.880
I wouldn't trust
it if it weren't.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.950
- We could talk about
ethics and the ethics

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.040
of putting the reader somewhere
that you haven't been.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.170
And that's not the gesture
that you're making.

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:45.170
So thank you so
much for this work.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.920
- Thank you, Evie.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.420
Thank you.

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:59.790
- Solmaz is open
to your questions.

01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:01.480
And there's a mic
here in the aisle

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:06.220
if you would like to go into
some of the territory I haven't

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:10.566
gone into, please come a forth.

01:02:10.566 --> 01:02:12.440
- Hi.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.230
You both mentioned the
problems of untranslatability,

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:19.710
and your issues with
working in English

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:23.400
with the cultural background,
and talking about issues

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.960
that relate to your identity.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.770
How do you negotiate not
putting in too many words that

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.020
aren't English?

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:36.110
Or when you do use those
words, what is the intention?

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:39.210
I find this to be a problem
when I'm trying to write,

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.920
because my first
language is Turkish.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.300
And to put in a lot of
words from a home language

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.160
often confuses an
alienates the reader.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.020
And that could be the intention.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.150
But sometimes, it
might be too much.

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:53.124
So how do you
negotiate that balance?

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.650
- OK, I'll start with a
pet peeve that I have.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.880
It's actually an inside
joke in my family.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.450
There's a movie called
The House of Sand and Fog

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:12.040
about an Iranian family.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.637
And the way it works
is the patriarch--

01:03:15.637 --> 01:03:16.720
I can't remember his name.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.600
But he'll say, he'll go
[SPEAKING FARSI] my boy.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.910
[SPEAKING FARSI] in
Farsi means "my boy."

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:26.500
So to our ears, we're
hearing, "my boy, my boy."

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.200
And so we get the Farsi word.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.570
But then, so we
are not alienating

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:32.820
this English-speaking
audience, we

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:38.020
get the immediate and one-to-one
translation of that word.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:43.080
That, I absolutely
refuse to do in my work.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.160
Because that's
basically, then, assuming

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.360
that no Farsi speaker
will ever hear the poem

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.610
and is absolutely
not the audience.

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:58.650
That said, I acknowledge
and I am writing in English.

01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:03.460
So my target audience will be
English speaking in some way.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.150
And I think of those moments
of untranslatability--

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:10.550
like, what I'll do
is I'll take a lyric.

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:12.260
And then one line
will be in Farsi.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.400
And then the next line of
the song might be in English.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:20.240
And so it kind of
carries, but it's not

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.660
necessarily a translation
of what preceded.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.204
And I think that's closer
also to how I talk.

01:04:27.204 --> 01:04:29.370
Like, I'll slide into Farsi,
and I'll say something.

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:30.800
And then I'll pick it
up again in English

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.030
and continue like that.

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:35.690
And so that helps
really keep the poem

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:42.410
as close to my own speech and
syntax of thought as possible.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:44.900
I think alienation
is fine, ultimately.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.330
I think, like, why not?

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.130
And I also like the idea of--

01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:59.550
to go back to agitating
a reader a little bit,

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:01.950
or irritating a
reader a little bit,

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:06.390
and perhaps making gestures
of closure in some places.

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:10.850
And carving out spaces of
cultural or linguistic privacy

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:15.870
in a poem, I think, is
incredibly moving and full

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.310
of potential.

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:22.114
It's not one that I have mined
extensively, but I admire it.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.500
- Hi.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.891
Evie, it's great to see
you and see both of you.

01:05:33.891 --> 01:05:35.640
I'm wondering if you
can talk a little bit

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.200
about what this means to be
kindred spirits for each other?

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.100
- Oh.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:45.480
I said that, so it's
not fair to ask Solmaz.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.290
For me, it just means
that I recognize in her

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:58.680
a similar desire to find
truth, speak about it, name it,

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:04.830
and to do so in a way that
communicates to readers,

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:07.530
and might move us beyond--

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.240
and we talked about this--

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.540
beyond feeling, towards action.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.150
- Absolutely.

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:17.430
And I want to go
back to something

01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:21.390
that you had said, which was
that the point of language

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:25.740
and then writing ultimately
is one of connection--

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.730
after what I just said
about irritating a reader--

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:36.180
but to have the ultimate goal
be one of that kind connection.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:39.897
But you're deciding
where you're connecting,

01:06:39.897 --> 01:06:41.730
and to whom you're
speaking, and what you're

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.146
doing with your
language, and what

01:06:43.146 --> 01:06:45.790
you refuse to do with your
own language, as well.

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.510
I find that that is
an area of kinship

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:51.026
and overlap for us, too, yeah.

01:06:51.026 --> 01:06:51.526
Thank you.

01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:52.026
- Thanks.

01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:00.990
- I want to thank you both
for this honest interview,

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:04.180
and for your very brave
work, and for agitating us

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.390
into more connection.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:08.760
My question was related to
the first one, which is,

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.140
do you write in Farsi ever?

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:15.660
And if you do, do you
come to different truths

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.610
or a different perspective?

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:18.170
- I don't.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:20.044
And I wish I could,
because I'm sure I would.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.170
Yeah.

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:27.220
And I think the knowing
that I'm missing

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:30.210
that is one of the
hardest losses, actually.

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:37.550
Hi.

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:40.250
- Thank you, both, firstly.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:44.310
And then I have a
two-part question.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.100
The first part is
in relationship

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.010
to when you were talking
about writing Look

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:55.550
and about, specifically,
how, in coming back to it

01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:58.550
and writing the title poem,
you thought about what

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:00.980
the argument of the book was.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:05.330
I'm sort of wondering how you
conceive of books as projects

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:08.120
and, specifically, how
that language of the book

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.870
as an argument-- or
I guess, ultimately

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:15.170
what the purpose of a book
is for you in your writing

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:16.290
process?

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.050
And then the other
part of the question

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:20.600
is in relationship to this.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.390
You have a really
wonderful essay

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.359
in The Volta called
"The Near Transitive

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:28.970
Properties of the Political
and the Poetical."

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.279
And in that essay,
you talk about eraser

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:37.510
and, specifically, how erasure--

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:42.229
it's, as of late, been more
predominant in American letters

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:43.910
and in poetry.

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:47.640
And you talk about how it
has this connection, though,

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.830
to military violence.

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:52.040
So I just would like to hear
more about that, specifically

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.350
how you came erasure
in your project

01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:55.670
and how you negotiated that.

01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:05.390
- So in terms of erasure, the
formal tactic of redacting

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.910
poems or any kind of found
text and then creating

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:16.220
a new poem out of it, it had
become fashionable in a way

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:20.870
that I found chilling because
of the word itself, "erasure"--

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:24.770
because of the action itself,
which is necessarily violent.

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:27.410
But it was being
done to texts that

01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:32.359
have no obvious relationship
to violence, particularly

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:34.640
state-sponsored violence.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.700
This was a tactic that was
proliferating alongside all

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.359
these Wikileaks
that were giving us

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:47.149
all these documents of
state-sponsored redaction.

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:48.830
It just seemed to
me that it would

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:52.880
be irresponsible
of me, as a writer,

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.920
to attempt erasure without
acknowledging its relationship

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.020
to actual erasure.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.580
And I think those
are the projects

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:04.160
of, quote unquote, "erasure"
that I'm most drawn to,

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.190
a book like Zong for
example, where you are using

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.920
the violence that
is being committed

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.960
against the language in the text
to diagnose and enact a greater

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.060
violence.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.770
And it's an actual
violence that is

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:21.510
done against bodies and people.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:26.630
So other than those
imagined Guantanamo erasures

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:29.540
and a few poems where
there's missing words,

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.437
it's not a tactic I really do.

01:10:31.437 --> 01:10:33.020
But even with the
Guantanamo erasures,

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.610
for example, I did not write
an entire poem and then black

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:39.890
it out.

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:44.850
Whatever is missing for the
reader is missing for me.

01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:50.040
It felt to me like it would
be some kind of trickery

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.450
or some kind of cleverness to
have a complete poem that I

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:58.092
can access and that is being
withheld from the reader.

01:10:58.092 --> 01:11:00.550
Now this is something that is
not acknowledged in the book.

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.250
I don't know that any
reader will necessarily

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:03.416
know that reading the poems.

01:11:03.416 --> 01:11:05.760
But it's the kind of
ethical consideration

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.980
that I find very important
in my own practice.

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:16.370
In terms of book,
that's harder to answer.

01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:19.810
I saw that the DOD has
its own dictionary.

01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:23.210
But I had to sit on it
for at least a year.

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:24.770
Because I kept
asking myself, what's

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:28.299
the one poem that I'm going to
write in response to this text?

01:11:28.299 --> 01:11:29.840
And it took me a
long time to realize

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.140
it wasn't a single poem,
it was a whole book.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:42.500
My own brain thinks in larger,
more symphonic constructions.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:46.340
It's very difficult
for me to narrow down

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.730
on one single thing.

01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:56.010
And so books, to me, and
having a book-length question

01:11:56.010 --> 01:12:00.210
that one can keep wrestling with
over, and over, and over just

01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:08.730
feels like the kind of thinking
that I want to be engaged in,

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:15.280
one that gives incredible
consideration and time to,

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.460
in my case, usually ethical
concerns and considerations--

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:26.470
but also, through that immediate
and short poetic burst.

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:28.660
So that tension of
the long, the huge

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:31.300
and the very small, and
particular, and specific

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.370
is one that I find
really exciting

01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:35.630
as a book-length thing.

01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:36.610
Does that answer?

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:37.734
Yeah.

01:12:37.734 --> 01:12:38.680
Thank you.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.650
- We will take the liberty
of asking the last question

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:47.630
as a segue from that
or a closure point.

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:50.120
Do you have a new
project that you're

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.396
working on that you're
willing to talk about?

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:57.700
No.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:58.352
- I do.

01:12:58.352 --> 01:12:59.805
No, I do.

01:12:59.805 --> 01:13:01.180
I'm trying to
figure out how to--

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.610
yes, I do.

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:05.290
The poems that I read tonight--

01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:08.230
the last two poems-- are
going into this new project.

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:14.710
And my obsession remains
with, how does power impact

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:18.070
and decide what we
say and how we say it?

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:20.630
But the gaze is a
little different.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:24.590
And I am following a
single voice, I think,

01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:29.200
this time and a
single alien in exile

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.830
that is critiquing the
metropole, so to speak.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:37.630
And the working title
is Customs right now.

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:40.730
So I'll just leave
it at that, yeah.

01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:42.460
- Well, I'm ready
for it whenever

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.930
you're done writing it.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:46.900
Would you all please
join me in thanks Solmaz

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.360
one more time for this
amazing [? evening. ?]

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.110
