Why Salt Preserves Meat

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.200
While today salting meat as a method of preservation
is generally only commonly used in such things

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.570
as salted pork and the like, salt has been
used as the primary method of preserving meats

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.710
and various other foods as far back as history
records.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.260
Salt has a preservative effect thanks to the
osmotic pressure it creates via absorption.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.790
For example, if you take a red blood cell
and place it in water, thanks to osmotic pressure

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.270
and the fact that the cell membrane is thin
and semipermeable, the cell with its relatively

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.340
salty interior next to the pure water will
gradually absorb more and more water until

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.750
it explodes.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.730
On the flipside, if you place that same red
blood cell into water that is saltier than

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.890
the cell’s interior liquid, the reverse
will happen and the cell will gradually lose

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.379
water, shriveling up in the process.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.179
Place it in water that has the same sodium
level as the cell, and nothing at all will

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.179
happen.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.879
This same effect will happen with most mold
and microbes.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.160
So if you use the salt for its absorption
effect to increase the osmotic pressure, these

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.630
things that may spoil the meat will have trouble
surviving and reproducing as their moisture

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.960
is sucked from them.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.010
The more salt added to the item (or sugar,
which has the same effect and is often used

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.870
to help get around the strong salt flavor),
the longer the preservative effect will last.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.320
You can also observe this absorption effect
simply by taking some cotton candy and placing

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.980
it in a humid environment.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.860
With just 33% relative humidity, cotton candy
left out in the air will completely collapse

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.870
and crystallize in just 3 days as it absorbs
the moisture in the air.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.270
At 45% relative humidity, it will completely
collapse in just one day.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200
At 75% humidity, it takes just 1 hour.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.600
This is why it has only been since 1972 that
non-”made on demand” cotton candy has

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600
been available.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.390
(1972 was when the first fully automated cotton
candy machine was invented that could make

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.500
the fluffy treat and quickly package it in
water tight containers).

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.180
If you’re wondering how to salt meat for
preservation, the process is fairly simple

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.840
and straightforward, though there are a variety
of variations on the basic method used to

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.080
improve flavor.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.340
In general, you simply rinse the fresh meat
in cold or lukewarm water, then pour a thin

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.289
layer of salt (generally kosher salt) all
over the meat and rub it in.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.140
Next, hang or set the meat out in a cool environment
(under 60 degrees Fahrenheit, but not below

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.939
freezing) for a couple weeks to dry it out
a bit.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.799
Finally, before cooking the meat, rinse off
the salt with water.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.170
In theory, if you use enough salt or sugar
when doing this, you can even preserve meat

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.560
for decades, though of course the amount you’d
have to use would probably make it unpalatable.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.989
At the minimum, if you’re only using salt
or sugar with no other preservative method

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.810
like smoking or the like, it’s generally
considered that about a 20% salt concentration

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.200
on the surface of the meat is needed to kill
off most types of microbes and fungi that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.050
can spoil food quickly.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.359
Bonus Facts:
• In the 18th century, salted beef or horse

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.280
meat (usually low quality) eaten on sailing
vessels as part of daily rations was called

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.829
“salt junk” or just “junk”, making
it technically the first food item called

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.249
“junk food”.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.250
Around a century later “junk” had spread
to refer to anything of low quality, though

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.299
it wouldn’t be until around the 1970s that
people would commonly start calling certain

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.060
food items low in nutritional value “junk
food”.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.779
• Pickling meat and other items usually
uses a salt/acidic method to achieve preservative

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:19.340
effects, often using some sort of vinegar
for the acidic element, which further creates

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.950
an environment that most microbes and fungi
have trouble surviving in.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.670
The most popular commercially available item
that still uses this technique is pickles.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.489
This is usually done by first soaking cucumbers
in a salt water brine (generally about 10%

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.609
salt) for a few days, then rinsing the cucumbers
off with purified water.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:53.479
Next, placing the cucumbers in vinegar and
sealing them in airtight jars.
