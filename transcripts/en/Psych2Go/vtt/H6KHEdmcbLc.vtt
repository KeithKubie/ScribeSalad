00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.219
It is one of the most common, yet
also, one of the most perplexing

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.809
sleep disorders that exists.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.240
Insomnia. At any given time, it can
affect around ten percent of the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.480
world’s population, causing
countless hours of lost sleep and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.519
wakeful anguish. But, why does it
happen, and how does one overcome

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.609
it? Stay tuned to find out.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.070
Naturally, we fall asleep at night.
It is how the human body reacts to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.210
exhaustion, and it is a part of the
innate biological rhythm which our

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.050
species has maintained for
thousands of years.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.830
Yet, more than 30 million Americans
suffer from at least a mild form of

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.489
insomnia, that causes them to have
difficulty falling asleep when they

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.430
want to, and which subsequently
leads to the suffering of fatigue

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.369
and drowsiness during the daytime.

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:55.440
And during their nights, sufferers
of insomnia experience a whole

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.420
other set of troubles and pains,
which add to their woes.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.150
What time is it right now?

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.000
Quite often, during the late hours
of the night, an insomniac’s mind

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.859
will race with activity.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:20.020
Tomorrow’s gonna be a big day.
Better get some sleep.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.509
Why do I feel like I’m forgetting
something?

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.581
Ugh. It’s too quiet in here. I can
hear myself breath.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.850
And, inconveniently enough, many of
their thoughts will be the ones

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.450
that induce the most anxiety,
depression, and stress; making it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.569
quite a challenge for the
individual to find any relaxation

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.259
right before bed.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.600
This is ridiculous.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.429
There may be a variety of different
reasons which cause these thoughts

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.679
to become so prominent at night,
but once they begin, they become

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.659
very difficult for insomniacs to
suppress.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.079
And, to make matters worse, some
sufferers will also experience

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.369
irritability, discomfort, or even
pain, after lying awake in bed for

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.990
a while.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.039
Many who experience persistent
insomnia crave for regular sleep

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.649
schedules, and the capacity to fall
asleep comfortably and to wake up

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.970
refreshed, but falling into such
routines without relying on the use

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.550
of sleeping pills or other types of
drugs can be a tenacious problem

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.730
that each individual must often
find their own unique solution to.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.330
For instance, distractions such as
television...

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.280
... books, or computers, could
potentially stimulate the mind and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.900
keep an individual awake for much
longer than they desire, or

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.650
conversely, they could actually
distract the mind for just long

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.980
enough from all the thoughts that
are keeping the individual awake.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.460
It really depends on the person.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.110
The key is to figure out what works
for you, and the best way to do

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.050
that is to experiment. If you
suffer from insomnia, finding out

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.530
what triggers your brain to send
the signals to the rest of your

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.680
body to nod off is the key to
overcoming this disorder.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.760
For some, getting out of bed to do
something relaxing, such as

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.360
drinking a warm beverage or reading
a book, can be more helpful than

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.750
simply lying awake in bed.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.130
For others, listening to music or
watching a familiar TV show can do

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.880
the trick.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.260
It also helps to be mindful of what
environmental conditions are

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.580
preferable and conducive to you
falling asleep, such as the amount

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.030
of light in the room, how noisy it
is during sleep hours, and the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.980
room’s temperature.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.900
And, it really helps to move all
clocks out of plain view, as this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.430
effectively alleviates the anxiety
associated with watching the night

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.400
hours tick away.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.100
The activities that you engage in
before bedtime can also have an

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.520
effect on how quickly you might be
able to fall asleep at night. Some

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.990
general things to avoid are heavy
late-night meals, vigorous

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.000
exercise, and work-related tasks
that might cause stress.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.850
Suffice it to say, big discussions
or arguments should also be avoided

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.460
right before bed, and all of these
stressful activities should be

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.730
replaced by more soothing ones, in
low lighting conditions if viable.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.160
This will generally prime the mind
and the body for sleep long before

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.240
it is time to actually fall asleep.
As for screens such as televisions,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.470
smart phones, and tablets...

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.500
Research has shown that the light
emitted from these screens tends to

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.830
suppress the body’s production of
melatonin, and that can severely

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.680
disrupt sleep patterns, but if you
find that watching something helps,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.330
then it might be a good idea to
stick to what works, and perhaps,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.120
just set things so that these
screens are turned off afterwards.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.060
And, that concludes part 2 of our
12 part series on disturbing sleep

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.699
disorders. Insomnia is a widespread
condition with different solutions

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.009
for different people, so to
continue the conversation, please

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.759
feel free to comment below with
your own experiences on it, and

Until next time, good night and

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:50.509
sleep tight.
