00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.070
Sleeping is the besstttttt.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.340
Waking up is the WOOORRRRSTTTT.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.000
JUST FIVE MORE MINUTESSSSS, Mom.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.769
Which never helps, does it?

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:21.960
I had a roommate in college who's alarm went
off at 7:15 for his 8am class.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.290
The radio, as loud as the volume would go.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.930
He didn't even flinch (or wake up), but I
almost hit the ceiling it scared me so much.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.510
We've done a lot of videos on sleep we even
have a sleep playlist but WAKING UP…

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.489
Some days, I just DON'T WANNA GET UP.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.900
Social jetlag, or the idea we HAVE to wake
up before our natural rhythms WANT us to wake

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.480
up affects 70 percent of the population according
to a study in Current Biology.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.320
And difficulty waking up is called sleep inertia.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.060
A 2013 study in PlosOne describes it as, "a
temporary period of reduced alertness and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.190
impaired performance."

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.660
Scientific symptoms of sleep inertia are poor
memory and reaction time, inability to perform

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.100
basic math and the suffering of alertness
or attention.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.619
These symptoms can persist for an hour, and
usually occurs when you wake up during slow-wave

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.619
sleep.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.880
Sleep comes in order across four stages: Stage
One is the transition from wakefulness to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.880
a light sleep.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.969
During this 5 to 10 minute stage, the electrical
signals pulsing through your brain form theta

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:19.969
waves.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.200
The next 20 minutes is Stage Two; the brain
produces rapid bursts of activity called sleep

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.499
spindles, and then the heart rate slows and
body temperature dips.

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:31.520
Stage Three is slow wave sleep or delta sleep.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.599
This lasts about an hour, and brain activity
comes in the form of delta waves.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.799
People here normally aren't responsive when
you call their name; and abnormal behaviors

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.530
like bedwetting or sleepwalking are part of
the end of this Stage.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.179
Stage Four is the famous REM sleep, when dreams
happen!

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.969
When you fall asleep you go through stage
one, and then back to Two.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.779
Then Two, Three, Four… back to Two.

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.130
You'll do this four or five times.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.659
If your alarm goes off when you're in stage
three, the deepest of sleep, then you'll be

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.659
jolted awake.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.139
And you'll get the worst of sleep inertia!

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:09.489
This is usually when people describe feeling
like they were "hit by a truck."

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.049
The hormones surging through your body keeping
you in deep sleep are still floating around,

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.150
affecting your now AWAKE body.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.860
Sleep inertia is still being studied, it was
only named in the late 70s, so, say it with

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.430
me now, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED!

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.879
But what we DO know, is the best medicine
is to get out of bed and turn on the lights,

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.280
because the retina is DIRECTLY tied to the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.359
The SCN controls our sleep-wake cycle and
the release of melatonin, which is a hormone

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.030
that triggers the sleeping part of that cycle.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.769
Your phone doesn't count though.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.170
It's true that at night the blue light from
phone and tablet screens mess with the SCN's

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.079
regulation of the sleep/wake cycle.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.870
(So don't use them before sleep), but a study
in PlosOne found that increasing blue light

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.280
doesn't increase brain alertness during sleep
inertia, so grabbing your phone first thing

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280
won't save you.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.150
Also, the snooze button is NOT your friend.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.220
If you're jolted from slow-wave sleep and
allow your brain to drop into sleep again,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.480
you'll start the whole cycle over; causing
you to feel even WORSE.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.650
And don't set alarms every half-hour either,
you're not gradually waking yourself up, you're

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.459
interrupting and restarting your sleep over
and over.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.430
I'm guilty of this, and so are many of you;
but it's the worst.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.549
Like EVERYTHING, having a healthy sleep/wake
cycle requires effort -- like running a race,

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.510
we have to train to be good at it.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.700
Waking up is no different.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.379
Set one alarm and make yourself wake up when
it goes off.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.659
Take down the blackout curtains so you get
some daylight and your retinas will tell your

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.239
SCN it's wakeup time.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.040
Wake up on the weekend too, so you don't throw
off your sleep schedule!

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.079
A morning routine is the best; and everyone
is different, but luckily, wakefulness is

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.200
easy to train.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200
But only you can do it.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.779
I used to be a night owl, but having to be
up to make DNews for you every morning completely

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:02.810
changed me.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.150
And… you know what?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:13.290
I kind of love it.
