[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.090
JENNY DEARBORN: So just
a little bit of context.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.480
For a long time, obviously,
we were subsistence farmers,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.630
and then we've had several
industrial revolutions

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.130
over time.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.500
We are now on the precipice
of the fourth Industrial

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.180
Revolution.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.910
Pretty significant
impact on our workforce,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.280
our global workforce.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.720
What has been
consistent for each

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.690
of these industrial
revolutions for success

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.550
is human ingenuity,
human creativity,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.650
and for us to create
opportunities.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.930
And I am firmly a believer
and an optimistic for growth

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.620
mindset.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.180
That we will always find
enough work for people to do.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.690
It is our responsibility, coming
from the center of the universe

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.560
here, Silicon Valley,
that is our responsibility

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.450
to sort of lead that transition
for certainly the United

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.620
States, the global workforce,
into that new state where

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.170
work is very, very different.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.430
One of the ways works is very
different is sort of grounded

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.860
in an internet of things, right?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.270
The cyber physical system.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.090
The coming together
of these two worlds.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.820
Certainly I don't need
to tell you about this.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.140
But this puts us in
technology in a good place

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380
because we understand this,
we understand the impact

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.000
that this has on
jobs, and how IoT

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.780
is displacing a
lot of traditional,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.500
sort of blue collar, high
school education type of jobs.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.200
And that is creating a
pretty significant divide

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.260
and is really an
opportunity for us

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.500
to sort of step up, and
help bridge this gap,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.550
and bring more people along.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.120
Just a quick case study of tech.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.760
So in this 25 year period,
we saw a real shift

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.950
in how sort of major
economic forces

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.820
happen in the United
States and in the world.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.200
It's fantastic for
shareholders, but there's

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.530
a pretty significant
impact on workers.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.390
So in this 25 years, about
the same amount of revenue

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.120
and about 10x less
number of employees.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.880
So a really different
type of work

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.280
and a really different
type of worker.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.034
So if you have an iPhone, you
can turn it over and it says--

00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:54.950
remember what it says?

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.204
Manufactured,
designed in Couperin,

00:02:57.204 --> 00:02:59.120
manufactured in China,
or something like that.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.310
Or designed in California,
manufactured in China.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.860
So it's a great example of
these two different economies.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.220
Manufacturing economy
and the creative economy.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.580
And the creative economy,
there's a lot more spoils.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.740
There's a lot more
wealth that's generated,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.560
but for a much fewer
number of people

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.650
and a really different
type of person.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.770
And maybe that was OK for a
while when tech was smaller,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.820
but as IoT gets into
everything that we do,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.120
every device, every Roomba,
everything in the world

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.390
is going to have some
IoT system in it, that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.280
cyber physical
system, there's going

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.240
to be this incredible demand
for engineering skills

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.220
and just not enough people
to meet that demand.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.800
So this model won't
hold moving forward.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.210
We won't be able to generate
this amount of revenue

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.720
and this amount of
market capitalization

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.210
with as few number of
people moving forward.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.720
We'll need to expand this
number, this 137,000 employees.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.760
Just for comparison, this
is, these two numbers,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.519
1.2 million employees
and 37 million employees,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.790
that is the entire
production supply chain.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.810
So that's everybody
who's making a spark plug

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.840
and making tires
and assembling them.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.230
Everything to the point of sale.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.720
So this causes a
challenge for us.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.060
We already know-- this
is not new information--

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.050
that 1% of the global population
controls 50% of global wealth

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.190
and 50% of the global
population has 1% of the wealth.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.060
That's not new
information at all.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.650
We know that rising
inequality, wealth disparity

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.010
is a significant problem.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.600
But it affects all of
us because societies

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.720
that have the greatest
wealth disparity

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.850
also have the
greatest instability.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.730
You can see here more violence,
more people in prison,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.140
more obesity, lower
life expectancy,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.750
lower trust in government
systems and institutions,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.980
things like that.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.590
Inequality is rising
in all countries, even

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.750
those that have
experienced rapid growth

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.610
and a drop in the
overall percentage

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.990
of people living in poverty.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.780
So this is something--

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.210
again, the mission of your
tech company, my tech company

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.560
is make the world a better place
and improve people's lives.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.060
We're in tech because
we have the power

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.610
to make the world a better
place, and we're super excited.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.940
We're going to use our passion
and our energy to help society.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.870
And so I feel a
tremendous responsibility,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.900
a personal responsibility
to do what we can.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.440
To really further that mission.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.060
And I feel like I can do that
in my role as the head of talent

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.730
and learning at SAP, which
is a major tech company.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.560
As we're looking at
projecting out the talent

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.220
needs for the future, the
next five, seven years,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.885
I know how many
engineers I'm going

00:06:19.885 --> 00:06:21.790
to need in which
countries, and I

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.010
know how many engineers
are coming online,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.080
and there's not enough.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.420
And I know the
staffing needs for most

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.050
of the other companies in the
world, major sort of players,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.350
and there's not enough people.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.550
So there's a tremendous
concern that we need to do more

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.670
to sort of help fill that gap.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.540
We know that there's a lot of
very exciting technology coming

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.330
online and great opportunities
with that technology.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.000
But there's also a
lot of disruption.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.180
Again, I'm very optimistic that
we can work our way through it,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:07.060
but I feel like we need to
do more to smooth that out

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.660
as we look at the impact
that technology has.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.000
So driver is the highest
self-identified job

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.980
in the United States.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.480
So this includes not just 18
wheeler drivers, long haul

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.460
trucks, this includes taxi
drivers, Ubers, school bus

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.340
drivers, city transit
drivers, private limousines.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.970
So driver is the highest
self-identified job.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:42.160
And there's an opportunity
here as this technology

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.730
comes online to think
about retraining

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.360
and to think about what is
the education that is best

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.595
for these types of workers.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.720
And one of the things that
I think about in my role

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.420
is, what is that cutoff point?

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.370
What is the tipping
point when you

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.530
can take talent and transition
them to something new?

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.090
And when is the
point where you say,

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.240
this particular type
of talent is best

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.582
to learn not programming skills,
but entrepreneurial skills?

00:08:10.582 --> 00:08:12.790
Because they're going to
need to do a little bit more

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.730
pulling themselves up and
figuring something out

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.100
because we as a
society may not be

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.990
able to create
enough jobs for them.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.150
So how can we help
these different folks?

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.770
A quick story.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.260
My mother, when I
was a little kid--

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.140
I grew up in the '70s
in Sacramento Valley.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.230
And she was a bookkeeper
at a local travel agency.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.240
And the local travel
agency was in the mall.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.620
Davis Time for Travel.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.669
And all the moms worked there
and that was back in the day.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.060
If anybody can remember, we
had to make an appointment

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.540
to get a paper ticket to go
from San Francisco to Frankfurt,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.990
and that was what
travel agents did.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.460
So certainly a huge change
in the travel industry.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.620
Companies like Expedia,
and Travelocity,

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.120
and Priceline, and
things like that.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.260
So the travel industry
saw a huge increase,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.560
but travel agents, we
saw a huge decline.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.830
About a 40% decline
from the peak in 2000

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.080
to today of that type of job.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.740
So people who were
travel agents,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.440
those jobs were all
over the United States

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.580
in every little
mall here and there.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.000
And they were great
middle class jobs.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.040
High school education jobs.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.830
And now the industry
is doing great,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.480
but a really
different type of job

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.550
in a really different location.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.360
So no longer spread out all
over the country equally.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.670
Sort of concentrated
in tech hubs

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.350
in different types of companies.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.240
So my mom did fine.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.420
She was a bookkeeper
and she just

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.710
went and became a bookkeeper
at another little business

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.390
in town.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.160
But not everybody sort
of has that resilience

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.700
depending on the type of
skills that they have.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.740
And what is our responsibility
to sort of think about and plan

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:09.510
for the job changes that are
happening across the country?

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.232
So this study was, it's a
2013 Oxford University study

00:10:14.232 --> 00:10:15.690
and it was praised
when it came out

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.600
for being both incredibly
visionary and very criticized

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.660
as alarmist.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.880
So it's probably
something in between

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.410
as we look at the different
jobs that are likely to go away.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.980
And we see the same pattern
for every sort of wave

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.270
of Industrial Revolution.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.600
The jobs that are most
likely to be eliminated

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:44.580
are the ones that are the
highest in physical skills

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.510
and the lowest in cognition.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:54.780
So there's also other
research that 83%

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.310
of people who are earning $20
an hour or less, their jobs

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.320
are likely to be
eliminated in the next five

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.260
years due to automation.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.770
The jobs that are least
likely to be eliminated

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.120
or the most safe are
the ones that have

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.930
a high amount of human skills.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.900
What is uniquely human?

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.070
What can't be automated?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.870
What can't be outsourced?

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.360
What can't go online?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.780
And things that have a high
amount of human manipulation,

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.980
creativity, social
perception, things like that.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.780
We'll see a very
significant increase

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.090
in psychologists,
human resources, people

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.100
that are helping others
cope with change.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.160
Do you have a thought?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.820
JENNY DEARBORN: There you go.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.860
Job security.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:47.580
So you could probably tell
just by reading the news

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.020
that we are at the lowest levels
of unemployment in a while,

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.210
but the highest
levels of anxiety.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.210
So we can sense that.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:02.655
People are doing well, but
maybe underemployed and nervous.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:13.230
So our economy-- and if we look
across a host of industries--

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.570
is really badly
in need of workers

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.800
skilled in computer science.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.320
There are half a million
jobs going unfilled now,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.990
and in a few years it's
estimated that nearly a third

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.410
of all computer science related
jobs will be left unfilled.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:33.000
We graduate in the United States
about 43,000 computer science

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.490
graduates a year.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:40.200
And a tenth of all
new jobs are ones

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.500
that haven't yet been created.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.980
So we're looking for
people for occupations that

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.560
haven't yet even been designed.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.830
So another study that if you
started a four year computer

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.665
science degree today,
by the time you graduate

00:12:58.665 --> 00:13:00.960
in four years from now
your freshmen content

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.010
is no longer valid.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.010
So incredible rate of change.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.980
And really, the best thing
that we can do for people

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.550
is help them focus on
fundamental human skills.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.590
Resilience, creativity,
innovation, social perception,

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.590
cross-cultural awareness.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.340
You know, these are really
what is significantly human

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:29.760
and can't be at risk of
automation and outsourcing.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.030
So some other stats
that should worry us.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.840
We're not in good
shape globally.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.080
These are the 34
market economies

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.050
that make up the Organization
for Economic Cooperation

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.550
and Development.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.930
And you can see that,
for example, Japan always

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.810
comes out in the
worst spot in this

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:57.410
because they're a significantly
high aging population.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.590
And also the increased
life expectancy

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.590
is making it a challenge
in a lot of countries.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:10.830
As we try to transition
to something that is new,

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.300
people are less
comfortable as they

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.800
get older transitioning
to something

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.540
that is really, really new.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.190
If you're born today
in North America,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.477
there's a 50% chance
of living to 105.

00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:21.060
If you're born today
in Japan, there's

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.550
a 50% chance of living to 110.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.770
So how do we think
about preparing

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.410
the future workforce when
our careers will be 50,

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.871
60 years long?

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.370
And, you know, what
is the education

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.550
that you need to give you
that foundation of resilience

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.360
and fundamental human skills
to be prepared for a very, very

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.510
long duration of change.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:50.840
So this is 16 to 65 year
olds, but what about our kids?

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.650
Fundamentally, I'm an educator.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.940
So given what we know about
the future of technology

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.630
and how essential computer
skills are to our economy,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.100
it seems pretty logical that
understanding the algorithms

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.230
and applications
on the internet is

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.650
going to be essential
for our kids'

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:14.540
health, their economic
abilities to sustain themselves

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.550
in the workforce.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.440
And it's probably,
moving forward,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.340
just as important as
understanding photosynthesis,

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.150
and the digestive system,
and, you know, electricity.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.410
So we need to really engage
with our school systems

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.317
to understand how we can create
the workforce of the future.

00:15:34.317 --> 00:15:35.900
Similarly, what I
talked about before,

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.990
that there's sort of this
threshold of when you can teach

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.060
people things that are
brand new and then when

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.490
it's time for them to learn
entrepreneurial skills

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.340
to create something
new on their own.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.830
Because of the talent needs
that are coming online

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.700
across all these countries
and all of our companies,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.230
we can see a very significant
demand for certain skills

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.270
and not enough
graduates coming online

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.880
across all of our countries
that can meet that demand.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.890
So we have to dig deep
across all of our companies

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.170
and dig into the K
through 12 system

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.540
to make sure that it's preparing
the workforce of the future 10,

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.650
20, 30 years out.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.776
So what's a super bummer--

00:16:19.776 --> 00:16:21.400
now we're going to
get into this stuff.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.260
It's all just a huge bummer.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.320
So 90% of parents want their
kids to learn computer science,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.710
but only 40% of schools
across the country teach it.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.410
And what's awesome is that
kids that take computer science

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.996
really enjoy it.

00:16:40.996 --> 00:16:43.120
Schools that have computer
science and engineering,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.880
the kids are excited about that.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.810
So parents want them to learn
it, kids want to learn it.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.280
Tech companies,
all companies are

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.042
desperate for these
graduates to have it.

00:16:55.042 --> 00:16:56.500
We don't have enough
graduates now,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.875
but I'm not thinking
about today.

00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:59.936
I'm thinking about
10, 20 years out.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.810
So that's why I'm focusing
on this population

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.780
to get them ready.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:10.910
And we see a very significant
disconnect in the coming years.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.220
This is not new information.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.810
Everybody knows that a lifetime
earning of a college graduate

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.930
is significantly higher
than a high school graduate.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:25.990
20x is your lifetime earnings
as a college graduate.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.670
But also as a computer
science graduate,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:35.830
it's 40% higher than the average
of all other degrees combined.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.290
And so computing jobs
are the number one source

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.790
of wage growth in the United
States in every industry,

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.440
in every state, and
they're projected

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.180
to grow at twice the rate
of all other jobs combined.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.450
Again, there's only 43,000
computer science grads

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.800
that come online a year
in the United States.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.690
So states that invest in
computer science education

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.480
really reap the economic
benefit as well.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.700
It's not just at a personal
level, it's at a state level.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.260
So there's only 10 states, and
California isn't one of them,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.700
that have K through 12 computer
science education standards.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.390
In 2017, those 10 states
were 9% more likely

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.780
than states without K through
12 computer science standards

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.150
to see unemployment fall.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.680
So this was original--

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.580
so in the US, I think we all
sort of know this intuitively,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.300
that governments and
corporations change

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.440
at a really different rate.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.890
So this chart shows the
rate of change of technology

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.620
is the blue run here, and
then the rate of change

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.650
of public policy in
alignment to that.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.190
So what I am really
challenged to do

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.440
and would love to put out
the challenge to others too,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.320
is to see what we can do
to sort of close this gap.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.990
This change gap.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.890
Can we look at other sources
of computer science education

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:08.170
to get more people
engaged in this solution?

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.340
I am also a firm
believer that perhaps we

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.340
can do more in
our HR departments

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:21.160
and our hiring to meet
people halfway or meet people

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.210
a little closer
to where they are.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:31.210
This is just a quick snapshot
of Silicon Valley's community

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.240
college system.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.720
So some basic facts about the
California community colleges.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.380
2.1 million students are
enrolled in California

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.610
community colleges.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.340
They are the nation's
largest institution

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.830
of higher education.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.650
114 schools.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:57.820
They are, across California,
67% ethnically diverse

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.730
and 53% female.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:07.840
30% of all 16 to 24 year olds
in the state of California

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.000
are enrolled in a California
community college.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.580
30% of every kid 16 to 24.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.700
So that's across the state.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.050
But here in Silicon
Valley, we have

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:30.280
17 colleges, 263,000 students,
and 70,000 of them are in STEM.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.360
They are 71% diverse
here in Silicon Valley.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.790
But what's super
cool, I think, is

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:43.330
that 30% of the
grads from all UCs

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.910
are California community
college transfers.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:51.280
And 51% of the grads of all
CSUs are California Community

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.440
College transfers.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.380
48% of all STEM graduates
from all UC schools,

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.380
UCLA, UC Berkeley, are
California community college

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.460
transfers.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.720
Almost 50% of every
engineer that graduates

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.810
started in a California
community college school.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:16.030
So as we look to broadening
our pool of people

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.170
that we're recruiting from
and helping more people sort

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.620
of move forward, I'd
like to challenge us

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.510
all in tech to think about
where we're recruiting from

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.780
and who we're looking
for as we pull people

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.990
into the workforce
of the future.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:40.610
So there are a ton of benefits
to California community college

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.490
school kids.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.930
I should also say that it's
really tough to transfer.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.140
Only 4% of the kids
that are enrolled.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.290
So 4% of the 2.1 million
students transfer

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.150
to a four year school.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.140
It's really hard.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.800
And so you get somebody
who's been through the system

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.420
and come out, then you know
that person is pretty resilient,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.379
and smart, and determined.

00:22:10.379 --> 00:22:12.170
And so those are also
great characteristics

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.910
to be looking for as we look
to the future of the talent.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.490
And let me also
tell you a reason

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:24.890
why I am super bullish
about this system

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.040
is I'm a product of it.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.310
So I have a confession to make.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.520
This is why I'm super
motivated about this.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.390
So I kind of, like, barely
graduated high school,

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.291
and went to the local
community college.

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:40.790
I grew up in
Sacramento Valley, so I

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.040
went to American River
College in Sacramento.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.990
And it was there
that I was diagnosed

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.890
as dyslexic, and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder,

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.790
and obsessive
compulsive disorder,

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.890
which my high school
didn't recognize.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.772
They just thought I
couldn't sit still.

00:22:54.772 --> 00:22:56.480
Everyday I got wiggly
and they would just

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.130
send me out to run the track.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.460
And so I was super athlete but
I really didn't learn a lot.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.707
And so they figured this
out at the community college

00:23:04.707 --> 00:23:06.540
and they gave me the
resources that we need.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.110
So I went from sort of
D's to A's, transferred

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.270
to UC Berkeley on an
academic scholarship,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.390
and then a master's at Stanford
on an academic scholarship.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.800
So what does this have to do
with the internet of things

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.440
and the automation of jobs
in the future of workforce?

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.820
It's really about opening our
eyes to an alternative path

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.220
and opening our
minds to what needs

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.710
to happen if we're going
to have a strong economy

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.780
and a just society.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.780
If we're trying to
make a difference

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:40.740
about wealth disparity
and a stable society,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.260
it's about inclusion.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.180
It's including all
sorts of people

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.750
from all kinds of
backgrounds in that future

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.060
because there's going to
be a lot of disruption

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:56.060
of a certain type of person and
we could do a lot more in tech

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.340
to include those people.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:03.690
I heard the term tech lash
for the first time in--

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.420
I read, I was
reading The Economist

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.750
maybe three weeks ago.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.640
And it said there's a tech lash
coming against Silicon Valley

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.930
by Washington.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.400
And I heard that
for the first time

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.620
and I was physically shaking.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.380
So I think we could do more.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.469
I mean, I'm a Silicon
Valley person.

00:24:20.469 --> 00:24:22.010
I said, you know,
Berkeley, Stanford.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.420
I'm, like, here.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.470
This is my world.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.700
And we could do
more to help people

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.580
in other parts of the
country to participate

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.760
in the future of work, because
we're going to need everybody.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.910
So you guys are doing a
tremendous amount already.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.867
So I'm not here to preach
to you and tell you

00:24:42.867 --> 00:24:44.450
that you should do
something different

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:50.300
because you are absolutely a
role model in reaching out.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.590
You have a tremendous
volunteer culture.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.360
I was doing some
research about you

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.920
and you have this
great partnership

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.420
with Goodwill,
which I did not know

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.200
is the largest
workforce development

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.330
nonprofit in the country.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.560
And you've pledged $10 million
dollars and 1,000 Google

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.110
volunteers to
create opportunities

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.220
for 1.2 million youth, formerly
incarcerated and displaced

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.270
workers, and veterans to
give them digital skills

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:25.700
to participate in the future of
work at the 156 Goodwill stores

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.520
across the country.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.040
So that's fantastic.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.720
That's fantastic.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.330
So certainly applaud
these efforts.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.730
But there's so many more things
that we as a tech community

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.552
and we who are
all sitting pretty

00:25:39.552 --> 00:25:41.510
with our great degrees,
and our wonderful jobs,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.670
and our great future,
there's a lot more that we

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:48.500
can do to bring a more
inclusive view into the talent

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.220
that we need.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.000
So it's really about being open
minded to all kinds of talent

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.010
and all kinds of backgrounds.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.339
Look for those
scrappy people that

00:25:57.339 --> 00:25:59.630
had to pull themselves up
and do something the hard way

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.360
because maybe they've got some
cool skills that we could all

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.950
benefit from.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.730
Encourage students of all ages.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.220
It's never too late
to learn something new

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.330
and to dig deep and try
and do something different.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.950
And then my strongest
call to action

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.530
is really around lobbying
for K-12 computer science

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.810
education.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.050
And even if you
don't have kids, this

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:29.960
is about doing what's right for
the community and the future

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.160
of work because we all want
to live in a just society

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.920
and in a place that sort of
closes that wealth divide

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:44.850
so that we can have a
safer and more harmonious

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.360
environment to live in.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.760
So there are interesting
things that can be done.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.700
It's not just around
volunteering at a school.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.610
But people who are
working in schools,

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.359
they know that they have
a significant challenge.

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:05.400
It's not just going to a
school and saying, well,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.060
why don't you just put through
computer science standards?

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.370
They know that they should.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.760
Why don't you just hire
computer science teachers?

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.200
They know that they should.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.760
They cannot recruit computer
science teachers at the rate

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.830
at which school
districts can pay.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.660
If you have those
skills, you're going

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.840
to go to a place like, you
know, your company, or mine,

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.830
or a lot of others.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:31.890
So what can we do to
sponsor a teacher?

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.230
Pay for a teaching role?

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.570
You know, maybe five
engineers get together

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.840
and they all work a four ten
schedule and everybody rotates

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.200
and actually teaches a class.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.880
There are things that we can do.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.140
You can adopt a school.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.830
You can adopt, you know, just
like a chaired professorship

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:54.510
at a university, you know,
sponsor the computer science

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.040
department at a school.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.000
Things like that.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.230
So there's a lot that can
be done to get creative.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:06.780
I've been talking with different
people at the national level

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.600
around creating social
sabbatical programs

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.770
for employees, tech
employees, to go and volunteer

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:18.150
for three months in a
government organization.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:24.690
There's more that we can do
to make our presence felt.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:30.820
And this is not just good for
schools, it's good for us.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:36.900
So this is a quote from a Google
employee about how this really

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.860
changed his life.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.240
So I found this quote
on the code.org site.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.050
So I was super excited to
see a colleague of yours who

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:49.110
was making such a great impact.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:54.530
And I want to leave you
with some links of things

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.380
that you can go and check
out about ways to help.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.340
So thoughts, questions,
feedback, ideas, reactions,

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.050
anything?

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.070
HR people?

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.400
Marketing people?

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.430
Yes, please.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.280
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
elementary school education

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.990
and then the community
college scene,

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.410
but I also keep hearing
that applying to schools

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.200
is getting so
challenging and kids have

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.670
a lot of anxiety around it.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.100
So is it also that
we have to increase

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.260
the number of four
year programs,

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.446
or is it really
earlier than that?

00:29:30.446 --> 00:29:32.070
JENNY DEARBORN: It's
earlier than that.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:37.440
I mean, there is stress and
anxiety in all these levels,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.860
and a lot that we
could do to make people

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.950
feel that a lot of different
paths are worthy, right?

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.370
I mean, I have four kids, so
what I keep telling, you know,

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.980
when I go talk to
schools, there's

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.560
a lot of second chances
in this country.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.630
You're going to
have a long career.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.160
You're going to
work for 50 years.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.730
There is nobody saying
in their right mind

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.730
that you have to do
XYZ in four years.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.510
Explore, take risks,
learn new things.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.440
Go to culinary school.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.148
Change your mind.

00:30:11.148 --> 00:30:12.210
Do this for 10 years.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.146
Go get another degree.

00:30:13.146 --> 00:30:14.520
Do something else
for five years.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.930
Get a different degree.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.920
Stack a bunch of
micro credentials.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.840
There's lots of different ways
to get to a really satisfying,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.160
joyful life.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.750
There's not one path.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:29.160
So it kind of goes
back to your point.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.860
I'm trying to encourage
HR peers to back off

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.040
a little bit from it
must be this university,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.570
it must be this degree.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.290
Because I think there's
enough research and data now

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.950
that says there's not
a direct correlation

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.940
between this university and this
degree with high productivity

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.417
and high success.

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:54.250
You can get there in
lots of different ways.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.660
And sometimes the
circuitous path

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.950
is what creates a really
interesting colleague

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.110
and a really
innovative perspective.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:10.110
So my advice and
encouragement to schools

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.770
is to back off on the
stress and encourage

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.050
concepts of lifelong
learning and joy

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:20.940
and internal motivation for
a long journey of learning

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.080
and discovery.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.130
Because if we don't
have that from within,

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.240
we're going to be stuck.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.090
You know, we maybe have a great
degree that last for 20 years,

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.340
but what about the next 30
that you are still working?

00:31:37.071 --> 00:31:39.320
AUDIENCE: You touched on it
a little bit as you talked

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.420
about the statistics
around community

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.190
colleges in California,
but I'm wondering

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.100
if you have any research or
thoughts on as we're working

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.080
to kind of reskill or skill
the future in computer science

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.810
and tech, what about
the intersectionality

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.810
of making sure that there's
still that diverse workforce

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.430
coming up with that?

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.800
I know that's a hot
topic right now.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.340
You know, do you have a
diverse workforce in tech?

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.210
And we're seeing that
there's gaps in gender

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.400
or different ethnic groups.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.540
So have you done any
research into how

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.920
you can skill the future
for these needed gaps,

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.490
but also ensure that
you're bringing up

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.615
a more representative
sample of workers as well?

00:32:21.615 --> 00:32:22.490
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.190
Well, I mean, that's why I
talked about the diversity

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.070
in the California
community college system.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:33.260
You know, it's 53%
female and 71% non-white.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:39.050
So these are great opportunities
to find diverse talent,

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.650
and that's incredibly important.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.220
I mean, as we think about
the role of technology

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.150
in our lives moving forward,
when you sort of project out,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.220
you know, internet of
things and how technology

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.160
is in everything, do
you want the people who

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.110
are making technology
decisions to have

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.320
a really consistent sort
of frame of reference

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.550
or do you want--

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.850
I want the people who are making
technology decisions to have

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.290
a very broad background.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.310
The often quoted
example I didn't make up

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.350
was about self-driving cars.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:16.670
That if a self-driving car
has an unavoidable collision

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.400
and there's a driver in the
car and the self-driving car

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.110
notices that there's four
pedestrians on the sidewalk

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.320
or whatever and a collision
is absolutely unavoidable,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.140
does the car make
the decision to save

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.250
the driver who
bought the car, one,

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.050
or save the pedestrians, four?

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.910
What is the right
decision for society?

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.280
What's the right decision
for the person who said,

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.870
well, I bought the car.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.020
You choose me.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.150
That's my car.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:44.900
Or I don't know.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.370
I mean, you know, so that's an
often quoted example of, well,

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.510
who's making that decision?

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.020
The car.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.170
OK, well, who
programmed the car?

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.750
Who hired that
programmer of that car?

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.320
What do all of the
cars consistently--

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.780
what decision would
all those cars make?

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.770
Is that the right decision?

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.970
What is right in that situation?

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.400
What is just?

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.510
I personally would like to have
a lot of diversity in the room

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.750
when the engineers are having
a conversation about what

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.139
that car should do
in that circumstance.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:27.710
So I think it's imperative
that we have diversity

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.639
in the new forms of technology
moving forward so that we have

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:35.330
a greater representative
viewpoint in these really

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.030
interesting, sort of
ethical conversations

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.196
that need to happen.

00:34:42.196 --> 00:34:43.172
Yeah, please.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.719
AUDIENCE: So there's
a lot of companies

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:53.399
now with massive online classes.

00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:54.469
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:54.710
Sure.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.179
AUDIENCE:
[INTERPOSING VOICES] so there

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.270
must be a lot of students
passing through that.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.990
And it's a question
for you and probably

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.050
some people in the audience--
are those students successful?

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.000
Have they learned?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.850
Can they use those skills in
a business workplace today?

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.420
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.260
Well, I might get this
a little bit wrong,

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.620
but it's pretty close.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.520
I think 80% of the people
that are taking [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.160
already have
undergraduate degrees.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.160
There's about a 5% completion
rate for people who

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.060
start classes to complete them.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:31.230
And the number one class on
Coursera is how to learn.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:35.450
So it kind of goes back to,
what is the most important thing

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.110
for us to know?

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.636
It's how to learn.

00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:38.760
You need to learn to learn.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.110
You need to learn to unlearn.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.520
You need to learn to relearn.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.450
You need to prepare yourself
for a 50, 60 year career

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.700
because we're all living to 105.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.490
You know, of constant change.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:53.150
You know, retiring
early might be 70.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:58.100
So how do we get ourselves
in a mental space

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.241
as a society of constant
learning and constant change,

00:36:01.241 --> 00:36:02.990
and being OK with that
and having that not

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.390
be an anxiety
producing experience,

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.241
but a joyful experience,
a great opportunity?

00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:09.740
So yeah.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.760
There's a lot of people that
are experiencing those classes

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.690
and they're great.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.110
We do them at our company.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.320
You do them at yours.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.540
And so it's interesting.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:30.420
I mean, I think that we should
be backing off on the pressure

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.870
to have the best degree
from the best school

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.060
and all that, and be
more open and accepting

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.930
to diverse paths like
stackable micro credentials.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.760
That's great.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.530
You know, there's lots of ways.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.320
Going to a code school,
going to a coding boot camp.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.250
There's lots of ways to get
really practical experience

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.774
that is more open to
diverse backgrounds.

00:36:57.764 --> 00:36:58.930
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:36:59.830
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.110
AUDIENCE: So in today's
world, the big tech

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:06.580
companies, do you think--

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.880
suppose a student, like a
community college student

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.980
did complete a Coursera course.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.340
Do you think that they're given
due consideration by the hiring

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.850
team or do you
think there's still

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.887
kind of an elitism
towards prestigious--

00:37:20.887 --> 00:37:22.720
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah,
there's still elitism.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.761
AUDIENCE: --universities.

00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:30.610
And what can companies like
Google and NASP do to fix that?

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.680
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:38.110
There's still a safety
to choosing someone

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:42.190
that has a four year degree.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.960
My perspective is
that you should be

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.430
able to prove your experience.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.290
So whether you have a fancy
degree from a four year school

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.900
or you have a bunch of stackable
micro certificates on top

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.650
of a community college
associate's degree, either way,

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.540
you need to prove to me
what you know, right?

00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.830
As a hiring manager.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:01.600
What can you do?

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.090
So in a more of a portfolio
approach to the hiring

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:10.390
process where we're
talking about actual work,

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.790
tell me about a time when
you actually did something.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.460
Show me an example.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.820
It's a great, easy
shortcut to say

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.400
what school did you
go to because we all

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.350
know the vetting process that
goes through for those things.

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:30.700
But as the demand for workers
increases and certain roles,

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:36.550
we will need to expand our
acceptance of alternate paths

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.880
to education for
those particular roles

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.950
because the
university system just

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.320
can't produce them
and bring them online

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.550
as fast as they're needed
across all of our industries.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.620
So what we can
do-- your question

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.100
is what can we specifically do.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.660
We can step back and
have a conversation

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.510
as an executive team around,
what are we actually trying

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.136
to accomplish?

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:00.010
What is our strategy?

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.390
What are our goals?

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.990
Can we achieve these
goals by having

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.370
a broader perspective to
talent and how that talent sort

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.700
of came up in the system?

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:15.640
So I think it really starts by
us as companies sort of looking

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.777
deep into ourselves and saying,
what are we actually trying

00:39:18.777 --> 00:39:20.860
to accomplish here and
what are the different ways

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.211
that we can accomplish
those goals?

00:39:24.211 --> 00:39:24.710
Yeah.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:25.210
Cool.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:26.429
Hi.

00:39:26.429 --> 00:39:28.470
AUDIENCE: I haven't seen
any information on this,

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:31.800
but one way I would
imagine we could increase

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.120
the incoming pool of talent is
for large companies like Google

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.960
and others to put money
behind some of these schools.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.650
Not for the reliance to be
solely on the government

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.210
to support these schools.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.760
But I've not seen, or maybe
they're just done quietly.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.460
But there was a
time when I expected

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.817
that there would be Google U.

00:39:51.817 --> 00:39:52.650
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.780
AUDIENCE: And it was a
brick and mortar school

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.900
that you could matriculate
into from any high school.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.940
And it met all the
standards, et cetera,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.270
but the money came from within.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.570
Is that being thought
about or done in any way?

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.800
I'm just not aware of it.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.383
JENNY DEARBORN: I
don't know any plans

00:40:09.383 --> 00:40:12.550
about Google U.
That's not anything

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.260
I would have awareness of.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Google
opened Howard West University

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.140
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:23.414 --> 00:40:24.580
That's what I was wondering.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.079
Yes.

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:27.210
I know some companies
that have MBA programs

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.910
that the company pays for,
but they're full programs.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.150
And that's where I
could see that we

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.045
could expand our capacity.

00:40:35.045 --> 00:40:35.920
JENNY DEARBORN: Yeah.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.910
Well, so many companies do this.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.930
SAP does also.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:44.760
We sponsor five different high
schools across North America.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.430
That's a partnership between
the company, a high school,

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.730
and a local community college.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.150
So it's a six year high school.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.060
At the end of six years, you
graduate with a high school

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.170
diploma, an associate's
degree in computer science,

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.210
and practical hands
on experience.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.200
So it's like an
apprenticeship program.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.800
It's a very close collaboration.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.360
We have one in Oakland,
there's one in New York,

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.630
there's one in Canada.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.354
So yeah.

00:41:11.354 --> 00:41:12.520
Other companies do that too.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.540
It's a great sort of first step
to making a huge difference.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.119
Yeah.

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:19.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.260
Thank you.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.420
This is very relevant
and eye opening.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.810
So you mentioned earlier
in your talk skills

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.947
for children to have.

00:41:27.947 --> 00:41:30.280
I don't know if that was
children or all people in terms

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.340
of this learning path.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.160
You mentioned resilience,
cross-cultural awareness,

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.090
creativity.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.445
What were the other sort of
essential things to learn?

00:41:39.445 --> 00:41:40.320
JENNY DEARBORN: Sure.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.770
Fundamental human skills.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:47.080
So creativity, innovation,
social perception.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.860
The World Economic Forum
has a list of 16 of them.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:56.230
I can send you the
list and the link.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:42:01.150
Emotional intelligence,
empathy, creativity, listening,

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.030
active listening skills,
leadership skills.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.330
You know, you have fundamental
numeracy, fundamental writing,

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.830
fundamental communication.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.080
But if you look at
the list of 16 skills

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.950
from the World Economic
Forum, what really jumps out

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:20.070
is how many are in human
to human perception.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.570
Yeah.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.500
That's what's really
distinctive, and different,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.962
and exciting to see.

00:42:24.962 --> 00:42:26.670
AUDIENCE: Well, thank
you, Miss Dearborn.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.920
Thank you everyone for coming.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.170
Let's give one more
round of applause.
