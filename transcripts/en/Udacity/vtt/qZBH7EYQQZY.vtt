00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Once again, this was one of those I didn't really expect you to get it right sort of questions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and so I sort of apologize but also not really.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The answer is 3  10⁸ m/s.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
These velocities don't add up the way they seem to add up when you're just walking along the train.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This itself is fairly mind blowing. How can the speed of light be the same.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
How could it still be approaching him at 3  10⁸ m/s.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Shouldn't it have gotten some boost from the train. Shouldn't it be 5? The answer is no, actually.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And in fact, this leads us to the second postulate.
