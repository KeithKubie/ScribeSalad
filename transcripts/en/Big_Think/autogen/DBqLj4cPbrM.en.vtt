looking at the human genome looking at
what we call single nucleotide

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729
what we call single nucleotide
 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.600
what we call single nucleotide
polymorphisms or SNP's you know just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
polymorphisms or SNP's you know just
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.800
polymorphisms or SNP's you know just
little tiny nucleotide change and one

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
little tiny nucleotide change and one
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.639

and 2 those are tumor suppressor genes

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
and 2 those are tumor suppressor genes
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.639

one little abnormality in those then it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
one little abnormality in those then it
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.920
one little abnormality in those then it
work so much and so you increase the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
work so much and so you increase the
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780
work so much and so you increase the
risk of breast cancer and we're looking

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
risk of breast cancer and we're looking
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.120
risk of breast cancer and we're looking
at a lot of these now so we know people

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
at a lot of these now so we know people
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160
at a lot of these now so we know people

don't detoxify a lot of these
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.980
don't detoxify a lot of these
carcinogens as well and looking at

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
carcinogens as well and looking at
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.529

so clearly research money needs to put

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110
so clearly research money needs to put
 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.350

people developed cancer we need better

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050
people developed cancer we need better
 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.350
people developed cancer we need better
treatments and we need been to continue

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360
treatments and we need been to continue
 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.010
treatments and we need been to continue
to evolve on the other hand we also need

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020
to evolve on the other hand we also need
 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.190
to evolve on the other hand we also need
to focus on something different than

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200
to focus on something different than
 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.150
to focus on something different than
just the war on cancer the war on cancer

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160
just the war on cancer the war on cancer
 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.370

was first coined by President Nixon in

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380
was first coined by President Nixon in
 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.730

the 1970s said we need a major push to

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740
the 1970s said we need a major push to
 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.010
the 1970s said we need a major push to
find a cure for cancer and since then a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020
find a cure for cancer and since then a
 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.050
find a cure for cancer and since then a
lot of great therapies that I've just

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060
lot of great therapies that I've just
 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.020
lot of great therapies that I've just
mentioned and many more have come out of

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
mentioned and many more have come out of
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.480
mentioned and many more have come out of
that war on cancer so that's important

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490
that war on cancer so that's important
 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.310
that war on cancer so that's important
but we also need a war on carcinogenesis

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320
but we also need a war on carcinogenesis
 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.590
but we also need a war on carcinogenesis
carcinogenesis refers to the causes of

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600
carcinogenesis refers to the causes of
 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.970
carcinogenesis refers to the causes of
cancer all the environmental toxins that

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980
cancer all the environmental toxins that
 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.580
cancer all the environmental toxins that
are out there that are not just out

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590
are out there that are not just out
 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.729
are out there that are not just out
there they're in our bodies okay so we

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739
there they're in our bodies okay so we
 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.050
there they're in our bodies okay so we
have polluted a lot of the planet and we

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060
have polluted a lot of the planet and we
 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.220
have polluted a lot of the planet and we
polluted our bodies and clearly i think

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230
polluted our bodies and clearly i think
 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.440
polluted our bodies and clearly i think
that the fact that childhood brain

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450
that the fact that childhood brain
 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.610
that the fact that childhood brain
tumors have increased dramatically since

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
tumors have increased dramatically since
 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.350
tumors have increased dramatically since
1970 you know some cancer incidence has

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360
1970 you know some cancer incidence has
 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.810
1970 you know some cancer incidence has
actually gone down but many have gone up

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820
actually gone down but many have gone up
 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.190
actually gone down but many have gone up
and childhood leukemia has gone up and I

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200
and childhood leukemia has gone up and I
 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400
and childhood leukemia has gone up and I
do believe that it's really no

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410
do believe that it's really no
 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.740
do believe that it's really no
coincidence that we're seeing you know

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750
coincidence that we're seeing you know
 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.509
coincidence that we're seeing you know
an epidemic of learning disabilities an

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519
an epidemic of learning disabilities an
 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.750
an epidemic of learning disabilities an
epidemic of you know developmental

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760
epidemic of you know developmental
 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.759
epidemic of you know developmental
disabilities we're seeing the incidence

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769
disabilities we're seeing the incidence
 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.400
disabilities we're seeing the incidence
of autism increased dramatically over

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410
of autism increased dramatically over
 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.430
of autism increased dramatically over
the last 30 years and I don't believe

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440
the last 30 years and I don't believe
 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.289
the last 30 years and I don't believe
that any of these are occurring in a

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299
that any of these are occurring in a
 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.330
that any of these are occurring in a
vacuum so I believe there's a link

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340
vacuum so I believe there's a link
 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.219
vacuum so I believe there's a link
between a lot of the illnesses that

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229
between a lot of the illnesses that
 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.010
between a lot of the illnesses that
we're seeing and the environmental

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020
we're seeing and the environmental
 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.500
we're seeing and the environmental
toxins that are ending up in our body

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510
toxins that are ending up in our body
 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.720
toxins that are ending up in our body
not just out in the environment so

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730
not just out in the environment so
 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.280
not just out in the environment so
there's no difference between the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290
there's no difference between the
 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.230
there's no difference between the
external environment and our internal

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240
external environment and our internal
 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.170
external environment and our internal
environment so we need a war on

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180
environment so we need a war on
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.420
environment so we need a war on
carcinogenesis as well as a war on

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430
carcinogenesis as well as a war on
 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.390
carcinogenesis as well as a war on
cancer a war on the causes of cancer as

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400
cancer a war on the causes of cancer as
 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.970
cancer a war on the causes of cancer as
well as treating at once it's already

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980
well as treating at once it's already
 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.960
well as treating at once it's already
occurred and I believe that's a war that

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970
occurred and I believe that's a war that
 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.930
occurred and I believe that's a war that
really can help prevent cancer I believe

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940
really can help prevent cancer I believe
 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.500
really can help prevent cancer I believe
that by minimizing people's exposures to

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510
that by minimizing people's exposures to
 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.290
that by minimizing people's exposures to
a lot of carcinogens we can affect

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300
a lot of carcinogens we can affect
 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.150
a lot of carcinogens we can affect
cancer incidence and I believe that

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160
cancer incidence and I believe that
 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.280
cancer incidence and I believe that
through a lot of the nutritional

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290
through a lot of the nutritional
 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.010
through a lot of the nutritional
modalities that I've just discussed we

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020
modalities that I've just discussed we
 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.250
modalities that I've just discussed we
can also improve not only cancer

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260
can also improve not only cancer
 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.650
can also improve not only cancer
survival below ribs well I think they're

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660
survival below ribs well I think they're
 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.710
survival below ribs well I think they're
all talking about it so you know I've

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720
all talking about it so you know I've
 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.740
all talking about it so you know I've
heard speeches were there all more

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750
heard speeches were there all more
 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.350
heard speeches were there all more

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360
cognizant of the environment and I am
 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.290
cognizant of the environment and I am
encouraged because that was not

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300
encouraged because that was not

something prior to this presidential

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120
something prior to this presidential
 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.660
something prior to this presidential
campaign you really heard people talking

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670
campaign you really heard people talking
 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.700
campaign you really heard people talking
about with any regularity and you know

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710
about with any regularity and you know
 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.370
about with any regularity and you know
was about a year ago that there was an

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380
was about a year ago that there was an
 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.020
was about a year ago that there was an
article in the front page of the New

article in the front page of the New
 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.210
article in the front page of the New

the death of environmentalism and they

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880
the death of environmentalism and they
 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.880
the death of environmentalism and they
interviewed two researchers who

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890
interviewed two researchers who
 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.520
interviewed two researchers who
contended that the reason people didn't

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530
contended that the reason people didn't
 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.640
contended that the reason people didn't
care about the environment so much or

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650
care about the environment so much or
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.440
care about the environment so much or
you know started to yawn or change the

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450
you know started to yawn or change the
 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.720
you know started to yawn or change the
channel when somebody was talking about

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730
channel when somebody was talking about
 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.310
channel when somebody was talking about
the environment is because they just

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320
the environment is because they just
 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.110
the environment is because they just
felt it was too big a problem you know

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120
felt it was too big a problem you know
 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.550
felt it was too big a problem you know
and there wasn't anything that they

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560
and there wasn't anything that they
 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.650
and there wasn't anything that they
could do about it but nothing could be

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660
could do about it but nothing could be
 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.630
could do about it but nothing could be
further from the truth because if people

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640
further from the truth because if people
 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.450
further from the truth because if people
can understand that the environment out

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460
can understand that the environment out
 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.090

my own mother I know what a toll it
takes on families and you know from

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530
takes on families and you know from

taking care of patients every day with a
 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.230
taking care of patients every day with a
variety of different cancer I know the

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240
variety of different cancer I know the
 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.000
variety of different cancer I know the
toll the cancer can take and clearly we

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010
toll the cancer can take and clearly we
 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.420
toll the cancer can take and clearly we
know the incidence you know cancer

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430
know the incidence you know cancer
 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.910
know the incidence you know cancer
Americans under the age of 85 it's

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920
Americans under the age of 85 it's
 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.160

heart disease so this is a big problem

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630
heart disease so this is a big problem
 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.940
heart disease so this is a big problem
and it's not a problem that just because

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950
and it's not a problem that just because
 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.460
and it's not a problem that just because
it's big should seem overwhelming it's a

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470
it's big should seem overwhelming it's a
 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.340
it's big should seem overwhelming it's a
problem you know we're very industrious

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350

we've had bigger problems and we've
 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.300
we've had bigger problems and we've
solved them and this is about each

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310
solved them and this is about each
 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.210
solved them and this is about each

they're putting into their bodies you

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020
they're putting into their bodies you
 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.600
they're putting into their bodies you
know how they can make their immune

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610
know how they can make their immune
 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.580

system strong how they can make their
detoxification system strong this is

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260
detoxification system strong this is
 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.110
detoxification system strong this is
about educating each person and I think

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120
about educating each person and I think
 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.660
about educating each person and I think
it's you know a great question that you

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670
it's you know a great question that you
 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.190
it's you know a great question that you
asked earlier what about people that

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200
asked earlier what about people that
 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.810
asked earlier what about people that
don't have a lot of money well maybe

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:28.820
don't have a lot of money well maybe
 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.220
don't have a lot of money well maybe
they won't be able to go out and buy

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.230
they won't be able to go out and buy

they won't be able to go out and buy
organic milk that they can do things

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000
organic milk that they can do things
 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.940
organic milk that they can do things
like you know drink green tea and

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:33.950
like you know drink green tea and
 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.630
like you know drink green tea and
sensible things exercise more there was

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:37.640
sensible things exercise more there was
 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.250
sensible things exercise more there was
a study in the New England Journal of

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.260
a study in the New England Journal of
 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.920
a study in the New England Journal of
Medicine suggesting that up to twenty

to just obesity there's an epidemic of

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300
to just obesity there's an epidemic of
 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.770
to just obesity there's an epidemic of
obesity in this country and you know the

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.780
obesity in this country and you know the
 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.850
obesity in this country and you know the
reasons for that or not enough exercise

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860
reasons for that or not enough exercise
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.840
reasons for that or not enough exercise
and too much intake and you know I think

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:58.850
and too much intake and you know I think
 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.990
and too much intake and you know I think
there are other factors that caused that

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000
there are other factors that caused that
 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.270
there are other factors that caused that
as well there are a number of chemicals

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280
as well there are a number of chemicals
 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.120
as well there are a number of chemicals
for instance that we're exposed to that

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.130
for instance that we're exposed to that
 

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.180
for instance that we're exposed to that
in animal studies have shown they make

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.190
in animal studies have shown they make
 

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.160
in animal studies have shown they make
the animals eat more even when you cut

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.170
the animals eat more even when you cut
 

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.650
the animals eat more even when you cut
the animals caloric restriction and

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:14.660
the animals caloric restriction and
 

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.330
the animals caloric restriction and
they're given a lot of certain

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.340
they're given a lot of certain
 

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.580
they're given a lot of certain
pesticides and herbicide residues they

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:18.590
pesticides and herbicide residues they
 

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.360
pesticides and herbicide residues they
still don't lose weight and so you know

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:22.370
still don't lose weight and so you know
 

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.130
still don't lose weight and so you know
there are a number of things people can

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.140
there are a number of things people can
 

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.080
there are a number of things people can
do just by getting within their ideal

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.090
do just by getting within their ideal
 

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.230
do just by getting within their ideal
body weight we know that up to

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.240
body weight we know that up to
 

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.030
body weight we know that up to
twenty-five percent of all cancers are

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.040
twenty-five percent of all cancers are
 

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.990
twenty-five percent of all cancers are
related to diet and we know you know

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.000
related to diet and we know you know
 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.640
related to diet and we know you know
about the connection with sugar with

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:36.650
about the connection with sugar with
 

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.980
about the connection with sugar with
high insulin levels with high insulin

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:38.990
high insulin levels with high insulin
 

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.570
high insulin levels with high insulin
growth factor levels so there are a

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:40.580
growth factor levels so there are a
 

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.320
growth factor levels so there are a
number of things people can do
