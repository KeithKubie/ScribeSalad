[Music]

00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:10.087
Okay, it's me, Destin. I am here with Mike
Simons at the National Electronics Museum,

00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:12.502
and he's going to show us something
that we interact with every day

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:13.810
that you probably didn't know.

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:15.405
So, what do you got for us, Mike?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.226
(Mike) We have a microwave oven.

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.897
And the microwave is built on technology

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:22.669
that was developed during the Second
World war for radar equipment.

00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:25.942
What we have here is just a standard,
off the shelf microwave oven

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:27.302
that we've modified.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:31.275
You'll notice that you can't open up the
door and we've disabled the controls,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.567
and it's got a separate
switch over here on the side.

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:35.041
What this is gonna show

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.765
is how the microwave beam travels
inside the cavity of the oven.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.807
We've taken a sheet of plastic and we've
embedded Christmas bulbs into it,

00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:46.494
and when I power this thing up it's gonna
spin, because it's on the carousel,

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.433
and as those bulbs flicker,

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.549
what that is is the beam
of microwave energy

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:53.200
that travels through the
inside of your oven.

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:56.780
[Click]
[Microwave hums]

00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:59.286
Okay, so what you see here is that those...

00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:02.038
the beam travelling through the bulbs.

00:01:02.063 --> 00:01:04.522
The reason that you have a carousel
inside your microwave oven

00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:07.365
is because that beam always
travels throught the same path.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.360
It's just bouncing around inside of there.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.072
So if you didn't have that carousel

00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:14.978
if you put your cup of coffee in the center
of the oven it might not heat up correctly,

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:16.941
because that carousel
allows your cup of coffee

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.072
to travel through different
portions of that beam,

00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:20.588
to make sure it heats up correctly.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.734
This thing also has a heat sink in it,

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.698
to eliminate some of the heat
that's generated by those bulbs.

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:27.841
And we've also lowered the power on this,

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.088
But this is definately a
"do not try this at home".

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:33.821
But you can come to the National
Electronics Museum and check it out.

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:37.371
(Destin) Awesome. So what is the best way
to heat up my coffee in the morning?

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:41.716
- Uhm... probably a tea kettle on your stove.
[Destin laughs]

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:42.628
(Destin) Excellent.

00:01:42.653 --> 00:01:45.669
So do you get more nerds, geeks
or dorks visiting you here,

00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:47.012
at the National Electronics Museum?

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:50.401
- You know what, we've debated about what's
the difference between all three of those,

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:53.535
and you know what, I think we get all
three but I can't tell the difference.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.118
(Destin) [Laughs] Excellent.

00:01:55.143 --> 00:01:57.416
So if you get a chance,
come up to Baltimore

00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.858
and go to the National Electronics Museum.
You'll learn something.

00:01:59.883 --> 00:02:03.038
I now know to put my food
on the edge of the carousel

00:02:03.063 --> 00:02:04.922
when I'm heating something up in
the microwave, is that correct?

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:06.438
(Mike) Not in the middle.
- That's right.

00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:09.418
So come up and visit these geniuses
if you're a dork, geek, nerd,

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:12.421
or anybody that just wants to learn
more and be smarter every day.

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:14.409
Alright, thanks Mike.
- Yeah, thanks.

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:20.651
[Music]

00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:32.186
...and where your relative motion is
going so you can compensate for it,

00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:34.241
but chickens are really good at this so...

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:38.750
I'll show you. Watch his
head stay totally stationary

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.452
as I move his body...

00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:44.392
