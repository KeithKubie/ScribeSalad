00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:04.563
Let's count together from zero to 19.

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:11.224
So, we have zero, one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:16.520
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.449
Now, we go to the two-digit numbers.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:35.938
Then, we go to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.263
Now, why did I do this?

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:40.796
The whole point of this is to see a pattern here,

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:42.856
especially in these two-digit numbers.

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.085
What do we see is true

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.737
about all of these numbers?

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:48.697
You could think of them they're being in their teens.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:53.571
They all, you might see, have a one as their first digit,

00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.660
and that one is sitting in what we'll call the tens place.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.931
and literaly says that each of these numbers

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.806
that one represents a 10.

00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:04.087
What do I mean by that?

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.579
If we go up to 10 over here,

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.850
this is telling us that this one represents 10,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.341
and this zero represents zero ones,

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.449
so 10 is 10 plus zero.

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:17.695
You say, "Oh, well, what's the big deal?

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:19.465
"We already knew that any number plus zero

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:20.596
"is that number again."

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:21.815
I think you'll see the pattern

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.838
as we go into these other numbers.

00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:26.919
So, 11 is equal to -

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.261
so the yellow one represents 10,

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:34.427
and this pink one represents one,

00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:39.937
and then 12 - 12 - this yellow one represents 10,

00:01:39.937 --> 00:01:43.441
and this pink two represents two.

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:45.050
You could think of it as

00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:48.100
this yellow one says this is one 10,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.574
so we have a 10 right over there.

00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:52.850
This is two ones, and you have two right over there.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.879
We can keep going.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:54.870
I think you see the pattern.

00:01:55.669 --> 00:02:01.028
13 is 10 plus three. 13 is 10 plus three.

00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:06.420
14 is equal to 10 plus four, plus four.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.154
15 is equal to 10 plus five.

00:02:11.154 --> 00:02:12.742
I'd encourage you to pause the video now,

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:14.233
and try to finish the rest.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.260
Try to write 16, 17, 18 and 19

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.865
as 10 plus some other number,

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.366
and really just make sure

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:23.087
that you understand the pattern that's happening.

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:25.003
Let's do that.

00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:27.755
So, 16 - so I can even write them all like this.

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:31.836
They're all going to be 10 plus something,

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:34.527
so 16 is 10 plus six.

00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:36.848
17 is 10 plus seven.

00:02:37.217 --> 00:02:40.190
18 is 10 plus eight,

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:42.639
and 19 is 10 plus nine.

00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:44.751
When you write it out like this,

00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:46.554
it becomes pretty clear

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.474
that this one in each of these numbers

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:54.056
represents 10, and the digit on the right -

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.738
that just represents that many ones.
