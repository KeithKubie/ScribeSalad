1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,920
The exercise of inviting you to choose.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,150
Our last novel,

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:11,151
as I think I explained in the very first
class of this term is an exercise in

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:17,451
thinking together about what
defines a period of literature.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,450
So for all the other
books in the syllabus,

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,990
I came with my rationale
for why I included them.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,000
And for this book I'm invited again
to think about whether I would,

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,110
if I were teaching this again
and you had not chosen it.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,220
So today I want to reflect on that and
it will lead directly into my analysis of

10
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,250
what the Holocaust is doing in this novel.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,520
And then I will have some parting
words for you to conclude the course.

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,240
When I think about books to include,

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,110
I have four categories that I think about.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,460
One is books that are
somehow representative.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,500
So the books in this course
that fit that bill, uh,

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,070
you might think of the ones
that featured the identity plot.

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,070
As I argued in that
lecture at mid semester,

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,400
the identity plot is a reigning
narrative structure in this period.

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,690
And some of the books in our syllabus
culminating in the human stain.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,920
And I think this book too could
be included in that group. Um,

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,110
all are representative of different
versions of that narrative structure.

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,410
So representative innovative,

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,920
I include works on the syllabus that I
consider innovative in the form of the

24
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:48,000
novel, in the genre of the novel
or for their subject matter.

25
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:52,470
Somehow they think about something in a
way that I haven't known anything else

26
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:57,100
to think about before. Um, I
think Lolita fits this model, uh,

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,970
very well and in its own way.

28
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:04,971
The bluest die at that time in the 1970s
took up a subject that had also been

29
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:10,860
neglected and was innovative
in its subject matter

30
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,030
is a book widely read well,
this book certainly,

31
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:18,720
uh,

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,640
meets that criteria and some
of our other books do as well.

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,260
Lolita is one, the human stain
is another, the woman warrior.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,760
Um, pretty much any Morrison
novel you can choose.

35
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,870
Um,

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,870
there are lots of books that fit this
criteria and usually when I'm aiming for

37
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:43,881
is a book that will be both widely read
and something else on my list so that it

38
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:50,970
covers more than one base.
And finally,

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,600
and this is the most,
uh, evanescent category.

40
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,230
Is it somehow excellent or
important in some other way?

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,570
Generally for me,
this is an aesthetic category.

42
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,990
So is it an excellent example of writing?

43
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,850
Is it an excellent example
of narrative art? Um,

44
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,250
is it important in what it thinks
about somehow, um, philosophically,

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,980
topically in a way that nothing else,
uh,

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,010
quite can match?

47
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,970
I talked to you on Monday a little bit
about Jonathan Safran Foer is ambitions

48
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:32,971
for this novel and his
ambitions in general as he
expresses them in interviews.

49
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,960
I think when I consider this novel,

50
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,620
I know that this is where
forwarders interest truly lies.

51
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,100
I'm sure he wants to be widely read.

52
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,140
I'm sure he wants to be innovative
and that's probably connected with the

53
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,160
excellence or importance
that he's aiming at. Um,

54
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,400
he probably doesn't want
to be representative.

55
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,710
Most writers want to be singular
rather than representative. Um,

56
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,100
but this is where the investment really is

57
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,260
and it's in that category that I think
we find his use of the Holocaust.

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,880
It's in the effort to be important to
be writing about something important in

59
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:30,691
this novel that the Holocaust comes
to have such a place in it or that he

60
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:35,740
chooses a story that has
the Holocaust at its center.

61
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,030
Now I myself am reserving judgment on
the excellence or importance of this

62
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,044
novel,

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,920
but I will say that it is certainly
representative of two things.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,970
One is a version of the identity plot.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,200
It is a novel of a young person to young
people coming to seek out their past

66
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:06,460
and somehow gained from that
search some sense of themselves.

67
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,790
So it is a version of the identity plot.

68
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,180
It is also representative of late
modernist formal characteristics.

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,460
So this is clever in the way that
John Barth is clever with language.

70
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,400
It is funny in the way that pension and
Barth are just drawing from our syllabus

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,420
a, it makes some of the kinds of
moves that the woman warrior makes.

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,200
So it is representative in that way.

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I do not think it innovates formally.

74
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,680
There's nothing I see here formally that
I have not seen elsewhere and before.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,540
So for me it doesn't
quite meet that criteria,

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,500
but representative and widely read,

77
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,620
certainly now there is a way in which
I think it could be understood as

78
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,094
innovative.

79
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,420
And my sort of kernel for
thinking about this is on one 85

80
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,423
yeah.

81
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,020
This is in that harrowing
scene where the woman,

82
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,870
they think of as

83
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,460
a Augustine has told them the story
of the murder of the Jews of track and

84
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,744
broad.

85
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,020
And then afterwards the
grandfather confesses to his
complicit conduct with that

86
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,253
murder.

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,593
Yeah.

88
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,250
And Alex has,

89
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:49,900
he's translating for Jonathan
his grandfather's words,

90
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:54,901
he says in the middle of one 85 you
cannot know how it felt to have to hear

91
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:58,210
these things and then repeat them.

92
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,090
Because when I repeated them,

93
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,720
I felt like I was making them new again.

94
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,883
Okay.

95
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,000
That phrase,

96
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,480
making them new again is loaded for any
ambitious writer coming after modernism.

97
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,370
Make it new was the dictum that as repower
and held out as defining literature

98
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:26,030
that could matter formally,
aesthetically, innovatively.

99
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,290
So to make it new in writing is very
closely allied with the project of

100
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:37,910
modernism.
A formal project

101
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,800
to use that phrase in this emotionally
loaded moment suggest two things.

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
One is it draws on a whole history of
discourse about genocide and particularly

103
00:07:56,211 --> 00:08:01,211
about the Holocaust that
could be encompassed under
the banner of trauma theory.

104
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,470
Now, some of you may have
encountered trauma theory.

105
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,770
It's a sort of mix of psychoanalysis
and literary criticism that has been

106
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:17,720
powerful in the past couple of
decades. It's power is waning, I think.

107
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Although there's this new interest in
sociology in trauma now in the former

108
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,850
literary critical version of it,

109
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,210
trauma theorists argued that to tell
the story again to tell the story of a

110
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,950
trauma again was to re-experience it.

111
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,540
This was a way of understanding
representation as human
experience has actual

112
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,960
experience on mediated,

113
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,620
and the special thing about trauma was
it was the only kind of experience.

114
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,750
This is what most trauma theorists argued,

115
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,130
that it was really the only kind of
experience that have this quality to it,

116
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,020
this peculiar quality to it,

117
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,380
that it remained real in the sense of
remaining experience and not becoming

118
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,380
language somehow.

119
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,280
Yeah,

120
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,830
this was a way of imagining language.

121
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Also conversely as being experienced
and for some trauma theorists,

122
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,310
this analysis of language spread out
to other kinds of language so that any

123
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:37,651
language could be understood
as in some sense traumatic.

124
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,720
And this is a far reach of it.

125
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,010
Much of this work I have to say
was done at Yale by two scholars,

126
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,740
Kathy Caruso and Shoshana Feldman.
Um,

127
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,440
both have now left the institution,

128
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:53,080
but Yale was very well
known for trauma theory.

129
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,520
It had its applications in Holocaust
studies in particular in the building of

130
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:06,070
the fortune off archive of
testimony, which is housed here. Uh,

131
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,390
I think in sterling.

132
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,580
Okay.

133
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,580
The effort to make videotapes
of survivors' testimonies
was in part of course a

134
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:22,651
historical effort to get that knowledge
secure before that generation passed

135
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:30,571
away to gather as much as could be
known of the human experience of the

136
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,070
Holocaust.

137
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,020
But there was a reason I
think that it was video.

138
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,230
There was a great desire among people
who wrote and thought about and studied

139
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:49,500
the Holocaust to have that immediacy,

140
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,130
that video, uh, was thought to give.

141
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,030
So rather than have transcribed
testimonies are written testimonies,

142
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,270
you get to see the actual
face and expression of the
person telling that story.

143
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,943
Okay.

144
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,830
This is something that scholars have
felt I have since the founding of the

145
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:14,070
archive have spent a lot of time
thinking about in theorizing.

146
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,530
In the course of that theorizing,

147
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:21,531
the word witness has come to have a
very specific and powerful meaning.

148
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,490
The interviewer was to think of herself
or himself as not a questioner or as an

149
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:35,820
interviewer in the way that we
would usually understand that role,

150
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,130
but rather as a witness
to that person's story,

151
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,780
a witness in the sense
of a judicial witness,

152
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:50,781
someone who would be in a court to affirm
that something had indeed happened.

153
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,600
There was a sense that was needed in
the context of gathering this evidence.

154
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Witnessing was a theorized in a much
more complex way by Shoshana Feldman and

155
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:09,160
dory loud, a psychiatrist, um, who is,

156
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:14,110
I think Dori, lob is still in new
haven. I think he's still at IU.

157
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,190
Um,

158
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,870
but together they wrote a book called
testimony that had a lot to say about

159
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:24,871
exactly how the witness functions in
relation to the person who's testifying.

160
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,410
And I think you can see the mark of all
of this thought about how the Holocaust

161
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,200
is received in the present
stamping for his work.

162
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,040
So you see it in part in
that little sentence that I
just read to you in saying,

163
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:47,230
and again it was making it new.

164
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,670
It's as if it's a moment in which trauma
is transmitted through language and is

165
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:57,820
imagined to be transmitted
in an unmediated way.

166
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,250
So the repetition that
we experience as readers,

167
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,670
all these horrible things are said twice
because we see Alex translating them.

168
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,090
That's dramatize for us by the
device of Alex as translator.

169
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,690
So it's debt to modernism or it the way
it has its eye on modernism behind it is

170
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:28,060
closely aligned to this understanding of
language and its relationship to trauma.

171
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,070
Now by the time Jonathan Safran
Foer is writing this book,

172
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:38,020
not only has Holocaust studies established
this whole body of thought about

173
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:38,854
language,

174
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,430
but there are also many examples of what
you might call the American holocaust

175
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:49,390
novel. And the one I'm going
to use in my lecture today, uh,

176
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:53,710
to think about in relation to this is
art Spiegelman's graphic novel mouse.

177
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:57,730
How many of you have, you have? You have
read it? Okay, good. A bunch of you. Um,

178
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,320
for those who of you who haven't,

179
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,530
it's the story of a character named art
Spiegelman and you'll recognize that

180
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,010
device of course from four.
Um,

181
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,370
art Spiegelman is a cartoonist writing
a book about his father's experiences in

182
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:19,160
the Holocaust and in concentration camps.
Um,

183
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,480
he goes through the novel
alternating between scenes of art,

184
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,670
interviewing his father of Ladakh,

185
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,850
and then it sinks into Vladeck story in,

186
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:35,851
there are lots of extended scenes where
we just see Vladik escaping from camps

187
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:39,370
and making his way through them and so on,

188
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,840
doing all the things that he did to
finally escape with his wife Andrea.

189
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,503
Cool.

190
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,730
We find out fairly early in
the first volume of mouse.

191
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:54,050
It's a two volume graphic that,
uh,

192
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,600
art's mother killed herself

193
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,910
well after she arrived in America
as an immigrant to having escaped.

194
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,510
And we see her in an inserted cartoon
in a different style in the bathtub.

195
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,550
She slit her wrists in the bathtub.

196
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,063
Okay.

197
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,120
What's striking about that graphic novel?

198
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:22,121
It's extremely smart in it's meditation
on the relationship between a son and

199
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:28,400
his father and the relationship between
growing up in America and surviving the

200
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,234
Holocaust.

201
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,420
But what's really striking is it's
meditation on the problem of Arts,

202
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,350
insignificance.

203
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,460
How can his childhood and his child's
problems being bullied at school or

204
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,230
whatever it is.

205
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,530
How can those compete with his father's
experience of having survived the

206
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,320
Holocaust by his own widths?
And by luck,

207
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,090
that dramatic story is
impossible for the sun to match.

208
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,260
And so there are certain ways I have
argued in print a certain ways that art

209
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,820
appropriate his father's story and
imagines himself as a survivor.

210
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,930
So it's a way of transmitting the trauma
of the Holocaust from one generation to

211
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,330
another. And there are lots of, um,

212
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,320
graphic devices and
linguistic tricks that, um,

213
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,660
that Spiegelman uses to affect this.
And A,

214
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,580
I won't go into that detail now, but, um,

215
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,530
it's something that I've argued at length.

216
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,573
Okay.

217
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,430
What makes everything is illuminated
different and I would argue innovative is

218
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:53,261
that it for me represents
the third generation effort
to recover the Holocaust.

219
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,730
So by the time for his writing,

220
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,470
okay.

221
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,160
These stories have been
told not only by Spiegelman,

222
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:09,161
his books came out in 1987 and
1991 or [inaudible] 86 and 91,

223
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,310
the two volumes of mouse so well before
four wrote this one forwards just a

224
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:17,354
child.

225
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,723
Okay.

226
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,920
That was not the only book on the
experience of the Holocaust. Um,

227
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,390
those would include Cynthia Ozick
the shawl. Very famous example.

228
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,440
Um, a little later, a European writer,

229
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,150
German writer living in England,

230
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,210
WG Sebald Road Austerlitz had a
very similar structure of a child,

231
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:41,900
of the Kindertransport,

232
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,100
someone who had been taken from Prague
to England along with all the other

233
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:50,490
children,
Jewish children of his,

234
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,250
his neighborhood to save them.

235
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,180
He discovers this as his own past and he
tries to go back and find the traces of

236
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,950
his parents in the concentration camps.

237
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,880
And finally he finds a snippet of film
from one of the concentration camps where

238
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:13,381
his mother was,

239
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:18,381
his mother was a singer and he slows
it down further and further and further

240
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,480
just to try to glimpse her face.

241
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,050
This is a story of the hunt for the
beloved parent and for the ground of a

242
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,050
child's identity.

243
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,610
This story has been told many times by
the time for his writing this novel.

244
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,501
In addition,

245
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:45,501
most of these prior versions and fiction
and Saman memoir have to do with the

246
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:54,081
first generation American experience so
far finds himself belated in two ways.

247
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,870
One because the story of
the Holocaust and, uh,

248
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:05,580
finding out that secret has
already been told and to,

249
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,540
because he's not second generation,
he's not the child of a survivor,

250
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,060
but the grandchild of a survivor.

251
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,880
So what do you do to
make that story your own?

252
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,270
If you are committed to its
central valley to who you are,

253
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,770
how do you make that into an
unmediated kind of experience?

254
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,780
One way that that's done,
both in second generation stories.

255
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:38,781
And I think in this third generation
story is by playing off of and,

256
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,410
um,

257
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,410
excavating the Jewish cultural
veneration for memory.

258
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,450
So in Jewish tradition,
memory of Eh,

259
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,870
of parents of the dead,

260
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,790
of past events is at the
heart of religious practice,

261
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,960
but also have secular versions
of religious practice.

262
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,760
This novel is full of those secular
versions of religious practice.

263
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,420
Um,

264
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,220
and it explicitly talks about children's
relation to the memory of their

265
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:13,500
parents.
This is on two 68.

266
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,393
Oops,

267
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,840
got my page wrong there. Sorry. To 60.

268
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,373
Okay.

269
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,970
He's describing here the
itch to remember that he,

270
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,230
he, uh, the novel imagines
as particularly Jewish,

271
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,890
but children had it. Worst
of all, for all though,

272
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:46,250
it would seem that they had
fewer memories to haunt them.

273
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,680
They had the itch of memory as
strong as the elders of the shuttle.

274
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,590
Their strings were not even their own,

275
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,250
but tied around them by
parents and grandparents.

276
00:20:57,251 --> 00:21:02,251
Strings not fastened to anything but
hanging loosely from the darkness.

277
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:09,030
So you can imagine this story of
Jonathan going back to find the woman who

278
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:16,741
helped his grandfather escape as an
effort to tie that string to something

279
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:17,854
concrete.

280
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,020
The fact that he never
can really find that woman

281
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,700
suggests that already internalized
here is something that I'm Holocaust,

282
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,713
uh,

283
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,320
literature coming before this has been
intent on examining and questioning,

284
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:44,680
which is, can you ever have that
on mediated relation to the past?

285
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:49,681
Can you ever tie memory back to the event
in a way that feels like it's a real

286
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:58,780
connection?
So here there's a fairly easy,

287
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:03,781
if also wistful or ELA gigantic admission
that you can't ever really tie that

288
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,810
string up.
This is why the hunt

289
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,960
is never going to be
successful in the novel.

290
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:15,230
We will never tie up all
those little details.

291
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,410
It's meant to be that way
because at this late date,

292
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,930
it's clear that's the
only way it could be.

293
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,640
And that's not innovative.
It's simply, uh,

294
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,400
where the genre is right now.

295
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,683
However,

296
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,250
this novel is loath to part with the
drama that earlier stories made from the

297
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:54,250
recovery narrative.
So for Jonathan,

298
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:59,251
the mystery is not what happened to
his parents during the hall to his

299
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:03,850
grandparents during the Holocaust.
That's the classic question.

300
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,200
The parents won't talk about what
happened. The child wants to know,

301
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,260
the child knows there's something back
there and the hunt is to find out exactly

302
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:15,094
what happened.

303
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,270
And usually it's hidden either
because the parent left,

304
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,890
a prior child

305
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,900
lost a prior child or somehow felt
guilty about surviving either because of

306
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:35,311
explicit acts where they were forced
to sacrifice someone in their family in

307
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:40,770
order to escape or in order to help
someone else in their family escaped.

308
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:41,980
They were forced to choose.

309
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:46,910
And we see that choice thematized
in Holocaust sections of this novel.

310
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,200
Um, so there's that hiddenness
of the Holocaust experience.

311
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,810
That's not what's hidden in this novel.

312
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:55,990
Okay.

313
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,160
That history is not what
Jonathan doesn't know.

314
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,480
He knows his grandmother survived
the Holocaust. That's not a mystery.

315
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,060
The mystery is who helped her,

316
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,000
who helped his grandfather,
sorry.

317
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:16,300
It's the grandfather who helped
his grandfather to escape.

318
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,220
That's the mystery.
Augustine is the mystery woman.

319
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,140
The photograph represents that
missing or hidden knowledge.

320
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,543
Okay.

321
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,710
That this drops out of the picture
of the novel relatively painlessly.

322
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,290
He'll never find her is I think the mark
of how the story of hiding something

323
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,440
that's hidden gets displaced onto Alex.

324
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,110
So what I see here is the transfer of
the story of they hadn't passed from the

325
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:53,400
hidden past of the victim's side of the
Holocaust to they hadn't passed of the

326
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:54,540
perpetrator's side.

327
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:01,010
This is a displacement of that
narrative onto the perpetrators.

328
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:07,550
So now it's Alex who is looking
to find the secret buried in the

329
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,410
dysfunctionality of his family.

330
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,610
Now it's Alex who finds in speaking to
his grandfather some explanation for why

331
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,460
his father is such a tyrant

332
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,620
and the same logic of memory and
genealogy that you see in the way Jewish

333
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:32,020
families are talked about
in their relation to memory,

334
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:36,030
in history between generations
that is reproduced.

335
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,130
As the father says,

336
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,430
you are responsible for your son.
The father is responsible for the son.

337
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,320
Somehow the father is reflected in
the sun. So the choice that Alex,

338
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,410
his grandfather made to point out his
friend Herschel as a Jew and to thus give

339
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:03,150
him up to the murderous Nazis.

340
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,500
This is somehow played out
in the dysfunctionality of
the family in the present,

341
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,520
in the terrible rages and
drunkenness of the father.

342
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,550
Okay.

343
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,550
It's interesting to me that this novel
is about making the relationship between

344
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:32,820
grandchildren and grandparents
as immediate as possible.

345
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,180
And so I think it's really
interesting that we have Alex,

346
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,440
um, disowning his father.
You are not my father.

347
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,390
He says at the end of the novel as he
throws his father out of the house.

348
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:49,224
Essentially

349
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,130
it's a way of getting the
second generation out of the
way and hopping into that

350
00:26:57,281 --> 00:27:01,660
space. So you can see it in the
second and third generation structure.

351
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,500
You swipe the parents out of the way and
you hop into their place as immediately

352
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:12,340
descended from the people
who experienced these events.

353
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,903
Yeah.

354
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,080
A problem for Americans writing about
the Holocaust is that even if you ama

355
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,670
grated here as a survivor,

356
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,550
this is not the land of those events.

357
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,660
And so I think this gives us some insight
into the use of the European setting.

358
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,850
Europe is where the
important history happened.

359
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,480
That's why a novel trying to be important
in these terms has to be set there.

360
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,220
So if you set out looking for
an important subject matter,

361
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,680
you need that historical
grounding and it's not in America.

362
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:00,514
It's in Europe.

363
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,803
Okay.

364
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,470
On one 17 you can see very clearly how
the story of Augustine and Alex picks up

365
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,370
the trope of witnessing and it's of course
accomplished through Alex's butchered

366
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:24,990
English.
This is on one 17 where he

367
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,170
holds the photograph out
Augustine and he says,

368
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,700
have you ever witnessed
anyone in this photograph?

369
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,260
She examined it for several
moments. No, I do not know why,

370
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,300
but I inquired again. Have you ever
witnessed anyone in this photograph?

371
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,460
No. She said again though this second,
no. Did not seem like a parrot,

372
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,800
but a different variety of,
no.

373
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,640
Have you ever witnessed
anyone in this photograph?

374
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,840
I inquired and this time I held
it very proximal to her face.

375
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:05,220
Like grandfather held it to his face?
No,

376
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:08,490
she said again and this seemed
like a third variety of, no,

377
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,770
I put the photograph in her hands.

378
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,660
Have you ever witnessed anyone in the
photograph? No. She said, but in her,

379
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:20,160
no, I was certain that I could hear.
Please persevere choir me again,

380
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:24,270
so I did. Have you ever witnessed
anyone in the photograph?

381
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,710
She moved her thumbs over the faces as
if she were attempting to erase them?

382
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,390
No. Have you ever witnessed
anyone in the photograph?

383
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,290
No. She said and she put
the photograph on her lap.

384
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,400
Have you ever witnessed anyone in
the photograph? I inquired, no.

385
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:46,720
She said still examining it,
but only from the angles of her eyes.

386
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,470
Have you ever witnessed
anyone in the photograph? No.

387
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,170
She was humming again with more volume.

388
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,080
Have you ever witnessed anyone in
the photograph? No. She said No.

389
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,530
I saw a tear descend to her white
dress it to withdraw and leave a mark.

390
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,570
Have you ever witnessed anyone in the
photograph? I inquired and I felt cruel.

391
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:12,190
I felt like an awful person,

392
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,570
but I was certain that I was performing
the right thing. No, she said,

393
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:19,690
I have not.
They all look like strangers.

394
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,670
I paralled everything.

395
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,480
Has anyone in this photograph
ever witnessed you?

396
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,790
Another tier descended.
I have been waiting for you for so long

397
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,023
here,

398
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:39,660
that effort through witness to come to
an unmediated connection with the past

399
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:48,070
and with the violence of the
Holocaust, it's acted out. It is,

400
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:48,940
as Alex said,

401
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,570
performed by that almost liturgical
repetition of the question and the answer

402
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,880
and the way that Augustine's body gets
closer and closer to the photograph.

403
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,160
She touches the faces.

404
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,730
She finally merges herself
and the photograph by
letting her tears fall on it.

405
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,060
So the question is,

406
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:24,061
have you ever witnessed for these people
she has not yet because no one has come

407
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:28,090
to hear her witness.

408
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,440
And I'm reminded then of
the structure of those, um,

409
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:37,470
survivor testimonies on video where a
witness is required in order for the story

410
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:42,490
to be told.
And so Augustine,

411
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:46,240
now she has not witnessed because
she did not have a witness.

412
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,190
Now she has her witnesses
and she will witness to them.

413
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,163
Okay.

414
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,820
And so Alex comes to be

415
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,980
undone by what he finds about himself,

416
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:09,070
what he finds out about his grandfather
and his family in the second generation

417
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:11,444
story.

418
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,890
Often it is the family
of the second generation,

419
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,340
the child of the survivor who is undone
by what they find out about their

420
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:23,840
parent.
So here again,

421
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:28,841
the structure of the narrative
is transferred to the
perpetrator's side and who

422
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:34,940
is lying in the bath
with their wrists cut,

423
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,200
not the survivor,
but the perpetrator.

424
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,820
So you get that image from mouse
transferred into the perpetrator's family.

425
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,440
What I find I'm

426
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,830
quite remarkable

427
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,770
about the formal

428
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:07,750
techniques of this novel is how they
finally reflect on that transfer of the

429
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:15,701
narrative from the Holocaust
literature to the perpetrators story.

430
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,730
And if you look on one 60 we
can begin to see how this works.

431
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:25,740
Okay?

432
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,420
Fuel recall,
uh,

433
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:32,421
they are sitting in the
silence and darkness

434
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,550
together,
peeling corn for Augustine.

435
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,620
And Alex takes Jonathan's diary
and opens it and he says on one 59,

436
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:49,560
this is what I read,

437
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,990
he told his father that he could
care for her mother and little Igor.

438
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:59,910
It took his saying it to make
it true. Finally, he was ready.

439
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,170
His father could not believe this thing.
What he asked what,

440
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,830
and Sasha told him again that he
would take care of the family,

441
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:11,220
that he would understand if his
father had to leave and never return,

442
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,130
and that it would not even
make him less of a father.

443
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,330
He told his father that he would forgive.
Oh,

444
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,640
his father became so angry,
so full of wrath.

445
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,890
And he told Sasha that he would kill him.

446
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,120
And Sasha told his father that he would
kill him and they moved at each other

447
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:30,990
with violence in his father said,
say it to my face, not to the floor.

448
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,660
And Sasha said,
you are not my father.

449
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,020
So in this scene,

450
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,160
Alex begins to understand

451
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,583
that

452
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,913
cool.

453
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Jonathan is using him as a character and
moreover that Jonathan has penetrated

454
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:58,750
right into the most intimate and
painful part of his family life,

455
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,710
his relationship with his father
and his fictionalizing. That

456
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,550
and of course,
if you turn to the end,

457
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,120
I hope you recognize this on two 74
this is in fact this passage from his

458
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:14,704
history,

459
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,810
what we are given as the letter
from the grandfather to Jonathan.

460
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,360
And there it is. This is what
happened. He took his father, uh,

461
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,730
he told his father that he could,
he could care for mother and little Igor.

462
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,800
It took his saying it to make a true.

463
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,450
Finally he was his father could
not believe this thing. What?

464
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,310
And so it goes on to the end
of that paragraph and you
can see culminating as in

465
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:48,450
the diary with say it to my face,
not to the floor, and Sasha said,

466
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,190
you are not my father.
What are we to make of this?

467
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,360
So this is a bit of postmodern cleverness,
if you will,

468
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,960
raising questions as have
been raised in the human stain

469
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,700
about who exactly is writing this account,

470
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,560
whether it's Coleman or
Nathan in that novel.

471
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:18,180
How it is that Nathan
knows what Coleman thinks,

472
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,910
how he knows all that happened,

473
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,110
all that he says he knows he has
that happened in coalmines life.

474
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Well here at the very end of the novel
when four brings out this passage that

475
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:37,560
has been provided much earlier
in Jonathan's notebook,

476
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,160
we are led to question the authorship
of all the letters in the book.

477
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,980
Now of course we know it's a novel.

478
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:49,680
We know it's all written
by Jonathan Safran Foer.

479
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,060
But in the logic of the novel itself,
Awareness.

480
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,940
Now verges towards this question,

481
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:59,640
it's not just the reader
who's meant to question this,

482
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,520
but the novel asks us
directly to question.

483
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,790
So what does it mean that Jonathan is
revealed to be the author of this letter?

484
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,080
Well,
there are a couple ways of looking at it.

485
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,760
There are those passages in the
book of antecedents. Remember the,

486
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,720
um,

487
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,720
the Jewish book of memory that
the tracking broaders right?

488
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,690
Over time,
some of those entries are prophetic.

489
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,220
They tell the future,
and we're given a,

490
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:43,140
an excerpt from that book
that describes the disaster.

491
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:49,370
And so we know that something like
precedents is a quality of Jewish writing

492
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:57,150
imagined in this way as a
kind of religious practice.

493
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,080
So either we can understand Jonathan
as carrying on that tradition,

494
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,320
that what he writes in his
diary is similarly proleptic.

495
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,950
It looks towards the future
and transcribes the future.

496
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,910
Or we can see it as
constructing the future itself.

497
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,600
So we can see it either as imagining
what will inevitably happen or as making

498
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:30,090
the future out of those words.

499
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,250
I think we're meant to feel
both residences to this
formal trick or this formal

500
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:42,370
device,

501
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,290
but the resonance of Control of making
it happen leads us to I think quite an

502
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:56,521
interesting place and leads me to wonder
whether this is not a novel of revenge

503
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:06,150
to transpose the story of a survivor of
the Holocaust who later much later in

504
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:15,481
their life finally comes to terms
with that terror and commit suicide to

505
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:19,660
transpose that well worn story,

506
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,080
well known story into the perpetrator's
life and family is a way of giving back

507
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,240
to the complicit,
the pain of the victims.

508
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,080
Okay,

509
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,150
so I think this is quite interesting.

510
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,210
Even though there are
so many moments where,

511
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,930
yeah,

512
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,200
that sense of fault is mitigated.

513
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,180
Would you not do the same?

514
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,570
That question gets asked
who would do differently?

515
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,210
How would you decide what to do?

516
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,600
We're given examples of listas father who
won't spit on the Torah even though he

517
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:08,870
is not a religious man and watches us,

518
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:13,871
his entire family is killed and then
finally spits so that he can be killed too

519
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,270
were given all kinds of morally ambiguous,

520
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,300
impossible situations,

521
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:28,301
situations really where moral machinery
isn't appropriate or possible to think

522
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:29,834
through.

523
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,570
Okay.

524
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,680
But still

525
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,790
there is that sense that a controlling
author has scripted this future for this

526
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:44,660
particular family in the present.

527
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,330
Yeah,

528
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:51,280
so that makes it quite interesting to
me in the, I just want to look on to 62

529
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,260
at another way that transposing the
story outside of the Jewish community

530
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,930
radiates out in this novel
and maybe mitigates that
suggestion of a revenge plot

531
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,900
and this is on two 62 when suddenly
the first person plural appears.

532
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:19,540
I don't know if you noticed it when you
were reading. I found it quite striking.

533
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,110
This is talking about the people of the
shuttle in their last months of life.

534
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,860
They waited to die and we cannot blame
them because we would do the same and we

535
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,130
do do the same.

536
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,170
Okay.

537
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,490
Yeah. Ask that question implicitly,
would you do anything differently?

538
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,250
Would you go about your normal life?
What would you do?

539
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,873
Okay.

540
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,800
And he says,
we would do the same.

541
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,980
But he also says we do do
the same as if mortality,

542
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,930
the fact of mortality,

543
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:05,880
the fact that we all are
all of us waiting to die.

544
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,680
And in the meantime,

545
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,250
not thinking about that inevitable end,

546
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,640
going about our daily life with joy
and play and all the range of human

547
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:18,720
experience and emotion.

548
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,920
He says that that is and Nalagan this
to what these people were doing even

549
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:30,621
though there and looks so different from
the one that Jonathan Safran Foer the

550
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:35,490
character in this novel
expects to have for himself.

551
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,900
So the Holocaust story and the reflection
that it causes back on the activities

552
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:46,590
of life radiates out in
a universalist sense.

553
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,740
It doesn't just impose its narrative
on a new set of participants in the

554
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:57,930
Holocaust that of the perpetrators
or those who are complicit,

555
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,910
but it radiates out to all
people past and present.

556
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,860
So it becomes a quality of the human
condition. This is a softening move,

557
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:09,270
I think.
Um,

558
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,360
it suggests the tragedy involved
in all sides of this story.

559
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:21,990
The tragedy of the simple man
trying to save his wife and child.

560
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,220
And in doing so becoming complicit
to the murder of his friend.

561
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:33,170
So we see that moral complexity and
it feels like tragedy because of the

562
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:35,280
softening moves.

563
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,240
Now I want to stop there and say
that it's in this innovation,

564
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,380
this change to an established narrative
about genocide and its relation to

565
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:54,561
literature and writing that I find
this to be an innovative novel.

566
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,490
And if I were teaching a course,

567
00:43:56,491 --> 00:44:00,510
which I used to teach regularly
on genocide and literature,

568
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,510
I would probably be very
happy to end with this novel,

569
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,810
for that line of analysis of this period.

570
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,500
It's very appropriate
as an innovative ending.

571
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,790
I think though in this novel it is partly
there as a way of taking on something

572
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:20,070
really hard.

573
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,900
So I talked a little bit on Monday about
the quality of this novel as a campus

574
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:28,590
novel, um, as the product
of a young person.

575
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,580
And I was joking with you
a little bit about the um,

576
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,350
the bar being set high for
the achievements. One can,

577
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,420
uh, pull off by the age of 22. Um,

578
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:48,380
I want to use that fact about
forward that this is a first novel,

579
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,270
that it's an especially and overtly
ambitious novel to reflect, um,

580
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,270
on something that's closer to life.

581
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:02,271
And this is I think something that I've
earned because literature is about,

582
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,410
it's addressed,
addressed to life after all.

583
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:10,020
That's why we read it
because it strikes us as a,

584
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,070
as a comment on things that are
important to us. If we read,

585
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,290
that's one reason why we read.

586
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So I want to use that question of ambition
also to address something that comes

587
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:30,780
up in the advising that I do here
for students year in and year out.

588
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:36,210
And to get at that question, I
want to read you something, uh,

589
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,690
as a good postmodernist
from the 19th century.

590
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,430
This is from Walden,
Henry David Thoreau's Walden.

591
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,830
So we have read a lot of books together.
Um,

592
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,390
this little part I'm going to read to
you from Walden comes after thorough,

593
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:58,680
has talked about the pleasures
and the virtues of reading.

594
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,120
Um, and then this is in a,
in a section called sounds.

595
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:08,100
The last section was, uh, was called
reading. This section is called sounds.

596
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,630
I did not read books the first summer.

597
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,000
I hoed beans, nay. I often
did better than this.

598
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,620
There were times when I could not afford
to sacrifice the bloom of the present

599
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:26,880
moment to any work,
whether of the head or hands.

600
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,800
I love abroad, margin to my life.
Sometimes in a summer morning,

601
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,230
having taken my accustomed Beth,

602
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,620
I sat on my sunny doorway
from sunrise til noon,

603
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,800
wrapped in a reverie amidst the pines
and hickories and Sumacs in undisturbed

604
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:48,090
solitude and stillness while the birds
saying around or flitted noiselessly

605
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:52,950
through the house until the sun falling
in at my west window or the noise of

606
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:55,410
some travelers wagon
on the distant highway.

607
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:00,770
I was reminded of the lapse of time I
grew in those seasons like corn in the

608
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:08,040
night and they were far better than
any work of the hands would have been.

609
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,700
They were not time
subtracted from my life,

610
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:17,010
but so much over and
above my usual allowance.

611
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,300
I hope that your summer,

612
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,210
we'll have a lot of time like that.

613
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,190
I hope that that time might
also have latitude for reading,

614
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,030
and that reading will be not only
what you have been now trained to do,

615
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:39,520
which is reading that is informed.

616
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,010
If it's contemporary novels,

617
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:45,760
you're reading informed about
where these writers come from,

618
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,700
what kinds of projects
they might be busy with,

619
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,090
what kinds of questions
they might be responding to,

620
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,720
but also that it will give you time to
enter into and pretend with Novaka often

621
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,780
remember back to the beginning of the
course to pretend with Nepal cough that

622
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:09,781
you can climb a mountain
of the imagination and meet
a reader there and forget

623
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,470
all the kinds of contexts that I've
been teaching you to pay attention to

624
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,560
because it's in that meeting,

625
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,270
in the imagination that I think literature
can most powerfully speak to you.

626
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,840
So I hope you will go and
have that kind of summer

627
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,780
[inaudible].
