00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.140
Hi everyone, and welcome to
another Google Developers

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.730
Live, where today we have a
pretty cool announcement for

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.890
the Google Drive SDK.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.630
That is the addition of a new
part of the API for managing

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.430
comments and replies.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.170
So actually, a feature a lot of
people have been asking for

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.410
for a long time, even before
Google Drive was called Google

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.130
Drive and we had a Google Docs
list and the various editors.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.320
There's a lot of people that
love Google Docs and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.910
Spreadsheets, and presentations,
and the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.410
commenting and the reply
features, and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.340
they're really great.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.310
But if you're a developer and
you're trying to build

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.680
workflow applications around
Docs, and editing, and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.350
workflow, they've just been
inaccessible in the past.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.725
Starting today, these
are now available.

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:04.030
We're actually going to
show some examples of

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.430
how to use the API.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.740
And those of you who have been
keeping an eye on our library

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.170
and our documentation, and the
client libraries, and getting

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.300
updates, you've probably
actually seen these in the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.170
APIs already.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.350
They've actually been there for
a couple weeks, but we're

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.340
just today making it official.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.925
So let's switch over.

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:26.870
I just have a doc up here just
full of some randomly

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.740
generated--

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
some text and a couple
of comments.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.010
Really, if you use Google Docs,
it should be really

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.160
familiar to most people.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.550
But there are a couple of things
I want to point out

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.370
that we have.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.410
We have comments, and
we have replies.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.530
You can see this second
comment here.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260
This has reply.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.350
And of course, we can do things
like edit and delete,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.930
and resolve, add new replies.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.465
All the functionality that
you get in [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:56.150
Editor is now available
via the API.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.720
And the really cool part about
this is you can actually

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.120
manage comments and replies
for any file.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.190
It's not just ours.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.460
But if you're building your own
editor and you have your

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.890
own doc format, certainly
those files

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.870
are in Google Drive.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.540
You can actually build your own
UI for managing comments,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.910
take manager or API for the
storage and notifications that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.150
come along with that, and just
make it behave very similar to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.360
the editors that people are
already used to working with.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.320
So to see actually how this
works from an API perspective,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.850
I'm going to switch over
to our API's Explorer.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.390
I should take a step
back here.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.580
We have all of our APIs.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.340
This is great tool for those who
aren't familiar with it.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.680
If you are trying to learn some
of our APIs, the API's

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.700
Explorer is just
really awesome.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.370
It gives you all of
our new APIs.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.030
You can click in, drill
onto them, see all

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.450
the different methods.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.640
And the ones that I want to
focus on today, of course, are

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.630
the drive.comments collection,
and we have, of course, a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.370
corresponding drive.replies.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.260
And really the main difference
is comments are--

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.140
comments and replies are
very similar, actually.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.530
The difference is, comments are
attached to documents, and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.220
replies are, of course,
attached to comments.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.760
So it's just basically
a nested collection.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.000
Let's go into our

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.310
drive.comments.list method here.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.320
A great tool.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.750
Again, tells you
what you need.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.200
Really, all we need to list
comments is a file ID.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.150
So I'm going to go back here,
and I'm just going to snag

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.710
this out of the URL.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.260
And we'll execute this.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.580
Also, if you're using this
tool and it gives you an

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.910
error, there is this little
button up here for authorizing

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.660
access to Drive.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.740
I already did this a
little while ago.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.130
My credentials are
still valid.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.430
But let's actually take a look
at what the response was.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.830
We can see here, we get back
a comment list collection.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.265
And we can see it's a collection
of comments.

00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:08.660
And in this case, we have two.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.960
We have the two top-level
comments that one is a little

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.120
trivia bit about one of the
words that appeared in there,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.910
and another one just about my
poor use of an example doc

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.360
using generic permission text.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.470
And then within there, we
actually have a replies

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.710
collection.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.750
So basically, everything that
we need in order to render a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.140
UI for what is a comment
activity on a document, we

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.080
could actually just get
in a single call.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.250
In addition, to getting the
actual content of the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.250
comments, we actually get a lot
of information about who

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.650
the author was.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.740
You get a display name.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.130
You get a link to their
profile URL.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.020
In this case, this particular
account doesn't have a profile

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.420
set up, so we're just
getting kind of the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.270
generic person icon.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.230
But if this were somebody who is
using Google+ and they had

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.680
a proper profile, you'd actually
be able to show an

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.560
image of that person, along with
their name, so that you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.930
can have a very nice social
experience with displaying

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.180
those comments.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.260
The other really important
bit here is this anchor.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.540
And I'm going to talk a
little bit more about

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.620
this in a few minutes.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.170
But this basically tells us
where in the document this

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.450
comment applies to.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.330
In this case, because this is
our format, we do have a

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.500
proprietary anchoring scheme,
which does make it difficult

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.480
for, or actually rather
impossible for you to create

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.430
comments that are anchored to
text in our document formats.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.380
But if it's a document format
that you control, or if it's

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.440
something where there's ways
to locate in a kind of an

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.430
interchangeable way-- and again,
I'll talk about this in

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.610
a little bit more
detail later--

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.100
you can put anchors in there
that your app can position

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.880
correctly and potentially, that
other apps could read and

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.750
position correctly as well.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.870
So basically, we have content.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.850
We have an author.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.620
We have content.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.820
We have the location.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.950
And then, of course, we have the
replies which again, very

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.040
similar author information for
who made the reply along with

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.550
the content.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.340
And of course, we have standard
stuff that we see in

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.360
most of our collections, whether
or not this is a

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.380
deleted comment or reply.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.360
The status for comments is
actually pretty important for

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.030
marking things as
open comments.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.650
That's still the action versus
resolved, indicating that the

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.990
people on the thread have
agreed that whatever the

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.580
comment was, that issue
is now addressed.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.510
So pretty basic.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.560
So let's actually try
creating a comment.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.580
So I mentioned earlier that it's
not possible right now to

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.410
insert an anchored comment
into our documents.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.560
That said, you can actually
insert an unanchored comment

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.760
into Google Docs.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.700
So I'm going to say
this is a comment.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.270
Let's keep that.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.190
And it's successful.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.100
We can see it.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.120
It knows my author
information.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.350
Creates it.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.870
You can also put HTML
content in there.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.840
Right now, I'm just putting
plain text, but if you want to

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.970
put HTML instead of plain text,
you can do that as well.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.900
You could render comments with
some tags if it's bold or

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.420
italicized or strike
outs, and so on.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.610
Now, I can actually
go up here.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.700
And we see in our full comments
list, we have this

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.170
unanchored comment, which we
can either comment on or

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:49.910
resolve, or do whatever we
need to do, or delete.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.830
If you want to do a reply to a
comment, it's actually not all

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.430
that difficult.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:01.360
Let's go back and list our
comments again and

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.610
then our file ID.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.656
And I'm going to
reply back to--

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:11.770
how about this thread
right here.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.630
We do need our comment ID in
order to do this, so we should

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.270
have another tab open.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.190
This is the replies/insert
method.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.420
I had already copied a little
earlier while I put in the

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.350
file ID just to make life
a little easier.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.560
And I'm going to put in
a comment ID as well.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.200
And let's see.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.020
And we'll just put
in something a

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.120
little silly and execute.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.070
And I did not authenticate
recently enough on here.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.820
I'll just reauthorize.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.660
And here we go.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.320
So now we were able to insert
a reply for that comment.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.130
If we go back in here, this
actually updated, and we can

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.920
see that new reply.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.510
So that's really the nature
of the comments/reply.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.160
You have comments.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.610
You have replies.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.390
You can do all the normal
operations that you would do

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.770
in working with a list of files

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:12.700
you can do with comments.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.770
So for example, by default,
deleted comments are removed

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.760
from the collection.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.140
When you query for comments,
actually you can ask for

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.520
include deleted.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.550
You can combine that with
updated min timestamps, if you

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.680
want to, for example, poll for
changes and find which

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.560
comments since the last time
you polled have been added,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.740
which ones have been deleted.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.120
If the comment is deleted, we do
return tombstone entries as

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.700
you would expect, and as we
do for most of our APIs.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.280
And that's really it.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.710
So I want to switch over to--

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:55.040
I've been mentioning anchors for
a while, and saying I want

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.740
to talk about them.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.560
So really what I want to point
out is if you go to our

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.150
documentation page here, we
go to this new page here

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.400
/drive/managecomments.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.790
And if you read through here,
there's actually a fairly

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.760
lengthy section here on talking
about anchoring

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.530
comments, and different schemes
here for interoperable

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.540
formats for anchoring content
to documents.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:28.490
So for example, if you have
text, then there's a couple of

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.720
different schemes that
you might want to do.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.620
You might want to anchor
a comment to a page.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.100
You may want to do it
to a range of text.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.540
This is basically using
offsets and how many

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.900
characters are in the range,
a line in a file.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.760
Likewise, if you're doing things
like video or audio,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.150
you might want to be able to
anchor comments to a point in

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.660
time in that audio or video
clip, and of course, give it a

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.650
range for how long of
that segment the

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.270
comment applies to.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.750
There's also different formats
for regions and in image.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.720
So if you're commenting on a
mock up for a new product and

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.410
you want to be able
to do things in an

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.850
image, you can do lines.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.760
You can do--

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.600
or rather rectangles
or points.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.810
And you can come up with your
own schemes as well.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.315
We do recommend that if you
are doing your own scheme,

00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:28.080
that you prefix it with
your application ID.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.020
And even if you go back over
to here, you can see this

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.320
anchor scheme here
for our own.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.510
Where's the anchor here?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.310
The anchor here.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.640
So this [INAUDIBLE] is basically
our internal app ID

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.190
for the document editor.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.020
And this is just a custom marker
that is meaningful to

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.420
us but not to really
to anyone else.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.520
So if you have, for example, an
XML document, a pretty good

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.730
anchoring scheme would
be something like

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.330
an XML element ID.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.990
Likewise, if it's a format that
you can control and you

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.500
have markers that are meaningful
anchors for a

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.960
comment, any way that you can
identify those, feel free to

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.740
use those as an anchor
yourself.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.680
One of the challenges with
anchors, however, is currently

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.650
in the version of the API that
just launched, the anchors are

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.460
immutable on a comment.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.160
So this imposes certain
limitations.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.670
For example, an anchor which
is based off of a line in a

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:42.460
text file, given that's
immutable, that anchor is only

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.840
relevant to a specific
revision of a file.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.730
So you do need to make sure
that if you are anchoring

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:55.550
comments to a file based on some
sort of relative position

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.510
or offset to the file, where if
the content changes, that

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.110
might invalidate the anchor,
that you only use anchored

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.730
comments on read only files.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.760
So for example, you're sending
out something for review.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.140
You might want to make sure
that the people who are

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.670
commenting on it can't
modify the file.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.170
That it's going to be
static for at least

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.820
some period of time.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.700
The anchoring scheme does
actually have a field for the

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.400
revision ID, so that you do know
that if the content has

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.280
changed, that you may have to
invalidate those comments as

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.330
the positions may no
longer be relevant.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.320
It is something that we do plan
on changing to make sure

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.120
that anchors can be changed
so that if you do need to

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.440
reposition them as a file
changes and those positions

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.270
change, that you'll be
able to do that.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.870
But for now, basically, the
recommendation is either use

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.660
anchored comments on read only
files if you're using one of

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.190
these kind of positioned anchors
where it's sensitive

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.140
to the format of the document.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.130
The second option would be
to use a custom scheme.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.130
This would be something, again,
if you have a format

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.880
that you can control and you can
embed the anchors, or if

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.640
you have some natural structures
like XML element

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.140
IDs, then just use the custom
scheme that you can manage.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.830
And then if the structure of
the content changes, the

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.620
structure of the file changes,
rather, and if those anchors

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.080
were to be deleted, you would
have at least some way to

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.040
detect whether or not
a comment was

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.470
still valid or not.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.940
And of course, the third option
is just to forego using

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.270
anchors, then you could just use
document-level comments,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.660
which are still really valuable
for a lot of content.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.160
You just have to kind of figure
out depending on what

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.130
type of file you're doing.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.990
But again, for a lot of the
formats that we're seeing

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.480
people do, they are proprietary
formats and have a

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.670
lot more flexibility for
embedding anchors.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.780
And in those cases, the API is
actually really easy to use

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.175
and very powerful.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.220
I'm trying to think if there's
anything else that is really

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.620
worth noting.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.260
The permissions are actually
pretty important.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.430
So one of the things a couple
of people have asked about

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.880
early on when we launched
the Drive API was in our

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.124
permission list, we did
have a commenter role.

00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:19.320
And of course, a lot of people
wondered why do you have a

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.770
commenter role if there's no
comment in functionality.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.710
Now you know.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.280
There's actually a good reason
for using that role.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.400
And it starts to make a lot more
sense if you are building

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.060
in commenting functionality
into your app, to start to

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.860
honor that role whether or not
somebody has either owner edit

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.990
or commenting permissions,
then you would enable the

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.780
features for adding a comment.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.430
If they don't have any of those
roles, then you want to

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.323
make sure that you disable those
features in your UI so

00:15:47.323 --> 00:15:49.380
that the users doesn't try to
create a comment and then get

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.910
an error when they actually
try to save it.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.890
But again, the same practice
that you should be doing

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.150
anyway for a drive application
always making sure that you

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.190
check ahead of time whether or
not the user has permission,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.730
not for security, but really
for usability just to make

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.250
sure that the user doesn't go
too far down any particular

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.380
path when the end result
is doomed to fail.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.140
But really that is
really about it.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.260
We do have a couple of trusted
testers who have

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.930
been working on this.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.690
I do expect in the next few
weeks that we will see a

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.450
number of applications out
there come out with

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.190
integration with the
comments APIs.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.940
Some of them, I think, are
going to be really cool.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.470
And once those start coming up
in the Chrome Web Store or in

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:43.430
other places, we'll try to point
them out as an example

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.550
for people.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.890
But other than that, have
fun with the API.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.710
I'm really excited to see what
people are going to do with

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:54.550
this, and that's really
about it.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.760
Join us again next time.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.080
We do have some more features
coming up pretty soon.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.220
And I do believe we are
off for next week.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:12.150
It is Thanksgiving, and even
though we're normally here

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.880
early in the week, I think we're
going to just take the

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.150
whole week off.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.140
But after that, come back,
and we'll have some more

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.040
announcements.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.180
We have some new quick starts
that we've been working on.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.250
Actually an iOS quick start
just got posted yesterday.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.730
We'll do a session on that.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.690
Again, a couple more features,
a little bit smaller than

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.020
comments, but are some really
cool and useful stuff coming

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.870
up as well.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.040
And other than that, thank
you very much.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:18:07.200
