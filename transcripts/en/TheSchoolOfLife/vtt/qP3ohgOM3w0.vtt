00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.270
We are often taught that the best way to prove
attractive is to smile. The idea feels logical

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.480
and for the most part highly appropriate,
but it shouldn’t blind us to the occasional

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.310
claims of a contrary minority approach, this
one founded on an awareness that friendship

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.970
between people is ultimately based not on
boosterish accounts of recent triumphs, but

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.019
on the possibility of shared grief, sadness
and melancholy.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.350
This may explain the surprisingly intense
charm of attractive people who are resolutely

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.260
not smiling – but instead look lost in thought,
absorbed by their own sorrows and taken up

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.140
with an internal dialogue around pain and
loss. They may well pull a smile if asked,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.010
but it will be obviously rather strained,
and brief, like a moment of sunshine between

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.670
dark grey clouds. They are beautiful not despite
their sadness, but – however curious this

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.090
sounds – precisely because of it. In the
Western artistic tradition, the most prominent

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.230
sad beautiful person was – for many centuries
– the mother of Jesus. In many representations,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:24.850
Mary was elegant, serene and poised, but she
was also – quite obviously – sunk in sorrow

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.890
and concern. But the sadness did not detract
from her appeal. Rather, it made the viewer

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.990
feel in the presence of someone who would
be in a position to understand their own sorrows,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.420
someone around whom it would not be necessary
to put up a front in the name of seeming normal.

Our longing for love is, at heart, powered

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.240
by a desire to be understood and to understand.
Given how much of life is tragic in structure,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.800
it follows that for many of us, the sort of
people we feel readiest to love are not going

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.630
to be those who find the business of living
obvious or easy; but those who are as puzzled

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.459
and saddened by it as we are; those who feel
a regular need to withdraw from the sentimental

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.209
bonhomie of daily life; those who are alive
to anxiety and catastrophe – and who may,

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.519
like us, frequently feel close to tears at
so much that is regretful and sad. We have

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.099
been keen to pathologise and medicalise expressions
of unhappiness – and our ideals of physical

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.459
beauty have kept pace with our prejudices.
Our billboards and movies loudly proclaim

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.531
the virtues of glowing contentment. But we
are in danger of missing out on one of the

00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:46.379
richest sources of beauty, which is when our
faces drop their usual masks and visually

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:53.760
acknowledge the pain of existence – a moment
of honesty and vulnerability on the basis

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.840
of which true friendship and love 
can arise.
