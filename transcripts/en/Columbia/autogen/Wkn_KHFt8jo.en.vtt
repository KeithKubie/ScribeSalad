years ago and then transitioned into the

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720
years ago and then transitioned into the
 

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.500
years ago and then transitioned into the
libraries so I actually want to use this

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:39.510
libraries so I actually want to use this
 

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.290
libraries so I actually want to use this
as an example of kind of some of the

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300
as an example of kind of some of the
 

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.690
as an example of kind of some of the
challenges that we've been facing so i

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700
challenges that we've been facing so i
 

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.790
challenges that we've been facing so i
came in and i started with all these

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800
came in and i started with all these
 

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.319
came in and i started with all these
great ideas right and i wanted

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:48.329
great ideas right and i wanted
 

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:50.269
great ideas right and i wanted
to do all of these different things and

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279
to do all of these different things and
 

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:52.549
to do all of these different things and
so I got to do some of those ideas

00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:52.559
so I got to do some of those ideas
 

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:54.619
so I got to do some of those ideas
initially and then after a while we

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:54.629
initially and then after a while we
 

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:56.840
initially and then after a while we
needed to start writing maybe a two page

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:56.850
needed to start writing maybe a two page
 

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.729
needed to start writing maybe a two page
description of that idea in order to

00:10:58.729 --> 00:10:58.739
description of that idea in order to
 

00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:00.769
description of that idea in order to
send it up the chain and have it get

00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779
send it up the chain and have it get
 

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:02.720
send it up the chain and have it get
approval and come back down and so said

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:02.730
approval and come back down and so said
 

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.220
approval and come back down and so said
okay and I started doing that and then

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.230
okay and I started doing that and then
 

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.600
okay and I started doing that and then
after a while we said okay well we're

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:05.610
after a while we said okay well we're
 

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.340
after a while we said okay well we're
doing a lot of these how do they fit

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:07.350
doing a lot of these how do they fit
 

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.720
doing a lot of these how do they fit
together and what's the picture that

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:08.730
together and what's the picture that
 

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.189
together and what's the picture that
you're actually trying to build from

00:11:10.189 --> 00:11:10.199
you're actually trying to build from
 

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:11.479
you're actually trying to build from
doing all of this stuff so I wanted to

00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:11.489
doing all of this stuff so I wanted to
 

00:11:11.489 --> 00:11:13.850
doing all of this stuff so I wanted to
share that picture with you what we're

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860
share that picture with you what we're
 

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.919
share that picture with you what we're
finding is that emerging technologies as

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:15.929
finding is that emerging technologies as
 

00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:17.299
finding is that emerging technologies as
we're approaching them are falling into

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:17.309
we're approaching them are falling into
 

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.400
we're approaching them are falling into
three areas one is professional

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:19.410
three areas one is professional
 

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.559
three areas one is professional
development one is new modes of research

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:21.569
development one is new modes of research
 

00:11:21.569 --> 00:11:24.859
development one is new modes of research
and one is outreach and so then on top

00:11:24.859 --> 00:11:24.869
and one is outreach and so then on top
 

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:26.629
and one is outreach and so then on top
of this are all of these other things

00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639
of this are all of these other things
 

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:29.079
of this are all of these other things
that were sort of starting out as ideas

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:29.089
that were sort of starting out as ideas
 

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:32.299
that were sort of starting out as ideas
which then are growing into something of

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:32.309
which then are growing into something of
 

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:34.789
which then are growing into something of
like a strategic plan or what was it as

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:34.799
like a strategic plan or what was it as
 

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:37.970
like a strategic plan or what was it as
a strategic thinking and design which I

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980
a strategic thinking and design which I
 

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.939
a strategic thinking and design which I
kind of liked for how we how we proceed

00:11:40.939 --> 00:11:40.949
kind of liked for how we how we proceed
 

00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:43.879
kind of liked for how we how we proceed
with a lot of this so we're doing a

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:43.889
with a lot of this so we're doing a
 

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:45.619
with a lot of this so we're doing a
number of different things looking at

00:11:45.619 --> 00:11:45.629
number of different things looking at
 

00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:47.150
number of different things looking at
how to support researchers and what they

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160
how to support researchers and what they
 

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.850
how to support researchers and what they
do everything from teaching researchers

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860
do everything from teaching researchers
 

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.559
do everything from teaching researchers
how to code and what good practices

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:51.569
how to code and what good practices
 

00:11:51.569 --> 00:11:53.720
how to code and what good practices
around code looking at researchers who

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:53.730
around code looking at researchers who
 

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.429
around code looking at researchers who
share code and share data and making

00:11:55.429 --> 00:11:55.439
share code and share data and making
 

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:58.329
share code and share data and making
them examples to then use them to then

00:11:58.329 --> 00:11:58.339
them examples to then use them to then
 

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:00.829
them examples to then use them to then
encourage other researchers to do things

00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839
encourage other researchers to do things
 

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:04.189
encourage other researchers to do things
like that bringing in new physical

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:04.199
like that bringing in new physical
 

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:06.079
like that bringing in new physical
technologies everything from Arduinos

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:06.089
technologies everything from Arduinos
 

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:08.739
technologies everything from Arduinos
and open-source hardware 3d printing

00:12:08.739 --> 00:12:08.749
and open-source hardware 3d printing
 

00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:10.729
and open-source hardware 3d printing
hopefully some gaming technologies

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:10.739
hopefully some gaming technologies
 

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:12.139
hopefully some gaming technologies
things like that so a lot of this is

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:12.149
things like that so a lot of this is
 

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:13.850
things like that so a lot of this is
still sort of in the proposal phase some

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860
still sort of in the proposal phase some
 

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.619
still sort of in the proposal phase some
of this has actually happened but I just

00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:15.629
of this has actually happened but I just
 

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:16.999
of this has actually happened but I just
sort of wanted to give you an idea of

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:17.009
sort of wanted to give you an idea of
 

00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:20.539
sort of wanted to give you an idea of
what my really cool job title actually

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:20.549
what my really cool job title actually
 

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:24.439
what my really cool job title actually
entails so jumping into things I

00:12:24.439 --> 00:12:24.449
entails so jumping into things I
 

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:26.539
entails so jumping into things I

was worried I was gonna do the same
thing so to jump into this I was I was

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.350
thing so to jump into this I was I was
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.829
thing so to jump into this I was I was
at a conference last week in the week

00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839
at a conference last week in the week
 

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:51.869
at a conference last week in the week
before and there was an investor there

00:12:51.869 --> 00:12:51.879
before and there was an investor there
 

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:53.999
before and there was an investor there
who said that he wanted to invest sixty

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:54.009
who said that he wanted to invest sixty
 

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:56.280
who said that he wanted to invest sixty
thousand dollars into a company and his

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:56.290
thousand dollars into a company and his
 

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.249
thousand dollars into a company and his
advisors were telling him to do this

00:12:58.249 --> 00:12:58.259
advisors were telling him to do this
 

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:01.470
advisors were telling him to do this
$300,000 feasibility study before he

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.480
$300,000 feasibility study before he
 

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.389
$300,000 feasibility study before he
invested sixty thousand dollars into it

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399
invested sixty thousand dollars into it
 

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:05.460
invested sixty thousand dollars into it
he said that doesn't make sense he said

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:05.470
he said that doesn't make sense he said
 

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.169

thousand dollars and fail and get a fact
 

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:12.449
thousand dollars and fail and get a fact
then spend a lot more money to sort of

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:12.459
then spend a lot more money to sort of

willing to step outside of maybe the way

00:13:23.489 --> 00:13:23.499
willing to step outside of maybe the way
 

00:13:23.499 --> 00:13:25.530
willing to step outside of maybe the way
that things are normally done to try

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:25.540
that things are normally done to try
 

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.999
that things are normally done to try
doing something a different way and

doing something a different way and
 

00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:28.979
doing something a different way and
maybe you can each sort of talk about a

00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:28.989
maybe you can each sort of talk about a
 

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:31.739
maybe you can each sort of talk about a
time when you had to step outside of the

time when you had to step outside of the
 

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:33.659
time when you had to step outside of the
way that things were normally done in

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:33.669
way that things were normally done in
 

00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:35.849

for ancient and medieval history but in
 

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.029
for ancient and medieval history but in
2005 I proposed this initiative that we

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:57.039
2005 I proposed this initiative that we
 

00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:58.979
2005 I proposed this initiative that we
collect graphic novels in the library

00:13:58.979 --> 00:13:58.989

humanities divisions but what I did
before I brought everyone together was I

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160
before I brought everyone together was I
 

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.429
before I brought everyone together was I
met with everybody individually to sound

00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:20.439
met with everybody individually to sound
 

00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:22.739
met with everybody individually to sound
them out because you know that thing

00:14:22.739 --> 00:14:22.749
them out because you know that thing
 

00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:24.150
them out because you know that thing
they say about trial lawyers you're

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160
they say about trial lawyers you're
 

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.470
they say about trial lawyers you're
never supposed to ask a question you

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480
never supposed to ask a question you
 

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.199
never supposed to ask a question you
don't already know the answer to but

00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:28.209
don't already know the answer to but
 

00:14:28.209 --> 00:14:29.579
don't already know the answer to but
that was my feeling about going into

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:29.589
that was my feeling about going into
 

00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:30.989
that was my feeling about going into
this meeting I wanted to make sure that

00:14:30.989 --> 00:14:30.999
this meeting I wanted to make sure that
 

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:32.819
this meeting I wanted to make sure that
everybody was that I wasn't gonna get

00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:32.829
everybody was that I wasn't gonna get
 

00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:34.409
everybody was that I wasn't gonna get
sabotaged by a lot of people kind of

00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:34.419
sabotaged by a lot of people kind of
 

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:38.699
sabotaged by a lot of people kind of
throwing tomatoes at me and it it wasn't

00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:38.709
throwing tomatoes at me and it it wasn't
 

00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:40.609
throwing tomatoes at me and it it wasn't
necessarily seen as an obvious

00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:40.619
necessarily seen as an obvious
 

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:43.590
necessarily seen as an obvious
development but nobody had an objection

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600
development but nobody had an objection
 

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.430
development but nobody had an objection
to it I guess you'd say

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440
to it I guess you'd say
 

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.100
to it I guess you'd say
and I definitely never thought that it

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.110
and I definitely never thought that it
 

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.960
and I definitely never thought that it
would become as focal a an element of my

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:53.970
would become as focal a an element of my
 

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:59.680
would become as focal a an element of my
work as it is now but I think that just

00:14:59.680 --> 00:14:59.690
work as it is now but I think that just
 

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.080
work as it is now but I think that just
asking you know all they can do is say

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.090
asking you know all they can do is say
 

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:07.670
asking you know all they can do is say
no just asking and I received ask and

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680
no just asking and I received ask and
 

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.460
no just asking and I received ask and
you shall receive it worked that's a

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:10.470
you shall receive it worked that's a
 

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.930
you shall receive it worked that's a
good that's a really good strategy one

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940
good that's a really good strategy one
 

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.370
good that's a really good strategy one
of the things I wanted us to touch on

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380
of the things I wanted us to touch on
 

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.260
of the things I wanted us to touch on
are sort of strategies so the one is

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:15.270
are sort of strategies so the one is
 

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.940

had to be overcome and I think part of
 

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.980

the answer is you know and that idea of
 

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.640
the answer is you know and that idea of

years or so ago we decided to do away

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720
years or so ago we decided to do away

with our reference desk and have just a

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:34.420
with our reference desk and have just a
 

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.120
with our reference desk and have just a
combined service point the information

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.130
combined service point the information
 

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.090

desk and while I think most library is

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.100
desk and while I think most library is
 

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.220
desk and while I think most library is
like most libraries have that kind of

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.230
like most libraries have that kind of
 

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.490
like most libraries have that kind of
model or some permutation of it that was

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:44.500
model or some permutation of it that was
 

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.470

kind of a big deal at Yale seven years
 

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.830
kind of a big deal at Yale seven years
ago so I think we had about six

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840
ago so I think we had about six
 

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.090
ago so I think we had about six

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.510
social science libraries before the
 

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:03.240
social science libraries before the
actual on combined library happen or the

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:03.250
actual on combined library happen or the
 

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.700
actual on combined library happen or the
combined Center and so we had had

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:05.710
combined Center and so we had had
 

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.870
combined Center and so we had had
different discussions with the

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880
different discussions with the
 

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.150
different discussions with the
librarians there and there was some

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:09.160
librarians there and there was some
 

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.070
librarians there and there was some
pushback from some of the librarians who

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080
pushback from some of the librarians who
 

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.820
pushback from some of the librarians who
had been there for quite a few years

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:12.830
had been there for quite a few years
 

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.940
had been there for quite a few years
but we gave them ample time to

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:14.950
but we gave them ample time to
 

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.259
but we gave them ample time to
understand that this change was

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:17.269
understand that this change was
 

00:19:17.269 --> 00:19:20.169
understand that this change was
happening still there was some kind of

00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:20.179
happening still there was some kind of
 

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:22.539
happening still there was some kind of
feet dragging through the sand but one

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:22.549
feet dragging through the sand but one
 

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:24.820
feet dragging through the sand but one
day we just decided the desk is going

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:24.830
day we just decided the desk is going
 

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.880
day we just decided the desk is going
and so we literally took the desk my

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:27.890
and so we literally took the desk my
 

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.799
and so we literally took the desk my
supervisor and I and put it behind a

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:29.809
supervisor and I and put it behind a
 

00:19:29.809 --> 00:19:34.690
supervisor and I and put it behind a
concrete wall luckily enough we did put

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:34.700
concrete wall luckily enough we did put
 

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.430
concrete wall luckily enough we did put
it behind a concrete wall even though we

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440
it behind a concrete wall even though we
 

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.990
it behind a concrete wall even though we
couldn't get facilities there to pick it

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000
couldn't get facilities there to pick it
 

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.730
couldn't get facilities there to pick it
up but we just said you know we've got

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:39.740
up but we just said you know we've got
 

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.110
up but we just said you know we've got
to do this it's never going to be an

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120
to do this it's never going to be an
 

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.070
to do this it's never going to be an
easier time so we did it and our

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080
easier time so we did it and our
 

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.230
easier time so we did it and our
circulation staff were properly trained

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.240
circulation staff were properly trained
 

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.200
circulation staff were properly trained
and we moved over to the model and it

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:50.210
and we moved over to the model and it
 

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.899
and we moved over to the model and it
was fantastic the librarians I think you

00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:52.909
was fantastic the librarians I think you
 

00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:54.700
was fantastic the librarians I think you
know a year later once they looked at

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:54.710
know a year later once they looked at
 

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.950
know a year later once they looked at
their statistics and saw that the number

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960
their statistics and saw that the number
 

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.600
their statistics and saw that the number
of consultations that they were getting

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:58.610
of consultations that they were getting
 

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.750
of consultations that they were getting
from the patrons I think quadrupled it

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760
from the patrons I think quadrupled it
 

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.480
from the patrons I think quadrupled it
was you know deemed a success but it was

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:04.490
was you know deemed a success but it was
 

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.460
was you know deemed a success but it was
really really difficult very painful

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:06.470
really really difficult very painful
 

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.200
really really difficult very painful
going through it so sometimes you just

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:08.210
going through it so sometimes you just
 

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.899
going through it so sometimes you just
have to pull the trigger right you build

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:10.909
have to pull the trigger right you build
 

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:13.299
have to pull the trigger right you build
that desk and then you move the desk and

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:13.309
that desk and then you move the desk and
 

00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:14.799
that desk and then you move the desk and
take it out piece by piece so that

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:14.809
take it out piece by piece so that
 

00:20:14.809 --> 00:20:18.129
take it out piece by piece so that
nobody notices Thanks actually um the

00:20:18.129 --> 00:20:18.139
nobody notices Thanks actually um the
 

00:20:18.139 --> 00:20:20.080
nobody notices Thanks actually um the
next question that I want to ask has to

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.090
next question that I want to ask has to
 

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.169
next question that I want to ask has to
do with barriers and both the types of

00:20:23.169 --> 00:20:23.179
do with barriers and both the types of
 

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:25.210
do with barriers and both the types of
barriers that you've encountered either

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:25.220
barriers that you've encountered either
 

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.220
barriers that you've encountered either
when you've been trying to lead or

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:27.230
when you've been trying to lead or
 

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.590
when you've been trying to lead or
trying to enact change how you've

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600
trying to enact change how you've
 

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.200
trying to enact change how you've
overcome those and maybe if there's been

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.210
overcome those and maybe if there's been
 

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.519
overcome those and maybe if there's been
a time where you've had to stand down

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:33.529
a time where you've had to stand down
 

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:35.710
a time where you've had to stand down
because of a barrier so whether there

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720
because of a barrier so whether there
 

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.149
because of a barrier so whether there
was something that you came up against

00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159
was something that you came up against
 

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:39.129
was something that you came up against
that you said you know right now is not

00:20:39.129 --> 00:20:39.139
that you said you know right now is not
 

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:40.779
that you said you know right now is not
the best time maybe we'll come back and

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:40.789
the best time maybe we'll come back and
 

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:43.450
the best time maybe we'll come back and
visit this later but we'll put our

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:43.460
visit this later but we'll put our
 

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.240
visit this later but we'll put our
energy somewhere else does that

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.250
energy somewhere else does that
 

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.399
energy somewhere else does that
resonates even yeah I can speak to a

00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:48.409
resonates even yeah I can speak to a
 

00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:50.830
resonates even yeah I can speak to a
little bit one of my areas of interest

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840
little bit one of my areas of interest
 

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.269
little bit one of my areas of interest
is scholarly communication and trying to

00:20:55.269 --> 00:20:55.279
is scholarly communication and trying to
 

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:57.789
is scholarly communication and trying to
advance interest in open access

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799
advance interest in open access
 

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.970
advance interest in open access
publishing and among my colleagues as

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:00.980
publishing and among my colleagues as
 

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.740
publishing and among my colleagues as
well as of course the broader college

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:02.750
well as of course the broader college
 

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.980
well as of course the broader college
but among my colleagues I think many of

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:05.990
but among my colleagues I think many of
 

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.100
but among my colleagues I think many of
them are very much on board and there's

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.110
them are very much on board and there's
 

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.840
them are very much on board and there's
a number of things that a library can do

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:10.850
a number of things that a library can do
 

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.759
a number of things that a library can do
we can as a department decide that we

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:12.769
we can as a department decide that we
 

00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:17.680
we can as a department decide that we
will change our own will you know issue

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:17.690
will change our own will you know issue
 

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.720
will change our own will you know issue
a resolution supporting open access and

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:19.730
a resolution supporting open access and
 

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.389
a resolution supporting open access and
do something that it's ultimately just a

00:21:22.389 --> 00:21:22.399
do something that it's ultimately just a
 

00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:23.480
do something that it's ultimately just a
statement of

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:23.490
statement of
 

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.150
statement of
this is a cool thing to do but I really

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160
this is a cool thing to do but I really
 

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.799
this is a cool thing to do but I really
wanted to get us to think about our

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:27.809
wanted to get us to think about our
 

00:21:27.809 --> 00:21:29.690
wanted to get us to think about our
tenure and promotion guidelines and that

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700
tenure and promotion guidelines and that
 

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.810
tenure and promotion guidelines and that
is like a real third rail of most

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820
is like a real third rail of most
 

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.910
is like a real third rail of most
academic discussions about changing

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:34.920
academic discussions about changing
 

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.390
academic discussions about changing
those in a meaningful way and one of the

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400
those in a meaningful way and one of the
 

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.620
those in a meaningful way and one of the
things I think that will really help

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:39.630
things I think that will really help
 

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.110
things I think that will really help
advance open-access efforts is when

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120
advance open-access efforts is when
 

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.620
advance open-access efforts is when
tenure promotion takes into account open

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:45.630
tenure promotion takes into account open
 

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.470
tenure promotion takes into account open
access efforts and supports those and

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480
access efforts and supports those and
 

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.690
access efforts and supports those and
maybe gives a gold star for those who

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700
maybe gives a gold star for those who
 

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.900
maybe gives a gold star for those who

weren't having and so it was difficult
 

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.620
weren't having and so it was difficult
and so when I was given and given an

and so when I was given and given an
 

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.260
and so when I was given and given an
opportunity to be put in an interim head

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:51.270
opportunity to be put in an interim head
 

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.120
opportunity to be put in an interim head
position for a little while I actually

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.130
position for a little while I actually
 

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.150

had colleagues say to me you know face

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:56.160
had colleagues say to me you know face
 

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.070

old enough and so that was really

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:02.160
old enough and so that was really
 

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.250
old enough and so that was really
difficult to encounter so I had to

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260
difficult to encounter so I had to
 

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.680
difficult to encounter so I had to
realize that while I felt like I was

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:08.690
