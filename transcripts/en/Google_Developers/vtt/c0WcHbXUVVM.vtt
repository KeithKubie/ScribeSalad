[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.640
APRIL ANDERSON: Welcome to part
two of our last episode

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.680
in this week's Women
Techmaker series.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.510
It's been really rewarding for
us to talk to so many talented

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.100
women who are innovating in
the tech space this week.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.350
And today, we're excited to
have yet another talented

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.430
woman techmaker, Hilary Mason,
who's the chief scientist at

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610
bitly, joining us from
New York City.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.000
Before we turn it over
to Hilary, by way of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.670
introduction, my name's
April Anderson.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.040
I'm an industry director
here at Google.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.480
And I'm working to bring
Google's advertising solutions

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.650
to our top partners in
the retail market.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.900
I've been at Google now for
about 10 years, and went to

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.980
school just down the road
at Stanford University.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.705
I'm joined here by my colleague
Kathryn Hurley, who

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:05.660
I'll turn it over so she can
do a quick introduction.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.900
KATHRYN HURLEY: Hey, everyone.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.490
My name's Kathryn Hurley.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.050
I'm a developer programs
engineer at Google.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.680
And specifically, I work on
Google Compute Engine.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.860
And as a developer programs
engineer, I help developers

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.130
use the Compute Engine API.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.120
So for example, I write
sample code.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.590
I speak at conferences.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.090
You might have seen me
at London Strata

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.740
this year, for example.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.720
And I answer questions on the
forum and Stack Overflow.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.630
And prior to Google, I got a
master's in web science at the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.630
University of San Francisco.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.540
And so now, at this point, I'd
love to turn it over to

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.920
Hilary, so she can tell us a
little bit about herself and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.400
give us a little bit about
her background.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.740
HILARY MASON: Sure.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.120
Hi.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.910
First, thanks for inviting me.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.230
It is really exciting to be
talking to both of you about

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.900
things I think we're all
pretty interested in.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.350
So this is really cool.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.350
And just to introduce myself
briefly, I'm Hilary Mason.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.850
I'm the chief scientist
at bitly.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.910
Bitly is a URL shortening
analytics company.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.240
But the work we really do is
about understanding human

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.280
behavior through the lens
of social sharing.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.550
So we look into the data
generated by our analytic

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.360
service and try and learn things
about humans, which is

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.580
pretty interesting.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.120
Because my academic background
is in computer science, but my

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.630
whole life I've also
built things.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.910
And so finally I'm in a position
where I'm both

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.580
building things and doing
interesting research.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.770
I also co-founded a nonprofit
called hackNY that helps young

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.510
developers find interesting
opportunities in the NY

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.150
creative tech economy.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.090
The tagline actually is from my
co-founder Chris Wiggins.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.320
And we say, "to save kids
from the street," but

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.540
we mean Wall Street.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.990
And I'm also involved in making
trouble in a bunch of

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.780
other ways in New York on Mayor

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.320
Bloomberg's advisory council.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.920
And also, I'm a member of the
hackerspace NYC Resistor.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.840
KATHRYN HURLEY: Wow, that is a
really awesome background.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.680
You do a lot of amazing work.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.300
So you briefly touched
upon bitly.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.650
But do you mind going into a
little bit more detail about

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.230
what the company does, maybe
how it got started?

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.890
HILARY MASON: Sure.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.095
So bitly was a total accident.

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:22.240
It was actually a feature of
another product that was a web

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.490
product around intellectual
discourse, around shared media

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.200
experiences.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.930
But it totally failed.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.420
But what did succeed was this
little piece of it for sharing

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.010
bits of content called bitly.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.890
And we actually have a sister
company called Chartbeat that

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.580
uses some of the same
technologies.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.420
And Chartbeat is real-time web
analytics for publishers.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.165
So nobody really planned
bitly as a company.

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:48.450
It's not like someone woke up
one day and said, oh, I have a

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.570
great idea for the world's
best URL shortener.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.930
But once that happened, we
started to build it.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.850
And we realized that the
value would always

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.240
be in the data set.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.710
And so eventually,
we developed a

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.675
business around that.

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:04.260
And that's our enterprise
analytics business where folks

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.150
who run large brands
are celebrities.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.830
Basically, anyone who either
publishes a lot of content to

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.200
the social web or has a lot of
content about them published

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.720
to the social web pay us for
branding on their shortlinks.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.320
And also, a whole set of
analytics about how their

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.650
stuff is doing.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.380
So we have these two sides,
the data and the business.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.270
And the work I do sort of
sits in the middle.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.400
KATHRYN HURLEY: Very cool.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.170
And how would you characterize
the bitly user experience?

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.540
For example, what do you think
that bitly is doing that

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.800
contributes to the seamless
content sharing

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.820
that we see on bitly?

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.070
HILARY MASON: Yeah, so bitly
is really the best way to

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.100
outsource your memory and the
content you want to save and

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.150
find later.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.580
So you can go to bitly
as a consumer--

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.580
of course, it's all free.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.620
And you can save things, tag
things, put notes on things.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.960
And then you can find out how
many other people also saved

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.890
those things or were interested,
or clicked on

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.260
those things.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.720
And you can come back and search
for that stuff later.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.470
And you can share easily out
to many different networks.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.500
So we see bitly as the hub that
sits between all of your

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.000
social sharing behavior.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.530
APRIL ANDERSON: Hilary, I'm
really interested to learn

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.850
more about what it means
to be a data scientist.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.170
Can you tell us a little bit
more about what that means?

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.390
What does a data scientist do?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.270
And in your role as a chief
scientist at bitly, what does

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.660
your typical day look like?

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.050
Take us through that.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.650
HILARY MASON: OK.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.105
So those are two different
questions.

00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:38.070
So I'll start with the one about
data science, which has

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.090
only really been around as a
profession for a few years.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.550
And I'm pretty privileged to
consider myself part of the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.230
larger worldwide conspiracy to
create the profession, or at

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.090
least help support it.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.850
I think data science deserves
a new job title because it's

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.370
not anything that we've never
been able to do before.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.110
But it's three behaviors that
we've never combined into one

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.780
professional before.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.610
And those three behaviors are
first, being able to do math

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.280
and build models that represent
the real world.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.220
The second one is being able to
write code or engineer the

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.050
systems that support
those models.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.820
And sometimes to do it at
large scale as you guys

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.370
certainly do and as we do
at a scale as well.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.100
And then third, to ask good
questions and be creative

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.760
enough to communicate
what you've

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.230
learned back to anybody.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.690
And that's often the hardest
thing to find, especially

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.780
combined with someone who
knows math and is

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.990
an engineer as well.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.590
But that's sort of the practice
that I've seen evolve

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.020
over the last couple years.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.480
As to what I actually do, that's
a very good question.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.480
I'm really privileged to work
with a brilliant team of

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.960
scientists, engineers,
and artists.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.600
And my job is mainly to
coordinate the various

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.270
research questions that we're
investigating, the systems

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.820
we're working on, and to work
with our product and business

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.150
to prioritize our work
appropriately.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.480
So I see our role as really
laying down the path where our

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.000
company will go in the next six
months or the next year.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.470
APRIL ANDERSON: That's great.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.610
And I definitely want to hear
more about that, but also want

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.810
to hear from Kathryn, who
has a few questions

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.975
for you on big data.

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:22.360
Because that's a very
interesting

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.072
topic for us as well.

00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:23.430
KATHRYN HURLEY: Yes.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.740
If you don't mind switching
gears a little bit.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.150
So as a data scientist, you
work with lots of data.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.080
What I'm first interested in
hearing about is what kind of

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.310
data is gathered by bitly
from your users.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.630
HILARY MASON: So we primarily
see three kinds of data.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.810
We see the save and
share events.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.480
So if somebody shortens a link
or saves it in bitly.com, we

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.120
see the entire set of
clicks on that link

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.630
once it's shared out.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.150
And that includes things like
the location of where people

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.400
are clicking on things from,
their referral, which social

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.410
network it's getting traffic
from, the user agent, so what

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.420
kind of device and
stuff like that.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.880
And then we actually go
and crawl the full

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.750
content of each link.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.170
And we would do a bunch of
analysis on that as well.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.230
So we primarily work with those
three types of data.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.690
KATHRYN HURLEY: OK.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.965
That's some pretty interesting
data that you gather.

00:08:13.965 --> 00:08:14.870
HILARY MASON: Definitely.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.300
KATHRYN HURLEY: Yeah.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.540
And just to give our audience an
idea of just how much data

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.850
bitly has and stores, and
how much data you get to

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.500
play with every day.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.550
HILARY MASON: Yeah, so we see
tens of millions of links a

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.710
day, hundreds of millions of
clicks on those links, and

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.980
then a lot of content.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.179
I don't remember off the top of
my head how big it is, but

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.169
it's moderately big.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.816
KATHRYN HURLEY: Moderately
big?

00:08:40.816 --> 00:08:43.490
It sounds pretty big to me.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.260
And so that brings up
a good question.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.390
A hot topic right
now is big data.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.930
And I know you have an opinion
about big data because I

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.860
watched some of your talks.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.160
What do you think
about big data?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.650
HILARY MASON: So I think the
term "big data" is a little

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.100
difficult because it's
so hard to define.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.220
So some people think big
data is when it won't

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.500
fit in Excel anymore.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.960
And some people think big data
is when you need more than one

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.180
node to actually operate over
something or store it.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.240
What I think is actually
fundamentally new and

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.220
interesting about big data is
that it reduces the friction

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.280
to working with data.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.040
So it lets you ask a question
and get the answer back before

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.500
you've forgotten why you've
asked that question in the

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.360
first place.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.840
So I think the advantages to
using these big-data type

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.330
technologies are really
human advantages.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.240
They're not so much technical
advantages.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.730
And I also, every so often, find
myself at a conference

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.650
with astrophysicists or people
who work in bioinformatics.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.790
And they look at our data,
and they say, ha.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.750
You thought that was big.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.490
We had to invent a new kind of
hard drive to store our stuff.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.400
So those are the people
who are really pushing

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.300
the edge of big data.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.310
KATHRYN HURLEY: And so it
sounded like you have a couple

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.630
tools that you like to use
to work with big data.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.130
Can you share what some
of those are?

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.720
HILARY MASON: Sure, though
they're fairly embarrassing

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.280
and old-fashioned.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.110
My favorite way to work with
data whenever possible is on

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.840
the command line using the bash
tools, so grep and awk.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.570
If you look on bitly's GitHub
page, we actually have some

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.340
nice scripts you can run to do
histograms on the command line

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.970
and do some really basic
sampling and get a sense of

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.900
your data just from that.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.970
That's not always possible,
though, so I'm

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.510
a huge Python nerd.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.810
We use NumPy, SciPy,
and scikit-learn.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.092
We also do have a Hadoop
cluster here at bitly.

00:10:42.092 --> 00:10:44.370
It's not my favorite piece
of infrastructure,

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.230
but we do use it.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.020
And it works very well for
what we use it for.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.280
KATHRYN HURLEY: Cool.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.960
Thanks for sharing.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.770
HILARY MASON: Of course.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.280
KATHRYN HURLEY: And so working
with all this data, you

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.480
probably have a lot of insights,
make a lot of

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.420
interesting discoveries
with this data.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.770
Can you share what your most
interesting discovery is with

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.350
all the bitly data?

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.740
HILARY MASON: It's really
hard to pick just one.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.480
But one thing we put up on our
blog today was we looked at

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.990
the half-life of content
by topic.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.220
And it turns out that most
content actually has very

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.550
similar half-lives.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.590
And a half-life is the time it
takes for a link to get half

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.410
the clicks it'll ever get.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.880
So just sort of looking at
how attention to it is

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.230
modified over time.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.060
But one kind of content is much

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.640
shorter, and that's sports.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:39.490
So once sports news is out of
date, nobody cares about it.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.190
APRIL ANDERSON: That's
a point.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.220
That's very true.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.460
HILARY MASON: Not really a
surprise, but good to see it

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.630
proven in the data.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.180
KATHRYN HURLEY: That's
so cool.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.420
And you make these discoveries,
but how do they

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.930
actually influence bitly
as a product?

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.560
Do you see any changes in the
UI or in the back end?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.280
Or are you just working with
the data and having fun?

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.940
HILARY MASON: Well, it's all
of the above, actually.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.380
So we tend to ask a
research question.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.465
And that might be something
like, can we build a model of

00:12:10.465 --> 00:12:11.840
canonical social sharing?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.520
So is there a consistent way
that content is shared through

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.310
different social networks?

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.280
And so we'll go out and
say, OK, how do we

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.260
know when we've won?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.270
How do we know when we've done
that, when we've actually

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.530
answered that question?

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.460
And then two, is it scalable?

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.870
So can we actually build
a system to do this?

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.480
Most of our products are
real-time analytics products.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.960
So is it possible to do
this in real-time?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.030
And then, if so, what should
the product look like?

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.410
And so that question was
actually not hypothetical.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.490
It was what we spent most
of last year working on.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.350
And we actually released an
experimental product called

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.420
Realtime, which is at the domain
rt.ly, where you can go

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:50.970
in and look.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.560
And it's showing you the stories
that are getting that

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.110
initial spike of attention.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.050
And you can now go in and
see the actual maps of

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.010
attention over time.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.030
So that's an example of
something that has gone from

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.220
research to infrastructure
to experiment.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.100
And soon, to bitly product.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.450
KATHRYN HURLEY: Awesome.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.100
It's always fun to see the work
that you do get put into

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.562
the product, I think.

00:13:14.562 --> 00:13:15.890
HILARY MASON: Absolutely.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:20.140
We're also opening up some of
the APIs there as well, which

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.700
I'm pretty excited about.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.160
KATHRYN HURLEY: Awesome.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.140
I like APIs.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.310
That's what I work
on every day.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.720
All right, one more question
for you, and

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.410
then I'll hand it--

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.950
I feel like I'm hogging
the show.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.900
But finally, have you hit
any walls recently?

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.800
Have you come across any
challenges with bitly's data?

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.500
And how have you overcome
those challenges?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.790
HILARY MASON: So that's a
difficult question because I

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.520
think most of my time is spent
overcoming challenges.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.170
And a lot of the time, they're
human challenges.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.210
So somebody is after
something different

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.730
than what we're after.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.410
Or we're not quite coordinated
within the company about what

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.340
we're trying to do.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.170
And sometimes there are
technical challenges.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.070
And I can think of examples
of both just from today.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.180
One being that we defined some
key business metrics for one

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.710
of our apps.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.870
And it turned out they were
getting written to one data

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.910
store and not another.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.340
And so I spent a long time
trying to track that down.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.530
In general, the ways I try to
work around these things are

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.530
to always talk to people
in a very positive way.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:31.470
So not to get frustrated or
upset but rather to say, OK,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.400
here's our problem.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.930
How do we solve this problem?

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.080
And I'm really fortunate, again,
to work with a lot of

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.180
smart people who are
really nice.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.950
In fact, our number one hiring
rule has always been, don't

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.646
hire assholes.

00:14:45.646 --> 00:14:50.020
And so that tends to work
out pretty well.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.550
KATHRYN HURLEY: That's
a good rule.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.836
APRIL ANDERSON: Yes,
it's a good mantra.

00:14:51.836 --> 00:14:56.480
So Hilary, I would love to hear
more about your role and

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.710
some of those challenges.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.625
And also, some of those
opportunities as you work as

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:01.540
the chief scientist at bitly.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.780
How do you really balance
wearing the technical hat and

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.800
the technical aspects of your
role with the things that are

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.790
more business-oriented?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.140
HILARY MASON: That's a really
good question because it's

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.820
something I'm still learning
how to do.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.240
And when I started at bitly
three years ago, I was writing

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.750
code every day.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.790
We were such a small team
that everyone knew what

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.640
everyone was doing.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.110
And it was pretty clear
where we were going.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.340
We had only one thing to do,
and that was keep scaling.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.330
And now we've got a couple of
different products, a larger

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.910
business, a lot more people.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.250
And so it has been a challenge
to learn how to grow with the

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.130
company and to grow
my team from just

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.530
me to now nine people.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:52.250
The ways I try to do that
are generally--

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.790
it sounds really trite, but
actually applying the

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.020
scientific method.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.740
So even in product or business
problems saying,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.070
OK, here's my theory.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.810
What experiments can we do
given the data we have

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.320
available, or the people we
have available, or the

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.870
resources we have available
to answer this question?

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.210
Can we try something and see
what happens, and then try

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.980
something else?

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.870
And that is generally how I've
thought about the world.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.610
And it has worked pretty well.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.120
APRIL ANDERSON: That's great.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.710
And how do you really infuse
that with your team?

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.430
This is an industry and
certainly a product that

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.520
requires constant iteration,
constant innovation.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.330
How do you really foster that
creativity with your teams?

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.510
HILARY MASON: I try and
lead by example.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.540
And what I mean there is to
have lots of bad ideas.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.430
Because you have to have
a lot of ideas to

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.750
have any good ideas.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.770
And if you don't even
try to articulate

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.410
those, the bad ones--

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.280
if you're afraid to do it
or you're going to be

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.520
embarrassed, then you're going
to miss out on the good ones.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.960
Or when you say something that
might not be the best idea,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.670
maybe one of your colleagues
can say, well,

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.910
that's total bullshit.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.480
But this other twist on it
might actually work.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.010
And so we try and keep that
kind of open environment.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.900
And also, keep in mind that a
lot of the best ideas don't

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.550
come from our researchers
with PhDs in math.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.010
They come from the people who
are working on our community

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.390
support team because they're
actually there working with

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.490
customers all the time.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.130
And so within the company, we
try and create a culture that

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.349
ideas come from anywhere.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:25.720
Questions can come
from anywhere.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.710
No one should be afraid
to have bad ones

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.080
or ask silly questions.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.590
Yeah, I do a lot of that.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.080
APRIL ANDERSON: No, I think it's
something we all kind of

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.730
strive to do, right?

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.900
Keep that customer
voice infused in

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.490
everything that we do.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.060
As a bit of a tangent on data,
I'd love to hear, how do you

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.940
actually keep track of your
own data within bitly?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.810
When you get this kind of
feedback, what are the

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.730
mechanisms that you use to
really make sure that you're

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.490
keeping your finger on the pulse
of how the product's

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.090
doing and what the customers
are saying about it?

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.050
Your own sort of big
data, as it may be.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:57.490
HILARY MASON: Right.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.750
So one of our responsibilities
is the not so sexy area of

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.550
business analytics.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.760
That is, even figuring out what
metrics correlate to the

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.010
kinds of behaviors
we want to see.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.940
And for some things,
it's really easy.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.880
So you have a certain amount
of money, and you

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.080
watch that go up.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.965
And that's great, right?

00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:16.640
Your problem's solved.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.730
But for a lot of things,
it's not that simple.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.180
So one of the projects I'm
working on is growing our

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.200
platform and working
on API design.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.260
And we start to think about,
OK, what kind of platform

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.340
users do we want?

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.050
How do we want to understand
their behavior on our system?

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.360
On the technical side-- if there
are any technical folks

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.920
in the audience--

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.700
we have a consistent development
metaphor within

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.590
bitly for all our systems,
which is you

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.640
have a stream of data.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.640
You have a queuing system.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.200
You have queue readers that
read out of that queue.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.980
You have some kind
of API layer.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.960
And you have an application.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.620
And what that lets us do is take
those streams of data and

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.050
put them in places where we
can analyze them pretty

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.210
easily, or hang things off of
them that can fire events when

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.760
metrics happen.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.960
And so we track everything we
can in StatsD and Graphite.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.360
We also have our own dashboard
called the Aquarium.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.890
We're big on the fish theme.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.840
And we just try and make that
available to everyone in the

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.020
company, so that anyone can ask
a question and find that

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.020
answer without having
to ask someone else.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.740
APRIL ANDERSON: That's great
to have that transparency.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.290
I would love to hear a
little bit more, too.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.340
I mean, you are doing so
many things at bitly.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.090
And you have such an impressive
background.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.110
What do you think of your
early experiences really

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.180
prepared you most for
your current role?

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.800
And are there any sort of
experiences that you'd

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.750
recommend for people who are
really looking to build a

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.940
career in tech and leadership
within the tech space?

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.290
HILARY MASON: Yeah.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.380
That's another good question.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.250
So I have a mix of
experiences.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.660
Some of them are theoretical
and academic.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.220
And many of them were
much more--

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.300
so I really do like
video games.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.930
So at one point, I built a
system to gather a lot of data

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.060
out of video games.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.550
And then it turned out it
actually had commercial value.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.300
But it was a total accident, and
I was pretty naive about

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.620
how I had developed it.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:19.300
So my only advice there is that
you have to actually do

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:25.260
things and not be afraid to do
things that are not perfect.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.060
If you do things and they're not
that great, people for the

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.540
most part just ignore them.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.430
But if you do things and they're
really interesting--

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.050
and if you're interested in
something, there are other

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.600
people out there who are going
to be interested in it.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.880
The second piece of advice--
and this is something I

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.730
learned probably a little bit
too late-- is that you need to

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.020
build a community.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.200
And in New York, we've been
really fortunate to see huge

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.590
growth in the number of people
working in tech or in

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.500
companies that have a large tech
component over the last

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.190
five years.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:03.400
But we've also done a lot to
build a data community here.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.430
And we've gotten people from--
where I say "we," it's mostly

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.210
me and a few other people who
said, we want this to

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.110
exist in New York.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.660
And we want New York
to have this voice.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.890
So we went out and found
people who shared that

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.370
motivation and that interest and
just started introducing

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.850
them to each other.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.320
And making sure that we have a
meetup every few months where

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.852
we get together with some
beers, so people

00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:25.980
are a little relaxed.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.730
And they can talk about what
they're working on or what

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.520
they're thinking about.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.780
But that community is
really important.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.320
APRIL ANDERSON: No,
that's great.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.760
Thank you so much for
sharing that, too.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.360
I think it is important to be
active and try new things and

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.580
really put yourself out there.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.540
So it's great advice to give.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.260
I'm going to turn it back over
to Kathryn because we want to

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.820
hear a little bit more also
about some of your recent

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.290
presentations and some of the
things that you've talked

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.425
about in terms of prioritizing
research.

00:21:50.425 --> 00:21:51.670
HILARY MASON: Sure.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.725
KATHRYN HURLEY: If we
have enough time.

00:21:53.725 --> 00:21:55.860
So like I said, I was watching
some of your recent

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.770
presentations.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:01.250
One in particular at Devs Love
Bacon, which is a very awesome

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.790
title for a conference.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.750
And at that conference, you
talked about-- and sorry, I'm

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.850
reading off my notes here.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.070
I just want to get the
question right.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.630
So you talked about several
steps in the

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.130
data analysis process.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:20.240
So that included finding,
scrubbing, exploring,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.955
modeling, and interpreting
the data.

00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:26.730
And so I was just curious if
you had any tips for data

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.470
scientists who are just starting
out in this data

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.890
analysis process.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.660
And if you could, suggest any
tools or any kind of material

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.740
that could help them get
started in the field.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.000
HILARY MASON: Sure.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.490
Here So I have to say that I
love that you watched that

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.630
talk because I had given a
three-hour machine-learning

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.090
algorithm tutorial at a
conference the year before.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.000
And the gentleman who organized
the BACON conference

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.300
attended and he liked it.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.360
And so he said, will you
come to my conference

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.250
and give the talk?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.460
And I said, sure, I'd love to.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.400
And then when I got there,
he said, oh,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.820
and you have 30 minutes.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.660
And so I had this three-hour
tutorial planned.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.680
And I was like, oh, oh, how do
I condense three hours of

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.100
material into something that'll
be entertaining and

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.570
interesting for 30 minutes and
actually not lose the value in

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.270
the presentation?

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.390
So that was an artifact of a lot
of stress and jet lag, but

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.620
I think it came out OK.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.590
The process you talked
about is something--

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.660
it's from a document I co-wrote
with my colleague

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.720
Chris Wiggins, who's also a
co-founder of hackNY, a few

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.520
years ago now, where we realized
that there really was

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.060
no canonical statement of what
a data scientist does or even

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:47.120
how you look at data in
a non-scientific way.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.350
And so we wrote this down.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.190
And it is, indeed, this--

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.510
you get data.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.620
You scrub it.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.660
You model it.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.870
You analyze it and you interpret
it, or make it

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.150
interpretable for
other people.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.910
It's pretty simple and
seems obvious now.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.990
But at the time, I hadn't seen
it written down like that.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:08.640
So for young data scientists who
want to start to explore,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.590
the first thing you
need is data.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.210
And there's actually a lot
of data out there.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.610
A lot of it's public data.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.390
You can look at some of
the government data.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.680
Even bitly has a public
data set of all

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.490
the 1.usa.gov clicks.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.945
So we powered the federal
government URL shortener.

00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:25.100
It's all public data.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.650
It's a good way to play with
social data if you're

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.160
interested in that.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.430
Or you can scrape it.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.700
So a lot of people do that.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.570
I just did a really fun little
side project where I scraped

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.030
all the menus for non-fast-food
restaurants in

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.040
New York City, and then tried to
plot clusters of different

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.920
restaurant types.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.120
So I found Chinatown.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.843
And I found where you should
go for Thai food.

00:24:46.843 --> 00:24:50.190
It was all really to find better
cheeseburgers, which--

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.100
this has mostly worked.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.490
But the data's out there.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.380
And so if you can think of a
question you would ask if you

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.420
had some data.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.920
Or the other way around, so find
some data and then look

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.240
at it and try and see what
stands out to you.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.470
Then you can start looking
at different tools.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.140
You can even start in Excel.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.820
So it's sort of a dirty secret,
but a lot of people do

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.890
great work in Excel.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.450
And when you move up from that,
you can go either to R

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.150
if you're a statistician by
training or Python if you're

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.090
more a computer scientist.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.160
Load that data up.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.160
And especially if you're in an
environment like IPython with

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.470
the interactive notebook, you
can start graphing it and

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.330
tweaking things and seeing
what you can find there.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.600
And then, my next recommendation
is get a GitHub

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.840
account and put whatever
you did up there.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.360
And then let people tell
you why it's wrong.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.990
Because you will learn a lot,
and they will think it's cool.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.460
And you'll get a lot of good
feedback and start to meet

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.350
people who are also interested
in what you're interested in.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.740
KATHRYN HURLEY: And you create
a lot of cool visualizations

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.095
as well with the data.

00:25:53.095 --> 00:25:55.530
So are there any libraries that
you like to use to create

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.390
these visualizations?

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.190
HILARY MASON: Well, at bitly,
we are huge fans of D3.js.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.270
In fact, my colleague Mike Dewar
wrote a short O'Reilly

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.590
book on getting started
with D3.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.490
So if you'd like to check
that out, we use it on

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.000
our Realtime site.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.770
And it's a really good book.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.520
Otherwise, so data visualization
in the service

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.150
of usefulness, where it really
doesn't have to be pretty, I

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:25.620
still mostly use matplotlib in
Python, which is a very simple

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.388
way to make fairly uninteresting
graphs.

00:26:29.388 --> 00:26:30.762
KATHRYN HURLEY: Cool.

00:26:30.762 --> 00:26:34.440
All right, maybe one
more question?

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.720
OK.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.920
And then I just want to ask
about the prioritizing

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.490
research blog post that
you wrote recently.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.840
So people that might not be
familiar with it, I'll just

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.560
cover it real quick.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.050
So you have five different
steps for

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.340
prioritizing research.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.400
And that's you first
state a question.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.300
Then you ask yourself, how do
you know when you've won?

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.900
And correct me if I'm not
getting these right, please.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.770
Then you assume the question
was answered correctly.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.920
What are the first things that
you're going to build with it?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.780
And then, if everyone in
the world uses it--

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.530
let's see--

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.350
how does that change
human behavior?

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.290
And the last one, my favorite
one, is, what's the most evil

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.500
thing that can be
done with this?

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.120
So first, my question is, what
about that last question?

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.280
Why did you include that?

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.880
HILARY MASON: I included that
because it lets you turn the

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.790
work upside down and think about
the implications of what

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.740
you're doing in a really
creative way.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.320
And just getting people to
brainstorm about how they

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.950
could do something terrible with
what they're working on

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.600
really makes them think
about it in a new way.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.210
And we've had a lot of really
good ideas come out of that.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.280
I do want to add that
we're not evil.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.560
We're generally trying to build
very good things, sort

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.110
of build things that make the
world more like the world we

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.470
want to live in.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:06.910
But that question tends to get
people to think creatively

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.550
about the research in
a way that nothing

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.410
else I've found works.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.370
APRIL ANDERSON: That's great.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.330
KATHRYN HURLEY: Cool.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:15.250
APRIL ANDERSON: I think
we're wrapping.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.790
KATHRYN HURLEY: Yes, I
think we'll wrap up.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.120
So I just want to say thank
you so much, Hilary, for

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.650
joining us.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.295
It was--

00:28:21.295 --> 00:28:22.630
HILARY MASON: Oh,
thank you, both.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.520
This was super fun.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.250
APRIL ANDERSON: Yeah,
it was really nice

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:24.920
to meet you, Hilary.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.080
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.380
I'm fascinated and very much
inspired by all the work that

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.840
you've done in your
career thus far.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.370
So thank you for coming here.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.835
HILARY MASON: Likewise.

00:28:34.835 --> 00:28:37.010
And thank you for hosting.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.025
APRIL ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:28:38.025 --> 00:28:39.170
KATHRYN HURLEY: That's great.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.590
Learning so much great
information from you.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.190
And I guess, should I wrap up?

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.070
Sorry.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.030
And to our viewers, thank you
