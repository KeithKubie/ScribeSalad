00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.560
Lee: Korean waters are
very dark and very cold.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.920
People don't usually dive there
for fun, but I do.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.040
The water is calm today,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.280
and we're going to do
a wreck dive.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.640
It looks so dangerous,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.680
but once your eyes get used
to the environment

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.960
and you realize that things
are moving,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.320
it's a really great joy
watching them.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.080
I saw a fish, like, this big,
and just absolutely amazing.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.080
Then I find a bunch of stuff

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.840
that I never expected
to find there,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.960
like instant coffee cups,
flip flops.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.760
It's upsetting.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.040
We have to think about
preserving the ocean.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.160
Diving into the water just
completely disconnects me

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
from the world I live in;

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.120
with 20 million people
living around the city.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.200
It gives me a sense
of reconnection with nature.
