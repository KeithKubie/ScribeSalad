00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.554
- [Voiceover] Ruby puts a dish of macaroni

00:00:02.554 --> 00:00:04.890
and cheese into the refrigerator.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.186
The dish was 80,

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:10.315
80 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:12.834
when she put it in, and the inside

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:17.081
of the refrigerator was
40 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.681
The dish cooled quickly at first,

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.875
so this is gonna be
interesting, quickly at first,

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:25.410
then slowed as it
approached the temperature

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.458
inside the refrigerator, alright.

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.246
Which of the following graphs

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:34.350
in the mT-plane could best represent

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.621
the temperature, T, in degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:42.578
"m" minutes after Ruby put
the dish in the refrigerator?

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:44.955
So mT-plane sounds very fancy,

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:47.596
but all they're saying is
is the horizontal axis,

00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:50.583
that's our time axis, and it's
gonna be measured in minutes,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.985
"m" for minutes.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.565
And our vertical axis in this plane,

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:55.886
in this coordinate plane, is going to be

00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:57.288
our temperature axis,

00:00:57.288 --> 00:01:00.315
and it's measured in Fahrenheit degrees.

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:01.717
So let's see what they're saying.

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:04.216
So the dish started at 80,

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:06.105
at 80 degrees,

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:07.670
at 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.494
So at zero minutes, right when
she put it into the fridge,

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:12.505
it should be 80 degrees.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.826
So this one right over here,

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:15.959
this one is indeed at 80 degrees.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.645
This graph right over here,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:19.657
this is starting at zero degrees.

00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:22.135
Not at, it needs to start at 80 degrees

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:24.269
if we're gonna model
what actually happened.

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:27.296
So this, we can rule
that one out immediately.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.982
Then when you look at these choices,

00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:31.156
this one starting at 40 degrees.

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:32.741
Once again, not what we need.

00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:36.032
We need it to start at 80
degrees at zero minutes.

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:37.597
So we'll rule that one out.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.238
This one also starts at 80 degrees.

00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:42.534
Now let's think about the shape

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.504
of what the curve should be.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.070
They say

00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:50.695
the dish cooled quickly
at first then slowed,

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:53.295
then slowed as it
approached the temperature

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:55.287
inside the refrigerator.

00:01:55.287 --> 00:01:58.354
Now, does this graph describe that?

00:01:58.354 --> 00:02:00.142
It starts, before it
was in the refrigerator

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:01.361
it was at 80 degrees,

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:02.540
or right when they put
it in the refrigerator

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.901
it's at 80 degrees.

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:07.192
And then it starts, its
temperature declines quickly

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:10.585
at first, but then the rate of decline

00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:14.628
slows as it approaches the
temperature inside of the fridge,

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:16.924
that 40 degrees, and that seems like that

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:18.387
this is what's happening.

00:02:18.387 --> 00:02:19.972
The slope is become,

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:21.638
it starts out quite negative,

00:02:21.638 --> 00:02:24.108
but it becomes less and
less and less negative

00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:25.896
as we get closer and closer

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:28.557
to the 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:28.557 --> 00:02:30.162
This one over here,

00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:31.544
after some number of minutes

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:35.607
we do end up at this
40 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:39.122
but the rate of decline is
constant the entire time.

00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:40.402
This is a line, this is describing

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.353
a constant rate of decline.

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:45.359
But what they described is
a changing rate of decline.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.696
The dish cooled quickly at first,

00:02:47.696 --> 00:02:49.382
so that would be a steep decline,

00:02:49.382 --> 00:02:51.414
cooled quickly at first,

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:53.649
then slowed as it
approached the temperature

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:54.766
inside the refrigerator.

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:55.965
So the decline slows,

00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:57.550
it becomes less negative

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.597
as we approach the temperature
of the refrigerator.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.568
So you have this. . . .

00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:07.568
this change in the rate
of temperature change

00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:11.325
and so you are going to . . .

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:12.930
or at least I would,

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.169
pick this one right over here.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.648
This one right over here
describes a constant rate,

00:03:16.648 --> 00:03:20.473
which is not what was
described in the question.
