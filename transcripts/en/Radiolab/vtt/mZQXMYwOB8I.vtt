00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is more perfect right now.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.490
Bossy here is working madly on a story about a supreme court case that will be

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:12.600
decided any minute to one of the most important supreme court cases this term

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.050
maybe of my lifetime, but in the meantime,

5
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:21.051
I wanted to share something with you guys as you maybe know that this podcast,

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.110
this new podcast you're listening to more perfect is radio labs first ever spin

7
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:27.360
off the episode for me,

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.820
the radio lab episode for me that inspired me to try out this whole series.

9
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:37.110
It actually goes back to 2012 it was our first time ever reporting about the

10
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:37.944
supreme court.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.760
I asked the entire team at radio lab to look at the docket for that year,

12
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:43.880
pick a case, make a few calls with sort of an [inaudible]

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.270
<v 1>bear man, reporter Tim Howard came back with the following story.</v>

14
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.950
It's about a little girl who becomes the center of a very big fight.

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.250
This is the story that got us hooked on thinking about the Supreme Court and in

16
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:03.360
many ways it inspired us to make more perfect.

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.860
Here's Tim. So I first, I first heard about this story, um,

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.230
I saw it listed on the supreme court docket for cases that they were going to be

19
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.820
hearing this spring. Well,

20
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.340
the name of the case is baby girl versus adoptive couple.

21
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.610
Actually in strict legal parlance, it's called adoptive couple v baby girl.

22
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.820
It's not a particularly catchy name. I've got to say it's a weird name though.

23
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:28.180
It's hard to, it's hard to picture. Yeah. So this is Marcia Zuck,

24
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.450
associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina and she wrote

25
00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:34.980
about this case in slate and it stood out to me because, you know,

26
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.200
it just seemed odd at first that this would even be a supreme court case.

27
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.780
It seemed more like a, a straight forward custody case. Right.

28
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.240
But when you dig in, yeah, there's a lot going on here. Crusades,

29
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.780
text messages, state law cares, children, Supreme Court,

30
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:53.540
Christopher Columbus Christian curriculum.

31
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.420
And it is not straight forward at all. Apparently not.

32
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.060
So let me walk you through it. The way that I learned about it.

33
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.940
The story begins with a couple, Matt and Melanie, capital Bianco. Um,

34
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.790
they are a couple who live down here in South Carolina.

35
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.940
He's a technician at Boeing. She's a developmental psychologist,

36
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.270
nice middle class, white couple. They're in their late thirties.

37
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.710
And you really wanted to have a kid. They had gone through, uh, you know,

38
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.140
infertility problems. It wasn't working out.

39
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.610
So eventually they decided to adopt,

40
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.200
enter a woman named Chrissy Maldonado. She lives about a thousand miles away.

41
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.480
I believe she's in Oklahoma. She's in her twenties,

42
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.620
already has a couple of kids.

43
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.730
She's pregnant and decides that she wants to give the baby up for adoption.

44
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.180
And she picks the Capitol Bianco's and everyone seems happy.

45
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.510
A Capitol Bianco's get the baby. And they name her. Veronica.

46
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.460
We used to call her boss lady. Not a lot.

47
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:48.930
Most of the time of his family called her that. Yeah,

48
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.000
Bosley nice as everybody around. This is Matt and Melanie Capobianco.

49
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.990
We're happy to do whatever she told you to do. Just, yeah,

50
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.040
the a poster child for a proud father, you know,

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.473
<v 2>but</v>

52
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.400
it's just gone as as wrong as it could have possibly gone.

53
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.670
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

54
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.240
<v 4>this is basically how it unfolded on TV news bracken session on the docket</v>

55
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:13.571
today.

56
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.740
A young child ripped from the arms of the only parents that she's ever known and

57
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.730
turned over to the native American biological father. She has never met a man.

58
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:26.080
Veronica had never even met. What happened is when Veronica was two,

59
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.900
her biological dad turned up seemingly out of nowhere,

60
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.840
and according to these clips, hadn't been around for two years,

61
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:35.950
had it been in the child, and now he's asking for custody and he gets it.

62
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.550
And the court is making them stand by and just let it happen.

63
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.500
W Y well, it's mainly because of this law. Indian Child Welfare Act,

64
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.420
the 1978 the Indian Child Welfare Act, Dustin, the dad, he's Cherokee.

65
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.890
He's a part of the Cherokee nation.

66
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.310
So that makes his daughter Veronica eligible to be Cherokee.

67
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.580
And the law is designed to keep Indian families together.

68
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.000
It gives preference to Indian kids staying with Indian parents.

69
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.960
So even though he'd actually signed papers, agreeing to the adoption,

70
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.680
he was able to invoke this law and get custody of Veronica.

71
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.390
He signed his custody away and he was able to then use his chair keenness to

72
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.360
reverse the rights. He signed away. Just hang on. All right,

73
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.030
cause all gonna make sense. Okay. But he takes the kid.

74
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.320
That's what you're saying. Yeah. New Year's Eve,

75
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.760
2011 with camera's rolling. Dustin Brown drives his pickup truck

76
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.980
<v 5>into Charleston, not in melody capital beyond go clutch to two-year-old.</v>

77
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.833
Veronica,

78
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.750
this could possibly be the last time they hold their baby as her mom and dad.

79
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.320
<v 4>Then that evening Veronica is transferred to Dustin.</v>

80
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.030
<v 5>It didn't feel like we had enough time for her to be not afraid when she would</v>

81
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.560
want to work strangers. Yet when she's, I mean to her,

82
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.080
they're complete strangers and I can't imagine that she's not going to be

83
00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:54.914
terrified.

84
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.590
<v 4>And as Dustin gets into the truck holding his two year old daughter for the</v>

85
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.750
first time, a reporter asks him,

86
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.260
<v 3>it's in her best interest.</v>

87
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.030
<v 4>And this is all you hear from.</v>

88
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.820
<v 3>I don't think so. We need to give her a thing.</v>

89
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.830
Have you ever seen the child?

90
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.190
<v 4>They declined any further comment on camera?</v>

91
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.670
He gets into the truck with Veronica and they drive away back to Oklahoma.

92
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.780
Can I do, can I ask you what, what was the,

93
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:26.910
when was the last time that you spoke with Veronica?

94
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.900
<v 2>It was the day after, um, the day after the</v>

95
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.380
transfer. Transfer. A phone call to her. Yeah,

96
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.830
we spoke to her for about two minutes. [inaudible] we uh,

97
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.890
[inaudible] I told her we loved her and she said,

98
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:51.060
I love you mommy and I love you daddy. And I don't know,

99
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.450
just a few minutes and [inaudible] but that was it.

100
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:58.040
That was the last time we were able to be in touch. And that

101
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.240
<v 1>was 16 months ago.</v>

102
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.740
And how long was Veronica with them again before this happened? About two years.

103
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.340
Oh man, that's hard. Yeah. And you know,

104
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.690
when I first heard about this case, that's basically the,

105
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.640
the only way I thought of it, you know, is just, yeah,

106
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.690
that's a crazy injustice.

107
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.040
That's basically all I saw in it. I mean,

108
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:22.880
if you're someone who has no background in this,

109
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.730
then you see a case like the baby Veronica case and you're like, whoa,

110
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.580
where's this coming from? How can this possibly be okay?

111
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.230
That's Marsha Zog again,

112
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.700
in her article for sleek kind of caught me off guard because the title was doing

113
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:35.900
what's best for the tribe.

114
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.530
Two year old Veronica was ripped from the only home she's ever known.

115
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.900
The court made the right decision. Yeah. So I called up tasker, like,

116
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:45.860
what do you mean by that?

117
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400
One of the things that's I think important to realize is that the problems that

118
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.120
equity was intended to address didn't stop happening that long ago.

119
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.140
[inaudible]

120
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.140
and this is where the story turned into the biggest rabbit hole I've ever fallen

121
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.960
into. Wait, what did she tell you? I mean,

122
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.550
Marsha basically said the only way you can begin to wrap your mind around what's

123
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:18.470
right and what's wrong in this story is to go back to the sixties.

124
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.120
Alright. How are you doing? How are you Tim?

125
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.040
Great to meet you and to this guy per Hirsch. Um, I'm a lawyer.

126
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.480
He lives in Long Island now, which is where I visited him. But in 1967,

127
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.740
the fall of 67,

128
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.220
I was on the staff of the Association on American Indian affairs,

129
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.980
sort of a legal advocacy group for American Indians.

130
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.460
And he traveled all over or working with different tribes. And um,

131
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.510
one day he gets a phone call from this guy, Louis Goodhouse,

132
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.560
the tribal chair of the devil's Lake Sioux tribe in North Dakota.

133
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.790
And this guy says, I really need your help. He said there was a child,

134
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.020
a devil's Lake Kid,

135
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:57.530
one of ours that was just abruptly taken away by social workers.

136
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.880
The Benson County,

137
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.881
North Dakota Social Services Agency came in and they took little Ivan Brown away

138
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.870
from his grandmother who was six.

139
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.160
What was their stated reason for taking a Ivan away neglect?

140
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.790
Because what? Because grandma wasn't, wasn't around. No.

141
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:20.780
Actually Burt says that the social workers were looking for that classic nuclear

142
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:24.770
family, biological mother, biological father children.

143
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.880
So when they saw him with an older relative, but no mom or dad, they thought,

144
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.040
oh, and they took them away.

145
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.990
The tribal council was extremely upset by this.

146
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.220
They wanted to fight a battle about this. Burt took the case,

147
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.210
fought it in court. We won that case. By the way, Mrs Alex Forney,

148
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:47.810
she got Ivan back after somewhat protracted battle,

149
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.560
but he began to wonder how widespread is this?

150
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.100
So from 67 to the end of 68 into 69 he tribe after

151
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.760
<v 4>tribe, after tribe doing interviews, and he says that everywhere he went,</v>

152
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.770
he would hear these stories.

153
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.610
<v 6>I remember it vividly.</v>

154
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.680
<v 5>This is Deb wells. She's a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe,</v>

155
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.280
and when she was 10 years old, a car pulled into her driveway.

156
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.300
<v 6>I'm gonna come driving in social workers and they got out of car and I told my</v>

157
00:09:16.301 --> 00:09:18.280
brothers and sisters, I said, go hike.

158
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.030
And they had to drag us out from underneath beds.

159
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.560
We got around and got in the house,

160
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.390
but then they took us to bluff and put us in a foster home.

161
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.943
It was horrible.

162
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.690
<v 5>This was just part of every native family's history. This is Marla Jean,</v>

163
00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:38.230
big boy. She grew up on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota.

164
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.610
I remember when I was young,

165
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.780
we'd go to one of the border towns and my grandma would say,

166
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.450
stay in the car. Lock yourself in.

167
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.180
Don't get out of the car and going into the trading post because they're going

168
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.720
to steal you. Yeah.

169
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.770
<v 3>What we found is that on every reservation,</v>

170
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.240
<v 7>my name is Michael Evans, no heart. I am a [inaudible].</v>

171
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.940
I Lakota from standing rock reservation.

172
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.840
<v 3>You couldn't not find a family that didn't know of a child in placement.</v>

173
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.990
<v 7>Social services came and took me and my sister and told my mother and dad that</v>

174
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.830
they were taking us into Bowbridge for physical tickets and they never let us

175
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.723
back.

176
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.120
<v 4>Wow. Michael says that his dad spent the next 30 years looking for him.</v>

177
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.810
In any case, Burt would ask these people that he was interviewing,

178
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.500
what reason did the social workers give you for taking the child?

179
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.150
And the answer is that it got ran. The gamut. Conditions of poverty, alcoholism,

180
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.830
overcrowding. Maybe they don't have adequate ventilation in the house.

181
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.940
No indoor plumbing,

182
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.210
but in most cases he says the reasons wouldn't have stood up in court.

183
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.550
They would put papers in front of them and they would sign.

184
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.850
They didn't know what they were signing. Some families, if they could,

185
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.910
they tried to fight it, but they usually couldn't afford to. Oh, look,

186
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.660
the tribal people are poor. So, uh,

187
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.730
we began to do a statistical collection of data state by state asking how many

188
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:03.570
Indian kids are in foster

189
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.700
<v 3>foster care and adoptive placement and institutional placement,</v>

190
00:11:06.701 --> 00:11:07.930
juvenile facilities.

191
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.440
<v 5>What do you arrived at at the end of that analysis is pretty shocking though.</v>

192
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.020
<v 3>[inaudible] about one third of Indian children were in out of home placements in</v>

193
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.930
non-Indian settings. Hold on one third,

194
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.740
25 to 35% of Indian children nationwide.

195
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.720
We're in out of home placement

196
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.160
<v 4>it. That's a real number. That is the real number.</v>

197
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:33.290
That's the number you see cited again and again.

198
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.710
<v 3>Nobody connected the dots.</v>

199
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.100
Everybody thought that it was their own personal tragedy.

200
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.440
Nobody realized that this was a pattern and a practice that was decimating these

201
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.633
tribes. Wait a second.

202
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.510
<v 4>How would this happen on this scale? I mean like would this,</v>

203
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.280
is this shit bunch of social workers making

204
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.120
<v 1>the same decision independently or is it like a policy? Well,</v>

205
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.650
this is basically social workers very much acting in the spirit of the day

206
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.800
because you have to keep in mind that in the fifties and sixties

207
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.420
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

208
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.650
<v 4>you have all these government policies that are put in place whose entire</v>

209
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:16.450
purpose is basically to try to once and for all solve this Indian problem that's

210
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:17.440
gone on and on.

211
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.460
You've got this guy in 1953 he was a senator from Utah who starts basically

212
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.600
trying to terminate the tribes. You mean like take away their sovereignty? Yeah,

213
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.080
he goes tribe to tribe trying to convince them or force them.

214
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.390
Tell them they have no, there's no way out of it.

215
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.920
He argues that this will be best for all of them. I remember this.

216
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:40.921
This was like out of e pluribus unum like to integrate them into the whole,

217
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.310
they will melt into the wider culture. That's what will save them.

218
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.450
Part of this was part of the social workers that were working in this period.

219
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.930
They were working under the auspices of this thing called the Indian adoption

220
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:53.764
project,

221
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.660
which was very much about that idea of like you take these kids from their poor

222
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:03.010
conditions and you connect them directly to white families that are looking to

223
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:06.090
adopt. So part of this was definitely top-down, very much.

224
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:08.603
<v 1>In any case,</v>

225
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.790
the end result of this is that a third of these kids are being taken away.

226
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.780
There were literally communities where there were no children.

227
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.550
That's Terry Cross.

228
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.990
He's the executive director of the National Indian Child Welfare Association in

229
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:25.740
Minnesota. There were communities where there were no children in Alaska.

230
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.140
There were communities where there were no children. I mean, what is,

231
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.540
what does the culture, except you know,

232
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:36.070
the ideas and traditions that you pass onto your kids? That's Marcia Zog. Again,

233
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.950
if you are hemorrhaging your children, then you're going to disappear. So what,

234
00:13:40.951 --> 00:13:45.010
what do you do? Well, it's too massive a problem if you're trying to fight, uh,

235
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.680
all these removals of kids on a case by case basis.

236
00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:50.900
Forget about it on national laws needed.

237
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.530
So Burt spent years walking the halls of Congress,

238
00:13:54.531 --> 00:13:58.700
literally endless lobbying, congressional hearings until finally,

239
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.850
the Indian Child Welfare Act is passed by Congress in 1978. So it does a lot.

240
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:07.690
But basically when it comes to adoptions, the ECO has placement preferences.

241
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.290
So the first preference would be with the immediate family.

242
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.810
So you're removed from mom, you're placed with dad,

243
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.270
or maybe with grandmother if they say no.

244
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.000
Second preference would be someone else in the tribe.

245
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:24.160
And the third a is any other American Indian. Wow. Any other, yeah.

246
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.430
And then after that, uh, then the child can be placed with, you know,

247
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.510
another family. Well,

248
00:14:30.511 --> 00:14:34.070
so if you're white and you're trying to adopt an Indian kid, you,

249
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.320
you have a lot of roadblocks. Yes. But by and large,

250
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.800
most of us think that equals probably the,

251
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.220
the best federal Indian law ever passed.

252
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.760
It did the most to help Indian tribes respect tribal sovereignty and really

253
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:54.840
fulfill the United States as trust relationship, uh,

254
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.240
with American Indian people. But now because of this case,

255
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:01.720
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

256
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.070
<v 1>that law may be in jeopardy.</v>

257
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.350
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

258
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.550
<v 1>we'll continue in a moment.</v>

259
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.443
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

260
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.873
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

261
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.700
<v 5>Hey, party people is your girl Phoebe Robinson.</v>

262
00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:24.520
And I'm chilling with my girl Alana glaze. Uh,

263
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.660
what up potheads we're back with season three of our hip hop casts zone.

264
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.760
Many white guys from w NYC studios.

265
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.320
And each week I interview some of the biggest pop culture icons at Oh yeah,

266
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.920
they aren't straight white dudes. Yes. They get plenty of attention already.

267
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.610
This season I'm coming at you with cannot miss conversations from people like

268
00:15:42.611 --> 00:15:46.810
black lives matter activist Deray McKesson, famous feminist, Gloria Steinem,

269
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:51.190
and queen of all Queens aqua feed her. I love all of them.

270
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.880
There's a lot of love on this podcast. So scratch is so many white guys.

271
00:15:54.881 --> 00:15:57.670
Wherever you get your podcasts. Love you mean it. Why Keye

272
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.200
<v 1>I'm Jad Abumrad this is more perfect. We're in the middle of a story that was,</v>

273
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.820
uh, our first attempt at Supreme Court reporting and uh,

274
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.040
it comes from reporter Tim Howard back to him.

275
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.850
<v 5>So in April we went to this conference in Tulsa, the board directors,</v>

276
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.150
council of elders, big room. There were 700 people there.

277
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.820
Most of them work in child welfare organizations,

278
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.330
in Indian communities around the country. [inaudible] native communities.

279
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.470
There was some traditional Cherokee drumming films, workshops,

280
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.070
and all anybody could talk about was this case

281
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.460
<v 12>Baker now and how the Baby Veronica case may affect the Indian Child Welfare</v>

282
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.230
Act. So please,

283
00:16:46.231 --> 00:16:51.030
please do keep maybe Veronica and her family in your prayers.

284
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.080
<v 5>Everybody was on edge. Well, I'm really worried I'm in this situation.</v>

285
00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.220
This is Terry Cross again and he's one of the organizers. And he told me that,

286
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.580
look, the couple Bianco's I feel for them,

287
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:08.850
but in what world is it okay for one family who feels they were damaged by a law

288
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:15.510
to put thousands of other children at jeopardy for their own hurt?

289
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.480
I can't imagine a world where that's okay.

290
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.410
<v 1>Well, I mean it's hard for us to say that because you know,</v>

291
00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:28.890
that's not what motivated us, our daughters, what's motivating us.

292
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.870
W how we feel. We just feel that.

293
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.460
And in this case it was a beautiful law that was put into place to prevent the

294
00:17:35.461 --> 00:17:39.480
breakup of paying Hamleys Indian families. And, um,

295
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.310
I just think it wasn't really supposed to be applied to a situation like ours.

296
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.540
They say, um, but we get that there's a huge historical wrong here,

297
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.010
but does that have to do with

298
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.210
<v 4>us? Reminds me of, uh, arguments that happen over affirmative action weirdly.</v>

299
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.840
Definitely. But here are, the details are, are so different. You know,

300
00:17:57.841 --> 00:18:02.640
they say this is a law that was created to protect Indian families, right?

301
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.330
But here you've got a Hispanic birth mom, you've got a white couple,

302
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:08.010
and then you've got a dad who's out of the picture.

303
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:10.860
So you're not actually protecting an Indian family,

304
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:14.010
your forcibly creating a new one. Absolutely.

305
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.400
And in the process you're breaking up a loving home and I don't think that was

306
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.400
the intent of the law ever. [inaudible] my personal opinion is that,

307
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.330
uh, Ecuador has outlived its usefulness and causes more problems than it solves.

308
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.040
This is mark fiddler.

309
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.640
I'm one of the attorneys for Matt and Melanie Capital Bianco.

310
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.040
He also happens to be native American himself.

311
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.400
I'm an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians.

312
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:42.120
That's a reservation up in North Dakota, right on the border with Canada,

313
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.480
you know, so I kind of had a foot in two cultures, so to speak.

314
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.990
I go back to the Raz in the summer and mark actually used to argue the other

315
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:53.100
side that the most important thing was to keep Indian families together.

316
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.930
And that Indian kids who are placed in non-Indian homes would experience

317
00:18:57.931 --> 00:19:01.470
emotional, psychological harm by being raised outside of the culture.

318
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.930
But then I had a case and um, I think it was 94 which gave him pause.

319
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.690
Uh, boy, that's a good word.

320
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.950
It was a case in which this young American Indian girl, uh,

321
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:18.750
Sierra wanted to be adopted by this white couple and mark opposed it,

322
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.190
even though on my heart hurts,

323
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:24.330
I knew that was probably not the right thing for the child.

324
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.680
He won the case. She was removed from the couple's home. And um,

325
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.170
Sierra would tell you herself, she had a shit or really rough life.

326
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.570
She bounced in and out of more than 20 foster homes, ran away many,

327
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:42.660
many times and got into serious trouble with the law.

328
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.700
And it always nagged me. Mark says, even though the tribes have suffered,

329
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.060
that doesn't change the fact that if you take a kid out of a loving home,

330
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.100
you're going to cause her real harm.

331
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.030
And he says that's why he took this case because the couple Bianco's you know

332
00:19:57.031 --> 00:20:00.930
they are among the most loving people I know.

333
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.320
He said they did everything you could ask. They're just amazing people.

334
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.470
They met the birth mother, Christine Maldonado, when she was pregnant,

335
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.150
they got to know her. She felt a connection to them. That's Laurie. Miguel's,

336
00:20:12.151 --> 00:20:14.190
she's represented Christie's since last year.

337
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.960
And they were also willing to have an open adoption. Yeah,

338
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.450
we still have a relationship with Christie. We, we love it to death.

339
00:20:21.451 --> 00:20:23.130
And Kristie gave birth to Veronica.

340
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.840
They were there with her in the delivery room. I mean, the day she was born,

341
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:32.010
I cut the cord. Matt Capobianco cut the umbilical cord.

342
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.490
So that's such a degree of intimacy that I,

343
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.250
I haven't given birth twice myself.

344
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.870
The idea that anyone other than my husband would be in the room is kind of

345
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:46.860
scary. But it gives you some idea of how she felt about the cup of Bianco's.

346
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.290
Now as for Dustin Brown, Veronica, his biological dad,

347
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.600
a couple months before she was born, Christy,

348
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:56.680
the birth mom sent him a text message asking him if he wants to pay child

349
00:20:56.681 --> 00:21:00.820
support or he wants to waive his rights. And he replied,

350
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.840
I'll waive my rights rather than pay a dime in child support.

351
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.320
Well, there's a contrast.

352
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.230
So in the beginning it sounds like he did not want to be a dad. Yeah.

353
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:12.670
And then actually a few months later,

354
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.590
he seems to make it even more official by signing a form,

355
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.400
agreeing to the adoption, and then he changes his mind. Yeah. You know, and,

356
00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.160
and obviously I was wondering what was he thinking?

357
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.370
Because you can't avoid the fact that how you feel about this guy is going to

358
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.410
influence how you feel about this law. Yeah.

359
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:36.270
And so I was trying to get in touch with him. I was pestering his lawyers. Um,

360
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.150
you know, will he do an interview? This went on for weeks and,

361
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.780
and they were basically like, he doesn't want to do interviews.

362
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.830
He doesn't want to talk. Yeah. Yeah. He so you didn't get him.

363
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.793
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

364
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.360
<v 4>Yeah. I got it. Good.</v>

365
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.160
So shortly before we were going to wrap this story,

366
00:21:56.161 --> 00:21:59.730
I get an email saying come to Oklahoma when

367
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.740
he lives in this one story house on this treeline block in a small town north of

368
00:22:07.741 --> 00:22:12.720
Tulsa. Hey, how's it going? How are we doing? Good. Okay.

369
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.280
Are we done? What does it look like? He's just a very normal looking guy.

370
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.270
A little bit of an army haircut. That's real.

371
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.000
He had a stash that night when he got Veronica, but he's clean shaven now.

372
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.590
Big Smile. So anyway, we go inside and the first thing he tells me

373
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.380
is that Veronica is not there.

374
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.280
Excited to meet her or as it says she was out with his wife.

375
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.290
Robyn goes out with my wife, turns out he's remarried in any case to assist us.

376
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.440
Alright. We sat down at the kitchen table and started talking.

377
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.070
Do you want to just,

378
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.200
do you mind introducing yourself and telling me like where we are?

379
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.660
I'm Dustin Brown. Um, we're, I no one Oklahoma, this is my house. Um,

380
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:53.970
um, part of the wolf clan,

381
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.240
Wolf clan is one of the seven Cherokee clans and my name Dustin Mades,

382
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.630
brave warrior and a Cherokee and actually, you know,

383
00:23:03.631 --> 00:23:08.220
join the army up and go over to Iraq. I'm like, wow, I'm here for the Cherokees.

384
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.970
I'm the brave warrior out in, you know, desert.

385
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.360
He's been a registered members since he was a little kid.

386
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.410
His parents were members and their parents and he said he's proud to be Cherokee

387
00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:23.760
basically because it means that he's from where he lives. It's a big deal to me.

388
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.350
So anyway, we started talking about the case and you know, it gets complicated.

389
00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:30.540
There's a lot of detail. I'm not going to go into all of it,

390
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.630
but basically he and Christie Maldonado, the birth mom,

391
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.220
we've known each other since we were 16. We've dated off and on through 2008,

392
00:23:38.221 --> 00:23:40.860
he joins the army basic training. He lives on a base.

393
00:23:40.861 --> 00:23:44.940
It's four hours away or south of Christmas time that year.

394
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.490
He basically says, let's get serious. Got down on one knee and proposed to her,

395
00:23:50.491 --> 00:23:55.260
said, hey, I want to bring you into my life. She said, okay, that's just great.

396
00:23:55.530 --> 00:24:00.450
And almost a month later she'd send me a message saying that she was pregnant

397
00:24:00.451 --> 00:24:04.770
and I was excited. I mean, I have children,

398
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.950
but her was, I was one of the things I wanted at that time.

399
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.790
Told her I can move you in your kids up to the base.

400
00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.690
Housing was going to be free on base. There was schools for her kids,

401
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.040
she could get a job right there on base, you know, everything was taken care of.

402
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.720
I mean everything was going great, you know,

403
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.100
and then pretty quickly the whole thing just soured.

404
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.530
It's impossible to know exactly what happened.

405
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:31.640
But Christy says that Dustin just simply didn't offer any support.

406
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.150
He says that he did here. He tried to at least,

407
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.670
but shortly after she got pregnant, she basically just shut him out,

408
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.530
just stop taking his calls. I didn't get no phone calls, no text messages,

409
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.900
none from rather blue. And I'm just like, well, what's going on?

410
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.040
And he says that he tried to get in touch with her detection,

411
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.030
trying to call her. You're still no answer. Uh,

412
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.630
there's a couple of times that I've went back to the bars. I went to her house,

413
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.800
drove those four hours from the base, knocked on a door. I could hear, you know,

414
00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:01.220
voices in the house. It sounded like her and the kids,

415
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:04.700
they wouldn't answer the door for me. And then one day he says,

416
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.720
she sent me a message saying, I don't want to be with you no more.

417
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:13.400
In three weeks after that, she's like, well, I want you to sign your rights over

418
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.700
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

419
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.480
<v 4>his parental rights. Would you sign your rights over? You guys are texting this,</v>

420
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.970
are you talking? Oh,

421
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.550
the whole time we're text messaging this because she wouldn't talk to me.

422
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.580
And what did you think it meant to me? How does that,

423
00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:31.580
she wanted me to sign my rights over her and I'm like,

424
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.700
this something I really don't want to do. He says,

425
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.710
she kept texting him that question and looming in his mind was the fact that

426
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.850
he'd just learned that we were going to be going to Iraq to do a radar mission.

427
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:47.270
So he starts to wonder, what's the right thing to do here? You know,

428
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.430
there was one chances I wasn't gonna come back.

429
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:53.150
I wanted to make the right choice and let the mother be that sole parent and he

430
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:56.390
says that he's holding out hope that if he does make it back,

431
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.480
we'll get back together and she'll just change your mind. Finally,

432
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:03.740
I just told her, I was like, all right, I'll sign my rights over months go by.

433
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.060
Christie has the baby,

434
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.570
he says he doesn't know exactly when because they weren't speaking.

435
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.880
But then six days before I had to go deploy to Iraq,

436
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:18.580
I get a phone call from some guy in Washington county. The process server said,

437
00:26:18.581 --> 00:26:22.680
hey, we need you to sign some papers, so sign your custody rights over nick.

438
00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:24.950
I directed him to an office right near the base.

439
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.490
We went there and signed the paper.

440
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.420
And what did you think it meant the whole time? I thought I was just, you know,

441
00:26:31.421 --> 00:26:34.150
the paperwork for me signing custody rights to her,

442
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.180
but when I got done sign, the guy said,

443
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.240
you just signed your rights away and instead of the biological mother,

444
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.860
the baby's been up for adoption.

445
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.040
She'd been living in South Carolina for four months.

446
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.120
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

447
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.870
<v 5>Dustin says,</v>

448
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.230
this is the first moment that he realized what was actually happening,

449
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.150
that the baby was up for adoption and he says that he had no idea he had just

450
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:58.440
legally consented to it.

451
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.650
I should've had a lawyer there with me at that point in time.

452
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:02.760
I grabbed the paper

453
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.200
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

454
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.220
<v 5>when the guy looked at me and said, if you go on, rip that up. He said, it's,</v>

455
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.500
you can, it's not good to do that. That he could be arrested. And I said,

456
00:27:12.501 --> 00:27:16.020
what do I got to do? He said, you get a lawyer,

457
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.760
which he immediately did.

458
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.140
And that's why the courts have ruled in his favor because they say that from

459
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:26.460
that moment, he's clearly demonstrated that he wants to be her dad. I mean,

460
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:31.360
I never, never once did I want to give up on my daughter. Never wants to,

461
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.950
I didn't want to give her up. I mean, everybody says that I gave her up.

462
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.380
I never wanted to. Now mark and Laurie say that if this were any other guy,

463
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.060
any other man of any other race, the story would be over right about here.

464
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.953
It's too late.

465
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.950
He wouldn't have any rights at all under every state's laws too late under the

466
00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:54.840
federal constitution. Too late. He rejected that opportunity to become a father.

467
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:59.390
But he has one thing in his favor, says, Lord, he happens to be [inaudible]

468
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.470
<v 4>Cherokee. And because of that fact,</v>

469
00:28:02.471 --> 00:28:04.960
not only can this sort of man object,

470
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.300
but he gets an automatic transfer of custody to him. And Mark and Laura,

471
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:13.690
you see that as basically the worst kind of preferential treatment and that is

472
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.840
unbelievable. This is John John Nichols.

473
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:21.040
This is Shannon Shannon Jones and the two of Dustin's lawyers. And John says,

474
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.730
okay, there's preferential treatment. Fine, but,

475
00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.770
but think about why all the protections of equal are there.

476
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.800
These roadblocks are there for a reason. We went over this earlier,

477
00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:32.920
but you know, basically people are being manipulated out of their kids.

478
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.220
And while you might like to think that that's ancient history.

479
00:28:36.221 --> 00:28:41.221
Now fast forward to 2010 he says the same thing is happening in this case and we

480
00:28:41.531 --> 00:28:44.830
have a registered member of the Cherokee nation.

481
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.160
We have his child being given up for adoption without his knowledge and without

482
00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:51.700
his consent.

483
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.840
And they kept this adoption from him for months and then spring it on him six

484
00:28:55.841 --> 00:28:58.190
days before he leaves the country. It,

485
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.230
it looks to us like it was engineered to make sure he got served,

486
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.230
but not in enough time to where he could put up a fight.

487
00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.670
I believe it was absolutely intentional and Shannon suggests that they knew

488
00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:13.210
about Equa, they knew it would apply and they were trying to sidestep.

489
00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:17.670
There were so many errors. You just did a little air quotes on errors. Yeah,

490
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.660
I did. Because I mean like for example,

491
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.800
there's this one important forum where Shannon says that they went out of their

492
00:29:23.801 --> 00:29:27.820
way to make it look like Veronica is not native Americans.

493
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.970
Cause it would be detrimental to the adoption. That's just, um,

494
00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.830
it's a preposterous argument.

495
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.730
You know the form mark and lawyers say the reason that nobody puts Cherokee and

496
00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:41.170
big bright flaming letters is simple. Christie herself is predominantly,

497
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.140
Dustin is predominantly Caucasian and is approximately 2% Cherokee.

498
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.170
What did you say? 2% yeah.

499
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.970
Veronica herself would be a little bit over one person. Wait,

500
00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:59.050
this whole thing is happening because he's only 2% I feel like that changes

501
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:00.190
things somehow. Well, yeah,

502
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:03.850
but you have to keep in mind that Cherokee nation doesn't care about the

503
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.500
percentage of Cherokee in your blood.

504
00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:07.090
That's not how they determine their members.

505
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.180
<v 16>Being a member of the Cherokee nation is like being a member of the United</v>

506
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.800
States. You are a citizen of the nation.

507
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.160
<v 4>You know, if, if your parents a US citizen, you're automatically a citizen.</v>

508
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.400
That's Chrissy Nimo, assistant attorney general for Cherokee nation.

509
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.230
If your parents a Cherokee citizen, you're not automatically a citizen,

510
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:29.450
but you can automatically apply. So it's based on direct lineage.

511
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.290
But still, you're right,

512
00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:35.310
because this is the argument that is most troubling to the tribes.

513
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.710
Both Chrissy Nimo and marsh [inaudible] told me that if the supreme court ends

514
00:30:40.711 --> 00:30:45.540
up deciding that Equa is unconstitutional because it really is rice-based

515
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.880
unconstitutional because it's a race based preference.

516
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:52.910
It calls into question every single federal Indian law out there goes Indian

517
00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:57.690
law. This is a case that they could use to do that.

518
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.620
<v 15>Mm.</v>

519
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.880
<v 4>If equal falls because it's unconstitutional,</v>

520
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.100
it could have a crazy domino effect.

521
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:11.550
Every single federal Indian law is premised on giving some sort of special

522
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:12.940
treatment to Indians.

523
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.220
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

524
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.670
<v 4>what would that mean concretely if Indian law were to go away?</v>

525
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.090
It means that they are policing their court system, their education,

526
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.080
anything they do as a sovereign nation, all of that just evaporates. Eh,

527
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:29.921
you know, like a,

528
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:34.921
a tribe would just become another group of people on some land

529
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.280
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

530
00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.020
<v 4>that said, this is not the likely outcome.</v>

531
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:47.740
Now the supreme court will probably rule as narrowly as they possibly can and as

532
00:31:48.861 --> 00:31:50.150
far as the tribes are concerned,

533
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.590
they can do a lot of damage to the law without calling it unconstitutional.

534
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:59.210
You know, they could allow for this certain kind of exception to Iqua,

535
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.650
which would make it a lot easier for people like the capital Bianco's to adopt.

536
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.990
So they could rule any number of ways. Yeah,

537
00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:10.850
and the thing is that it's all strangely connected to this.

538
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.450
I figured three year old girl and holds onto this.

539
00:32:14.451 --> 00:32:17.930
I'm thinking I'm just gonna sign custody rights over. So when,

540
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.490
when she finally showed up halfway through my interview, right.

541
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:24.290
<v 16>Dustin? Hello. Hi.</v>

542
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:29.000
It was kind of surreal daughter Ronica though.

543
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.220
Hey Veronica, I'm Tim.

544
00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.560
<v 4>She's got dark curly hair. She's this ball of energy.</v>

545
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.940
She's definitely bullheaded.

546
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.080
<v 5>And within a minute she's given me a tour of every single object in her room.</v>

547
00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:51.240
Yes. I mean everything. I'm the bear army bear.

548
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.170
I don't want to carry dog tags on it. She was a very,

549
00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.720
I'm a very proud, cool hosts.

550
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.500
A few minutes later, if she wanted to show me her geese,

551
00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.790
I don't think I've seen geese in a long time. What can tell me about it too?

552
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.950
Those are, those are real [inaudible]. Yeah,

553
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.033
<v 17>correct.</v>

554
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.220
<v 5>She feeds them out of her hand.</v>

555
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.610
<v 17>Nope. Nope. Don't mess with that water.</v>

556
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.023
<v 5>Maybe</v>

557
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:33.630
Thomas the train. Yeah. So, uh, what, what could happen to her?

558
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.390
Are they eating? Well, if the Supreme Court said

559
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.760
Grant Dustin Brown shouldn't have qualified, um, as father under equity,

560
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:45.780
what they do is they would send it back down to a South Carolina court and then

561
00:33:45.781 --> 00:33:49.260
they would have this new best interest evaluation basically.

562
00:33:49.261 --> 00:33:51.990
Like what's the best thing for her at this point?

563
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.380
She's been with him now for about a year and a half.

564
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:59.310
And so that actually might really change the calculation,

565
00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:03.030
you know,

566
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:08.030
and I want to try honestly hanging out with her and Dustin in the backyard.

567
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:16.550
It's really easy to forget all these people whose lives are just completely

568
00:34:18.001 --> 00:34:21.090
tangled up in this scene. But who aren't there?

569
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.470
Christie Maldonado, the birth mom, she did not intend to get Veronica.

570
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.960
She intended to give Veronica a life. Matt and Melanie Capobianco. I mean,

571
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:33.040
this has been going on for so long.

572
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.260
We'd kind of been in a holding pattern for like, well forever.

573
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.830
We're just waiting and waiting and waiting. And of course the,

574
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.980
the hundreds of tribes who are just worried about their own kids.

575
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.960
<v 16>Pretty cool. Are you a good swimmer? Yes. Hi Dad.</v>

576
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.930
Smeller I'm a bad swimmer.

577
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.470
Simmer. No, I'm a pretty bad swimmer. No,

578
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:05.300
you're not your dad's name or how do you know I'm a good swimmer?

579
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:11.230
Dad's Manet. Your Dad's mailer. Well,

580
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.260
I appreciate that.

581
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.900
<v 5>Yeah. The secret.</v>

582
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.870
So the Supreme Court came to a decision on this ruling about a month after we

583
00:35:21.871 --> 00:35:24.780
first aired this podcast and here's what they said.

584
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.510
<v 4>Okay. So, uh, the supreme court ruled five,</v>

585
00:35:28.511 --> 00:35:31.510
four in favor of the adoptive couple,

586
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.650
which is to say against the birth father to Dustin Brown. The Dad lost, right?

587
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.330
It was like a 60 ruling

588
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:43.390
<v 18>and not being totally confident with all the ramifications where I just made</v>

589
00:35:44.301 --> 00:35:45.134
some calls.

590
00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.203
<v 19>Hi, how are you?</v>

591
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.690
<v 4>I'm doing great. How are you [inaudible] for example, I skyped with Marsha Zog,</v>

592
00:35:53.691 --> 00:35:55.230
who you remember from the piece.

593
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.820
She's a law professor at the University of South Carolina.

594
00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.520
Can you walk me through what this opinion means?

595
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.090
<v 19>Well in terms of Veronica's placement,</v>

596
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.990
had it come out the other way, then it would be over.

597
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.680
She would stay with Dustin Brown, her biological father, end of story.

598
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.170
What we have now is the court upholding the termination of his parental rights.

599
00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.870
<v 4>So basically the supreme court ruled that Dustin Brown shouldn't have been</v>

600
00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:26.860
allowed to invoke the Indian child welfare act because he didn't have what's

601
00:36:26.861 --> 00:36:31.660
called continuing custody of Veronica continuing custody. Right.

602
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:36.220
They argue that this is about preventing the breakup of Indian families and

603
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.490
there was no Indian family here because they didn't live together.

604
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.400
The Dad and the daughter didn't lived, right. Yeah.

605
00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.290
So they don't scrap the Indian Child Welfare Act.

606
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.710
They just say that it shouldn't apply in a case like this. So basically,

607
00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.110
according to Tim, it was a pretty narrow ruling.

608
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:55.460
What then happened is that the supreme court kicked the case down to a lower

609
00:36:55.461 --> 00:37:00.170
court in South Carolina and that lower court ultimately awarded custody of

610
00:37:00.171 --> 00:37:04.280
Veronica to the Kappa Bianco's. Dustin Brown tried to fight it.

611
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.610
There were lots of lawsuits flying back and forth in both directions,

612
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.650
but in the end, Veronica did end up going to the Campo Bianco's.

613
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.210
<v 20>Then two and a half weeks since our daughter, Veronica [inaudible],</v>

614
00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:18.770
Matt Millichap Bianca,

615
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.160
<v 4>and on October 10th, 2013 Dustin Brown called depress comp.</v>

616
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.460
<v 20>It was the love for my daughter that kept me going all this time,</v>

617
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:28.230
but it's not.

618
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:33.230
It was also the love from my daughter did that finally gave me the strength to

619
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:38.400
accept things that are beyond my control.

620
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:45.150
The time has come for me to let Veronica live in normal childhood.

621
00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.410
It was so desperately needed and deserves.

622
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.310
<v 4>Dustin Brown then announced that he would be stopping his custody battle.</v>

623
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.070
<v 20>That's good. And to Veronica, one day,</v>

624
00:37:56.071 --> 00:38:01.020
you will read about this time in your life. Never, ever,

625
00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:02.730
ever for one second.

626
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.150
[inaudible] never ever for one second. Now how much I love you

627
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.820
[inaudible]. How hard I fought for you. How much do you mean doing

628
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.603
[inaudible]?

629
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:41.100
<v 15>My home will always be your home. I'm always welcome in it.</v>

630
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:53.740
<v 20>[inaudible]</v>

631
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.990
<v 15>I miss you more than words can express.</v>

632
00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.413
<v 20>Yeah,</v>

633
00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.390
<v 15>there will always be my little girl,</v>

634
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:04.380
my princess and I will always love you until the day I die.

635
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.760
<v 21>One more thing in our story,</v>

636
00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:18.840
we talked a lot about the possibility,

637
00:39:18.841 --> 00:39:22.510
sort of the larger possibility that from the tribe's perspective this case could

638
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:27.511
be used as a first step to basically declare Indian law as a race based

639
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:31.084
situation that

640
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:35.380
<v 4>could then be negated. That didn't happen in this case,</v>

641
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.060
but there is this sense that they, they kind of planted a seed.

642
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.270
For example, Justice Alito who wrote the ruling,

643
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:48.100
he starts it off with mention of Veronica being, you know,

644
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:50.280
a 1.2% Cherokee. Hmm.

645
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.570
Which is interesting cause it sounds like he's about to make an argument for why

646
00:39:55.571 --> 00:39:59.770
this is a race-based preference and why it's a violation of equal protection.

647
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.100
But then he doesn't make that argument. He pulls back according to Tim.

648
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:06.670
And so the question is why did he start the ruling that way?

649
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:08.890
Was he trying to send a message of some kind?

650
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.620
I asked Marsha what she thought about it.

651
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.020
Why do you think they started it off that way?

652
00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.630
<v 19>I have been thinking about that. Um, [inaudible]</v>

653
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:21.960
it clearly

654
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.280
sat wrong with at least some members of the court.

655
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:28.950
I mean when listening to the oral arguments, you could tell that, you know,

656
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.870
Robert's harped on it as well.

657
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.970
I think it's an indication that at least some members of the court have serious

658
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:41.120
reservations about Indian law because they just don't see Veronica as an Indian

659
00:40:41.551 --> 00:40:43.290
child. To them,

660
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.640
a Indian is a race and she doesn't have enough blood to be of that race.

661
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.700
And I would say so possible indication of where future Indian law cases are

662
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.003
going to go.

663
00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.753
<v 15>No.</v>

664
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:06.990
[inaudible]

665
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.823
<v 0>since then,</v>

666
00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:11.520
the supreme court has seen a handful of Indian law cases and the biggest

667
00:41:11.521 --> 00:41:15.690
development so far is that the bureau of Indian affairs and the federal

668
00:41:15.691 --> 00:41:20.691
government have changed the rules surrounding the Indian Child Welfare Act or

669
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.810
thereabout. You, the new rule changes are gonna go into effect December, 2016.

670
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:28.470
What it will mean is that when a child like Veronica is put up for adoption,

671
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.740
the state would have to ask whether or not she was an Indian child.

672
00:41:31.741 --> 00:41:35.390
The father would have to been asked whether or not she was an Indian child and

673
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:39.530
the state would not be able to consider what percentage Indian blood she has in

674
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:41.510
determining if she is an Indian child.

675
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.440
Obviously the hope is that future Veronica's will not have to go through what

676
00:41:47.481 --> 00:41:52.160
this Veronica went through, but we'll see. Huge thanks to Tim Howard,
