&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.090
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
[Inaudible] it will be.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.390
I'm Lee Ann Potter.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.320
I direct educational
outreach here at the Library,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.080
and it is really a
joy to welcome you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.150
to this evening's poetry
reading, and conversation.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.870
And if it goes anywhere
as well as our meeting

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.740
with ththis program features
young people and poetry,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.240
which means it's
going to be fun,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160
and it's going to
be interesting.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.270
And so naturally the -- I
can say this in this company,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.190
the most fun and interesting
divisions in the Library

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.690
of Congress are responsible
for this program tonight.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.050
[Laughter] It's not being
recorded; nobody's going

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.350
to like get mad at me.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.720
And that is the Library's
Young Readers Center,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.300
which is part of my division.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.930
Not only is it a very
special place in the Library

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.360
for young people,
but it is also part

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.410
of a much larger
educational effort

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.930
to engage audiences
with the Library.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.430
And this evening is also brought
to you by the library's Poetry

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.570
and Literature Center.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.680
And my colleague, Robert
Casper, would be here,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.810
but he's on travel in Kentucky

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.240
with the current
US Poet Laureate.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.760
So I'm going to say a
little word about that.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.780
The Poetry and Literature Center
is home to the US Poet Laureate.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.800
And our current Poet
Laureate, Tracy K. Smith,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.350

Thursday, April 19th.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.550

In 20Mayor's Office,

to artistic excellence,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.610
and to civic engagement, youth
leadership, and social justice.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.330
The National Youth Poet Laureate
Program works in collaboration

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.140
with local youth literary
arts organizations

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.390
across the country,
and is championed

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.490
by our nation's leading
literary organizations

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.560

Now, to kick off our program,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.370
[pounding sounds] we have
a very special guest,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.210
who is fun and interesting, too.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.540
[Laughter] She is our
current national ambassador

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.330

how is that, Jacqueline Woodson;

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.070
I get to introduce her.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.330

Newbery Honor Medalist,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.050
And her platform as our
national ambassador is

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.150
"Reading = Hope x Change
(What is Your equation?)."

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.660
She is encouraging young
people to think about,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.540
and think beyond the
moment they are living in,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.390
the power they possess, and the
impact that reading can have

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.290
on showing them ways in which
they can create the hope

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.120
and the change they want
to see in this world.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.510
Please join me in
welcoming Jacqueline Woodson

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.040

&gt;&gt; Jacqueline Woodson:
I threw on my Ascot

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.480
because I forgot my medal.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.880
[Laughter] They're sending
it to me so I can have it

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.030
for tomorrow's ceremony.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.150
And I'm bummed I don't
have it for tonight;

but I'm so grateful to be here.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.480
I'm so grateful to be back

new Poet Laureate finalist.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.270
This is so exciting, especially
coming off of yesterday

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.100
and the walkout, and the
power young people have

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.400
to change the world.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.310
So thank you, thank

And she's so phenomenal.

And I love that she's
wearing my sorority colors.

&gt;&gt; Amanda Gorman:
I'm sorry, you all,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.090
I thought that was going

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.590
[Laughter] Thank you
so much for having me.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.930
It's always a pleasure to
return to this Library,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.690
which is my favorite, to speak
alongside Jacqueline Woodson,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.650
who's just a queen, a hero,
all of the above and more;

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.030
and also to welcome
our five finalists

So I'm going to read two
poems for the occasion,

and then I'll bring up
our amazing finalists,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.120
who I know you would
love to meet.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.290
And I'm going to start with
a piece called "Waiting

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.330
with the Gourd Moon",
that I wrote as a coda

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.510
to Black History Month
for the New York Times.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.550
[ Paper Sounds ]

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.280
"'Waiting with the Gourd Moon.'

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.150
I dream of the world in
its existence before me.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.850
I am child shrinking
to white fetus,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.930
then minimized to a grain.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.260
Then I fold into nothingness.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.150
And in this form, I lightly
trace the scars [inaudible]

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.370
scraped into the god blue
back of the Atlantic,

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.040
until I find myself sitting
between a brown elder's legs,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.400
while he tosses tails
up to a gourd moon.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.630
Market women [inaudible]
to a blossoming sun.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.350
We stomp the ground
to night palpitations

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:53.100
from heavy height skid drums as
[inaudible] a plum purple sky.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.180
The majesty of a village settles
upon me like the dust of stars.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.630
I sing out for my ancestors,
not knowing their names.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.750
I cry for them not
knowing the losses.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.380
I dream of them not
knowing if they dream of me.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.380
I inhale them, the
beads making the necks,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.570
the vases crowning the skulls,
lips sliding open and welcome.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.880
My sisters, I call to you.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.410
My brothers, I ask of you,
toss your stories at me.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.260
Fling your love to me
with upturned lips.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.980
Let me walk with you.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.460
Let me talk with you.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.380
Let me watch when you laugh.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.420
Hang back your head face
stretching up to the clouds

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.540
as if you're eating
the sweetest sunset.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.810
Let me hear the brown grass sing
below while flames leap high.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.890
Let me dance, dance with you
until the music cracks us

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.880
out of our bodies like nuts.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.540
I want to come home to you, you
who sketch ancient brown rhythms

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.510
in my chest, you who drag
hieroglyphs with your feet

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.240
and milk sands you,
who resurrect houses

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.910
and pharaohs while your
voice climbs the silver rungs

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.180
of stars, you who wind
the Nile around my wrists

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.980
and stretch my smile wide as
the Sahara, you who hum heritage

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.920
with the womb of flesh within
you, you who open your palm

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.580
like buckets, waiting
tenderly to receive me.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:20.510
I am co, and we will be reborn
into a world without change,

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.260
where redemption is
greater than Emancipation,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.530
where [inaudible] both
plump fruits swelling

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.510
from my people's laughter
in the glory of our roots."

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:37.380
[ Applause ]

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.640
Great; and I'm going to read
a poem that I semi-apologize

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.600
because I know some of
you have heard it before.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.100
It is the poem that I had the
honor to read as an introduction

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.990
to our current US Poet
Laureate Tracy K. Smith.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.770
And it's called "In This
Place (An American Lyric)".

00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.630
"There's a poem in this place
in the footfalls, and the halls,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.910
and the quiet beats
of the seats.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.140
It is here at the curtain of day

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.230
where America writes a lyric
you must whisper to say.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.050
There's a poem in this place, in
the heavy grace, the lined face

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.220
of this noble building
collections burned

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.940
and were born twice.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.290
There's a poem in
Boston's Copley Square

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.100
where protests chants tear
through the air like sheets

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.660
of rain, where love of the many
swallows hatred of the few.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.710
There's a poem in
Charlottesville with tiki torch

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.750
of string, a ring of flame
tight around the wrist of night,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.220
where men so white they
glean blue seen like statues

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.490
where [inaudible] that long
wax burning ever higher,

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.020
where heather higher
blooms forever

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.870
in a meadow of resistance.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.470
There's a poem at the
great sleeping giants

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.780
of Lake Michigan defiantly
raising its big blue head

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:58.110
to Milwaukee and Chicago,
a poem begun long ago blaze

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.810
into frozen soil
strutting upward and aglow.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.990
There's a poem in Florida,
in Puerto Rico, in East Texas

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.190
where streets swell
into a nexus of rivers,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.350
cows afloat like modeled
buoys in the brown,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.480
where courage is now so common

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.210
that 23 year old Jesus Contreos
[phonetic] rescues senior

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.690
citizens from floodwaters.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.960
There's a poem in my Los
Angeles [inaudible] wide

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.220
as the Pacific tide where
a single mother swelters

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.740
in the windowless
classroom teaching black

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.530
and brown students in Watts
to spell out their thoughts

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.850
so her daughter write
like this poem for you.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.410
There's a lyric in
California where thousands

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.560
of students march for blocks
and document it, and unafraid

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.460
when my friend Rosa finds
the power to blossom

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.380
and deadlock her spirit, the
bedrock of her community.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.880
She knows hope is like a
stubborn ship gripping a dock

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.560
of truth that you can't stop a
dreaming or knock down a dream.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.220
How could this not be her
city, su nacion, our country,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.440
our America or American lyric to
write to, a poem by the people,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.400
the poor, the Protestants, the
Muslim, the Jew, the Native,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.120
the immigrant, the black, the
brown, the blind, the brave,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.420
the undocumented, and
undeterred, the woman, the man,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.520
the albino, the trans, the ally
to all of the above and more.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.430
Tyrants fear the poet.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.840
Now that we know it,
we can't blow it.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.060
We owe it to show it, not slow
it, although it hurts to sew it

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.630
when the world [inaudible] below
it, hope, we must bestow it

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.800
like a wick in the poet
so it can grow, lit,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.580
bringing with it new
stories to rewrite,

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.790
the story of a Texas city
depleted but not defeated,

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.400
a history written that
need not be repeated,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.660
and nation composed,
but not yet completed.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.730
There's a poem in this
place, a poem in America,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.810
a poet in every American
who rewrites this nation,

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.140
who tells a story worthy of
being told on this minnow

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.320
of an Earth to breathe, hope
into [inaudible] of time,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.520
a poet to every American
who sees

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.150
that a poem penned
isn't a poet's end.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.960
There is a place where
this poem drowns.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.360
It is here.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.220
It is now in the yellow
song of dawn's bell

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.340
where we write an American lyric
we are just beginning to tell."

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.510
Thank you.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:29.210

&gt;&gt; Milla Kudas: Hello.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.930
&gt;&gt; Amanda Gorman: Hello.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.230
&gt;&gt; Milla Kudas: First I want to
thank the Library of Congress,

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.680
and thank Urban Word,
as well as Amanda

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.460
for that fabulous introduction.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.260
I'm going to just do two poems.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.290
I'm going to start with a
sonnet, and then I'm going

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.960
to go into another poem.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.640
So the sonnet is "A
Sonnet for a Moth".

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.230
"Your wings, honey-dipped
between shoulder blades,

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.950
unscrewed, left open on
marble counters, crystallized

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.720
as a capsule of toothpaste,
a motel memoir

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.330
for an out-of-towner
in my own backyard,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:14.020
flying towards a light dim as
dusk wherever warmth radiates.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:21.940
You alwayto eradicate
the smoke in your mouth.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.330
The Shirley Temple tongues
tangled stems no spider bites

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.630
my neck.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:31.080
The such a [inaudible] playing
gentle, the cherry drowns.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.120
You do not care to check.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.800
Dare unthread me head
first into the flame.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.280
I see a moth wink, and
think of your name."

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.590
So that's my sonnet [applause],
my one and only sonnet.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.140
[Laughs] And now
this is my next poem.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.080
And I wrote this for CUPSI,
which is happening April.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.380
It's a poetry slam.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.720
I'm very excited for it.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.430
"Hey, I'm gay, and
not up for debate.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.680
I'm gay, lesbian,
Libra, lascivious.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.540
I'm gay as a wolf
flannel on a summer day.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.190
I'm so gay.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.650
In third grade, my best friend
and I would sneak kisses peck

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.500
for peck at the playground's
corner.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.810
Our parents called it
confusion, experimentation,

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.410
like my desire could be
dissected, cut down to cuticle.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.670
I'm gay like -- woo, I'm gay
like I swallowed my sexuality

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.740
until sophomore year, found it
again staring into Amy's eyes

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.540
at lunchtime, earbuds
draped around her neck,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.930
the cranberries echoing
in her collarbones.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.340
I'm gay like I write
poetry, really gay poetry,

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.440
with my trimmed fingernails
and chipped polish existing

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.950
in the blur between platonic
cuddling and intimacy.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.030
I'm gay like Willow
Rosenberg post "Werewolf",

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.470
like Buffy really slays.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.410
I'm gay like middle school,
softball and musical theatre,

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.340
an unending emo phase.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.990
I'm gay like turtlenecks and
dodging texts, like nose-ring

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.920
and undercut, like
everyone's a little eager

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.550
to reduce me down to trend.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.990
I mean, I get it, flannel
goes out of season,

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.540
but some of you all would
rather a rope than a bowtie,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.430
than a necklace with
my girlfriend's name.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.920
But I still sport button-ups at
all my family holiday parties,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.110
hoping the collar will cover my
love's letters because I'm gay.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.800
Like grandma still
doesn't get it.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.720
No matter asks me how many
times she asks about the boys

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.620
and I don't give her
a straight answer,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.520
she says the reason I
haven't met someone yet is

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.590
because I go to a
women's college.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.440
And the love almost leaps from
my lips I'm gay like almost,

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.080
like lips, like the
closet is cracked open.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.710
But some days I have
to lock myself in,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.300
put my best fem forward
at the job interview,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.600
the Megabus terminal,
my grandpa's funeral.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.700
I'm gay like every time gay,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.390
the men in my life take it upon
themselves to amend and say,

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.500
"Well, what about Ben,
what was that then?"

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.040
[Laughter] I'm gay like my
only straight friend just came

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.270
out so she would've
known sooner if not

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.060
for the folks always photo
shopping her wedding pictures.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.530
I'm gay like my girlfriend
boiled me a bath

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.450
from the hot water
stopped working,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.860
made warmth out of winter.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:17.490
We l I forget each intersection
kiss is a death wish.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.830
But I'm gay like privilege,
search party and headline.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.940
Like not everyone
is made into martyr,

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.290
like not every casket comes
with a feature film full

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.050
of rainbow flags, but the
casualties keep coming.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.630
And we prefer to live loving,
we prefer to love living.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.780
And I'm gay like still here,

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.600
singing the mountain
goats glitter faced

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.240
on the subway turning
dismal to dazzle,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.360
death into trend,
love to the end."

thank you for all being here.

I'm really honored to be
a part of this program,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.840
to be here with all of
these amazing people.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.160
I'm going to read
two poems today,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.090
and they're both after cities.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:11.290
The first one is for Houston,
and the second is for Banaras,

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.530
which is where my
family lives in India.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.230
"After Harvey."

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:21.120
"The first rain after the
hurricane, we held our breath.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.960
Imagine what it would feel like
to be drowning again so soon

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.220
after the taste of stolen air
replaced the salty gasping

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.140
of rising tides.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.230
The first rain after
the hurricane,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.530
we were ready before the flash .

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.950
Snarling and slavering
in red Wellington boots,

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:42.630
they watched us with hungry
eyes, snout sniffing the air

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:49.080
for threats from the
sky and each other.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.240
The first rain after the
hurricane, the water washed away

00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:05.600
as quick as it had come, leaving
the streets dark and empty,

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.830
and water still priced
1.99 a gallon.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.980
We scoured the clouds for
signs of false promises.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.460
The first rain after
the hurricane,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.690
we tethered our homes together,
waited to become chains

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.310
of floating memories, prayed
for a second chance at survival,

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.020
our heads still bowed
as the rain evaporated,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.510
leaving only stillness behind."

[ Applause ]

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.050
My second piece is about
my hometown in India.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.350
And it's the holy city
because it has the intersection

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.750
of two holy rivers.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.830
But there's also
a place where --

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.810
as Hindus, we cremate our dead,

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.700
and so there's a
place along the river

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.530
where you just see
fire lining the banks;

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.150
and this is a poem
about that scene.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.640
"The city is burning, or
maybe it's just the stars,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.340
the river caught
between her banks.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.640
I can't tell.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.930
The haze is a curtain covering
the open kitchen window

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.720
when the smoke alarm
screams, 'Mama,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.140
[foreign language], Mama.'

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.700
If the holy city burns
and he lights a cigarette

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.540
from the ashes, will
he be spared?

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.960
The temple spills soot
like a blackened mouth,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.140
like teeth falling out
of the old man's head

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.370
when he spits, splat.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.630
Tobacco turns the sands of
the riverbank to liquid rust.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:31.560
queuing for cremation
delight in the warmth.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.720
The city of lights is
burning and the reflection

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.730
in God's glasses looks
like sacrifice, salvation.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:41.950
Did you know that anyone who
dies in Banaras is saved,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.810
that -- did you know that this
time the line at the gates

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.090
of heaven is so long it trails
back to Earth, bodies stacked

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.720
like firewood waiting
to be collected,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.480
only the dead poor tied down
with bricks at the bottom

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.620
of the river can
breathe through the smoke

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.950
and close press of people.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:04.540

touch and they long for heat,

&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.640
&gt;&gt; Cassidy Martin: So this
first piece is for a culture

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:48.470
that I had to look up and
relearn in order to remember it.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:54.010
So "I was named after Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.120
I was basically born into the
backyard of a Mennonite farm

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.630
where we would wash each other's
feet at the end of the day,

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.850
and then we would eat watermelon
smiles down to the rind.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.210
We would spit the
seeds in the grass

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.080
so the chickens could
eat them later.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.430
And every morning we had
to check the henhouse,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.530
but not me because I would
be over there screaming

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.350
when mothers would expand
their wings in warning

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.610
like Mennonite mothers would
pinch children when they run

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.660
with eggs, the ones you had
to collect in the morning

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.970
and eat before the sun woke up.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.000
The hens would peck
at my fingers

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.010
that were smaller than her beak.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.590
We would use sticks and poke
them under their bellies

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.240
so they would give us
breakfast in the morning.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.270
We would eat not at
a dining room table,

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.610
but a long wooden bench with
hen-stitched tablecloths.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.450
We would slip our prayers
into each other's palms

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.320
and offer them to God for
a meal made from scratch.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.600
This gets fluffy golden
brown, and the ground

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.300
on a southern farm feels
like home, like mud pies,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.500
like fireflies in mason jars.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.280
But this pretty picture
of painted isn't acrylic.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.660
It's water-colored by night.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.540
Our oldest cousin would
commend us to lock our doors

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:28.690
because sometimes boy
cousi'd think that it's okay

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:33.550
to touch a six year old with
brown hair and tangled limbs.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.740
And my oldest cousin
would always tuck the halo

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.730
of my baby hairs
back into my bonnet,

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.990
which was really a prayer cap
that we wear at all times,

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.690
because we believe that we
should always be ready to pray.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.850
I grew up in a home where
men like my father only had

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.650
up to an eighth grade
education, but my mother told me

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.580
that he was the smartest
man she had ever married.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.170
And the black cowboy hat in the
back of her closet that she used

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.200
to keep I would fit
if I had it now.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.860

public school and poverty.

ma'am,' and, 'No ma'am,

into my vocabulary.

come from, and no matter

00:31:58.050 --> 00:31:59.810
at any time.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.660
A well-regulated militia being
necessary to the security

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.070
of a free state, the right
of the people to keep

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.670
and bear arms shall
not be infringed.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:12.810
We march because those words
are worth more than our lives,

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.210
because those who defend
them do not know our names,

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.450
how our mommas know to hold
us close when pistols rejoice

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.980
in the night like
martyrdom is the best some

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.160
of us can expect in life.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.840
We march because.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:31.570
Because the other day,
we had a lockdown drill,

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.870
and as my back was pressed
against the wall away

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.170
from the window, I was
waiting for shots to ring out,

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.710
blunt like the promise

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.660
of freedom the way
politicians take NRA money

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.370
and give us back bodies.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.590
We were not taught
the sound of gunshots.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:50.250
We have never been
asked to write eulogy.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.760
We march because as I write
this poem, I want to be worrying

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.330
about tests, and homework,
and acne, and grades,

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:02.300
and it's frustrating that
this poem sounds like an ode

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.670
to assault rifles, that my
grandmother prayed I would

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.980
survive in case of
a school shooting,

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.760
that an Austin sixth grader
wrote his will in case

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.570
of a school shooting,
that 'in case

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:17.240
of a school shooting' has
become a justification,

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.120
but not justification
enough for stricter gun laws

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.840
because someone, someone

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.290
in America says they
love their guns.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:34.520
And my body becomes a canvas,
becomes a false prophecy,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.100
and I flash back to police
siren, to red, white, blue, red,

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.130
white blue, and I say in my
head over and over again,

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.590
'Hands up, don't shoot.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:51.070
Hands up, don't shoot.'

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.670
We march because I learned
long before high school

00:33:54.670 --> 00:34:01.150
to fear bullets, before
Columbine, before Sandy Hook,

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.500
before Stoneman Douglas.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.130
We march because
today, I did not die.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:10.360
Today, I was not shot, not
crucified, not martyred,

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.190
not made poster, or hashtag
'not afraid', didn't crouch

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.090
down on my classroom today.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:21.770
Today, I didn't have to run,
or hide, or mourn a friend.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.820
We march because
today, I knew that one

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.070
of those things could
happen at any time.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.610
They've happened before.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.830
We are not marching
to take your guns.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:37.160
We are marching for our lives.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:41.950
So watch us because there
is power in our footst.

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:50.510
And the streets will ring with
it long after we are gone."

[ Applause ]

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.600
And this second poem
I wrote for my dad,

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.610
and it's called "I
See Mountains."

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.910
"I watch as the white woman
won't sit next to my dad

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.390
in the subway, won't be seen

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:18.460
in the space a black man has
left behind, won't be possessed

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.160
by the ghosts he
carries with him.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.940
She scans the car
for another seat,

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:27.990
one with fewer nooses attached,
looking everywhere but at him,

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.470
everywhere but at the empty
seat next to him that beckons

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.540
with open arms, ignoring it
as if it were white privilege,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.180
as if it were unclean,

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:43.090
as if there was ever could
sit while a white woman stood.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.860
I wonder if she is
suddenly aware

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.880
of her whiteness the
same way I am aware

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.710
of my father's blackness;
how he carries space

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:56.750
with him anywhere he goes,
a well so full of blood,

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.150
and light, and magic,
and everything black

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.570
that it is overflowed.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.440
How dirty he must feel
contaminating the seats next

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.580
to him, his pride
planting explosives

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.480
in the orange plastic skin

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.120
so bright it requires a
three-foot radius tongue a

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.000
skyscraper that could
collapse at any moment.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.770
And I think she must
recognize the risks associated

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.640
with the air around his
body, how fragile it is,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.670
how precious breath is
in a black man's lungs.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.690
She stands with the
seat in front of her

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.640
as I watch standing next to
her, and I want her to sit

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.550
to cast aside the fire hoses

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.920
and German shepherds
her mind has rejected.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.250
I want her to recognize that
when she ignores this seat,

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:46.020
she ignores The Promised Land.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:53.000
I want her to see my dad the way
I see him, as holy, as human,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.690
as strong as he is fragile.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:37:04.100
And she smiles, reads her
book, continues to stand

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.570
like George Wallace at
the schoolhouse door.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:11.660
And my dad winks at me
as if he sees the miracle

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.600
in what has just occurred,
that a white woman gives

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.120
up her birthright,
stands for a black man,

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.690
recognizes that he
takes up so much space

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:29.460
in this world she
cannot possibly find room

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.940
to disrespect it.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:35.400
And I do no; bright
as the mountaintop

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:44.570
where no trees can
grow, only flowers,

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.560
that only black men
have ever set foot on.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.330
So I think my father
moves mountains with him,

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.590
has climbed them, tamed them.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:04.470
And he will sit for now enjoying
the space that he has earned."

My body is the vase.

thing needs a home.

fist, their straining knuckles.

what it can to survive.

Brooklyn in the house,
of course.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:59.290
And we have a staff member Urban
Word here with us who wears

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.620
so many hats, I don't even
know what her title is,

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.510
but she coordinates
this program,

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.950
she coordinates these
young people, and she holds

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.700
up about 41 cities in
this national network.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.000
So give it up for Shannon
Mateski [assumed spelling] right

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.800
over here.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.100
[ Applause ]

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.780
So before I get into it, just to
give you a little bit of history

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.420
about the program; this
program was started

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.250
in 2008 in New York City.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:29.190
And the idea behind it was
that young people had spaces

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.420
like the [inaudible] and poets
cafes, the Apollo theaters

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.380
of the world, and young people
were doing powerful, creative,

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.450
politically charged,
and important work.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:44.150
And the idea was that we wanted
these young people to be able

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:49.070
to be in spaces that they
were not traditionally offered

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:50.370
access to.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:54.430
So when we envisioned where we
wanted these young people to be,

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:58.740
it was originally like City
Hall, and it was a vision

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.330
that really helped us
create a program that wanted

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.280
to celebrate young people that
were not only great poets,

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.320
but great leaders that were
interested in social justice

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.720
and social impact, that were
interested in civic engagement

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.470
and really working
in their communities.

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:16.030
So that's the model
by which we use

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.970
as the framework
for this program.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.700
So everyone that you see here
tonight, as you could tell

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.210
from their bios, along

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.360
with being incredible artists
is an incredible leader;

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.150
they've done so much.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:31.300
Fast forward to about four
years ago, we got a new mayor

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.150
in New York City and his
name is Bill de Blasio.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.840
And we had the incredible
opportunity

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.040
where the Youth Poet Laureate
at the time of New York City,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.620
Romney Romana [phonetic],
was invited to speak at --

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.650
perform a poem that she
wrote for that event

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.070
at de Blasio's inauguration.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.260
So it was an incredible moment

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.260
because there was only a
few people asked to speak;

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:56.190
it was her, and Harry
Belafonte, and Bill Clinton.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.890
And [laughter] she
stole the show.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.490
The New York Times
wrote about it.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.030
And we -- there was
a lot of press.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.930
After that a lot of our partner
organizations were in a network

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:09.790
of probably 60-plus
organizations that do this work

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.420
in their communities,
and they wanted

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.820
to know how they
could replicate that.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.040
And we actually have
folks from DC, Words Beats

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.340
and Life here tonight

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.700
that hosted the DC
Poet Laureate Program.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.640
So we decided that we wanted
to make this program something

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.820
that we could launch
in different cities.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:29.240
A few years ago at the twilight
of the Obama administration,

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:34.680
we were invited to the White
House to meet Michelle Obama.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.030
And it was an incredible
opportunity, but what had

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.390
to happen was that we
needed five finalists.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:42.290
We needed to kind of
get this local program

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:45.340
that had city youth poet
laureates across the country

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.810
to something where we were
going to sort of matriculate it

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.170
up to a national
Youth Poet Laureate.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:53.330
So we quickly hustled
together all of our efforts,

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:57.540
we named our inaugural group of
five finalists, and got to go

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.630
to the White House; and, you
know, the rest is history.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.210
This past April, Amanda
was awarded the title

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.440
of the first national
Youth poet laureate.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.850
And now we have our first
set of new finalists

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.780
for the second Youth
Poet Laureate.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.150
So it's been an incredible
journey

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.690
that gives you a little
backdrop of the program.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.620
I want to get into
the conversation.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.200
Let's -- I want to start --

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.050
yes I'll have a question
for everybody,

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:22.640
and then prepare your
questions because I want

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.240
to open it up to the audience.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.300
So I want to start
with Patricia,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.010
since the mic is still
hot from your flames.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.400
The question that I have
is really about Chicago.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.650
I love your poem
about the Windy City.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:39.900
And right now Chicago, you
know -- it's been for a while,

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:44.790
but the art that's coming out of
Chicago, the poetry, the music,

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.670
the theater, it's, you know,
in my opinion, probably one

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:52.340
of the most culturally
artistically vibrant cities,

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.110
even politically active
cities that we have.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.240
It's really a touchstone
for, you know,

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.530
what we should be doing in
terms of art and politics.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.490
And I just want to
know how that city

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.900
and that scene inspires
you and your work.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.360
Do you feel supported
by it, or are you sort

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.090
of rogue doing this
incredible art on your own?

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:11.860
So tell us a little
bit more about that.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.620
&gt;&gt; Patricia Frazier: Definitely
more supported than rogue.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.590
[Laughter] I think that
growing up in Chicago has kind

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:22.390
of been bittersweet, because
for so long growing up I had

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.550
to watch people on the TV screen
tell me about the neighborhood

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:27.150
that I lived in, and
the neighborhoods

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.450
that my friends lived in.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:33.580
And I think a long time we spent
asking politicians and our mayor

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.030
to do the work of repairing
the image of the city,

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.730
but after a while we just
kind of realized that this is

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.420
of people's resistance;
this isn't going

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.590
to work without the people.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.590
So a lot of our work, and
a lot of my work is kind

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:49.310
of based upon disproving
narratives that are said

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:53.650
about us, and not exactly
counteracting them,

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.820
because like the thing about
stereotypes is they are true,

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.140
right, like some of
these things are true,

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.970
Chicago does have
a violence problem,

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:00.640
Chicago does have a
gun violence problem,

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.930
but also Chicago is
so many other things.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:07.600
So I think I'm just constantly
inspired by the people that I'm

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.410
so lucky to work
with, especially more

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.810
in the political
campaigning of things.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.630
I work with this group
called "Assada's Daughters",

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:18.010
and where Assada's
Daughters is different

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.930
from other organizations
is normally --

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.230
and organizations

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:25.500
that politically organize they
take what I like to call like

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.260
"pretty diversity", you know,
black people that look good

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.710
on a poster board, black people
that look good on a podium.

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:33.760
And Assada's takes kids
out of the neighborhood,

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.980
which is Washington Park, and
teaches them how to organize,

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.620
and teaches them how to
speak up for themselves.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.380
Because sometimes
the person who needs

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.390
to be speaking doesn't always
look like, you know, one of us.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:45.200
Sometimes it looks like my uncle
who has a felony and who listens

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.450
to Gucci Mane, and
does all these

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:48.880
like different things, right?

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.250
Those stories matter, too.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:52.310
So that's what I try to do, I
try to write about those people

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.890
because they're more
important than the narrative

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.140
that is being shown of Chicago.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.440
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cirelli: [Inaudible].

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:07.270
So I'm going to pass it over
to Cassidy just, you know,

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.570
learning about your background,

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:10.600
which you shared a little
bit about, and, you know,

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.900
even talking with
you and getting

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.410
to know you a little bit,
I'm always interested in --

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.760
because it's something
that we don't see as much

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.560
with young poets, is the
interplay between faith

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.200
and poetry, or how faith
informs your poetry,

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.950
or how poetry informs
your faith.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:28.480
You can take it however
you want.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.350
But I'd love for you to
elaborate a little bit

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:34.070
around just the ideas
of faith and poetry.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:35.990
For some people,
poetry is their faith.

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:39.670
And for you, you have multiple
manifestations of how you,

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.190
and how that intersects with
your story, your back story.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:46.580
So you want to shine a little
more light on that for us?

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.950
&gt;&gt; Cassidy Martin: Sure,
I'm always happy to talk

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.990
about God; you already know.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:56.700
So [laughter] when you love
from -- this is from personal --

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.000
I know we're in a government
place, I don't care, but,

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000
you know, from a personal
-- when you love God,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.930
you see Him in everything
you do.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:10.410
And it's -- but my
take on poetry and God,

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.910
the way they interweave doesn't
just come from me saying, "Oh,

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.420
I love God," then,
"I love poetry."

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:19.120
I kind of feel like poetry
has the spirit of Him.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.180
It's welcoming, it's loving,

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.680
it's expression,
it's caring for.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.200
Like my mentors, I will
say they're godsend

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.600
because they take care of me;
they feed me, they clothe me,

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.340
they take me to birthday
parties and weddings and stuff.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.900
So it's like everything
that's come

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.120
out of poetry have been
opportunities, have been family,

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.430
and I feel like that is
the channel that God put me

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:49.020
through to be able to
speak through poetry.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.860
And then by doing that, I
feel like I speak for Him.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:58.000
I speak for not just my
god, but a greater purpose,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.830
which is something that
everyone can relate to,

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.740
whether they are
religious or not.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.270
So I feel like every
one of us up here,

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.580
whether we have the
same religion or not,

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.810
we have a message, and poetry is
how we get that message across.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:13.890
And I'm thankful for
God for everything.

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:16.620
But the opportunities
that He's given me

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:22.150
through poetry have just been
the apex of my entire life.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:25.890
And to be honest -- well
a lot of teachers say --

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.320
I will say one thing,
a lot of teachers say

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.150
that if they can reach
one student per year,

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:31.450
then their job is --

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.630
then they've reached their
goal, that's their job.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:37.120
Well, for me, was one person.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.600
It was [inaudible] I
was Youth Poet Laureate,

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:44.000
and I was a finalist, but
I didn't get the title.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.800
That was the first year
we had ever done it.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.290
I had got it the second
year, but the first year,

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:48.590
I was just a finalist.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:49.890
I didn't get it.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.190
I was very upset.

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:52.810
I wanted to quit because
I didn't have a drive.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:54.110
I was , I don't know."

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:59.720
But at the end of the day,
there was this one girl who came

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.480
up to me, and she said, "I --

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.170
" and the poem was about
abuse, very extensive abuse.

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:11.220
And she came up to me and
she said, "Thank you so much

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:15.010
for saying what I have
always wanted to say."

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:18.060
And I just can't --

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.380
me personally, I just
can't explain anything

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.280
like that other than God.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.150
Like I just can't;
like there's no way.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:30.510
There's no way that that wasn't
something that He put in my life

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:32.750
to tell me to keep going.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.030
So I mean, He's the
reason why I do it,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.690
and that is the reason
why I love Him.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:37.990
It's a tradeoff relationship.

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:39.290
[Laughter]

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:40.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cirelli: Thank you

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.390
for sharing that;
that's great to hear.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:45.750
[ Applause ]

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:49.380
So I'm going to go
to William now.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:55.930
So William, you were so adamant
about reading these two poems.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:59.900
And I really appreciate
the sense of urgency.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.420
And me, you know,
being from New York,

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.420
I've gotten to hear you a bunch.

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.920
And just you always
have a sense --

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:12.460
a "poetics of urgency" I like
to call it, around your work.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.970
It seems like everything
you write is

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:18.400
like fresh off the press,
which is very hard to do,

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.150
and you do it so
sincerely and powerfully.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:24.550
So I want you to talk a
little bit about your process,

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.900
and how you manage to
keep up with, you know,

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.140
a very busy school schedule,

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.890
because I know you're all
overachievers, and being able

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:36.530
to crank out these poems that
literally were about stuff

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.600
that happened yesterday.

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.900
&gt;&gt; William Lohier:
Yes; yes, sure.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.570
So let me first talk about
these two poems specifically,

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:47.570
and my process writing
them, and performing them

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:48.870
in front of you today.

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:53.040
So when I first put together a
portfolio of perspective poems

00:53:53.040 --> 00:54:00.010
that I wanted to read here, I
think all of them got rejected.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:04.000
[Laughs] So two poems that
I hadn't really wanted

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.550
to read were the ones
that were selected.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:10.180
And I emailed Michael and I
said, "These are not the poems

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.220
that I feel it is
important to say.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:15.550
These are not the poems that
I want a group of people

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:22.240
in the Library of Congrelk a
lot about political things;

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.620
I talk a lot about race.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:30.130
And I think Michael was
talking earlier about how it's

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:32.900
so important to have youth,

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.600
people who are traditionally
excluded

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.780
from the national narrative
in this type of setting.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:44.050
But I was -- I asked myself,
"What is the point of being here

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.970
if I cannot be fully
here and fully present,

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:50.680
if I have to leave parts of my
identity outside of the room?"

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:55.070
So I thought that was so
important to me, and especially

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:57.750
with the poem "Why We March".

00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:00.830
I mean, obviously, I'm
really passionate about it.

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:04.120
And I thought especially
given this platform,

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:09.610
and given the location, it is
something that I have to say.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:13.500
And in terms of my
process; so I'm super busy,

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.380
after this I'm going
to take a train home,

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.870
I'm going to get
home at like 1:40,

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.830
and I have to go
to school tomorrow.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:23.490
So it's safe to say that I don't
have a lot of time to write.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:28.340
And I think that in some weird
convoluted way helps my poetry,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.150
because when I do write, I know
that I'm going to have two,

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.820
three hours and I have
to say what I want to say

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.270
in those two, three hours.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.810
So when I sit down and write,
I'm not fooling around,

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.990
I write what I think is true,
I write what I want to say,

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:44.520
and I write what I
think it's important

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.250
for other people to hear.

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:50.250
Because I think my voice, and
all the voices of the people

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:54.310
on this stage are so
important, especially right now.

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:57.640
And so when we write, it's
so important that, one,

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.850
we have people who
listen to us and, two,

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.400
that we be fully present,
and that we bring all

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.510
of ourselves to the table.

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:09.150
[ Applause ]

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cirelli: So I think

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:11.970
that dovetails really
nicely into Milla.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:13.980
So I'm going to ask
you a question.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.410
You know, I get to see a
lot of the applications

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.900
from the students
across the country.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:21.280
And one of the real
components to this work is

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.290
that they submit a
poetry portfolio,

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:25.210
but they also submit a CV.

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.190
And that sort of ouir
social justice work,

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:32.180
their organizational work, their
schoolwork, their accolades.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:36.860
And it seemed -- what's really
amazing to me is Los Angeles,

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:41.460
of all places, which is so huge
and spread out and everything,

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:43.850
is a chore to get
somewhere in Los Angeles

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:46.840
because I spent a lot of time
on the West coast and LA myself;

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.430
everything is a hassle
to get anywhere.

00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:54.790
But at the same time, the
CVs from the kids in LA are

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:58.400
like ridiculous, yours included.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:03.370
So and that says a lot about,
you know, parents, resources,

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.140
what's going on in these
communities, kids having to go

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:09.950
to places to do things in LA,
you have to make a real effort.

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:15.670
And I want to know sort of the
intersection between, you know,

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.770
the efforts that you've made
in your life to do things

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:19.680
and be a part of all of
these incredible groups

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.760
that you're proud
of and, you know,

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.210
connecting it with your work.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:24.750
Does one drive the other?

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:28.790
You know, explain that synergy
between yourself as a poet,

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:32.650
and yourself as a person that's
just really involved in a lot

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.820
of stuff in the community.

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.360
&gt;&gt; Milla Kudas: For one thing,

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.570
I think that Los Angeles
Public Transit does all right.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.160
[Laughter] Maybe not the
best, I'll give it that,

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.400
but it does do all right.

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.410
And I think also I had some
really, really great friends

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:52.730
in high school -- because I'm
currently living right outside

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.180
of Boston, and I go
to Wellesley College.

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:59.270
But when I was in Los Angeles, I
did have some wonderful friends.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:02.400
And like the one person in the
friend group who did have a car

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.260
and did drive was also really
passionate about poetry,

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.940
and so certain missions
that we both really cared

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.340
about we'd go together.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:12.430
But I think as far as the
intersection between my work

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:14.920
and also like my work in
communities, I think they're one

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.640
in the same in a lot of ways.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.430
And it goes back to
what Cassidy was sayi,

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.020
the idea that sometimes
when I'm saying a poem,

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:23.490
when someone comes up to me
and says like, "I needed that,"

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:25.130
that feels like I'm
doing the work.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:27.340
But I think that's
always not enough.

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.340
Sometimes that's emotional
labor and that's work,

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.000
but you also have
to go So I'm part

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.170
of Young People Creating Change.

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:37.080
And like we put on open mic

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.590
so that we're not
always the only people

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:41.890
up there saying things.

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.510
We want to invite other youth
to tell their stories as well.

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:46.950
And I think when you're so
passionate and when poetry kind

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:49.010
of consumes your life,
it just doesn't stop,

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:50.440
and it's a beautiful,
wonderful thing

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.420
that I would never, ever change.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:57.290
So it doesn't feel like a lot
until like you check your watch

00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.950
and it's like 10:00 and
you realize you haven't

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:01.430
like drank water, because you've
been just like going everywhere

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:02.730
and you've been on the train.

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:05.740
But then you have friends and
support systems around you

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:10.820
who make drinking water a
think you are reminded of.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:14.310
So yes that's all
I've got to say.

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cirelli:
Awesome, awesome, cool.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:21.040
[ Applause ]

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:25.100
Awesome; and I'll be asking a
more poetry-related question

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.400
for Rukmini.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:31.050
What I really love about your
work is that whether it's a poem

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:36.970
about Houston, or a poem
about a city in India,

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:39.170
it sounds like it could
be in the same place.

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:42.890
You know, and that's a real
skill as a poet and an artist

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:45.340
to be able to have
such a definitive voice

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.190
that anything you're talking
about feels like it's coming

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:50.380
from the one singular
voice of the poet.

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:54.650
So I wanted you to explain a
little bit how you managed to do

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:59.770
that incredible feat of talking
about family, background,

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:08.450
Houston, Texas, being
-Harvey, so and how you melt

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:13.100
that into a singular poetic
voice that has that consistency

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.260
that I love about your work.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.560
&gt;&gt; Rukmini Kalamangalam: Sure.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.230
I think one thing that really
informs it is that I am

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.730
that singular being, right,
there are so many things

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:24.630
that are incorporated in my
life because we've moved a lot.

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:29.100
So I was born in the UK, I grew
up for six years in Scotland,

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.520
and then, you know, we
moved to the United States.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.520
And there's always been
this sense of like --

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.710
you know, my parents always
tried to instill in me the sense

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:40.550
that I'm a global citizen, and
that it's my responsibility

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.920
to not only speak out for
the places that I'm from,

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.460
and the places that I'm living
in, but also all the places

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.520
that I am connected to.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.460
And so I think that
I've been trying

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:53.940
to explain myself
for a very long time.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.900
And that's where the voice comes
from, I think, is this idea

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.290
that I am a whole bunch of
different things, but primarily,

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.400
people see me as
Indian-American.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.770
And you know, the idea that
I've often been, you know,

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:08.020
the only Indian-American,
the only Asian-American,

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.390
so you're always trying to
speak up for that voice.

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:12.830
But at the same time, you
know, you're a diverse person,

01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:14.450
you have varied interests,

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:16.360
and you encompass a lot
of different things.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.180
And so for me, it's the
idea that my identity

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.670
as a global citizen, as a
person of many cultures,

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:25.990
informs my beliefs on a
lot of different issues.

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:28.330
So I try to bring that
part of me to everything

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:29.740
that I said on the page.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cirelli:
Awesome; thank you.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.500
[ Applause ]

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.340
Thanks. A question for Amanda.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.640
&gt;&gt; Amanda Gorman:
No; I don't want

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.970
to go, they've done so well.

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.270
[Laughter]

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:42.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cirelli: There
are so many I can ask.

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:48.100
You know, I feel like a voyeur
of just this incredible ride

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.450
that Amanda's gone on since
she was named the finalist

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:54.300
at the Kennedy Center to
go into the White House,

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.790
to being named the Youth
Poet Laureate of the US.

01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:00.750
I watched her rap on Hot 97.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:05.650
I saw her on a billboard
in Times Square,

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:09.510
making her first
presidential address, you know,

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:13.960
20 years plus before
she'll be the president.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.670
[Laughter] And I've seen her
on so many pieces of press

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:20.240
that we can't even keep
up as a small organization

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.340
with like three or
four staff members.

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:26.420
So tell us a little
bit about the journey,

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.350
but also tell us what was --
what are some of the highlights?

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.920
You don't have to name
just one because I know

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.220
that would probably be hard.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.030
But what were some of your
favorite moments this past year

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:40.580
as being the first ever
National Youth Poet Laureate?

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.520
&gt;&gt; Amanda Gorman: I'm sorry,
there are so many emotions going

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.440
on right now, one
feeling of like inadequacy

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.100
because we have geniuses
on the panel.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.680
Like let me say something as
intellectually like powerful.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.330
Yes; I mean, it's
been a crazy ride.

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:56.820
And when I try to explain to
people, it's not just the ride

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.970
of like this year, but I think
of it as kind of voyeur journey

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:01.670
of ever since I met
Michael Cirelli,

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.550
when I was first named
LA Youth Poet Laureate,

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:06.950
and being on that ark of not
only the growth of myself

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.620
as a poet, but growing also
with us as an organization

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.190
and seeing the fantastic
spread of this program,

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.440
and seeing how much people
believe in the power of youth

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.480
and poetry when combined.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.700
So in that regard, it's so
difficult to choose highlights.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.760
And I've kind of split them
in two; I've split them

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.130
in like the half in which people
easily recognize, for example,

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:34.690
meeting Michelle Obama like
period, dot, and new paragraph;

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:36.480
[laughter] you know, and the
amazing things I've been able

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.950
to do whether it's writing
within New York Times,

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:40.530
or being able to give a state

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:42.620
of the union address
on MTV for 2036.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.080
I was checking my calendar,
I'm like, "You know it's not

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.500
that near yet, but
sure, we can do this."

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.410
And so those are some
great highlights.

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:53.770
But for me the moments
that keep me going,

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:56.710
the moments that rejuvenate me,
and why I do my work is kind

01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:58.430
of like a lot of the moments
I think all of us have talked

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:01.670
about on the panel, it's that
person who comes up to you

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:03.520
after the performance
or after the reading,

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.720
and tells you the story.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.300
And I mean, one of the things
that I continually deal

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.320
with is growing up,
having a speed impediment,

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.900
and it coming back in
moments when I'm most nervous.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:17.370
So you can imagine going live
on MTV is kind of a moment

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.160
when I'm a bit nervous
about what I'm about to do.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.610
And, you know, trying to
make decisions of how I want

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.190
to navigate that; do I want
to change the way I speak,

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:27.260
do I want to change the way
in which I present myself?

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.170
And when I was named
US Youth Poet Laureate,

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:33.930
I made conscious decision to
not erase those scars of myself,

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:36.760
and to not erase that process
that I've had of dealing

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.370
with an auditory
processing disorder,

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.800
dealing with a speech
impediment while being a speaker

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.100
who travels around the country.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:47.020
And time and time again, I will
get onstage and tell my story.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.320
And especially that --

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.620
I remember that first night

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.460
when I was named US
Youth Poet Laureate

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.940
at Gracie Mansion there was
a girl who came up to me

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.150
with her mom, and she
was like six years old,

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.960
and she has these big brown
eyes, and she starts talking

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.260
to me about how she has

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.870
that same exact auditory
processing disorder that I have

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.170
and a speech impediment.

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:05.810
But because of me,
she's inspired

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:07.400
to write and share her voice.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.590
And I don't think
highlights get better

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:10.970
than that, I really don't.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:14.180
And it's not that I'm trying
to convert people to poets.

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.010
I'm not trying to make all the
little children that I meet

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.780
with become published authors.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.510
That's not my duty.

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:26.540
But my duty is to make
them believe in themselves.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:29.510
And that has been t

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:34.200
[ Applause ]

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cirelli: I think we
want to open up some questions.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:40.240
If you all have any questions,
it would be a good time

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.930
to offer some of those up.

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:44.930
It's probably not going to
be many opportunities to be

01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.360
with the five finalists
and their current --

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.150
the first ever National
Youth Poet Laureate,

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:51.900
so anyone have a question?

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.950
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] out of curiosity
for the five finalists,

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.250
what did you imagine
having access

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:11.860
to this platform would allow
you to do, in terms of --

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.270
as you all said, having your
voices heard [inaudible],

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:22.900
I wonder how you imagine
this responsibility

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:30.040
and this opportunity allowing
you to be a representative

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:41.400
for young people in general,
your cities, and your nation?

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.160
&gt;&gt; Cassidy Martin: Okay; so --

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.790
I don't know if this
is on, but that's okay.

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:51.200
To answer that question,
that was actually one

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.670
of the essay questions.

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:59.440
We had to write an essay
saying [laughter] what --

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.400
we had to write an essay saying
like, "What do we want --

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.350
as a Youth Poet Laureate, what
-- it's what do you want to --

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:07.510
basically what she said, that's
the question we were asked.

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:10.040
[Inaudible Comment]

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.740
&gt;&gt; Cassidy Martin: Oh, good,
you can read mine then,

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.260
because I'm about to summarize
it for you right now, okay?

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Pirelli:
So everybody get

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.860
in on this because [inaudible].

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.160
&gt;&gt; Cassidy Martin: Go
ahead, I'm not scared.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:26.580
Okay, look, this is what I say.

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.320
[Laughter] I -- when I first
became the Youth Poet Laureate

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.210
of Nashville, the first
year that I was, you know,

01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:38.170
it was very new, and so
I recognized that because

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:41.900
of this title, I could go into
government official places

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:46.740
with an official meaning and
reason for why I was there,

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.810
and people would listen
to me because of that.

01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.130
But I will always defend
this statement to the death

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.510
that I don't care
what title I have,

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:59.330
I am going to be
doing the same thing

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:01.350
that I would be doing
without that title.

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:05.580
But the title amplifies
your voice.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:09.850
So the fact that this title was
created is the whole reason we

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.010
even have this opportunity.

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:14.630
But whether you have
a title or not --

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:19.060
and this is my personal mission
, it doesn't matter who you are,

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:25.430
it doesn't matter what your
name is, if you have a purpose,

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:27.450
be driven and do that purpose.

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.990
And it doesn't matter
what happens,

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:31.660
or what people call you,

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:36.110
if that's what they remember you
by, it's like Maya Angelou said,

01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:38.330
"People will not always
remember what you said,

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:40.940
but people will always remember
how you made them feel."

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:45.350
And that's the true mission, not
to win a title, but to get kids

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.510
like us up here in the future.

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:53.590
[ Applause ]

01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:56.970
&gt;&gt; Patricia Frazier:
Yes, all of that.

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.930
[Laughter] But also for
me, I think some of it --

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:01.530
a lot of it is personal.

01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:08.020
I've lost so many friends,
and so much of my family.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.470
And something -- and
I lost my grandma

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:12.070
like a couple of months ago.

01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:15.520
And something that she
always made apparent to me,

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.680
and apparent to everybody
was that it's so,

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.470
so important to be loud.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:21.250
Sometimes I was embarrassed
of my voice,

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:24.580
embarrassed of being loud, but
then I think about the fact

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:30.120
that if I'm not writing
poems, what girl --

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.220
like how are you going
to know that girls --

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.730
black girls from the projects
and ghetto girls exist,

01:09:34.730 --> 01:09:37.700
and can be educated, and
can be socially-conscious

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.000
and all of these things?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.040
And I think that it's
really important that --

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.850
like you said, all of us are
on this stage because each one

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:48.720
of us has a certain
identity that closes a gap

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.980
in the narrative of what
an American looks like.

01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:53.150
So that's why like
that's so important to me.

01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:55.490
Like you said, regardless
of the title,

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.970
I'm going to be doing
the same exact thing.

01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:01.800
But I don't know, like
besides Tiffany Haddish,

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.080
what like black woman who's
just belligerent, and ghetto

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.620
and about her people is
on platforms like this,

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.920
or on platforms like this.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.440
And it's also super important
to me because I think

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.870
that ordinary people deserve
biographies, too, right?

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:17.420
So often, when we write about
people, we write about people

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.250
who we think like, from
a hierarchical position,

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.980
and to defeat the hierarchy
of what you see going

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.280
on in America right now,

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.000
especially with who our
president is, and who we have

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.120
in office, we have to understand

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.890
that sometimes we don't need
a white [inaudible] male

01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:36.590
to be the forefront, or to be
moderating the conversation,

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:38.730
or to be the speaker
on the table.

01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:40.510
Sometimes we need a queer woman,

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:42.960
sometimes we need queer black
women, sometimes we need --

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.610
like all of us represent
a different image

01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:47.490
of what America is; and that's
why I think that regardless

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:52.610
of who wins, I would be proud
of any one of us because all

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:57.480
of us are not the same narrative
that you see every single day.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.270
And like I said, for me, I
just want to amplify the voices

01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:02.550
of the people that I've
lost and tell their stories.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.460
That's why so many of my poems
are not just specifically

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:08.280
about politics, but the politics
of the people, the politics

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.420
of my mom, the politics of my
Auntie Julie, and the politics

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.690
of these ordinary people
who people aren't going

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:14.990
to remember their
names, but they're going

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:16.290
to remember their stories.

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:19.420
And they're going to
remember, "Hey, I exist,

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.660
but I have to remember I'm
in a bubble, and there are

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.540
so many people out there in the
world like me who exist too,

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.180
and who are human too."

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.510
So yes.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.880
[ Applause ]

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.180
&gt;&gt; Rumkini Kalamangalam:
Yes, definitely.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.540
I feel that because as an
Asian-American slam poet,

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:43.190
I don't see a lot of Asian
American slam poets, you know?

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:46.670
[Laughter] We're taught in our
communities that the best way

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:49.740
to go unnoticed and to
get ahead is to be silent,

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.590
and to let people
do what they want,

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.730
and then do your thing
in the background.

01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:55.970
And I'm so tired of that
narrative defining our

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:58.210
community, you know,
and defining who we are,

01:11:58.210 --> 01:11:59.800
and how we move up in life.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.120
It's like so many of our,
you know, images that we hold

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.810
up as successful end
up turning their backs

01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:08.820
on Asian American people who
don't follow in that line,

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.570
who don't want to become
doctors, who don't want

01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:14.440
to become lawyers or eng, you
know, activists and who want

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.390
to stand in solidarity
with other people of color,

01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:18.430
and other marginalized
movements.

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:21.560
And that is what is
important to me as, you know,

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.390
part of this platform
is that, you know,

01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:27.380
the title of Youth Poet Laureate
of a city or a region, or,

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.850
you know, a country
brings poetry

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:31.970
to the mainstream in some sense.

01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:35.340
You know, it brings people
who are attracted by success

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:39.030
to listen, and to listen to
what we have to say as people

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.760
who are, you know, often
dismissed as alternative.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.300
And so for me, a large part of
this is inspiring other girls

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:50.650
who -- other, you know,
Asian-American girls

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:58.510
who didn't feel like their
voices were big enough to

01:12:58.510 --> 01:13:02.100
[ Applause ]

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.010
&gt;&gt; William Lohier: And I think
I totally agree with everyone --

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:06.310
with what everyone
else has said.

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:07.690
And I think it's
really important to note

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:11.440
that for every single one of
us here, there are hundreds

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.010
and thousands of youth
that are not on this stage

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.410
that don't have the
opportunity to be here.

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:20.800
And so I think it's the
obligation I think that a lot

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.660
of what the Youth Poet
Laureate does is public,

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.300
is in front of other people,

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:29.180
but so much of that
is behind the scenes;

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:34.870
is working with those
organizations,

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:39.750
is helping the youth
in their communities

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:45.510
who don't have the kind of
platform that they have.

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:49.390
[ Applause ]

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:52.010
&gt;&gt; Milla Kudas: So ditto,
ditto, ditto, ditto.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:56.720
I also think that -- I talk
a lot about how I feel --

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.020
like maybe this could be an LA,

01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.240
that a lot of the activism
you see sometimes is very

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.840
performative in that
people will go up on a stage

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.760
and do a slam poem, and
this could be my own slam

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.060
team sometimes.

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.360
They'll like do a poem about
like women empowerment,

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.650
and then after practice
will say something to me

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:12.280
that I will not stop
thinking about for two weeks.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.150
And it will just be like
they do it for the scores,

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:15.610
but they don't really do
it in their communities;

01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:17.050
they don't really communicate
with the people around them.

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:20.220
And so my mission is
to create poetry spaces

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:23.150
that are both accessible, and
also are held accountable,

01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:25.290
in that I want to
see more people --

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:26.590
like we were talking about,

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:27.890
we all represent a different
narrative, but there are

01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:29.290
so many more narratives still.

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:30.700
And I want to invite
those narratives

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.090
to the stage to speak as well.

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:33.840
And then I think in
terms of creating

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.120
like a tangible change is like
when you're given a platform

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.210
like that like share
a GoFundMe page.

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:40.710
Like get conversations
circulating

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.680
so that we can start a grander
discussion than just my voice.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.410
And then outside of that,
I'm also really gay.

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:52.050
[Laughter] And I want to do --
I identify as fem non-binary,

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:53.940
and I feel like a lot of times,

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.720
I have to like tame this
non-binary part of myself,

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.170
and like kind of silence
the whole gender exploration

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:01.840
that is going on in my brain.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.890
And I want to not only be a
role model for other people

01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:07.060
who are just as confused
about their gender as I am,

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:12.970
but also learn from other people
and be able to create these com,

01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:17.750
and rather I feel empowered to
be as much as myself as I can be

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.910
so that I know that other
people feel that same way.

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:21.210
So yes. [Laughter]

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:22.510
&gt;&gt; Cassidy Martin: Also,

01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:26.600
[applause] like one more thing
-- I want to say one more thing.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.500
I think I can speak for all
five of us, all six of us,

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.600
all seven of us to say that
like just because we're up here,

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.910
we have a title, the real work
isn't just getting upon stage

01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:41.410
or standing up at Library of
Congress and spitting a poem.

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:45.770
It's actually going,
and teaching them.

01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:48.660
The work that is combined
just from five of us

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:52.470
up here is a whole -- is a
year's worth of blood, sweat,

01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:56.250
and tears from teenagers,
from college students,

01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:59.130
who actually go in the community
and do things besides get

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:00.550
up on stage and write poems.

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:02.960
We help kids write
their own poems.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.500
And that is what's important,
and that is the mission.

you for that question.

a local organization,

organization called

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:17.220

Just a little shout-out
for "Words Beats &amp; Life".

01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:23.240
I think we have time
for one more question,

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.170
right, so who wants it?

01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:33.150
&gt;&gt; I don't have a question, but
I would like to make a comment.

01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:38.070
I'm loving the new generation.

01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:40.650
[Inaudible] the issue
and the one I'm hearing

01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:46.040
that makes the difference is
you're not just encouraging the

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.470
young people, you're encouraging
the whole [inaudible] keep

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:51.770
doing it.

01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:54.190

don't just sit in a box,

while they were presenting

to us, and I was
writing it down.

to humor me here, okay?
