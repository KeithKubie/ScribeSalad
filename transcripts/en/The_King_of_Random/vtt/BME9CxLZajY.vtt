Rubber bands are great,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.299
and life hacks are great,

00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:04.610
and rubber band life hacks
are especially great.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.530
And today, we're gonna try out
10 of them to see which one's work,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.760
and which ones don't.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.820
[Music]

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.060
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.900
We've got 10 rubber band based
life hacks that have appeared

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.740
in several different viral videos.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.900
We're gonna put them to the test,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.620
and see which one's hold up
and which ones fall flat.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.600
Can you use a rubber band
as a pencil eraser?

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.970
I've written the same thing twice.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.970
And for the first one,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.340
I'll use the eraser that
comes with this pencil,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.020
and for the second one,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660
I'll use a couple
of different rubber bands,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.480
and see how well they'll erase it.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:53.560
[Music]

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.360
I gotta tell you.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.040
I was a little surprised
at how well this one worked.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.160
We had slightly different results

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.780
with our two different
types of rubber bands.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.440
So your mileage may vary.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.470
But overall, I think the rubber bands
did almost as good of a job

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.340
as the eraser that came on the pencil.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.980
I would say that rubber bands
as a pencil eraser works pretty well.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.660
If you have a stripped
screw in a piece of wood,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.040
can you use a rubber band to increase the
grip between the screwdriver and the screw?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.500
The idea is we can fit the
rubber band over the head of the screw

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:22.500
and the rubber will help give extra grip
between the screwdriver and the screw.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.480
This screw is pretty thoroughly stripped,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.580
and I can't really back this screw out.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.600
So let's see if we can get
any added grip with the rubber.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.620
[Music]

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.340
Well I wasn't able to back the screw out,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.620
and it felt like in about one second,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.460
I had stabbed and cut my way
right through the rubber band.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.680
Can sort of see there's a cross-shaped
hole in this rubber band now.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.740
Let's try it again with both sides of the
rubber band for extra grippiness.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.740
Oh, I think I cut through
both of them already.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.780
Yep already cut through both sides
of the rubber band at once.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.280
In my experience, if a screw
gets completely stripped,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.660
a rubber band is not going
to solve your problem.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.220
You're going to need to use specialized
tools designed for removing screws that

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.460
have been stripped away.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.000
Using a rubber band as a bookmark.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.280
In every video, I've seen
that shows this life hack,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.780
the rubber band is stretched
all the way around the open book

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.360
to keep your place where you're reading.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.600
I'm going to try this with both a
paperback and hardcover book.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.820
[Music]

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.140
This hack is that you can easily open
your book back to where you were,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.560
and just continue reading.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.760
[Music]

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.470
This does technically work.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.680
A rubber band, it does
keep your place in the book.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.480
You can open it back up,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.980
but it only a couple minutes
of having the rubber band on there,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.300
it started to leave a dent mark in the
pages where it's compressing them.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.900
It's also very easy
for the rubber band

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.280
to catch the edge of
the paper and fold it over.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.460
On some books like this one,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.600
the pages have sort of
this decorative silver edge,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760
and I don't know what it
would do to that over time,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940
but I can't imagine
it would be all the great.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.780
You know what else works
really well as a bookmark?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.320
Literally any scrap of paper.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.480
[Music]

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.800
Book marked.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.280
Can you use rubber bands
to secure a pot lid onto the pot

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.780
while it's full of something?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.600
We're gonna test this out with
some delicious water stew.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.060
Pot mostly full of water.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.060
Lid that stays on,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.420
but may not be super
resistant to sloshing.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.860
[Music]

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.020
Let's give it a good slosh.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.460
[Music]

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.240
Popped right off.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.580
Tons of water everywhere.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.800
Let's test if that's something
we can stop using rubber bands.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.480
In the videos where
I've seen this life hack,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.550
the lid is secured by
using two rubber bands.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.460
Each one goes around
one of the handles of the pot,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.780
and the handle of the lid.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.780
That seems like it could work.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.080
Often the pot lids have
more of a button style handle,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.610
which would make the rubber bands
grip onto it even better than they are here.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.209
However, this already seems
like it's doing a decent job.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.560
Let's go give it our slosh test.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.480
[Music]

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.240
Little bit still escape out the side,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.120
so it's not holding it on
pressed down super hard.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.780
Let's give it the big slosh.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.020
[Music]

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.480
Well, water still managed to escape,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.320
but the lid is still on.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.420
If tipped for just a second,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.780
not much water comes out.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.820
So let's say you're carrying it and oops...

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.420
Well, you lost a little bit,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.400
but let's try that same
test with no rubber bands.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.180
All right you're carrying it,
and drop it for just a second.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.479
That's a lot worse without rubber bands.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.320
A rubber band stretched
around a roll of toilet paper,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.120
in theory, you can pull out
the tube in the middle,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.520
and then have a handy little dispenser

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.240
that works a lot like a tissue box.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.220
Well, on this role and pretty much
every roll of toilet paper I've ever used,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.600
the toilet paper is actually
glued onto the roll itself.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.480
It means that so far,
this is a little difficult.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.620
[Music]

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.960
Yes, progress.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.380
Sort of.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.940
[Music]

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.760
All right, finally got that roll out.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.680
Now, we should be able to
just pull the inside.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.620
We have a sort of tissue dispenser,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.960
break off what you need,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.440
blow your nose,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.100
break off more,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.380
blow your nose.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.120
This works okay here
at the beginning of the roll.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.560
Let's see what happens
when we get near the end,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.640
and it still has a
rubber band wrapped around it.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.780
[Music]

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.480
This is really good use of toilet paper.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.480
[Music]

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.000
Our rubber band is now
collapsing our container.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.360
Still dispensing.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.780
Well, not anymore.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.940
[Music]

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.720
Rubber band has now 
collapsed our container

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.240
to the point where it doesn't dispense.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.020
[Music]

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.120
Now it's not even attached.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.060
With the rubber band
around the roll of toilet paper,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.480
you can pull the toilet paper
out of the middle,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.540
but unlike a tissue box,
it's not a one-handed operation.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.880
You need to use one hand to pull,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.280
and then another hand to
break off how much you want.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.220
My biggest issue with this method is
that if you already need two hands,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.540
then just use two hands,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.160
and it stays nice and contained.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.220
It's on a roll.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.360
This is exactly as easy or difficult
as it was to pull it out of the middle.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.960
It's not gonna end up
squishing itself down flat

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.820
to the point where if you try
and pull one it lifts the whole roll.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.520
In my opinion, using a rubber band to turn
a roll of toilet paper into a tissue dispenser

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.980
is much more difficult
than just using the roll,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.720
and completely pointless.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.700
By wrapping a rubber band
around the handle of some pliers,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.820
you have some convenient little
pinchers that will hold small things

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.920
while you work on them.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.740
[Music]

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.720
I love this.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.520
This is simple and this is clever,
and it works really well in my opinion.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.240
These pliers even naturally spring open.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.229
They've got a little spring built
into them that holds them apart,

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.569
but when that's not what we want,

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:07.000
a rubber band easily
overcomes that spring,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.540
and they just hold things nicely together.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.900
This is definitely something I will use.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.160
After cutting an apple,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.660
you can use a rubber band
to hold the pieces together,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.460
so it doesn't turn brown
between cutting and eating.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.140
We're gonna try two different tests.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.720
One with a cut and rubber-banded apple
next to a cut and laying open apple

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.060
to see how they compare
in terms of turning brown.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.539
[Music]

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.760
After about four hours,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.520
there's only a slight difference in color

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.900
between the apple that
was sitting open on a countertop,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.569
and the one that was being
held closed with the rubber band.

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:41.120
The other test will be a
cut and rubber-banded apple,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.479
and a cut apple placed back together

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:45.140
and both in Ziploc bags,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.260
and we're gonna let
that one go overnight.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:55.760
[Music]

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.720
Here's the apple that had the rubber band,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.340
and here's the apple that didn't.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.440
Using a rubber band to attach
a cloth to a wooden spoon

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.100
so you can use it for dusting.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.400
Well, you can attach it.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.180
That part is definitely true.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.120
[Music]

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.020
It works but I don't get it.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.260
You know what else works?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.680
Just the cloth without the
spoon or the rubber band.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.200
You can dust things with just the cloth.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.640
Possibly just as well and probably better.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.220
You can see the mark where you
have the exposed cloth on the spoon,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.680
and that was dusting,
and that part is so dirty

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.480
that it stopped picking
up the dust really quickly.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.188
And sure that means we need
to dust our blinds more,

00:08:39.188 --> 00:08:40.990
but if you're just holding the cloth,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.759
you can use all of the cloth for dusting.

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:48.790
I think it's way more likely that the
best way to clean is just use the cloth.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.760
Just wipe the dust up with that.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.740
It works just as well, if not better.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.240
This to me is just absurd.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.240
The basic idea is that if you're
going to be going in and out of a door

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.480
that tends to close and latch by itself,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.040
you can use a rubber band
stretched between the doorknobs

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.640
to hold the latch down.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.480
This can prevent it from latching
and easily let you go in and out

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.580
as much as you need.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.300
On this particular door,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.589
the door knobs are wide enough.

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:14.300
The rubber band is missing the latch,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.200
but a quick fix for that is just
to twist the rubber band once.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.540
If a single rubber band isn't holding
the latch down far enough,

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.840
just throw on a second.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.100
[Music]

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.660
The rubber bands do a great job
and depending on your door,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.380
you may need more than one or two
but I would say this definitely works.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.160
Say your hose has sprung a leak,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.920
and it's spraying water
where you don't want it to,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.880
can you use rubber bands
to stop that leak?

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.580
The idea is that by wrapping several
rubber bands tightly around the hose

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.820
right where it's leaking,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.860
you can actually stop the
leak from happening.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.320
It's quite a few rubber bands and they're
Twisted on there quite a few times.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.200
[Music]

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.120
It's still leaking.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.200
Maybe I need more rubber bands.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:13.100
[Music]

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.860
Waters flowing to the hose.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.240
[Music]

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.380
Well, it looks like we may
have stopped up the leak.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.940
At this point, I would say that
maybe this is a useful life hack.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.620
It did stop up our little leak.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.140
It wasn't a very big leak.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.240
But there is one other issue.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.260
What if your leak doesn't happen
right at the very end of the hose?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.240
What if your leak happens
more in the middle?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.200
How hard or easy would
it be to fix a leak right there?

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.900
To stop up this leak,

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.300
we had to use a lot of rubber bands,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.080
and they had to be on there pretty tight.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.020
We were able to just wrap
and wrap the rubber bands

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.660
because we were right
near the end of the hose,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.300
but if our leak is 12 feet into the hose...

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:58.060
[Music]

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.960
That's one.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.840
I need to do 15 more of those.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.459
I think it would probably be faster to
just run to the store and buy a new hose.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:11.100
That would take less time than stringing
all 15 tightly round rubber bands

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.880
over 12 feet of hose.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.040
I would say if you have a small leak
near one end of the hose or the other,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.300
you might be able to do an
okay repair using rubber bands.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.900
I would say that if your leak
is more than about six inches

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.780
from the end of the hose,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.260
it's not going to be worth the effort.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.020
I think you'd be better off using
something like some strong duct tape

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.620
or maybe a bicycle patch.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.360
Rubber bands are great,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.800
and there are a lot of cool life
hacks you can do with them.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.540
Some of them work amazingly
well and are super useful.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.060
Some of them are pointless
or don't even work.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.560
There are hundreds or
thousands of life hacks out there,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.480
and we want to start
testing some of them.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.900
Let us know what life hacks
you want to see us try.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.200
Some of them are gonna be great,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.760
and some are gonna be total junk.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.560
We want to figure out which is which.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.560
Guys, there's still more for you to see.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.240
