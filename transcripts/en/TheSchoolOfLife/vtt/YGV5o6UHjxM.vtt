00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.000
The decision whether one should stay or leave

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.420
is one of the most consequential
and painful any of us ever has to make.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.940
On any given day, many millions of people worldwide

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.880
will be secretly turning the issue over in their minds
as they go about their daily lives.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.920
Their partners beside them, possibly having little clue as to the momentous decision weighing upon them.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.320
The choice is perhaps more common now than it ever was

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
We expect to be deeply happy in love, and, therefore, spend a good deal of time

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.100
wondering whether our relationships are essentially normal in their sexual and psychological frustrations

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.320
or are beset by unusually pathological patterns which will impel us to get out as soon as we can.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.680
What films or novels we've been exposed to, the state of our friends' relationships,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.760
the degree of noise surrounding new sexually driven dating apps, not to mention how much sleep we've had

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.200
can all play humblingly large roles in influencing us one way or another.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.200
Awkwardly, it seems that no one else actually really minds what we end up doing

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.820
which gives the decision a degree of existential loneliness it might not always have possessed

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.040
Historically, the choice was, in a sense, a good deal easier

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.440
because there were simply so many stern external sanctions around not leaving:

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.780
religions would insist that god blessed unions

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.360
and would be furious that they're being torn asunder,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.960
society strongly disapproved of breakups

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.220
and cast separating parties into decades of ignominy and shame,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.180
and psychologists would explain that children would be deeply and permanently scarred

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.440
by any termination in their parents' relationship

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.880
But, one by one, these objections to quitting have fallen away;

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.780
religions no longer terrify us into staying

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.420
society doesn't care,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.060
and psychologists now routinely tell us that children

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.280
would prefer a broken family to an unhappy one

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.040
The burden of choice therefore falls squarely on us.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.500
The only thing determining whether to stay or leave is how we feel

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.360
which can be pretty hard matter indeed to work out for ourselves,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.540
our feelings having a dispirited habit of shifting and evading any efforts of rational qualification.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.120
In the circumstances, it might help to have a set of questions, devil's advocate in nature, to fall back upon -

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.260
a kind of checklist to dialogue within one's mind

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.020
in the silent hours of the morning, from the chill vantage point of the spare room couch.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.100
How much of our unhappiness can be tightly attributed to this particular partner,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.000
and how much might it, as we would risk discovering five years and multiple upheavals later,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.740
turn out to be simply and inherent feature of any attempt to live in close proximity to another human?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.200
Though it is, of course, always essentially their fault,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.780
what tiny proportion of the difficulties might we, nevertheless, be contributing to the discord?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.000
In what modest way might we be a little hard to be around?

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.300
Consider the annoying traits in all previous partners we've had

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.880
and people we've known that our current partners happen not to have

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.100
what do we manage not to fight about?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.660
Start to probe at any new infatuations or crushes, largely by getting to know them better

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.460
Observe closely how many sexually available and intelligent people

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.340
the single types around us, especially those hooked up to those new dating apps actually manage to encounter day-to-day.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.140
Try to have another converstaion with your partner in which you don't accuse them of mendacity,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.200
and instead simply explain, quite calmly, how you actually feel and how sad you are at quite a few things.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.660
Reflect on how'd you really feel as a child.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.080
If henceforth, you were to have two tiny bedrooms,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.960
two new step-parents, and possibly a few more new half-siblings.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.240
Compare with the scratchy reality of the current set up.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.460
Question how normal it is for any couple to have great sex after twenty-two months.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.560
Ask yourself if you're ready to face the risk of perhaps achieving no more

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.520
than exchanging a familiar kind of unhappiness for a new and more complex variety of unhappiness.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.760
Wonder whether you really want to choose hope over experience

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.320
Then, if you still have the impulse to leave,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.620
the chances of subsiquent regret lessened to at least a touch, a heavy heart, and a cautious mind,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.500
leave.
