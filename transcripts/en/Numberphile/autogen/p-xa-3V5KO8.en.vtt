00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.730
 
so today's video I want to talk about a

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740
so today's video I want to talk about a
 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.290
so today's video I want to talk about a
subset of problems in maths called

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300
subset of problems in maths called
 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.390
subset of problems in maths called
orchard problems which are not really to

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400
orchard problems which are not really to
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.099
orchard problems which are not really to
do with trees but it's kind of helpful

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
do with trees but it's kind of helpful
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.450
do with trees but it's kind of helpful
to think about trees so you can think of

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
to think about trees so you can think of
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.230
to think about trees so you can think of
apple trees or you can think about

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
apple trees or you can think about
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.850
apple trees or you can think about
forest fruit trees they're quite often

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
forest fruit trees they're quite often
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.759
forest fruit trees they're quite often
planted in deliberate plantation ways so

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
planted in deliberate plantation ways so
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289
planted in deliberate plantation ways so
in lines have you ever seen if you're

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
in lines have you ever seen if you're
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.120
in lines have you ever seen if you're
driving down a road and there's a huge

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
driving down a road and there's a huge
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.920
driving down a road and there's a huge
vineyard you get this weird effect when

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
vineyard you get this weird effect when
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.150
vineyard you get this weird effect when
you see something that you see you look

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
you see something that you see you look
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.290
you see something that you see you look
down the video and you see just a line

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
down the video and you see just a line
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.490
down the video and you see just a line
of trees and then suddenly move a bit

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
of trees and then suddenly move a bit
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.509
of trees and then suddenly move a bit
and you see that this stretches on

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
and you see that this stretches on
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.160
and you see that this stretches on
forever and as you move you get this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
forever and as you move you get this
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.450
forever and as you move you get this
light coming in and out of phase and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
light coming in and out of phase and
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.919
light coming in and out of phase and
it's quite a nice effect actually

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929
it's quite a nice effect actually
 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.299
it's quite a nice effect actually
there's a lot of mass to ask about these

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
there's a lot of mass to ask about these
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.100
there's a lot of mass to ask about these
things like which trees can you see at

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
things like which trees can you see at
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290
things like which trees can you see at
any one point at which trees can you not

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
any one point at which trees can you not
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000
any one point at which trees can you not
see and can you see out when you walked

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
see and can you see out when you walked
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.740
see and can you see out when you walked
into other trees in the way and does it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
into other trees in the way and does it
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.760
into other trees in the way and does it
matter where you stand and that's the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
matter where you stand and that's the
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.110
matter where you stand and that's the
sort of thing that often gets described

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
sort of thing that often gets described
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119
sort of thing that often gets described
as orchard problems and the one I want

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
as orchard problems and the one I want
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.619
as orchard problems and the one I want
to show you it's a simple one where

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
to show you it's a simple one where
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.600
to show you it's a simple one where
they're surprising the unexpected answer

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
they're surprising the unexpected answer
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400
they're surprising the unexpected answer
imagine you're standing at the edge of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
imagine you're standing at the edge of
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380
imagine you're standing at the edge of
an infinite forest or orchard this is a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
an infinite forest or orchard this is a
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240
an infinite forest or orchard this is a
mathematical one so the trees are thin

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
mathematical one so the trees are thin
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.130
mathematical one so the trees are thin
and and all the trees are on coordinate

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
and and all the trees are on coordinate
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.420
and and all the trees are on coordinate
points so if you imagine a coordinate

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
points so if you imagine a coordinate
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250
points so if you imagine a coordinate
grid that they call this lattice points

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
grid that they call this lattice points
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990
grid that they call this lattice points
in the trade the points with integer

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
in the trade the points with integer
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.270
in the trade the points with integer
coordinates so 1 comma 1 1 comma 2 and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
coordinates so 1 comma 1 1 comma 2 and
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189
coordinates so 1 comma 1 1 comma 2 and
I'm just gonna put loads of trees on

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
I'm just gonna put loads of trees on
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.690
I'm just gonna put loads of trees on
this because this is gonna be where

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
this because this is gonna be where
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.920
this because this is gonna be where
we're gonna play for a while we're gonna

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
we're gonna play for a while we're gonna
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.480
we're gonna play for a while we're gonna
play in the orchard for a bit let's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
play in the orchard for a bit let's
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789
play in the orchard for a bit let's
start as in all good mathematical models

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
start as in all good mathematical models
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.649
start as in all good mathematical models
by keeping it simple and later on we can

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
by keeping it simple and later on we can
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.210
by keeping it simple and later on we can
upgrade that but so the simplest ways to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
upgrade that but so the simplest ways to
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.320
upgrade that but so the simplest ways to
assume that they're mathematically thin

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
assume that they're mathematically thin
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880
assume that they're mathematically thin
they're points which is obviously not

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
they're points which is obviously not
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.530
they're points which is obviously not
what real trees do but we'll ask

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
what real trees do but we'll ask
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999
what real trees do but we'll ask
questions about that before we upgrade

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
questions about that before we upgrade
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.289
questions about that before we upgrade
the model to be more realistic well kind

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
the model to be more realistic well kind
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.090
the model to be more realistic well kind
of but if you look directly at it there

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
of but if you look directly at it there
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.590
of but if you look directly at it there
is a tree there and actually that's what

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
is a tree there and actually that's what
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.580
is a tree there and actually that's what
I'm when I start asking about which

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
I'm when I start asking about which
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.050
I'm when I start asking about which
trees can you see so I'm gonna imagine

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
trees can you see so I'm gonna imagine
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.399
trees can you see so I'm gonna imagine
that for the sake of the rest of this

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
that for the sake of the rest of this
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.899
that for the sake of the rest of this
argument we're gonna stand the origin

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
argument we're gonna stand the origin
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609
argument we're gonna stand the origin
and I could have done all the trees

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
and I could have done all the trees
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.990
and I could have done all the trees
going over here and down here but we'll

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
going over here and down here but we'll
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.249
going over here and down here but we'll
just work with this quadrant and you can

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
just work with this quadrant and you can
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:37.969
just work with this quadrant and you can
extend it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
extend it
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310
extend it
in your own mind if you wish and the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
in your own mind if you wish and the
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.690
in your own mind if you wish and the
real question is if all these trees are

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
real question is if all these trees are
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.429
real question is if all these trees are
out there and they carry on forever this

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
out there and they carry on forever this
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830
out there and they carry on forever this
is an infinite forest so it doesn't end

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
is an infinite forest so it doesn't end
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.749
is an infinite forest so it doesn't end
in those directions there are a lot of

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
in those directions there are a lot of
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.039
in those directions there are a lot of
trees I'm gonna just put that out there

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
trees I'm gonna just put that out there
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.499
trees I'm gonna just put that out there
there's possibly some level of infinity

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
there's possibly some level of infinity
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.330
there's possibly some level of infinity
number of trees and I think you can see

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
number of trees and I think you can see
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.859
number of trees and I think you can see
some of them although your caveat is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
some of them although your caveat is
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749
some of them although your caveat is
noted that mathematically thin things

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
noted that mathematically thin things
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.039
noted that mathematically thin things
are gonna be harder to see than real

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
are gonna be harder to see than real
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350
are gonna be harder to see than real
trees but if I for example if I stab

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
trees but if I for example if I stab
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389
trees but if I for example if I stab
this point and I look directly

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
this point and I look directly
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.870
this point and I look directly
forty-five degrees into the forest I can

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
forty-five degrees into the forest I can
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.570
forty-five degrees into the forest I can
see that tree like if I get it right I

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
see that tree like if I get it right I
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580
see that tree like if I get it right I
can see that tree obviously if it's thin

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
can see that tree obviously if it's thin
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.290
can see that tree obviously if it's thin
maybe as hard at sea but I also can't

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
maybe as hard at sea but I also can't
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.400
maybe as hard at sea but I also can't
see the trees behind it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
see the trees behind it
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.170
see the trees behind it
they're directly in line so there are

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
they're directly in line so there are
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.190
they're directly in line so there are
some obvious questions which are not

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
some obvious questions which are not
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.110
some obvious questions which are not
interesting yet but about visibility and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
interesting yet but about visibility and
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.940
interesting yet but about visibility and
so a lot of these problems are also

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
so a lot of these problems are also
 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.440
so a lot of these problems are also
called visibility problems or latus

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
called visibility problems or latus
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.060
called visibility problems or latus
problems I likely err more poetic

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070
problems I likely err more poetic
 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.800
problems I likely err more poetic
orchard problems think there's the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
orchard problems think there's the
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.150
orchard problems think there's the
question and I can ask you this Brady if

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
question and I can ask you this Brady if
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.950
question and I can ask you this Brady if
you're standing at this corner I'm gonna

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960
you're standing at this corner I'm gonna
 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.630
you're standing at this corner I'm gonna
claim you can see some trees for example

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
claim you can see some trees for example
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.370
claim you can see some trees for example
when you can see that tree if you look

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
when you can see that tree if you look
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020
when you can see that tree if you look
in the right direction you can also see

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030
in the right direction you can also see
 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.640
in the right direction you can also see
that tree if you look along with that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650
that tree if you look along with that
 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.740
that tree if you look along with that
direction and you would then hide that

direction and you would then hide that
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.660

tree and actually behind it so some

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
tree and actually behind it so some
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.920

directions you look you can see trees

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
directions you look you can see trees
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.110

see a tree eventually and I'm interested

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
see a tree eventually and I'm interested
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.440
see a tree eventually and I'm interested
in your intuition about this my

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
in your intuition about this my
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.430
in your intuition about this my
intuition is no because eventually if

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
intuition is no because eventually if
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.500
intuition is no because eventually if
you go far enough you do a hit one even

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
you go far enough you do a hit one even
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.730
you go far enough you do a hit one even
if you like carve out to miss the first

if you like carve out to miss the first
few than he goes upriver now I have the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
few than he goes upriver now I have the
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.840
few than he goes upriver now I have the
same intuition about that and the answer

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
same intuition about that and the answer
 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.700
same intuition about that and the answer
is not as simple as that the other

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710
is not as simple as that the other
 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.990

standard answers to this question are

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
standard answers to this question are
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880
standard answers to this question are
you look up no trees up there which is

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
you look up no trees up there which is
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.740
you look up no trees up there which is
great it's hilarious but if you look

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750
great it's hilarious but if you look
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.150
great it's hilarious but if you look
along the axes there are trees on there

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
along the axes there are trees on there
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.280
along the axes there are trees on there
as well so I think it's obvious I'm

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
as well so I think it's obvious I'm
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.540
as well so I think it's obvious I'm
gonna claim it obvious that you can see

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550
gonna claim it obvious that you can see
 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.460
gonna claim it obvious that you can see
some trees is it all trees or are there

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
some trees is it all trees or are there
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.050
some trees is it all trees or are there
gaps and where are the gaps if there

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
gaps and where are the gaps if there
 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.920
gaps and where are the gaps if there
already and that's that's what we're

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930
already and that's that's what we're
 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.990
already and that's that's what we're
gonna play with because it's it's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
gonna play with because it's it's
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
gonna play with because it's it's
surprisingly easy to answer so the first

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
surprisingly easy to answer so the first
 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.440
surprisingly easy to answer so the first
thing I'd to point out is that I know

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
thing I'd to point out is that I know
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.500
thing I'd to point out is that I know
which tree I can see based on what angle

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510
which tree I can see based on what angle
 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.390
which tree I can see based on what angle
I look on the line actually the angle is

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400
I look on the line actually the angle is
 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.190
I look on the line actually the angle is
not so important as the gradient so if

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200
not so important as the gradient so if
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.180
not so important as the gradient so if
you're standing here and you look along

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190
you're standing here and you look along
 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.360
you're standing here and you look along
an angle of 45 degrees there then you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
an angle of 45 degrees there then you
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.830
an angle of 45 degrees there then you
will see this tree and that's got a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
will see this tree and that's got a
 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.470
will see this tree and that's got a
coordinate of 1 comma 1 now actually the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
coordinate of 1 comma 1 now actually the
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080
coordinate of 1 comma 1 now actually the
45 degrees is pretty intuitive but it's

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090
45 degrees is pretty intuitive but it's
 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.970
45 degrees is pretty intuitive but it's
also a gradient of 1 and just a mighty

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980
also a gradient of 1 and just a mighty
 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.280
also a gradient of 1 and just a mighty
what a gradient it's like how far along

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
what a gradient it's like how far along
 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.110
what a gradient it's like how far along
you go for how far up you go for

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120
you go for how far up you go for
 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.729
you go for how far up you go for
everyone along rise over run is the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739
everyone along rise over run is the
 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.199

line here I'm less worried about well

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
line here I'm less worried about well
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.270
line here I'm less worried about well
the angle as I could work it out but I

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280
the angle as I could work it out but I
 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.530
the angle as I could work it out but I
need some trigonometry but I can tell

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540
need some trigonometry but I can tell
 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.540
need some trigonometry but I can tell
you the gradient of that line the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550
you the gradient of that line the
 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.840
you the gradient of that line the
gradient here equals 2 and it's hit the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850
gradient here equals 2 and it's hit the
 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.020
gradient here equals 2 and it's hit the
tree at 1 comma 2 so I'm gonna claim

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
tree at 1 comma 2 so I'm gonna claim
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.310
tree at 1 comma 2 so I'm gonna claim
that if I know I'm gonna hit a tree it

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320
that if I know I'm gonna hit a tree it
 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.660
that if I know I'm gonna hit a tree it
can probably calculate the gradient of

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670
can probably calculate the gradient of
 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.479
can probably calculate the gradient of
the line I hit so if I picked this point

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
the line I hit so if I picked this point
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.090
the line I hit so if I picked this point
he is that gonna be good well that's 1 2

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100
he is that gonna be good well that's 1 2
 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.909
he is that gonna be good well that's 1 2
3 4 5 and 2 up so it's the point 5 comma

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919
3 4 5 and 2 up so it's the point 5 comma
 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.090
3 4 5 and 2 up so it's the point 5 comma
2 and actually I can work out which line

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100
2 and actually I can work out which line
 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.220
2 and actually I can work out which line
will hit it because it's got a go

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230
will hit it because it's got a go
 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.290
will hit it because it's got a go
there and it will carry on but because

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300
there and it will carry on but because
 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.580
there and it will carry on but because
I've got a lion I've got some distances

I can work out the gradient of this one

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
I can work out the gradient of this one

know which lines will hit which trees

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510
know which lines will hit which trees
 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.330

tree eventually right you're worried
 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.320
tree eventually right you're worried
that you wouldn't well if we can make a

hi-hi is one of those massively annoying
numbers it turns up everywhere you don't

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150
numbers it turns up everywhere you don't
 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.090
numbers it turns up everywhere you don't
expect but that's just one example of a

just claimed to it it's not built of
 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.670
just claimed to it it's not built of
integers or in ratios or integers and

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680
integers or in ratios or integers and
 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.260
integers or in ratios or integers and
this is where they get the word rational

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270
this is where they get the word rational
 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.750
this is where they get the word rational
because of that ratio of integers so

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760
because of that ratio of integers so
 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.130
because of that ratio of integers so
ratio naught would be better

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140
ratio naught would be better
 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.200
ratio naught would be better

look so these are all rational numbers

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590
look so these are all rational numbers
 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.890

if I look along a rational gradient

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900
if I look along a rational gradient
 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.660
if I look along a rational gradient
I will hit a tree so if you looked along

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670
I will hit a tree so if you looked along
 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.630
I will hit a tree so if you looked along
a line of gradient you said pie

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640
a line of gradient you said pie
 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.460
a line of gradient you said pie
well pie is close to 3 so the gradient

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470
well pie is close to 3 so the gradient
 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.720
well pie is close to 3 so the gradient
is roughly 3 it would go

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730
is roughly 3 it would go
 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.310

one ish so you kind of head up there it
 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.000
one ish so you kind of head up there it
would be something like this line but it

would be something like this line but it
 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.530
would be something like this line but it
would miss that tree anyway up here it's

would miss that tree anyway up here it's
 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.780
would miss that tree anyway up here it's
not obvious to me where it would go next

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790
not obvious to me where it would go next
 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.000
not obvious to me where it would go next
or in fact whether it would here tree

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010
or in fact whether it would here tree
 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.430
or in fact whether it would here tree
unless I know something about pie which

unless I know something about pie which
 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.780
unless I know something about pie which
you've kind of mentioned that it is

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790
you've kind of mentioned that it is
 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.720
you've kind of mentioned that it is
irrational it's not a ratio now if it

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730
irrational it's not a ratio now if it
 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.970
irrational it's not a ratio now if it
was a ratio it would hit a tree since

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980
was a ratio it would hit a tree since
 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.070
was a ratio it would hit a tree since
it's not a ratio

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080
it's not a ratio
 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.810
it's not a ratio
it can't here tree that's gonna just

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820
it can't here tree that's gonna just
 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.300
it can't here tree that's gonna just
miss the 22 over 7 tree it's gonna be

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.470
miss the 22 over 7 tree it's gonna be
really close to it because these

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480
really close to it because these
 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.420
really close to it because these
ridiculously close to 22 up seven pie is

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430
ridiculously close to 22 up seven pie is
 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.070
ridiculously close to 22 up seven pie is
really well approximated by that

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080
really well approximated by that
 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.180
really well approximated by that
rational number and there's some other

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190
rational number and there's some other
 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.040
rational number and there's some other
really good ones too but it is gonna

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050
really good ones too but it is gonna
 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.720
really good ones too but it is gonna
miss because if it didn't miss it would

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730
miss because if it didn't miss it would
 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.180
miss because if it didn't miss it would
be a rational number now there are lots

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:34.710
my head being standard in a forest of
 

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.930
my head being standard in a forest of
infinite trees and not see any of them

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940
infinite trees and not see any of them
 

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.209
infinite trees and not see any of them
which is where the mathematical model

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219
which is where the mathematical model
 

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:39.589
which is where the mathematical model
comes into question like ok because

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599
comes into question like ok because
 

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.150
comes into question like ok because
they're infinitely thin you could stay

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.160
they're infinitely thin you could stay
 

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.500
they're infinitely thin you could stay
upgrade than the model you could say

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:42.510
upgrade than the model you could say
 

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.270
upgrade than the model you could say
well what if the trees are a little bit

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.280
well what if the trees are a little bit
 

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.400
well what if the trees are a little bit
thick or maybe if you if you think about

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.410
thick or maybe if you if you think about
 

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.960
thick or maybe if you if you think about
this is firing a laser beam and the

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:47.970
this is firing a laser beam and the
 

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.650
this is firing a laser beam and the
order

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660
order
 

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.120
order
then you could say what if my laser beam

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.130
then you could say what if my laser beam
 

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.010
then you could say what if my laser beam
is a little bit thick and it's very easy

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.020
is a little bit thick and it's very easy
 

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.320
is a little bit thick and it's very easy
to start realizing that eventually when

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:54.330
to start realizing that eventually when
 

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.180
to start realizing that eventually when
the thickness comes in you do get trees

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.190
the thickness comes in you do get trees
 

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.890
the thickness comes in you do get trees
blocking away and you're going to forest

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:57.900
blocking away and you're going to forest
 

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.200
blocking away and you're going to forest
or you see is trees which is different

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.210
or you see is trees which is different
 

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.730
or you see is trees which is different
from what we just explained but the

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740
from what we just explained but the
 

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.930
from what we just explained but the
question is how far can you see into the

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940
question is how far can you see into the
 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.770
question is how far can you see into the
forest and there something we've got

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:03.780
forest and there something we've got
 

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.540
forest and there something we've got
quite a real-life question of like what

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:05.550
quite a real-life question of like what
 

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.980
quite a real-life question of like what
how far does this lay they actually get

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:06.990
how far does this lay they actually get
 

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.690
how far does this lay they actually get
before it gets blocked by tree or depend

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700
before it gets blocked by tree or depend
 

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.400
before it gets blocked by tree or depend
on the thickness that depend on maybe

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.410
on the thickness that depend on maybe
 

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.530
on the thickness that depend on maybe
the size of the orchard and so those

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540
the size of the orchard and so those
 

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.630
the size of the orchard and so those
questions become orchard problems and

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640
questions become orchard problems and
 

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.250
questions become orchard problems and
the the famous one is Polly's orchard

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260
the the famous one is Polly's orchard
 

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.780
the the famous one is Polly's orchard
problem if you want to look it up it's

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:17.790
problem if you want to look it up it's
 

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.670
problem if you want to look it up it's
to do with how far can you see or could

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680
to do with how far can you see or could
 

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.660
to do with how far can you see or could
you get out with the wood with your

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:20.670
you get out with the wood with your
 

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.640
you get out with the wood with your
laser depending on the size of the

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:22.650
laser depending on the size of the
 

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.380
laser depending on the size of the
orchard and it's saying that if the

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:24.390
orchard and it's saying that if the
 

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.380

first of all you're gonna go near one

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.450
first of all you're gonna go near one
 

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.319
first of all you're gonna go near one
but maybe there's a line which is least

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:26.329
but maybe there's a line which is least
 

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:28.930
but maybe there's a line which is least
near it's still gonna be near I'm gonna

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:28.940
near it's still gonna be near I'm gonna
 

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.040
near it's still gonna be near I'm gonna
fail and maybe you could argue

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.050
fail and maybe you could argue
 

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.060
fail and maybe you could argue
mathematically you gonna get pretty

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:31.070
mathematically you gonna get pretty
 

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.040

pound close but anyway the idea that

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.050
pound close but anyway the idea that
 

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.449
pound close but anyway the idea that
there may be a line which there's least

00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:34.459
there may be a line which there's least
 

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:36.790
there may be a line which there's least
near means there's a most irrational

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800
near means there's a most irrational
 

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.579
near means there's a most irrational
number and actually it is this line the

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:39.589
number and actually it is this line the
 

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:41.050

reason is I'm not gonna go into now but

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:41.060
reason is I'm not gonna go into now but
 

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.250
reason is I'm not gonna go into now but
there are some interesting familiarities
