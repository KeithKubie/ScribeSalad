Back in the second season of my
show,

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:05.838 line:0%
<i> I gave Los Angeles-based
 realtor Sue Stanford</i>

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:09.142 line:0%
<i> the idea of capitalizing
 on the 50% of people</i>

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.310 line:0%
<i> who believe in ghosts
 by specializing in</i>

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:14.814 line:0%
<i> the sale
 of ghost-free homes.</i>

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.449 size:88% position:44%
- That's really a wild idea.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.084
<i> - So after giving
 her marketing</i>

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.519
<i> a complete overhaul...</i>

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:23.656
- Oh, my gosh.
That's amazing.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.359
<i> - I paired her up with
 professional psychic Ron Bard</i>

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.227
<i> to help her detect
 any ghosts that</i>

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.630
<i> might be lurking
 in her properties.</i>

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.900
- Definitely a change of energy.
You feel that, correct?

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.301 align:end position:100%
- Mm-hmm. Definitely.
I feel,

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.903 align:end position:100%
like, chills
coming down my spine.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.571
- Right.
- Is it a ghost?

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:39.806
- No.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.574
<i> - What I never saw coming</i>

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.509
<i> was that Sue herself had
 had intimate encounters</i>

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.211
<i> with spirits in her past.</i>

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
- It's like--you know
what an incubus is?

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:52.285
It's a ghost that will have sex
with someone until they die.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.687 align:start size:56% position:44%
- Wow. That's like
what I experienced

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.056 align:start size:81% position:19%
when I was in Switzerland.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.791
- What happened
in Switzerland?

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.493 align:start size:81% position:19%
- When I was being choked?

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.028
- You were being choked
in Switzerland?

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.229 align:start size:34% position:66%
- Yeah, I--

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.564 align:start position:0%
- We were just talking
about that.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.199
- What?
- Yeah, uh, earlier--

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.934
- Choked by what?
- By an entity like that.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.469 align:end position:100%
I felt like
I was being picked--

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.270
- Wait, a ghost choked you
in Switzerland?

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:12.905
- Yes.
- Wow.

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:14.574
<i> The filming of
 the ghost realtor episode</i>

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.142
<i> turned out to be an intense</i>

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.044
<i> personal experience for Sue.</i>

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.745 align:end position:100%
- Come out!
Come out, evil spirits!

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:21.581
- [sobbing]
- Come out, evil spirits!

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.816 align:end position:100%
Demons messing up with
the vertebras in the neck.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.151
Leave now.
- Uh...

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.519
- Leave now!
- Okay!

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.321
- Leave, leave! Leave!
- Stop it!

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.822
- Leave! Leave!
- Stop it!

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.524
<i> - But with
 so many distractions,</i>

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:33.226
<i> it was hard to tell
 at the time</i>

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.861
<i> what she really thought
 of my idea.</i>

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.530
Are you okay, Sue?
- Yeah. Actually, I'm fine.

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:40.266
I think I'm in--
feeling a little relief now.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.802
It's amazing.

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:44.470
[sighs]

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:46.873
<i> - It's been three years
 since I rebranded Sue</i>

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.574
<i> as The Ghost Realtor,
 and when I recently</i>

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.376
<i> checked out her website,
 I was delighted</i>

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.411
<i> to discover that
 she'd not only continued</i>

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:54.914
<i> to use my idea
 in her real estate practice</i>

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.983
<i> but had gone as far
 as teaming up</i>

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.451
<i> with Ron Bard the psychic</i>

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.986
<i> and a small-time
 production company</i>

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.721
<i> to create a television pilot</i>

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.789
<i> for a "Ghost Realtor"
 reality series</i>

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.758
<i> that she was pitching
 around town.</i>

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.460
<i> - I feel kind of funny
 in here.</i>

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.395
<i> This is--this is not good.</i>

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:12.532
<i> - We're putting salt
 in the corners</i>

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.800
<i> to disperse the negative energ.</i>

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.904
<i> If this was my house,
 I'd burn this shit down.</i>

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:21.908
<i> - I was so proud of how far
 Sue had run with my idea.</i>

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.443 line:0%
How are you, Sue?

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.048 line:0%
<i> - But when I gave her a call
 to schedule a follow-up,</i>

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:31.384 line:0%
<i> she shared some sad news.</i>

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.093 line:0%
- Oh, I'm sorry, Sue.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:43.563
<i> But she told me she was now
 working with a new psychic,</i>

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.298
<i> and she wanted me
 to come meet him.</i>

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.766
<i> So at Sue's insistence,</i>

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.634
<i> I paid her a visit
 at her home.</i>

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.002
- I want you to meet--
- Hi.

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:51.637
- Hey, Nathan.
- Joshua.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.206
- Good to meet you.
- Nathan, good to meet you.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.574
- Good to meet you.
- J-Joshua?

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.175
- Yes, sir.
- Good to meet you.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.276 align:start position:0% line:0%
- So I'm what's known
as a psychic medium,

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.778 size:84% position:42% line:0%
but I'm also clairsentient,

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:01.514 align:start position:0% line:0%
which means that I feel,
uh, my angels.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:04.217 align:start position:0% line:0%
I'm also clairvoyant,
which means I can see.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
I'm also clairaudient,
which is--most of the time,

00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:09.655 align:start position:0%
I actually hear--
I hear voices.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:13.092 align:start position:0%
and, uh, I also do
financial advising.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.594
- Oh, okay.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.697 align:start position:0%
- Uh, it's--utilizing
spirit with everything.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.632
<i> - Sue told me
 she was still working hard</i>

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.968
<i> to get the "Ghost Realtor"
 show off the ground,</i>

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.704
<i> and she even hoped that Ron
 could still be a part of it.</i>

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.706 align:end position:100%
- He probably can help us
from the other side, also.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.507
- Yes, definitely.
- Mm-hmm.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.209
- That's a great point.
- Yeah, it truly is.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:31.978 align:start position:0%
- We call on Ron
when we need some help.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.346
[chuckles]
- Definitely.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.514 align:start size:78% position:22%
- So you can talk to Ron?

00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:38.384 align:end position:100%
Even though he's gone,
you can still...

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:41.020 align:start position:0%
- Sure, and, you know,
I can do--I could try

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.321 align:start position:0%
communicating with Ron
right now,

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:44.123
if you all would like.
- Mm-hmm.

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:46.926
- Right now?
- Sure.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.229
- Why not?

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.165 size:88% position:44%
- So dear Mother-Father God,

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:54.500 align:start position:0%
how grateful am I
just for this...

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.736 align:start position:0%
vortex, for this space,
for this time.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
Grateful am I just for
all of the angelic beings

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.774 align:start position:0%
that are in this home,

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.343 align:start position:0%
and as we evoke
the spirit of Ron,

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:09.148 align:start position:0%
we are grateful that
Sue, myself, and Nathan,

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.217
as a collective consciousness,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.353 align:start position:0%
that we are open
and available.

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:17.356 align:start position:0%
Okay, go ahead.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.725
- Go ahead?

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.228 align:end position:100%
- Do you want to ask
a question?

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.730
- Uh, for Ron?

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:26.466
- Yes.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.469
- Um...

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:35.675
Did he enjoy his
experience, uh, on the show?

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.177
- Yes.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.746
- Great. Um...

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.985 align:start position:0%
- Are there any more questions
that you--that you have?

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:52.025
- I guess, how does he feel
about you replacing him?

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.565
- Uh, he says it's good.

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.367
He says he knows--
he says

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.537
that I've got
a good heart. Um...

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.939 size:78% position:39%
So he--he says it's good.

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:09.542
- That's good.

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:13.312 align:start position:0%
- Do you have any other
questions, Nathan?

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:15.781
- Um...

00:05:15.814 --> 00:05:18.384
I know, on the show,
he mentioned

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:21.320
that he worked
on the O.J. trial.

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:24.357 align:start position:0%
- Uhh, worked on O.J.'s
defense team...

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.791
- You worked on O.J.'s case?

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:27.560
- Yeah.
- So do you think he's innocent?

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:29.995
- He was definitely innocent.

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:32.631
- O.J.
- Definitely.

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:36.402
- Now that he's...
on the other side,

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:39.372
does he have
any clearer info on,

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:43.042
maybe, who
the real killer was?

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
- He--he does,
uh, but I don't--

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:50.750 align:start position:0%
I'm not getting a name or
anything like that right now.

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.018
- He knows who the killer is?

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:56.422
- Yeah. They--yes.

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:59.325
- Was it O.J.?

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.428
- This is not coming from Ron.

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:06.432 align:start position:0%
This is coming from me,
and that answer is yes.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:08.501
- But Ron's
not telling you that.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:13.038 size:81% position:41%
- Every time I present him
with that, he steps back.

00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.007
- Who's telling you then?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.377
- My own connection with--
with my own--

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.414
with my own spirit guides.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.115
- Okay.

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:24.517
Cool.

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.420 align:start size:69% position:31%
- That's how it works.

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:28.587 align:start size:34% position:66%
- Bye, Sue.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.889
- Bye, honey. You take care.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.524
[gasps]
Oh, I got a little kiss.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.058
- Yeah, of course.
- That's so sweet.

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:34.493 align:start size:66% position:34%
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:35.594
- Okay. Well,
thanks for coming by.

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:36.796 size:88% position:56%
- It's only--only for women.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:40.132
[laughter]

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:41.834
<i> It was great to see that Sue</i>

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.170
<i> and her new psychic
 got along so well,</i>

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:46.272
<i> and even though
 it was sad that Ron had died,</i>

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:49.108
<i> I was happy he'd still be
 able to guide them</i>

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:51.110
<i> from the other side.</i>
