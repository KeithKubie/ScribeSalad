talk about police reform we don't want
 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.980
talk about police reform we don't want
to believe that that dead man perhaps

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990
to believe that that dead man perhaps
 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.440
to believe that that dead man perhaps
didn't deserve to be killed we want our

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450
didn't deserve to be killed we want our
 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.870
didn't deserve to be killed we want our
police shootings or killings are police

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880
police shootings or killings are police
 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.640
police shootings or killings are police
officers we want them to fit into a

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650
officers we want them to fit into a
 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.960
officers we want them to fit into a
tight little narrative we want to be

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970
tight little narrative we want to be
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.250
tight little narrative we want to be
able to put a bow on them and say well

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260
able to put a bow on them and say well
 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.440
able to put a bow on them and say well
police shoot bad guys and that's what

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450
police shoot bad guys and that's what
 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.420
police shoot bad guys and that's what
happens and we want to absolve ourselves

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430
happens and we want to absolve ourselves
 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.400
happens and we want to absolve ourselves
emotionally of having to think about it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410
emotionally of having to think about it
 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.500
emotionally of having to think about it
anymore and I think that what video does

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510
anymore and I think that what video does
 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.690
anymore and I think that what video does
is it complicates that narrative it

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700
is it complicates that narrative it
 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.090
is it complicates that narrative it
complicates this good guy bad guy

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100
complicates this good guy bad guy
 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.070
complicates this good guy bad guy
narrative right we teach our kids to

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080
narrative right we teach our kids to
 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.290
narrative right we teach our kids to
play cops and robbers right then that

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300
play cops and robbers right then that
 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.330
play cops and robbers right then that
these interactions of the police are on

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340
these interactions of the police are on
 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.940
these interactions of the police are on
this binary or either you have a copy of

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950
this binary or either you have a copy of
 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.950
this binary or either you have a copy of
the robber the cop is always the good

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960
the robber the cop is always the good
 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.190
the robber the cop is always the good
guy and the robber is always the bad guy

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200
guy and the robber is always the bad guy
 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.770
guy and the robber is always the bad guy
and I think that what we've seen brought

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780
and I think that what we've seen brought
 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.210
and I think that what we've seen brought
to light via this protest movement in

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220
to light via this protest movement in
 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.860
to light via this protest movement in
via this moment where we're talking

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870
via this moment where we're talking
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.170
via this moment where we're talking
about policing with this nuance in this

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180
about policing with this nuance in this
 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.030
about policing with this nuance in this
level is if that is not in fact how it

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040
level is if that is not in fact how it
 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.560
level is if that is not in fact how it
always works and then you have police

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570
always works and then you have police
 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.510
always works and then you have police
shootings of people perhaps even who

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520
shootings of people perhaps even who
 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.280
shootings of people perhaps even who
were the bad guy who had committed a

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290
were the bad guy who had committed a
 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.040
were the bad guy who had committed a
crime but that does not erase the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050
crime but that does not erase the
 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.600
crime but that does not erase the
question

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610
question
 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.330
question
okay but should this person be dead and

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340
okay but should this person be dead and
 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.649
okay but should this person be dead and
there's a nuance their right and I think

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659
there's a nuance their right and I think
 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.029
there's a nuance their right and I think
that again that's a new ones that were

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039
that again that's a new ones that were
 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.740
that again that's a new ones that were
uncomfortable with we're very often

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750
uncomfortable with we're very often
 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.929
uncomfortable with we're very often
uncomfortable questioning that type of

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939
uncomfortable questioning that type of
 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.939
uncomfortable questioning that type of
Police Authority because because it

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949
Police Authority because because it
 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.950
Police Authority because because it
raises these real questions about what

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960
raises these real questions about what
 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.510
raises these real questions about what
is the role of the government and the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520
is the role of the government and the
 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.490
is the role of the government and the
police in our lives and who should be

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
police in our lives and who should be
 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.260
police in our lives and who should be
dead and who should not be but but I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270
dead and who should not be but but I
 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.369
dead and who should not be but but I
think that you know I definitely think

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379
think that you know I definitely think
 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.830
think that you know I definitely think
video it beautifully complicates that

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840
video it beautifully complicates that
 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.790
video it beautifully complicates that
and forces us to grapple with what might

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800
and forces us to grapple with what might
 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.740
and forces us to grapple with what might
actually lead to different outcomes

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750
actually lead to different outcomes
 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.689
actually lead to different outcomes
right and I think that that's kind of

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699
right and I think that that's kind of
 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:04.960
right and I think that that's kind of
the point of what a lot of the activism

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970
 
 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.359
