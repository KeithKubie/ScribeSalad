00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:03.795
rst Ladyship
was really a transition

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:07.382
from the old and the new
versions of womanhood.

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.218
(upbeat music)

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:13.680
- Lou Hoover was not only
considered a tough woman,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.014
she was an intellect.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:18.017
- She was actually one
of the very first women

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.186
in the country to
hold a geology degree.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:23.690
- She had met another person
interested in geology,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.025
and his name was Herbert Hoover.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.779
- Eventually her purposed
marriage and she accepted.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.741
Soon after, his mining company
transferred him to China.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.535
They took a steamer there
from their honeymoon.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.537
She learned Mandarin Chinese.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.956
- When she and her
husband were in China,

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.958
they got caught up
right in the middle of

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.418
the Boxer Rebellion.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.129
- This was a violent Chinese
Nationalist uprising.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.883
- She was more concerned
about getting food and aid

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.094
to the other individuals in the
compound that they lived in,

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.888
more so than her own safety.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.224
She literally got on a
bicycle and carried things

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.226
as bullets were
flying back and forth.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.896
One of bullets hit the
spoke of the bicycle

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.314
that she was riding on.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.316
She lived through
that, survived it.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:07.901
She just carried on.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.987
Lou Hoover loved the outdoors.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:14.324
And she was not afraid of
being athletic as well.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.326
- She was Vice President of

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.995
the Women's Amateur
Athletic Association.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:22.248
She thought that girls
participating in sport,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.460
being outside, getting
exercise, could be tremendously

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.088
beneficial for their physical
and emotional wellbeing.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.341
She was also very involved
with the Girl Scouts.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.761
She was national President of
the Girl Scouts in the 1920s

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.764
and then Honorary President
when she was First Lady.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.141
- She believed that the
mission of the Girl Scouts

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.102
was helpful to
the entire nation.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.271
She believed strongly
that girls and women

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.815
should be educated.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.359
That girls and women should
take part in the body politic.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.278
- She often time used her
role with the Girl Scouts

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.364
as a way to kind of
reach American women

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:58.618
and American girls and teach
them how they could help out

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.204
their communities
during the Depression.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.040
- Lou Henry Hoover had
a strong sense of self.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.667
So when the time
came as First Lady

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.211
to invite all the congressional
wives to the White House,

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.506
she decided she would do
that even though one of the

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.967
congressional wives
was African American.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.719
- There was a congressman
named Oscar De Priest

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.056
and he was the first
African American congressman

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.308
to be elected in
the 20th century.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.060
A black person
hadn't be entertained

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.312
at the White House in decades.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.816
But Lou Hoover was adamant
that Mrs. De Priest

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.319
be invited on an equal
basis with the other members

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.529
of Congress' wives.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.406
- She made a point of
meeting Jessie De Priest

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.033
at the front door, of shaking
Mrs. De Priest's hand,

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.577
of welcoming her
into the White House.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.079
When the firestorm
of controversy hit

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.748
after Mrs. De Priest was
there, as she knew it would,

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.667
Mrs. Hoover ignored it.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.003
- A number of
Southern legislatures

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.880
actually censured Mrs. Hoover.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.174
They passed resolutions
condemning her having

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:58.678
invited an African American
woman to the White House.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.597
She was hurt by the criticism

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.682
but she never
regretted doing it.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.684
(upbeat music)
