00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:39.690
To begin with, for anyone who’s somehow
managed to avoid the more than a decade old

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
phenomenon of Rickrolling, in a nutshell this
involves tricking someone into clicking on

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.520
a link that takes them to the video for the
relentlessly upbeat and infinitely cheesy

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.079
1980s anthem, usually by suggesting it’s
a link to something else which is a particularly

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.289
compelling click.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.180
So how did the curious meme of Rickrolling
get its start?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.380
For that, it’s necessary to start with its
much lesser known predecessor- duckrolling.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.890
Duckrolling got its start indirectly thanks
to the founder of the occasionally infamous

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.860
internet message board 4chan, Christopher
Poole- better known online by his moniker

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.960
“moot”.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.210
Not long before Rickrolling became the internet’s
go-to prank, moot decided to make it so that

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.990
anytime a user wrote the word “egg” on
the site, it would autocorrect to “duck”.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.020
The prank was a big hit with 4chan users who
were particularly amused that the word eggroll

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.920
would automatically be stylised as duckroll
whenever it was typed.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.540
As the joke evolved, some time in late 2006
one anonymous user Photoshopped and linked

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.510
to an image of a duck with wheels- a literal
interpretation of the word duckroll.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.159
It soon became a common prank on the site
to to trick fellow users into clicking links

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.409
that led to the image of the duck, resulting
in the coining of the term “duckrolled”

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.340
to describe the act of being duped in this
way.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.579
This all brings us to Rickrolling.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.119
Some time in May of 2007 an unknown user on
4chan’s /v/ video game board posted a link

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.869
purported to be for the trailer for the game
Grand Theft Auto IV, but in reality took people

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.790
to a freebooted upload of the music video
for Never Gonna Give You Up.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.930
Google caches and a bit of trolling through
the Wayback Machine reveals that this video,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.950
along with being the first known video created
expressly to Rickroll internet denizens, is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.250
one of the earliest known examples of that
music video being uploaded to YouTube.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.900
It’s also worthy of note that the uploading
of this video predates an authorized upload

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900
by some two years.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.730
In any event, when linking Astley’s hit
song became the new en vogue prank, the term

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.569
Rickrolling, borrowing from Astley’s first
name and the aforementioned duckrolling meme,

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.380
was coined to describe it.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.570
Arguably the apex of the Rickolling phenomenon
came on April 1st of 2008 when YouTube automatically

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.739
redirected every person who clicked on a video
on the site’s main page to the music video

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.460
for the song, which we guess is a lot better
than directing them to an alternate version

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.510
of this joke going around at the time involving
a couple of ladies and a cup…

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.080
As to Astley, he first learned about Rickrolling
via friends of his Rickrolling him.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.660
Not getting why his friends were emailing
him links purported to be to other things,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.709
but taking him to his hit song’s music video,
he would later reveal in an interview that

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.060
his teenage daughter let him in on the prank
that was sweeping the internet.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.180
Which brings us to what the notoriously reclusive
Astley thinks of his most popular song being,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.500
to put it bluntly, the punchline to a bad
joke.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.450
After all, this once again thrust him in the
spotlight he so rapidly exited in his late

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.620
20s when he got sick of the life of a popstar
and decided he’d rather devote himself to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.440
other things, most notably raising his new
daughter, Emilie, rather than being absent

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.700
from her life for large stretches of time
while on the road.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.170
To begin with, Astley states he thinks the
whole thing is rather amusing and, to quote

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.170
the man himself,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.170
I don’t see it as negative.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.080
If someone had messed around with it and cut
it all up and made me look stupid – I mean

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.840
I look pretty stupid anyway in that video
– if it was nasty, then I’d be probably

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.010
a bit pissed off, but it’s not.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.250
It’s like, “We’re choosing that video
because it’s a full-on Eighties, cheesy

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.250
video.”

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.120
There’s no getting away from it now and
I’ve got to own it because if I don’t,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.620
it’s like being petty.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.620
He goes on:

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.569
I suppose at first I was a little embarrassed
by it.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.840
I always liken it to when people look through
their photo albums or home videos from 20

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.660
years ago and think, Gosh, did I really wear
that?

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.690
The difference is, thankfully on the one hand
and perhaps a bit scarily on the other, mine

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.160
are out there for the public to see whenever
they want.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.769
I find some Rickrolls really funny.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.310
Have you seen the one with President Barack
Obama?

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.830
Someone has cut up his speeches and put them
together so that he sings “Never Gonna Give

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.830
You Up.”

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.070
It’s totally amazing.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.910
I find it bonkers, by the way!

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.280
This brings us to why Astley never really
tried to capitalize on Rick Rolling directly,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.440
as so many former stars would have.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.150
While he had a variety of reasons, including
not wanting to embarrass his teenage daughter

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.360
by milking the meme for extra exposure, he
also stated, “I’m not being an ageist,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.540
but it’s almost a young person’s thing…

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.720
I think the artist themselves trying to remix
it is almost a bit sad.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.970
No, I’m too old for that.”

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.970
That’s not to say he didn’t profit from
Rickrolling.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.510
While you’ll often read on many an interesting
“fact” website more concerned with clicks

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.700
than getting information correct that Astley
only made $12 thanks to the meme, this isn’t

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.990
exactly accurate.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.140
While Astley has alluded to making very little
off of his side of the YouTube revenue generated

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.759
from the music video, with to date the authorized
video on YouTube having almost a half a billion

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.770
views, he does explicitly state he’s greatly
profited from the fad, including seeing a

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.570
significant boost in sales of his records
following the phenomenon of Rickrolling.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.690
Further, his first solo album following the
Rickrolling meme, 50, released in 2016, was

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.490
also by far his most successful album since
his glory days a couple decades before, managing

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.940
to debut at #1 on the UK Albums Chart and
ultimately going Platinum, despite his original

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.419
expectations that nobody would even notice
he’d released an album at all.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.540
More directly in 2009, while he was actively
staying out of the spotlight during most of

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.750
the Rickrolling meme’s peak popularity,
he did make one exception- Astley himself

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.220
performed the world’s first live Rickroll
at the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.320
with the opening salvo of Never Gonna Give
You Up abruptly interrupting another song

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.210
as Astley waltzed around lip syncing the lyrics.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.990
Of this event, he states, “[They] paid me
loads of money and my friends who live in

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.270
America said I should do it because everyone
watches it.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.010
I took the family to New York for a week.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.580
It’s good to be able to do things like that
because as you get older you realise life’s

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.910
short and you have to make the most of it.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.000
I appreciate how lucky I am.”

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.520
Continuing on that line of thinking and more
or less summing up his thoughts on his early

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.539
career, Astley states,

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.660
I’ve learned to appreciate my old songs.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.470
I quit for about 15 years, didn’t sing any
of them ever, and I’ve learned to realize

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.980
how lucky I was to have them.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.479
I know that sounds a bit corny.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.199
If I see [an artist] and they’re being a
bit shitty, I’m kind of like, “Just remember,

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.650
we were the lucky ones… we were all extremely
lucky.”

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.860
He also notes fame in his older years is much
nicer than at his peak, allowing him to tour

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.401
when and how he wants instead of having to
do whatever the recording studio wanted him

00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.669
to do all the time.

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.449
And, despite his boost in popularity thanks
to Rickrolling and the success of his album

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:55.500
50, he states,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.139
I don’t feel famous any more.

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.919
To some degree I am – when I’m on stage
in front of thousands of people singing Never

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.830
Gonna Give You Up – but in my day-to-day
life, no one really cares.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.970
I don’t get recognised until I’m on stage
and then I can walk off and forget about it.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.970
It’s great.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.080
Ego dictates it would be nice to play Wembley
Arena on my own but it’s a fair trade, being

00:07:14.080 --> 00:10:34.130
able to do what I do and also lead a quiet
life.
