00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.772
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.645
-Thank you, Paul,
for introducing me.

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:11.070
And it's now my pleasure to
introduce Dr. Alexander Wait

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.190
Zaranek, or Sasha, whom I
know since 2006, as I met him

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.480
as a co-founder of
the-- in the very

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.130
early days of the-- Harvard's
Personal Genome Project.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.740
We were working to get it to
the green tea line at Huntington

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.270
and then said, oh,
I've also in-- then

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.970
from the beginning, wow.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.140
And now it's 2016.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.100
And we were working together.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.550
And the Personal
Genome Project has

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.590
grown beyond any expectations
that we had back in 2006.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680
We had one participant
at that moment.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.880
So we couldn't know
how it would develop.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.830
So currently Sasha
is the co-founder

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.300
and the chief
scientist at Curoverse,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.430
which is a venture-backed
company focused

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.140
on building free and open
source platform for storing,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.710
analyzing, and sharing
biomedical data.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.430
Sasha works on
open technologies.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.150
That's also part of the
tradition of the Personal

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.890
Genome Project, of course, open
data collection and open data

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560
sharing.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.070
And those technologies are
part of the revolution that's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.930
reduced human DNA
sequencing cost

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.220
by a million-fold since the
completion of the Human Genome

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.130
Project.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.800
So in the early 2000s,
it was a million times

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.880
more expensive to sequence the
human genome than it is now.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.730
So this is unprecedented
development.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.500
The current-- Sasha's
current research focus

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.580
is on the development of
clinical quality applications

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.130
for processing massive
data-- data sets

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.300
spanning millions of
individuals across collaborating

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.400
organizations.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.690
This is-- usually these are
something like consortiums,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.820
huge collaborations,
and eventually

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.370
encompassing exabytes of data.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.940
And I must confess that I
didn't know what exabytes were.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.660
I did just a test
back in the lab

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.024
and asked a very
established colleague.

00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:16.190
And he hadn't heard of it,
which made me very happy.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.940
But I'm sure Sasha's going to
explain to you what exabytes

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.930
are.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.800
And Sasha's
contributions have led

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.840
to highly cited publications
in Science, Nature,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.170
and the Lancet and
other leading journals.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.230
And he's now going
to tell you something

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.270
about tiling the genome,
naming the parts of genome that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.460
make you you.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.960
Sasha?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.106
-Thank you so much, Jeantine.

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:43.880
Hi, everybody.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.910
So I'm going to start by showing
you a piece of my genome.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.960
And here it is.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.360
This is one little piece of it.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.650
If you look at the green
dot, there is a C right here

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.560
where my genome may be
different than most of yours,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.480
although there's probably a
few people in this room that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.480
have that same feature
in their genome.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.460
And this is very
strongly associated

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.170
with high cholesterol.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.880
You know, my mother had
a tendency toward it.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.320
My grandmother did.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.800
It's a very
well-established finding.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.810
We know that high cholesterol
can be quite clinically

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.110
significant.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.950
But interestingly enough,
after much research and effort,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.660
it was found that
people who do have

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.190
this feature in their
genome don't necessarily

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.570
have a significant association
with heart disease.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.660
So, you know, genomes
are complicated.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.930
And this is really only about
a millionth of my genome.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.760
We have an awful lot
of genome to show you

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.420
if I just sat there showing
you slides of my genome.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.390
And we happen to know
something about this feature.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.820
But there's lots of
features in genomes

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.980
we don't know so much about.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.700
Now, as Jeantine
mentioned, we're

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.675
both co-founders of the
Harvard Personal Genome Project

00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:21.700
that George Church
started in 2005.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.080
So an interesting
thing about my genome

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.350
is that you can go to
this URL, and you-- it's

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.339
completely public.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:30.630
And you can download my genome.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.690
In fact, there are several
copies of my genome

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.010
that were independently
sequenced.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.850
And so if you need some data
to play with, there it is.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.350
And I was actually just
chatting with some members

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.850
of the audience.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.890
And we have at least
one high school student,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.630
not to signal you out.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.550
But obviously, if
you're in high school

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.460
and you want to study genomes,
well, who is going to let

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.000
you study really
confidential data?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.240
So people like me who
wanted high school students

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.300
to be able to study genomes
made their data public.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.230
And so I think it's
very gratifying for me

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.650
to see such a wide audience
that isn't necessarily just

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.760
biomedical researchers, because
I think in the end all of us

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.640
have genomes.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.671
And all of us should
be able to study them.

00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:31.170
And it would be nice if there
was public data that you could

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.450
play with that would give you
kind of a sense of what can you

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.800
learn from a genome in
a kind of hands-on way

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.710
that you couldn't
learn necessarily.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.960
And you may be very
private about your genome.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.510
You might think we public
genome-sharing people

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.290
are crazy.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.740
But you would still
benefit from having genomes

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.780
to play with yourselves.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.140
Obviously, the world's
biomedical data

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.660
will mostly be private.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.850
But it's very helpful to have
a collection of public genomes

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.040
so that we can kind of get
a feel for what's possible.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.440
So how are we
going to make sense

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.130
of genomes, my genome,
any particular genome?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.660
Well, the only
way is to sequence

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.260
lots and lots of
people and to carefully

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.100
phenotype those people, really
look at their medical records,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.530
look at their history,
their medical history,

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.210
and amass all of
that data together

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.640
to look at it in large cohorts.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.440
So we need lots of genomes to
understand even one genome.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.070
And luckily, that's not
too much of a problem,

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.780
because over the
next five years we

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.970
will sequence at least
five million whole genomes

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.910
and probably more
than that portions

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.280
or smaller portions
of the genome.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.470
And this is a lot of data.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.760
It's about 500,000 terabytes.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.270
That's half an exabyte.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:14.230
And that's something-- you know,
these days a little hard drive

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.110
can easily store a terabyte.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.250
So, you know, 500,000 hard
drives is still a lot of data

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.910
if you are-- want to share
it with your colleague.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.640
So how are we going to do this?

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.700
How are we going to
amass these data sets?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.890
How are we going to
make them useful?

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.600
So the way that we're
going to do it is we're

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.260
going to build on the commons.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.070
And this is something
that, in IT,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.710
the Googles and
Apples of the world

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.610
have all been doing for years.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:54.010
So the most kind of well-known
foundation in this space

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.780
is called the Free
Software Foundation.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.690
It's here in Boston.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:03.030
And their mascot is this
little guy over here.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.730
The Penguin over here is Linux.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.640
So if you have an Android phone,
then it's powered by this guy.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.360
And if you have an
Apple iOS phone,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.470
it's powered by the BSD demon.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.540
They're both free software.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.710
At this point, the vast
majority of computing devices

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.370
in the world are all
running free software.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:30.170
And this-- as a businessperson
and a scientist, this

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.080
is actually a big
deal, because it

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.460
used to be that we just couldn't
imagine how you could possibly

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.610
have software businesses that
gave all their software away.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.070
But it turns out that
over the last few decades

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.800
this has become very
well established.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.660
There's billions of
dollars of venture capital

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.800
investment in IT companies
whose products are all actually

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.360
open source.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.210
OK, so on the software side,
part of building on the commons

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.870
is this free software idea.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:10.490
On the data side, let's build
on the Personal Genome Project.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.870
So at Harvard, we--
these are the PGP 10,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.910
or the first 10 participants
in the Personal Genome Project.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:24.270
One of our goals
has been to scale up

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.100
the project when we
could sequence people

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.020
for about $1,000 per person.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.760
And recently a
company called Veritas

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.150
that is co-founded
by George Church

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.440
and some of my colleagues has
announced a commercial offering

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.350
where you can get your
genome for $1,000.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.280
They will give it back
to you if you want.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.610
And if you want,
you can donate it

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.150
to the Personal Genome Project.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.990
You have to go through the
Personal Genome Project consent

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.680
process.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.820
And you really have to think
about what you're doing

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.120
and pass an entrance exam
and some other things.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.130
But at this point, it
is actually possible

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.380
that we've hit this
goal that we've

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.720
had for a decade of
the $1,000 genome.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.520
The other thing that's
important for these kinds

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.770
of scientific studies that the
Personal Genome Project offers

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.460
is that we offer cells.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.550
So if you're a
biomedical researcher

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.404
and you need an
actual tissue sample,

00:10:30.404 --> 00:10:32.820
then participants that want
to donate those tissue samples

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.300
can do that through the PGP.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.900
And there's various
bio banks that

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.050
will store those
tissue samples and make

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.420
them available to researchers.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.940
And the most successful
example of this at this point

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.140
is the National Institute for
Standards and Technologies

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.370
has chosen two families
from the Personal Genome

00:10:53.370 --> 00:11:01.320
Project, a mother, a
father, child, two trios,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.340
to be kind of the
reference material genomes.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.290
So those are now very
widely available.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.270
And if you are a
clinical lab and you

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.720
want to sequence a genome,
you can order these materials

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.660
from NIST and use that to
validate your sequencing so you

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.660
actually know that your
sequencing process is good

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.600
and not just nonsense.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.110
So PGP has already
really made quite a lot

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:42.931
of impact with an incredibly
ardent but small volunteer

00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:43.430
staff.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.860
So the questions I've
been thinking about

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.460
with my colleagues at PGP, with
my colleagues at Curoverse,

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.250
with students, have been
around this question of, well,

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:05.360
how do we organize the sort
of computational resources

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.020
so that when a scientist
asks a question, when

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.660
a member of the general
public asks a question,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.490
or when a physician
asks a question

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.450
about a genome or about
genomes in general,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.160
that we can actually
answer those questions?

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.910
Because obviously, as I sort
of alluded that-- there's

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.219
going to be 5 million genomes.

00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:28.760
But those 5 million
genomes are going

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.410
to be spread all over the world.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.640
It's a huge amount of data.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.180
It's all locked in little silos.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.160
How are we going to ask
questions of these data?

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.740
And if I ask a question
of your genome,

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.830
how do I know that
when I'm asking you

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.940
about a bit of your
genome that we're

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.330
talking about the same
part of your genome?

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.930
This is where the title
of my talk comes from,

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.290
is that we need all
this infrastructure

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.030
to make it possible
for us to share.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.560
But we also need to just be
able to make sure that we're

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.600
talking the same language.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.000
So I'll give you an
idea of how we do that.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.740
So what do we have now?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:22.290
Well, these hard drives sit on
benches pretty much everywhere

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.420
that sequences genomes.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.370
Genomes are often
delivered as hard drives.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.480
This is quite an old picture.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.660
And so the hard drives have
gotten a little bit smaller.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.940
And they store a
little more data.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.590
But it's still the same horrible
method it's always been.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:45.440
If I asked-- if I gave you 5
million of these and told you,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.490
well, I need to ask some simple
question, you know, I mean,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.450
it takes an hour just to
load one of these hard drives

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.640
onto your computer.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.040
It's really totally impractical.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.120
And also, they fail, and they
overheat, and you lose data.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.250
And it's really terrible.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.460
So we need some
kind of platform.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.510
We need something.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.850
We need some big,
big standard platform

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.170
that people use to make
this data available

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.160
that can be everywhere around
the world, sort of a planet

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.570
scaled.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:29.450
And the features I think about
that a platform like this

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.200
has to have are
these four things.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.720
And these are really
unique, because some of you

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.320
may know that big
data is something

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.040
in the news all the time now.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.350
There's lots of
companies that are

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.280
creating products for big data.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.790
But biomedical big
data is actually--

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.640
despite all of its similarities
with the rest of the big data

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.290
world, does have
interesting, unique features.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.030
And so these are four of them.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.570
So one of them is
that in biomed we

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.150
need to share more than
in other organizations.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.040
Our regulation and our
security requirements

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.900
are among the most
complex in the world,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.010
especially in tension
with our need to share.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.390
Because obviously, sharing and
privacy are, in some sense,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:25.890
in conflict.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.790
We also need the provenance
and reproducibility.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.570
And the data is unique.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.594
You know, I showed you
a piece of my genome

00:15:36.594 --> 00:15:37.510
at the very beginning.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.840
We're going to talk
about that a little more.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.760
But the vast
majority of my genome

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.780
is exactly the same as the
vast majority of your genome.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.680
So it doesn't really
make sense to not

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.985
have very special-- If we're
going to store exabytes

00:15:50.985 --> 00:15:54.935
of this data, then we might
as well have very specialized

00:15:54.935 --> 00:15:59.750
systems that are
super good at handling

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.510
the details of
this kind of data.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.320
So sharing, how
should sharing work?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:16.280
Well, today when Google and
Facebook run their companies,

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.340
they build data centers
all over the world that

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.600
have very large scale.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.030
And those data centers
cover the globe

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.950
in a kind of
planet-scale computer.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.710
And when something
needs to be computed,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.210
you move the
question to the data.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.660
And we should be doing that too.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.350
So if I'm here at
Harvard, and I have-- we

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.720
have several data
centers at Harvard.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.540
There's one at the Macy's
building, actually, downtown.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.660
Most people were
unlikely to know that.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.400
There's a very large
data center downtown.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.880
And so you want to be able to
move the question to that data

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.650
center.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.900
And if you have a
collaborator in the UK,

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.750
then you want to be able to
move the question to that data

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.250
center.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.730
And you don't want to say, hey,
please ship me some hard drives

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.060
with genomes on them.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.300
That's what you
don't want to do.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.770
And of course, federation
can be optional.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.584
Your data is very private.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.750
You don't want your doctor
to share it with anybody.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.374
But you do want your
doctor to have it.

00:17:26.374 --> 00:17:28.860
So there's no need
for federation

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.655
if that's your preference.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.280
Now, Mark Zuckerberg
and Larry Page,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.430
they have these planet-scale
computing systems.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.330
But they don't have a need to
share the way that biomed does.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.720
They don't share their customer
records with each other.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.880
They don't really share much
of anything with each other.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.540
And they don't have to.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.270
But in biomed we
do need to do it.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.530
Now, I could spend this
entire talk talking

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.510
about governance of data.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.150
I think the only thing I'd
like you to appreciate,

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.860
because I'm a person who's
comfortable making my data

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:13.520
public, but before I
became a biophysicist,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.400
I was a cryptographer.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:22.890
And I am very conscious
about privacy and security.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.375
And I want to know
if I promise you

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:31.390
that I'm going to keep your data
private that I really mean it.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:35.900
And so I would
like those promises

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.990
to be based on some
kind of public scrutiny.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.770
So the systems that
keep your data private,

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.550
because your preferences are
to keep your data private,

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.900
should be based on
real world systems that

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.800
are run on public data where
people like me and others

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.230
have made their data public.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:19:01.940
And so you can be assured
that people, cryptographers,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.970
security experts have actually
tried to sort of crack

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.410
into those systems and really
tested how secure they are.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.400
So even though I'm
talking primarily today

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.180
about public data and
open source software,

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.420
the reason I care
about these things

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.190
is so that your data is private
if that's what you want.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.630
And so it's something
that is really

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.460
a very important principle.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.740
But even though you yourself
might not be a cryptographer,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.600
you can go to people
that you trust

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.350
who are authorities on
analyzing cryptographic systems.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.620
And you could say, hey,
should I trust these people

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.920
with my data?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.090
And if all of the systems that
have your data are open source,

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.940
then they can be audited.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.260
And you can get
that kind of answer.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.090
If everything is
proprietary, then you sort of

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.015
have to trust the company
that they're doing everything

00:19:59.015 --> 00:20:00.390
that they say that
they're doing.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.060
OK, so provenance--
this is Charles Darwin.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.430
Obviously, all life
on Earth is connected

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.930
through an evolutionary process.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:17.440
And when we're doing these
very large computations,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.860
we want-- especially--
I mean, it's

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.250
hard to appreciate, really,
how big an exabyte is.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.300
But it really is quite big.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.200
So if you are doing
computations at that scale,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.680
you want to know that those
complications are reproducible.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.900
Could you do that computation
twice and get the same answer?

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.310
One of the things that
computer scientists are

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.630
used to when they
work at this scale

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:49.037
is that unlike your computer at
home, which probably will work,

00:20:49.037 --> 00:20:51.370
and if it doesn't work, you
will just turn it on and off

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.190
and try again, computations
at the exascale

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.550
are guaranteed to have
computers that break.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:03.400
So you can't just turn
off your million computers

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.490
and turn them back on.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:09.920
You have to be
tolerant of failure.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.120
And so provenance gets
very, very important.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.760
You really want
to be able to know

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.170
the history of a computation,
how it was done, and so on.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.400
So hopefully this
is an amusing slide.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.500
So this is Paris
Hilton up there.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.320
She's the blue on
this graph here.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.820
So she was much more--
and the red line here

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.600
is searches for cancer.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.060
And the yellow line is
searches for medicine.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.250
So Paris Hilton was
much more important

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.880
than cancer and
medicine at least

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.440
several times in the history
of the internet searches.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:49.100
But on the whole, cancer and
medicine are pretty important.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.600
And so what I'm
hoping to get you

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.920
to think about is that as an
internet company, Facebook,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.074
Google, really, the biggest
commercial enterprises

00:22:03.074 --> 00:22:04.490
responsible for
building this kind

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.410
of planet-scale infrastructure
that I'm talking about,

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.360
you know, their
use case is people

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.210
searching for Paris Hilton.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.000
And so in biomed,
we care a lot more

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.600
about explaining why did your
doctor make this decision based

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.730
on this report they
generated 10 years ago?

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.740
Recreating the exact search for
Paris Hilton from 10 years ago,

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.163
far less important.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.470
And so provenance is just
much more important in biomed

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.530
than it is in the
internet world.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.560
And I've already
mentioned unique data,

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:53.460
but this is-- it's just a
fact that all life on earth

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.475
is ribosome-based.

00:22:54.475 --> 00:22:58.510
There are very small
differences in the ribosome

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.620
across organisms on Earth.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.060
And so everyone has a genome.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.990
All life on Earth has genomes.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.350
And ultimately,
they have proteins.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.860
And so this whole sort of
mechanism of life on Earth

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.520
has a huge amount in common.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.090
We have a lot in
common with each other.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.680
And we have a lot in
common with other species.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.650
And so you don't
have to share-- you

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.890
don't have to store every
little bit of that exabyte.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:34.570
You could potentially
compress the data enormously

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.830
if you take
advantage of the fact

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.805
that this data is so unique.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:46.520
So when we weave all
of these together,

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.670
at the Personal
Genome Project we

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.550
built something
called Arvados, which

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.940
is a platform, if
you want to call it

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.800
that, that's open
source that includes

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.200
all of these components.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.940
It's been running on
systems like this.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.890
It runs in the cloud.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.405
So it runs on
Amazon Web Services.

00:24:04.405 --> 00:24:07.090
It runs on Google
Cloud Platform.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.417
And it's the thing that powers
the Personal Genome Project.

00:24:11.417 --> 00:24:13.000
And it can power
lots of other things.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.970
But the idea is that because
Arvados is open source,

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.960
we can run it everywhere.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.680
We can run it in the cloud.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.230
We can run it in
private data centers.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.650
We can use it to stitch
together this sort

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.090
of planet-scale
computer that I've

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.335
been talking about across
organizational boundaries.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.970
This diagram is not important.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:40.680
But the Arvados.org at the
bottom, the URL is important.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.830
There is a very vibrant
open source community

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.840
around this project.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.850
The Sanger Institute
in the UK, all sorts

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.595
of pharmaceutical
companies, lots of people

00:24:52.595 --> 00:24:56.087
are really starting to realize,
why are we all recreating

00:24:56.087 --> 00:24:56.920
this infrastructure?

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.770
It's completely not competitive.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.020
The pharmas call
this pre-competitive.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:08.910
But it allows-- it means
that-- I had a high school

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.440
student, actually,
for two weeks, who

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.460
just finished last week.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.760
And so they were using Arvados.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.343
And they were
contributing to Arvados.

00:25:15.343 --> 00:25:17.240
And I didn't really
need to make them

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.510
sign any super-complicated
agreements,

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.100
because it's all
open and public.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.420
So you can just go
and contribute to it.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.360
If you have a niece
or a nephew that

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.300
wants to play with this
stuff, this project

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.770
is pretty unique
in terms of making

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:40.620
that possible without normally
the sort of onerous legal

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.740
agreements you would
expect working with Harvard

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.250
Med or something like that.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:55.280
So a component of
Arvados is this part

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:01.680
of the software that
handles genomes, that names

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.320
parts of your genome.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.530
The system is called Lightning.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.920
The idea is that it's very fast.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.650
It operates in real time
over-- it will actually

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:17.970
be able to answer questions
in less than a second.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.600
Over time we hope it will
do that at planet scale.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.660
So your doctor
could ask a question

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.320
on their mobile
device, and genomes

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.460
would be interrogated
all over the world.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.630
And not just genomes, but
other kinds of biomedical data.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.800
And you don't want to
just ask, do other people

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.570
have exactly this feature
that I'm interested in?

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.760
But you also might
ask for things

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.440
like, are there other patients
that are similar to my patient?

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.750
And in those kinds of
queries, in the past

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.819
the way it would
work is-- actually,

00:26:54.819 --> 00:26:56.360
the way it works in
clinical genetics

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.568
is that all the clinical
geneticists know each other.

00:26:58.568 --> 00:27:00.830
There's only maybe
a few thousand.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.800
And they get together
at the same conferences.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.220
And so when they
see a patient that

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.900
looks like another
doctor they know

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.620
might have a similar
patient, they just

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.750
call them up on the
phone or they email them,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.480
and they say, hey, do you
have a patient so-and-so

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.860
with these features?

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.660
But this isn't going
to work, right?

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.970
I mean you can't rely on
phone calls and emails

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.840
now that we're generating
millions of genetic features

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.440
for every single person.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.970
It just cannot possibly work.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:39.240
And even in the old
world, the doctors

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.540
could talk to each other,
and they would eventually

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.990
realize they're talking about
the same genetic feature

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.560
because Dr. A would
call it one thing.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.270
Doctor B would call
it something else.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.481
And so in the course
of the conversation

00:27:52.481 --> 00:27:54.480
they would come to an
agreement, oh, yeah, we're

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.980
really talking about
the same thing,

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.610
or, actually, we're not
talking about the same thing.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.820
Again, can't do
that if we really

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.680
are working at this
scale with millions

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.970
of features per patient.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:14.490
So in the process of
building Lightning,

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.010
it's worth keeping in
mind the doctors are

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.980
doing clinical genetics today.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.780
And they've been doing
clinical genetics for decades.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.150
And there are
standards organizations

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:29.830
that have been around, I think,
since the '50s, actually,

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.530
in the field called
cytogenetics.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:36.800
And the way-- what these
pictures are reminiscent of

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:43.510
is actual microscope
staining of your DNA.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.860
So you take your DNA.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.180
You put a stain on it.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.110
You look at it under
the microscope.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.620
You try to stretch it so
it's kind of straight.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.690
And it looks kind of
like these pictures.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.490
So you get bands that are
dark and light depending

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.540
on where the stain changed
the color of your DNA.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.330
And so that nomenclature
has been around for decades.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.550
And so part of the
design goal of Lightning

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.340
is we need to make sure
that when a doctor asks

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.020
for a bit of genome
using the nomenclature

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.890
they've been using for 50
years that Lightning knows

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.770
about that nomenclature
and that it can talk

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.320
to doctors in their language.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.290
So this is a pretty
busy diagram.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:33.240
But I'll try to explain a little
bit about how Lightning works

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.400
and how we name
bits of your genome.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:43.190
So the important thing is this
unique 24-base tag sequence.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.410
So the idea is that the way we
name genomes, the way that we

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:50.090
decompose them into little
bits that we can all talk about

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:55.710
in a consistent way is
through the standards process.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:02.400
We pick about 10 million
24-character sequences

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.750
that are unique.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.480
And we use them as landmarks.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.330
And once we've picked those
sequences, we call them tags,

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:17.260
then we can decompose your
genome into what we call tiles.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.540
And every tile in
your genome can then

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.140
be given a unique name.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.500
And I'll show you some examples.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.710
But-- just show you
in this diagram.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.170
So this is a tag.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.340
It's 24 bases.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.400
And then this is some
sequence in between

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.990
that's 200 characters,
just whatever

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.390
happens to be in your genome.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.560
Then there's another
unique tag and so forth.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.510
So your whole genome
gets tiled in this way,

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.460
with these-- the little
green boxes are the tags that

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.160
delimit your genome.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.210
And you have a copy from
mom, let's say on the top,

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.210
and then you have a copy
from dad on the bottom.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:31:01.870
So you have two sets of bases
that are very, very similar.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.690
So in total you
have about 6 billion

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.370
of these characters
in the ACGT alphabet.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.500
And so that's what
your genome is.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.340
And over here, this
little yellow square,

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:24.050
this would be a position where
this person has a sequence that

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.930
isn't the common sequence.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.240
It's different from kind of
what most other people have,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.360
especially most other
people of their ethnicity,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.030
because there's-- a lot of
variation is very specific

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.755
to different ethnicities.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:43.910
And then the next encoding
is just another person.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.780
And you can encode millions
of people this way.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.150
And the nice thing
about this encoding

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.300
is that it's super compact.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.490
So the raw data for a
genome is 100 gigabytes.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.100
It takes one of these
big, huge hard drives.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:07.730
I can encode sort of pointers
into this library of sequences,

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.180
of tiles, in four megabytes.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.210
So four megabytes you
can attach to an email.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.090
You can send it around.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.210
And for me this is
slightly amusing

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:22.840
because there was a
scientific paper about genomes

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.320
as email attachment.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.540
And George Church, pretty much
as soon as the paper came out

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.620
was like, yeah,
genomes are four megs.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.270
It's really no problem.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.520
Everything is solved.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.382
We don't have to worry about
these huge 100-gigabyte data

00:32:37.382 --> 00:32:38.710
sets anymore.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.040
And I would argue with George.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.320
I would say, no, no, George.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.220
That paper doesn't do this.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.230
And it doesn't do this.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.360
And it doesn't do
this other thing.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.290
We can't use that.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:51.040
That's-- I'm not even sure it's
physically possible to make

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.000
a four-megabyte genome.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.957
But last year we published a
paper with 20-megabyte genomes.

00:32:58.957 --> 00:33:00.540
And now we have
four-megabyte genomes.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.210
So George was right,
and I was wrong.

00:33:04.952 --> 00:33:06.315
So it is in fact possible.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.570
Just let me show you how
this works with my genome.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.830
So here's-- you can think
of this as a tile, right?

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.650
This is just like
a big tile, right?

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:20.530
Lots of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.220
So now I've added tags.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.860
They're blue and underlined.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.500
So there's not
actually one tile here.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.160
There are seven.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.680
And then I'm just going to
reorganize it a little bit.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.980
All the As, Cs, Gs, and
Ts are exactly the same.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:42.400
I've just moved stuff around so
that the tags are in a column.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.310
And so each one of
these things is a tile.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.810
And the important
tile, the one that

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.580
was associated with
cholesterol in my genome,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.770
is this one right here in the
middle in its little red oval.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:00.560
So this is the same sequence,
the one in the middle.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:07.630
And this is not-- you know,
there's no fun punchline here.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:11.980
This number is 32 characters.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.770
It's a unique, consistent
name for this tile up here.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.620
And the nice thing
about this number

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.909
is that if you have
that number, it

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.219
means you really have this
feature that's associated

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.094
with the cholesterol.

00:34:24.094 --> 00:34:25.550
It's completely unambiguous.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.540
If two different
labs around the world

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.760
sequenced your
genome and my genome

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.420
and somebody else's genome, and
they came up with this number,

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.410
then you would know that we had
the same feature in our genome.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.659
And that's not the case today.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.909
Today you get a pile of
As, Cs, and Gs and Ts

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.290
on your hard drive.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:50.449
And you might get something
called a variant call file.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.340
And those files can
be very ambiguous.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.889
And so it's actually very, very
easy to end up in a situation

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.710
where you're trying
to figure out, well,

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.900
does your patient really
have this bit of genome?

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.420
No, maybe not.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.550
Maybe.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.455
And so this is
a-- I'm sorry this

00:35:07.455 --> 00:35:09.360
is a very technical procedure.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.410
But it is something that
allows us to actually do

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.190
this kind of sharing.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.570
And over time, you know, we'll
give these things nicknames

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.830
and human-friendly names.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:26.060
But for now it's good that the
machines have a consistent way

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.290
to name bits of your genome.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:28.940
Because otherwise,
it wouldn't be

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.140
possible to automate
these things

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.340
that our doctors were doing
just by phone calls and emails.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.440
Diagram is from our paper.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.430
At the top is kind
of a traditional view

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.950
of a chromosome.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:49.060
In the middle there's
kind of a graph structure.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.720
Genomes, you can
start thinking of them

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.000
as making graphs where the
tiles in a person's genome

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.450
represent all of the one
path through the graph.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.780
And then all of the different
people in the population

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.630
have different paths
through the graph.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.760
And then this
particular thing here

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.170
is just like the tile I
showed you from my genome.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.970
This is from a PGP
participant's genome.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:19.090
This is very strongly
associated with breast cancer.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.840
We haven't actually
established that she is aware

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.980
that she has this.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.510
She had breast cancer at 66.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.590
So from her
perspective, she already

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.520
knows she has breast cancer.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.630
But we did notify
participants about this.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.340
And sometimes participants
get back to us.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.290
Sometimes they don't.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:46.190
So that's part of the nature of
this kind of public research.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.930
But this is an actually
clinically very important

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.230
variant in a genome.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:57.670
And again, you see
this string, 3552B9.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.750
This is a
computer-generated string

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:05.440
that is unique and
completely unambiguous

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.460
in terms of identifying the
feature in this person's

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:09.960
genome.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.670
The nice thing
about this encoding,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.160
so this is called principal
component analysis.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.270
This is a very simple thing
that people do when they

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.940
talk about machine learning.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:29.130
So if I give you lots
of genomes and you

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.630
apply this sort of statistical
technique on those genomes,

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.330
then what you'll end
up with is people

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.590
will separate by ethnicities.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.680
So all the people
who are Caucasian

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.830
will end up in one
pile down here.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.790
And people who are
Asian are over here.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.760
And people who are
African are over here.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.200
And it's kind of
what you expect,

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.170
that we have a huge number
of features in our genome

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.730
that are very similar to
people of similar ethnicity.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.690
And so you get this
kind of separation.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.520
And this tells you that
our sequencing is working

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.490
and that it's not full
of sequencing errors.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.820
But this is a very
rudimentary form

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:10.870
of machine learning that the
encoding-- I mentioned it's not

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:17.190
only compact, but it's extremely
convenient for applying machine

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.270
learning techniques to genomes.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:23.430
And I don't know if anyone
saw the news around this.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:27.730
I mean, probably people know
that IBM Watson defeated

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.900
the Jeopardy champion.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.240
And people know that IBM
also beat the world's chess

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.230
champion.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.210
So recently, an actually
much harder victory

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.770
was achieved by Google.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:45.720
So Alpha Go defeated the world's
best Go player, which I think

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.250
is probably the hardest board
game that we have in the world.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.820
So machines are
just getting really

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.880
good at doing things that human
experts have been good at.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.610
And so I think we can expect
that machine learning is going

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.720
to have all sorts of
breakthroughs in biomedicine

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.380
over the course of
the next few years.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.850
And these kinds of encodings
and consistent naming schemes

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:18.420
are going to be essential
to make that happen.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.060
So again, Lightning
is federated.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.640
So the idea is that you
can send these queries

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.050
all over the world.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.660
Your doctor is working on
their little smartphone.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.700
And queries go out to data
centers all over the world.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:38.190
And an answer can
come back immediately.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.190
And initially, this is
not going to be deployed

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.460
in every physician's office.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:47.950
This could be a decade
before this happens

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.870
in sort of routine care.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.930
But for pharmaceutical
research, for drug discovery,

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.690
and also just for
general discovery

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.940
by the general public,
I think that people

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:05.042
will want to play with this data
as it becomes more available,

00:40:05.042 --> 00:40:06.500
people who have
played with their--

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:11.350
looked at ancestry or
other-- predicting eye

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.210
color, blood type.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:18.700
There's just lots of things
that just pop out of this data.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.529
And so I expect that
people will want

00:40:20.529 --> 00:40:21.695
to play with their own data.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:30.830
Hopefully-- I know this
is a very dry subject.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:34.740
This is the infrastructure
behind genomics.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:40.590
And so all of it, though,
although it may be very dry,

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.280
it is accessible.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.520
And so my hope is that
even if it isn't something

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.440
that you think you
will do personally,

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.620
that you do reach
out to your nephews

00:40:52.620 --> 00:41:00.460
and nieces and young friends
and invite them to participate

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:06.710
in this very open community,
because you don't need a PhD.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:14.170
You don't need special,
secret, top security clearance,

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:20.750
because the code is public,
and the data is public.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:25.450
And this is one of our meetings
at the Personal Genome Project.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.950
I think Jeantine
is nicely featured.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.260
And I'm there as well.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.810
So thank you guys all very much.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.750
I hope I can answer
some questions.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.800
