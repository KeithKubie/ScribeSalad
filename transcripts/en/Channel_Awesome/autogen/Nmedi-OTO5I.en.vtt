00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.270 align:start position:0%
know how I would get around that how do
 

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
know how I would get around that how do
you<00:19:58.390><c> just</c><00:19:58.750><c> you'd</c><00:19:59.230><c> have</c><00:19:59.380><c> to</c><00:19:59.470><c> make</c><00:19:59.620><c> just</c><00:19:59.890><c> such</c><00:20:00.490><c> a</c>

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:00.790 align:start position:0%
you just you'd have to make just such a
 

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
you just you'd have to make just such a
different<00:20:01.380><c> character</c><00:20:02.380><c> I</c><00:20:02.410><c> mean</c><00:20:02.650><c> just</c>

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:02.890 align:start position:0%
different character I mean just
 

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.030 align:start position:0%
different character I mean just
something<00:20:03.040><c> 100%</c><00:20:03.850><c> different</c><00:20:04.740><c> well</c><00:20:05.740><c> also</c>

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
something 100% different well also
 

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.830 align:start position:0%

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
somehow referencing Bert and that's
 

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
somehow referencing Bert and that's
tricky<00:20:08.050><c> it's</c><00:20:08.320><c> a</c><00:20:08.410><c> hard</c><00:20:08.620><c> thing</c><00:20:08.770><c> to</c><00:20:08.830><c> do</c><00:20:09.070><c> so</c><00:20:09.310><c> it's</c>

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:09.430 align:start position:0%
tricky it's a hard thing to do so it's
 

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.410 align:start position:0%
tricky it's a hard thing to do so it's

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
true to the spirit of it so I thought
 

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.370 align:start position:0%
true to the spirit of it so I thought
that<00:20:28.630><c> was</c><00:20:28.690><c> an</c><00:20:28.810><c> interesting</c><00:20:28.930><c> dichotomy</c>

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:29.380 align:start position:0%
that was an interesting dichotomy
 

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.030 align:start position:0%
that was an interesting dichotomy

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
sequel but you could argue that it is
 

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
the same formula but you change the
