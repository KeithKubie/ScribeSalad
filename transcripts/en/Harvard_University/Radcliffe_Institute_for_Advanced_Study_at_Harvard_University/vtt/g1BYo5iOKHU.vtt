00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.740
- Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.550
We're now going to
start our second panel,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.900
on citizenship and
its gatekeepers.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.310
I'm going to ask the panelists
to come up and occupy

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.120
their seats.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.230
And while they do so,
allow me to introduce

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.890
Professor Phil Deloria to you.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.140
Phil, who I am just so
absolutely thrilled and charged

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.040
that he has joined
us here at Harvard--

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.360
it is a real revolution
and awakening on campus--

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.120
is a professor of history
at Harvard University.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.830
His research focuses on
the social, cultural,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.670
and political histories
of the relations

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.780
among American Indian
peoples in the United States.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.630
He's author of some
very important books.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.950
Many of you may know them, but
if you don't, Playing Indian,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.510
Yale University Press in 1998;
Indians in Unexpected Places,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.020
Kansas, 2004; American Studies--

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.080
A User's Guide, 2017.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.660
And forthcoming,
and it is beautiful,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.380
and just go to one of his talks.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.070
There's going to be an
event at Harvard Bookstore--

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.270
- May 4--

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.360
- May 4.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.045
- --or 6.

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:22.670
- Check it out.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.410
Or 6, or something.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.450
Go both days.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.940
And Becoming Mary Sully--

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.800
Toward an American
Indian Abstract.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.240
Just a beautiful volume.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.590
A really remarkable volume.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.090
With that, I'm going
to turn it over

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.930
to Phil and this
remarkable panel.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.226
Thank you.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:40.666
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.030
- Well, thank you
all for being here.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.930
And I think we all want to
pause and think and acknowledge

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.900
the first panel, which set up
so many interesting questions

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.352
for us to contemplate around
some of these questions.

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:56.810
So in our first
session, of course,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.480
we talked about
economic citizenship.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.460
When we were having
the planning meetings,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.290
there was a lot of
conversation about this.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.040
And I had sort of forgotten
what a deeply interesting kind

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.690
of set of problems
really come up

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.405
when we put these things
together and think about them.

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:14.030
So we've thought a bit about the
uneven distributions of wealth

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.090
and how these things produce
an uneven range of citizenship,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.880
sort of gradated scales
of rights, privileges,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.490
responsibilities--
things like choke points,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.250
chickenization, new economic
kinds of constraints,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.630
which actually sort of affect
our practice of citizenship.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.560
So in this session, Citizenship
and its Gatekeepers,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.510
we want to turn to a
more sort of concrete,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.640
almost a case study
sort of approach

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.670
to some of the structures that
gatekeep and sometimes enable--

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.500
and I think it's
important to understand

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.110
the sort of dialectic
relationship there--

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.840
that enable citizenship
and the experiences

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.590
of people encountering
some of those structures.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.470
We might quickly think
a bit about-- what

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.970
we want to do here,
I think, is take

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.670
three of the central
master narratives that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.610
show up in American history
and then sort of diffuse

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.210
out from that.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.200
And that would be the story
of conquest concerning

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
American Indian people--

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.040
Indigenous people;
the story of slavery,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040
concerning African and
African descendant people

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.280
and Indigenous people as
well; and then immigration

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.560
and the ways in which
immigration, as we know,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.770
plays into all of these kinds
of economic sorts of questions.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.042
So we might imagine a
set of legislative acts

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:23.000
that sort of structure
how we think about this.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.490
For me, this always begins
with the three-fifths clause.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.930
I poll my students
every semester,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.360
and they happily tell me
it's all about three-fifths

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.518
of an enslaved
person for purposes

00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:35.810
of proportional representation.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.227
What they almost always miss
is the other clause in there,

00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:40.580
Indians not taxed,
which establishes

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.470
a certain kind of
ground for Native people

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.900
to be in the Constitution
as being excluded

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.240
from the Constitution
and setting up

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.150
the sort of baseline,
or the grounding,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.370
within the American
constitutional system

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.550
to imagine Indian people as
discrete and separate political

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.220
entities who might leave those
entities behind and become

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.682
members of the American polity.

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:02.390
So from there, we
might imagine, thinking

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.490
about the 14th Amendment;
of the civil rights

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.330
legislations of 1960s; the
1924 Citizenship Act, which

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.480
brings Native people into the
American citizenship regime;

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.170
the Indian Reorganization Act,
as Rosita Worl talked about;

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.654
the 1924 Immigration Act;
the 1965 Immigration Act.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:20.029
All of these things
are, I think,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.100
part and parcel of
the structure of what

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.420
we want to think about today.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.500
So we have three
fabulous speakers.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.940
I will introduce them in order.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.460
Jill Doerfler is
professor in the head

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.080
of the Department
of American Indian

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.190
Studies at the University
of Minnesota, Duluth.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.930
Her most recent book,
Those Who Belong--

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.760
Identity, Family,
Blood, and Citizenship

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.770
Among the White
Earth Anishinaabeg,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.320
examines staunch
Anishinaabeg resistance

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.450
to racialization and
the complex issues

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.430
surrounding tribal
citizenship and identity.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.820
And Jill has spent the
last many, many years sort

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.800
of deeply engaged from a
community kind of position.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.825
Pap Ndiaye is professor of
history at Sciences Po, where

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:05.450
he specializes in the history of
black minorities in the United

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.260
States and France.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.268
He's published a
number of things,

00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:10.310
which are all really
interesting and all of which

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.680
have French titles.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.510
And for me to say Sciences Po,
that's as close as I can get.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.020
But I do want to
sort of mention some

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.930
of the fascinating conversations
we had last night, that he's

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.110
a member of the scientific
committee for an exhibit, Le

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.390
Modele Noir, which opened at
the Museum d'Orsay on March 26,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.240
and which completely is this
incredible and important effort

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.300
rewriting, in terms
of race, and I think,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.680
arguably, citizenship, some of
the sort of classic paintings

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.510
that we associate with French
and other kinds of paintings.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.950
Chia Youyee Vang is professor
of history at the University

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.630
of Wisconsin, Milwaukee,
where she also

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.820
serves as associate
vice chancellor

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.760
in the division of Global
Inclusion and Engagement.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.710
She's the author
of Hmong America--

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.590
Reconstructing
Community in Diaspora,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.540
as well as a number of
other kinds of texts.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.910
And so what we'll
be bringing to you,

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.640
hopefully, is a series of really
interesting and evocative kinds

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.368
of treatments that
will illuminate some

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.910
of the things we
heard today and lead

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.560
into the conversation
we'll be having

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.602
over the rest of the day.

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:14.940
Jill, I turn things over to you.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.340
- Miigwech.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.310
Thank you so much
for inviting me

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.740
to be a part of these
interesting and important

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.660
conversations.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.760
Phil, as you noted, that
important groundwork that

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.700
was laid by the first
panel, for me-- especially

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.570
for Rosita's panel, I think that
will set up some of the things

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.630
I'm going to talk
about quite nicely.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.650
So one of the vital activities
for American Indian nations

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.960
is the regulation
of citizenship.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.840
Citizenship is, of course,
a much debated topic

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.480
in many countries,
with some currently

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.820
questioning longstanding
citizenship requirements

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.920
in the wake of
political changes.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.720
And American Indians are also
in that similar situation.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.790
Historically, American
Indian nations

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.950
had a wide range of ways
in which people were

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.960
accepted into their nations.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.220
But as we moved into the
modern paperwork, card carrying

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.150
kind of citizenship era, the US
became increasingly influential

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.400
on the citizenship requirements.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.410
So today, I'm going to
share from my research

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.200
about how the Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe came

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.410
to adopt a one-quarter Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe blood quantum

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.890
minimum for tribal
citizenship in 1961,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.790
and then, briefly,
as time allows,

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.590
White Earth Nation's efforts
for constitutional reform,

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.040
including citizenship
in the early 2000s.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.250
So I don't have a
lot of slides today,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.970
but I'm going to put up the
map slide, just to help give

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.410
some context and background.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.130
The Minnesota Chippewa
Tribe is unique in that it

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.540
is six member nations, or
reservations, combined together

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.210
under a single constitution.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.840
And so just to give us
the reservations here,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.410
we see, moving our way from
west to east, the White Earth

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.780
Nation, my home nation.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.530
Then we see Leech Lake, Bois
Forte, Mille Lacs, Fond du Lac,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.240
and then Grand Portage,
far up on the North Shore.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.560
You'll note that the term here
is Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.180
That's the official legal name.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.620
We also use Ojibwe
and Anishinaabeg.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.860
And my preference
for Anishinaabeg

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.830
will guide some
of my terminology

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.960
today, so I'll
also be using that.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.799
The Minnesota Chippewa
Tribe Constitution

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.220
was adopted and approved
in 1936 in accordance

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.520
with the Indian
Reorganization Act.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.410
And each of the six
reservations or nations

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.610
that make up that governing body
maintain a degree of autonomy,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.030
but governed under that
single constitution.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.220
Citizenship with
American Indian nations

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.100
is also sometimes
called enrollment,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.060
also sometimes
called membership.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.790
I'll be fluctuating between
those terms and citizenship

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.980
today.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.410
While the US courts and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.350
have officially recognized
the inherent sovereignty

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.810
of American Indian nations
to define and regulate

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.360
citizenship and
practice, the BIA

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.730
has pushed some tribes,
including the Minnesota

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.930
Chippewa Tribe, to enact
blood quantum requirements.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.850
Citizenship became
a pressing issue

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.670
shortly after the
formation of the MCT

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.600
and was discussed at length
at several Tribal Executive

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.510
Committee, or TEC, which
I'll be using today.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.720
The Tribal Executive Committee
is the governing body

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.860
of the tribe, and those
minutes are rich in detail

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.040
and record a great
record for us.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.330
So many Anishinaabeg at the TEC
meetings held in May of 1940

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.180
spoke about the negative
impact that using blood quantum

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.300
for tribal citizenship
would have on their children

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.920
and grandchildren.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.920
For example, Bill
Anywaush from White Earth

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.860
declared that he did not approve
of the use of blood quantum.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.250
He felt it would Institute
a "great harm," because it

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.270
would deprive their children
of participation in the MCT.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.770
William Nickaboine
from Mille Lacs

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.630
stated, quote, "I
personally wouldn't

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.690
want to be a party to this
striking off of our youths,

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.820
for the reason that my
children in the future

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.800
may have these
mixed bloods, and I

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.020
don't want them to say
that I have done that,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.940
restricting them from
the roles," end quote.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.590
Anywaush and Nickaboine's
resistance to blood quantum

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.170
reflects a concern
for their family

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.240
and their
responsibility to ensure

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.120
that future generations
would have the ability

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.540
to become Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe citizens.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.580
Likewise, Bill Morrell
from Leech Lake

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.250
spoke out against blood quantum.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.070
He also talked about future
generations, as well as

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.400
equality, stating,
"I feel this way.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.620
The only way we can
ever reach a settlement

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.950
is that no matter how
small quantity of blood

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.250
an Indian man has, he
should have the privileges

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.840
of a Chippewa Indian.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.530
We are all human, just like
any other people in this world.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.470
Why would you deprive your
own grandson of the rights

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.150
of a Chippewa Indian?

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.130
We aren't like dogs,
who go and forget

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.020
their pups as soon
as they're big enough

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.250
to go off by themselves."

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.820
Here, Morrell uses family as
leverage to call for the TEC

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.310
to follow Anishinaabeg
values and practices.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.150
And he further advises the
Tribal Executive Committee to,

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.030
quote, "be guided by the
love of your children,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.990
your little grandchildren,
even if they are mixed bloods."

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.110
He continues, "You can't
tell your own relatives

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.040
to get out because they
aren't full bloods.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.520
You are a loving people.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.590
Consider the people
you are going to hurt

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.750
by making that demarcation.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.240
Think how bad that
poor, old Indian woman

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.720
is going to feel when she hears
that her little grandson is not

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.870
a member of the Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe."

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.420
Morrell's call for the
traditional value of love

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.180
to guide decision-making
is compelling.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.890
His comments also
raise questions

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.440
about the future of the
Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.310
What would happen to the
nation if citizenship declined

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.240
and future generations
were, in fact, excluded?

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.610
In addition to the concerns
for future generations

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.080
that were expressed
at the meeting,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.780
past generations
were also mentioned.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.230
So Mr. Savage from Fond du Lac
noted that their forefathers

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.300
had included mixed
bloods in treaties

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.250
made with the United States.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.550
And he asked, quote, "Why
should we go on the record

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.050
as opposing the
mixed bloods when

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.840
they were approved of by our
forefathers so many years ago?"

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.090
Asking this question
forced those at the meeting

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.970
to think about the ways in which
their ancestors had addressed

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.110
the same question of
including mixed bloods.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.330
And so the question
of tribal citizenship

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.000
was not only about the
inclusion of future generations,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.890
but also about honoring the
wishes of their ancestors

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.770
and continuing Anishinaabeg
practices of inclusion

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.950
and caring for relatives.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.180
One year later, at meetings
in May and July of 1941,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.480
tribal citizenship was
again a prominent issue.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.190
Mr. Rogers from
White Earth began

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.670
by summarizing the
discussion from May 1940,

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.470
and he noted that this
question of citizenship

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.900
had come up for the
last five years.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.730
So this is just a
small summary of what

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.370
they have been talking
about over and over again

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.270
in these meetings.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.000
And he said, now,
it's been five years.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.120
We have basic agreement
that everyone who is

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.260
descended from what they
call the Treaty of 1889,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.930
which we know as
the Nelson Act--

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.230
he said, everyone that
is a descendant of that

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.990
should be eligible for
tribal citizenship.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.010
And so he worked with the
Bureau to draft up a resolution.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.360
Rogers explained, quote, "These
rules throw the gate wide open.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.310
Any descendant of
the original members

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.310
who were entitled to enrollment
under the Treaty or Agreement

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.190
of 1889 are entitled
to enrollment.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.140
These rules provide
that any descendant,

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.260
no matter what degree of
Indian blood he possesses

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.980
or where he lives or where he
is born, so long as he can prove

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.550
that he is a descendant or
issue of the original families,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.830
is entitled to enrollment
under these regulations.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.150
We want to enroll everybody
who is entitled to enrollment.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.070
We didn't not want to
consider the quantum

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.950
of Indian blood, the
place they were born,

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.840
or where they lived."

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.700
So Rogers was attentive and
deliberate with the citizenship

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.310
requirement that he drafted.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.350
The suggestion for
generous inclusion

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.940
was grounded in
family relationships,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.220
Anishinaabeg values, and
all of the sentiments

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.180
that have been expressed by the
delegates over several years.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.240
We also see that they don't
want to exclude anyone

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.730
who is, quote, "entitled"
to citizenship,

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.850
indicating that a restriction
like blood quantum

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.530
or a restriction
like place of birth

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.650
would be a form of
disenfranchisement.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.710
So the resolution went
forward to the political body

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.920
and was approved
in July of 1941.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.280
Then, as required by
the MCT Constitution,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.880
the resolution was submitted
to the commissioner

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.690
of Indian Affairs for approval.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.680
That took a little bit of time,
as workings at the Bureau do.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.010
More than a year later, Oscar
Chapman, assistant secretary

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.310
of the Department of Interior,
wrote to the Minnesota Chippewa

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.250
Tribe rejecting the resolution.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.950
Chapman noted that the
policy would create increased

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.880
membership, which, of course,
they were very aware of that's

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.480
what they were doing.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.860
But Chapman notes that it's
going to increase membership,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.770
but it's not going to
result in increased funding

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.590
from Congress,
which really wasn't

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.200
a part of their
discussions at all.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.550
This is his imposition of that.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.360
So the letter states in part,
"If the Minnesota Chippewa

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.320
Indians desire to share their
property with a large number

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.070
of persons who are Indians
neither by name, residence,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.420
or attachment, but by merely
the accident of a small portion

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.420
of Indian blood, the
Minnesota Chippewa Tribe

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.940
must realize that
every new name which

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.790
they add to the
membership role will

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.240
by that much decrease the
share every member now

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.570
has in the limited assets of
the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe."

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.220
And I feel like you can
hear the paternalism oozing

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.280
from these letters.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.300
[LAUGHS]

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.600
So here, Chapman's
direct implication

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.280
is that the fewer
citizens, there

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.710
are the more resources
there are going

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.100
to be for each individual--
so bringing economics

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.760
into the citizenship
discussion here.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.490
He is attempting to sway
the Minnesota Chippewa

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.370
Tribe into passing a
citizenship resolution that

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.320
would be more restrictive.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.300
He presumed that the
Minnesota Chippewa

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.280
Tribe, elected
leaders, and citizens

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.580
would be more concerned
with monetary compensation

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:07.470
than with the inclusion of their
family members as citizens.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.900
In the following years, the
Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.569
advised the Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:16.290
to adopt a more restrictive
requirement for citizenship,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.480
noting that if they
were going to submit

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.720
another resolution that
was the same, based

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.460
on this concept
of lineal descent,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.319
they would again be rejected.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.590
And they were, several times.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:33.180
So to speed us along here,
despite these setbacks,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.170
for a number of years the Tribal
Executive Committee continued

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.030
to push for lineal
descent as the requirement

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.770
for citizenship, but they were
unsuccessful in ever getting

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:44.550
that approved.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.430
In fact, as they were
told, those resolutions

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.280
would be rejected,
and they were.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.670
So I'm going to speed
us ahead to 1961, which

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.670
is when the Tribal Executive
Committee finally bowed

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:01.110
to these pressures and passed
a citizenship requirement.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.040
The ordinance stated,
quote, "After the approval

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.190
of this ordinance by the
secretary of interior,

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.670
all children born to the parent
or parents whose names appear

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.380
on the basic
membership roll shall

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.190
be eligible for membership
provided they possess at least

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:22.050
one-quarter degree Minnesota
Chippewa Indian blood,

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.050
and provided further that an
application for enrollment

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.170
is filed with the secretary
of the Tribal Delegates

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.340
within one year of birth."

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.100
And we see in this
resolution, they're

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.280
already acknowledging as soon
as the secretary approves this,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.610
they're finally giving
into that pressure.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.650
The Minnesota Chippewa
Tribe president

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.710
has to qualify what
they've passed.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.440
And president at that time which
John Pemberton, and he said,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.430
quote, "It was necessary to set
the one-quarter degree blood

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.140
quantum in the
ordinance in order

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.590
to receive the approval of the
Department of the Interior,

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.200
which defines an Indian
as being one-quarter

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.500
or more degree Indian blood."

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.040
He went on to explain, quote,
if the Minnesota Chippewa

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.440
Tribe does not set
up enrollment rules,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.620
then the Department will
make their own rules."

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.980
This is a time when termination
is going on in the US

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.140
and they there have been
threatening letters sent

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.515
to the Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe--

00:19:17.515 --> 00:19:19.800
you guys have to decide
this, as though they

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.040
haven't tried to decide
it four or five times

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.990
but been rejected.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.040
So no surprises.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.970
Ordinance was approved by
the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.610
Also, during this time period,
the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.580
is working to make significant
changes to the governing

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.810
structure.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.870
And so what they did was
they proposed a whole host

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.350
of changes in a
referendum in 1963.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:50.590
And MCT citizens voted
1,761 in favor and--

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.750
oh, excuse me--

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:57.750
1,761 for, 1,295 against.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.640
And so both the citizenship gets
codified in the Constitution

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.850
at that time as does a
host of other changes,

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.820
and the secretary approves.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.860
The shift to blood
quantum as the determinant

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.860
for tribal citizenship
in 1961 has, of course,

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.520
had a significant
impact on the MCT.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.200
As feared by
Anishinaabeg leaders,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.440
many families have literally
been divided by blood quantum,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.620
with some family members
recognized and other family

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.600
members excluded.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.640
I'm personally in a kind
of situation like that.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.460
My mother is enrolled as
a citizen and I'm not.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.940
And we see that pattern, just
as delegates were concerned

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.480
about future generations.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.470
We've seen that
come to fruition.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.020
Recent research conducted
by the Wilder Research

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.030
Center for the
Minnesota Chippewa Tribe

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.600
found that, quote, "The
overall population of the MCT

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.810
is declining under the current
one-quarter blood quantum

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.270
requirement."

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.060
In her 2007 State of
the Nation Address,

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.300
Erma Vizenor, chairwoman
of the White Earth Nation,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.730
spoke of the accomplishments
of the tribe as well

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.040
as future goals,
and she announced

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.740
it was her intention to
hold a Constitutional

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.400
Convention in the fall, noting
that among other issues that

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.940
needed to be addressed, the
citizenship issue needed to.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.150
And she stated, quote, "As
tribal membership continues

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.060
to decline under the present
one-fourth blood quantum

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.390
requirement, we must decide
eligibility for enrollment."

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.500
40 White Earth
citizens volunteered

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.890
to serve as delegates in the
Constitutional Convention

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.710
process, and four
conventions were ultimately

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:40.800
held between October
2007 and April 2009.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.630
The issue of
citizenship was just

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.570
as significant to the
constitutional delegates

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.660
as it had been more
than 50 years earlier.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.420
For example, William
Anywaush's plea to, quote,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.830
"consider the relationship"
remained equally relevant.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.290
Constitutional delegates
discussed citizenship

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.150
at each convention,
and while there

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.670
was a diverse range
of views presented

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.980
the discussion often
came back to family

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.710
as well as the importance
of practicing our values,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.820
getting those values codified
into the Constitution.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.240
For example, one delegate
stated, "Everything we do--

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.540
all the hard work,
love, respect--

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.110
all of that should be pointed
toward future generations.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.060
Core values should
be used to take

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.100
care of future generations."

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.500
Others equated
citizenship with resources

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.260
and feared a larger population.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.520
For example, one
delegate stated,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.110
quote, "How can we cut
this pie any smaller?

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.590
It scares me."

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.560
After several lively
and lengthy discussion,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.900
the constitutional
delegates decided

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.660
that blood quantum was
not an appropriate means

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.740
to define citizenship and they
wanted family relationships

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.820
to take precedence, and
they passed a requirement

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.490
for tribal citizenship that
was lineal descent that

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.120
was very much like the
same kinds of citizenship

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.490
requirements that
the tribe had tried

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.780
to get passed years before.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.990
Over the next few years,
the process stalled.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.790
There are lots of
political issues

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.030
to be navigated with
White Earth's relationship

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.100
with the Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.180
The effort finally
moved forward in 2013,

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.240
and White Earth citizens
voted to adopt the proposed

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.740
constitution by a
margin of nearly 80%.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.490
But despite the landslide
approval of the Constitution,

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.790
elected leaders at White Earth
halted the implementation,

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.100
in part over concerns
over lineal descent

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.280
and also because of this
question and uncertainty

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.790
about White Earth's position
within the Minnesota Chippewa

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:48.990
Tribe.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.930
And so the future of the
Constitution of the White Earth

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.800
Nation is uncertain.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.230
If the US Secretary
of the Interior

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.690
had not rejected
the MCT resolutions

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.690
requiring lineal descent
for tribal citizenship,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.320
it seems unlikely that the
MCT would have ever created

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.800
and implemented a one-quarter
blood quantum requirement.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.020
This imposition on
the fundamental right

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.870
of the Minnesota Chippewa
Tribe to determine citizenship

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.840
has had lasting consequences.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.630
Efforts to eliminate blood
quantum as a requirement

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:26.860
continue as Anishinaabeg refuse
to forget about their children.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.170
Thank you.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.635
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.770
- Good morning.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.310
Thank you very much, Philip,
for your kind presentation.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.270
Thank you very much
to the organizers

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.310
of this important conference.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.510
It's a pleasure and an
honor to be part of it.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.960
My presentation aims at
raising a number of issues

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.300
about the connection between
citizenship and race in France.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.810
In spite of its proclaimed
universalist colorblind

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.710
principles, the French
state has incorporated

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:13.600
race as a central element into
its policies of citizenship.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.650
Black persons in France
often find their citizenship

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.190
questioned in a suspicious way.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.880
As I will show, they are often
seen as foreigners, possibly

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.155
undocumented migrants.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.220
Although trained as
a historian of the US

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.950
and still working
on US history, I

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.440
have delved more and
more in French history,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.100
partly because of my
French Senegalese origins,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.240
but also because as
a citizen of France

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:52.110
I felt almost too obliged
to deal with these issues.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:56.760
In July of 2016, in a police
station located in the working

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.850
class suburbs of Paris where
uprisings took place in 2005,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.150
a 24-year-old black man named
Adama Traoré died of natural

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.300
causes, as the police stated.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.140
The Traoré family protested
and asked for a full inquiry

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.210
regarding the
causes of the death.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.930
We soon learned that Traoré
died in this police station

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.420
because he couldn't breathe.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.570
His neck and chest were crushed
by three policemen standing

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.500
on him.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.480
A few days later,
a demonstration

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.120
took place in Paris, with
hundreds of protesters

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.280
all asking for the truth.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.610
The movement, Black Lives
Matter France was created.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.850
You can see that on
this slide behind me.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.370
In other words, the
American situation,

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.460
far from being totally
foreign, has often

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.810
been a means or a window
through which to question

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.870
French society and politics.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.630
Of course, BLM France
is much smaller

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.010
and marginal than BLM USA,
not only in demographic terms

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.590
but also politically speaking.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.960
Anti-racism in France
has been struggling,

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.530
facing an aggressive
ultrarightist opposition.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.840
Anti-racism in my
country doesn't

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.810
have a history of
political victories

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.310
that could energize new
generations of activists.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.860
No civil rights
movement in France,

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.310
but a long history of
intellectuals and activists

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.360
trying to bring to the
forefront racial inequalities

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.480
and questioning the very
meaning of citizenship

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.020
so closely linked to
Frenchness, as you will see.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.140
There is clearly
a growing interest

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.350
for these issues in France,
including on the fine art

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.570
scene.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.730
The Musee d'Orsay,
as Philip mentioned,

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:49.020
has just opened an important
exhibit on the representation

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.440
of blacks in the French painting
from the late [? 18th ?]

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.760
to the 1930s.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.380
The name of the exhibit
is Le Modele Noir,

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.850
attracting a huge attention
in France for some days now.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.470
So I thought that my
different points could be well

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.930
illustrated, so to
speak, by paintings

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.910
from this exhibit, which I
will also briefly comment.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.440
OK, so if I--

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.260
correct, I should press here.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:23.550
So my first point is about
the fragility of citizenship.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.450
This fragility stems, I think,
from the French Revolution

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.940
and the very foundation
of citizenship,

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.960
which created
universal citizenship

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.270
and abolished slavery in
1794 under the pressure

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.430
of the Haitian Revolution.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:45.150
This new citizenship-- the
invention of citizenship

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.060
in France during the
French Revolution

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.050
didn't last long, as
slavery was reinstituted

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.790
by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.800
A good example of
this is this woman

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.480
who is behind me on the right.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.340
Her name is Madeleine.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:10.110
She was slaved in Guadeloupe
in the French Caribbean,

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:15.240
brought to Paris as
a free woman in 1798,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.610
four years after the abolition.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.570
Here, she is painted by
Madame Benoit in 1800.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.080
And two years later, she
would be back to slavery

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.650
in Guadeloupe, and we don't
know what happened of her.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.840
The original title
of this painting

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.890
was Portrait of a Negro Woman.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.930
But thanks to
research being done

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.300
in the archives of
the Benoit family,

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.900
we know now that this
woman's name was Madeleine.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.180
So we chose to
rename the painting

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.540
as Portrait de Madeleine
in the exhibit,

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.780
and it will remain so at
the Louvre Museum, when

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.900
the painting gets back
to the Louvre Museum

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.890
in a few months from now.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.820
Another example is
the man next to her,

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:10.230
Jean-Batiste Belley, who
was born in Senegal in 1746,

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:14.580
was deported as a slave when
he was a baby to Saint-Domingue

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.190
in the 1750s.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.680
And he later bought
his freedom and was

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.150
elected to the French
Parliament in 1793

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.350
as the representative of
the island of Saint-Domingue

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:32.070
with the aim of
abolishing slavery.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:38.010
So he's painted here as one
of the proud representatives,

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.960
having abolished slavery.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.070
But when Napoleon reinstituted
slavery, he also decided--

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.960
Napoleon-- that
all nonwhites had

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.990
to leave Paris and
the surrounding area,

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.870
which forced Belley
out of Paris in 1802.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.650
Obviously, all French
lost their citizenship

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.500
with the empire and
the restoration.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.080
But citizenship--
that's my point here--

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.490
was first questioned
on the basis of race.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:09.490
The first unsettled citizens
of the French Republic

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.980
were the former slaves.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.660
My second point is about the
gift of citizenship-- what

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.940
I call the gift of citizenship.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.060
That is, the fact that the
French Republic has often

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.210
presented political
rights as granted,

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.420
as generously
granted by the state.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.050
A good example of that is the
second abolition of slavery

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:36.410
in 1848, as painted
by [INAUDIBLE] here,

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.570
who was officially commissioned
by the Republic to celebrate

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.710
the abolition, which is
typical of the narrative which

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.900
the republic wanted to impose--

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.580
citizenship granted to slaves
by the envoy of the republic.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.810
Slaves, as you can see,
very happy and surprised.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.630
As you may know, the
historical situation

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:02.800
was vastly different,
as slaves had already

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.130
rebelled at the news of
a revolution in Paris.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.050
When the abolition
was proclaimed--

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.230
officially proclaimed--
in the spring of 1848,

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.580
the French Caribbean were
uprising on a massive scale.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.100
So here, it is really about
the memory of slavery.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.750
The new citizens should
be thankful in a way

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.670
and shouldn't ask for more.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.890
They shouldn't ask for
reparations, of course.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:32.650
The issue of reparations
surfaced as soon as 1848,

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.890
but the former slave
owners, and only them,

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.040
received substantial
amounts of money

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.650
for the loss of
their human capital.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:47.410
Same, actually, in the United
Kingdom a few years earlier.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:52.030
My third point would be
about the invisibility

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.070
of the nonwhite citizens.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:59.140
Many observers of French
social and political life

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.810
seem to have recently
discovered the existence

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:05.500
of black populations
in metropolitan France.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.830
On an individual level
these people may be visible,

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:12.550
but as a social group and
as a cognitive category

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.590
French blacks don't have
much of an existence

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.430
for social scientists
as well as policymakers.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:22.240
They have [? indeed ?] been
called invisible men and women.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.950
As a group, they don't
have an existence,

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.260
since the republic
doesn't officially

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.440
recognize ethnoracial minorities
and has defined itself as

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.820
colorblind with no racial bias.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.300
This situation would
not be a problem

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.640
if the social difficulties
encountered by French blacks

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.250
were acknowledged and analyzed.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.210
As I argue, this
is not the case,

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.070
so this invisibility,
rather than being

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:53.350
the logical consequence of a
quiet life in French society,

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:58.210
can be analyzed as a consequence
of discriminatory processes.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.590
On the academic level, the
situation is rather similar.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.840
In France, there are
more books and articles

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.830
published on African Americans
than on African French

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.020
or Caribbean French people.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.100
Indeed, African American history
is a fairly well-established

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.920
field in France in
contrast to studies

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.230
on African immigrants,
African students,

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.909
Guadaloupian civil servants,
Senegalese [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.000
et cetera, which are scarce.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.639
And there is not much
on "French blacks,"

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:32.230
as if this notion had
no legitimacy or meaning

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.880
to describe past and
contemporary social situations.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.159
In the exhibit Modele
Noir, I told you

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.830
that we wanted to
rename those who

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:46.570
had no name, including
one of the model

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.120
of the late 19th century.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.650
Her name was Laure.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:55.179
You can see her in those
two paintings by Manet.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:59.830
And thanks to research by Denise
Murrell and another curator

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:03.560
of the exhibit,
Isolde Pludermacher,

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:10.390
Laure and other anonymous models
have been put to the forefront.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:15.490
Denise Murrell tells about
her art history courses

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:20.080
at Columbia University
10 years ago

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.280
when she was studying
the famous painting

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:30.310
Olympia on the left,
which was painted in 1865.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.270
And she remarked that
the black person that

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:37.480
is Laure in the
background was not

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.860
even mentioned by
the art professor

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.500
analyzing the painting.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.510
And she also remarked
that there are

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:50.740
more studies in France on the
black cat which is on the bed

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.900
than on Laure herself.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:59.200
And Laure didn't have any
name, literally, but the three

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.120
of those delved into the
archives for the last year

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.100
and found quite a few
things on this woman who

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:14.395
shifted from small jobs,
model but also servant.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:22.440
She took care of babies and
she did all kind of small jobs

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.000
at that time.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.430
We don't know what
happened of her after 1880.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.180
So the issue of invisibility
is very much there,

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.600
including obviously,
in the fine arts.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.910
And that's of the
objective of the exhibit,

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:41.800
to tell a different story.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.160
My fourth point is
about the language.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.440
And here, I mean
the ways in which

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.220
institutions of the French state
have used the French language

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.850
to make proper distinctions
between French citizens

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.600
and French subjects of
the colonial empire.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.870
The French language was
seen as too sophisticated

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.900
to be properly learned
by the subjects.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.300
During World War I, when 150,000
African soldiers came to fight

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.050
in the trenches, a new
language was invented,

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:17.500
named [? Francais-Tirallieur, ?]
a Pidgin French,

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.880
supposedly easier to
learn for simple minds.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.170
Then this Pidgin French
invented by French linguists

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.890
came to be so closely
associated to Africans

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:34.570
that it was naturalized
and seen as their language.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.000
Most nonwhites in
France have stories

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.840
to tell about people talking
to them in a simplified French.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.200
Talking slowly, as if
they couldn't understand.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.460
Here you have, on this
slide, the [? manual ?]

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.750
that is the book that was
published during the war

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.510
and in the subsequent
years so as

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.320
to familiarize the
soldiers with the French.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.060
But the French, as it
is explained and taught

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.280
in this little textbook,
is not a standard French.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.370
It is a simplified
French, as I said.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.850
And you have an example of that
in the sentence at the bottom

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.630
of this commercial. [? "Y'a ?]
bon," meaning it's good,

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.460
but it's not a good French.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.900
Obviously, it's this Pidgin
French, invented, again,

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.070
by the French linguists.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:34.510
The command of French is still
one of the current criteria

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:39.280
to get French citizenship, with
French exams becoming harder

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.500
and harder over the years.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.500
And I suspect that quite a
few French people would not

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.760
pass the exam.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.110
We can also think of
efforts by the French state

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:54.250
to erase local accents
in metropolitan France,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.330
especially through the
higher education system.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.990
The intimate link between
citizenship and language

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:06.970
is crucial when analyzing
the internal boundaries

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.480
of citizenship.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:15.790
My fifth point is about
getting citizenship.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.210
Several thousands of the
World War I African soldiers

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.760
chose to stay in
France after 1918,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.160
in spite of the French
authorities which

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.490
insisted that the colonial
soldiers had to return

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.250
to their native colonies.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.410
A mixed population of persons
from Africa and the Caribbean

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.900
grew in the interwar period--

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.040
I think around 30,000 people--
at a time when blacks were not

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.320
only a matter of
colonial discourses

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.400
but became a fairly banal
fact in Paris, Marseille,

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.660
or Bordeaux.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.680
The issue of citizenship soon
came to the forefront since

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.400
many of these soldiers--
former soldiers, veterans--

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.920
subjects of the empire were
asking for French citizenship.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.560
And most of their demands--

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.280
I believe 80% of their
demands-- were turned down.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.350
When looking at
the files, we can

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.340
see that they did not
deserve citizenship.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.210
The merits-- [SPEAKING FRENCH]----
none proved merits.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.870
Marriage to a French citizen
did not automatically grant

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.180
citizenship and still does not.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.910
A citizenship based on merits
included a higher education

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:27.410
degree.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.970
For example, this is how
Senghor, born in Senegal,

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.770
became a French citizen
in 1932, since he

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:40.660
went to the Sorbonne University;
political support; or fame.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.900
Here, I found the
application for citizenship

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.090
by Josephine Baker in
1937, when she married

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.090
a French man, Jean Lion.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:57.700
In the file, there is a note
by the American Consul, which

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.100
basically says that
there is no need

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.630
to start a more detailed inquiry
regarding Josephine Baker.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.420
She was obviously so
well known that there

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.160
was no need to go further.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.860
And this is how she was
granted French citizenship

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.590
while keeping her
American citizenship.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:23.710
But when we delve
into applications

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:27.160
from anonymous
people, we can really

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.270
see the discrepancy
between, on the one side,

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:35.620
the official criteria to
get French citizenship,

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.400
and the actual practices
regarding citizenship.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.020
The actual practices can only
be seen through the individual

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:49.150
files when looking at the little
notes written by the mayor,

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.750
written by the governor, the
[INAUDIBLE] of such and such

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:57.130
area, regarding the morality
of the soldier explaining that

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:58.020
the--

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.440
the soldier, if it's
a former veteran--

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.270
it was often the case
in the 1920s and 1930s--

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.450
all kind of things
that are taken into

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.350
account when
granting citizenship.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:15.460
So citizenship is not
about the general law.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.240
It's really about
the specifics of it.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.990
My last point is about
exoticism and the fact

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:27.700
that the depiction of nonwhites
as foreigners, visitors,

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.600
sometimes unwanted visitors,
migrants, is still very vivid

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.250
as the French have
been struggling

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.740
with the transformation
of French society.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.390
And here you can see the
depiction of Josephine Baker

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:48.550
obviously in highly exoticized
ways in the 1920s and 1930s.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:53.920
And if there is one question
which black persons have often

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.740
to answer in France, it
is where do you come from.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.160
And if you say,
well, I'm from Paris.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.970
It's my case.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:05.020
People say, but where
do you really come from?

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.990
As if, obviously, you
were coming from some kind

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.040
of exotic country.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:15.100
So as a conclusion, to quote
Professor Mack this morning,

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.490
who raised the question of the
meaning of formal citizenship.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.830
If it's still a valid
category of analysis,

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:25.030
my answer would be that the
most fragile, vulnerable,

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.670
take formal citizenship
very seriously.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.120
Thousands every year apply
in the US or in France

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.440
to get citizenship.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.260
And it is not an easy
process, which speaks volume

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.150
about the importance of it.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.950
In the case of black
persons in France,

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.280
citizenship can be seen as
a protection against some

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.520
of the most burdensome
kinds of racial injustice,

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.670
and most importantly
facilitate the trips

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.650
to their native countries.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.650
However, there are also
internal boundaries

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.090
between different
groups of citizens.

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.730
The yellow vest
movement in France

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.060
recently showed how class,
in the Marxist sense,

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.910
still very much matters
in political activism

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.200
and consciousness.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.320
The yellow vest speak about
being second class citizens.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.630
There are also racial
boundaries, as we have seen,

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.960
also prompting the
activists of BLM France

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.720
to speak of being
second class citizens.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.780
I'm not sure that the language
of second class citizenship

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.990
is very helpful from an
analytical standpoint.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.200
I like much better the
idea of unsettled citizen.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.630
I also speak of
vulnerable citizens.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.260
However, what matters here is
that the demands for rights,

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.160
wages, health care, better
behavior of the police,

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.160
education, et cetera,
are still framed

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.170
in the language of citizenship.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:44.660
I think it tells a
lot about the enduring

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.720
power of citizenship in France
as well as in the United

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.730
States.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:50.492
Thank you.

00:44:50.492 --> 00:44:53.936
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.480
- Good morning.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.820
When people ask, where
are you really from--

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.697
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:04.697 --> 00:45:07.030
--they often say, well, there's
no country called Hmong,

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.700
so where are you really from?

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.830
So I get that question
all the time too.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.080
So it is indeed a great pleasure
for me to be here today.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.010
Thank you so much to the
committee for inviting me.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.110
What I want to do
today is that--

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:22.050
I think that all of the
topics that you talked about,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.780
even the chickenization,
is very important in terms

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.180
of Hmong American lives
in the United States.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.760
Many Hmong actually
became chicken farmers.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.420
And I've actually studied some
of the farms that they buy,

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.160
and they're very tragic stories.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.730
So thank you so much for all
of you for being here too.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.940
And I think, just
having me come today

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.620
says a lot about
the kinds of things

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.020
that we want to talk
about as a nation.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.520
And earlier, we talked
about how citizenship

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.280
was sort of promised
before people even

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.330
came to this country.

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.710
So there's so much I
want to talk about,

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.670
but I think that for the purpose
of our conversation today,

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.730
I want to show how
Hmong American veterans'

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:07.050
mobilization for citizenship
and belonging, especially

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.100
incorporating into US
military history, sort of

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.640
demonstrates the different ways
in which they are people who

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.400
have very little agency, the
ways in which we've described

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.200
them, but at the
same time they've

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.630
exercised tremendous
agency in terms

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:27.120
of reframing this whole
idea that they were merely

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.020
foreign mercenaries, reframing
that narrative constituting

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.080
their military
service during the war

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.290
to be something
that's very patriotic,

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:39.670
something very patriotic.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:42.130
And so when I talk about
Hmong experiences, what

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.170
I want to hope to do
today is to demonstrate

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:46.960
that really the extent to
which ethnic minorities

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.160
like the Hmong are perceived
to be included or not really

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.850
depends on the different
ways in which states

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.580
have various processes
to incorporate

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.167
marginalized groups.

00:46:59.167 --> 00:47:01.000
So just so that we are
all on the same page,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.150
I want to do a one-minute
Hmong history because I think

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:07.120
not everyone may have that.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.172
I know we're at
Harvard, but sometimes

00:47:09.172 --> 00:47:10.630
people still have
questions for me.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.730
So I will do a
one-minute history.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.060
So for most of you who
may have heard of Hmong,

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.360
I hope it's not just
through Gran Torino.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.330
So the Hmong are an
ethnic minority group,

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.910
where about 4 million still
live in southern China.

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.080
That's where our roots are.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.770
But in the mid to late
1800s, some of my ancestors

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.150
began to move to what is called
the Indochinese Peninsula.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:39.640
And in the 1950s, '60s, with
the emergence of the Cold War,

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.840
then it was really precisely
because they became involved

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:49.870
in the clandestine army, that
we know that for the United

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.860
States, over 3 million
Americans served in Vietnam--

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.970
American soldiers.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.740
But because of Lao
neutrality, they

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.320
weren't American
soldiers inside of Laos.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.120
And so the United
States had to create

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.260
these foot soldiers to support
the larger war in Laos.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.750
So this is just the image of
some of the soldiers' children

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.210
that were being trained
and paid for by the United

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:13.330
States during the course
of the Vietnam War.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.100
So for me, I think
it's very important

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.860
to talk about this a
little bit more in depth.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.840
Because from 1961 to 1973,
over 40,000 Hmong combatants

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.690
served in this
clandestine army out

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.845
of a population of a little
bit more than 300,000.

00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:30.220
And during the
course of the war,

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.700
about 17,000 combatants died.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.570
So when we compare that to
58,000 Americans who died--

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.070
I mean, several
hundred thousand who

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:43.640
were injured as well, but 40,000
out of a population of 300,000,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.370
and 17,000 died.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:49.270
And then thousands more died as
we escaped Laos to seek refuge

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:50.380
in Thailand.

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.930
So over the course
of the war, we

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.720
became displaced-- internally
displaced within Laos,

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.610
in our mountains and
villages and towns,

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.520
wars that were decided on the
other side of the world, that

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.240
had nothing to do with us, but
we became entangled in that.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.390
So after the war
ended in 1975-- again,

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.430
it ended for the
United States in 1973,

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.560
but for the Hmong and
other Southeast Asians,

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.780
it did not end until 1975.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.990
And over 170,000 Hmong
have been resettled

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:19.540
in the Western hemisphere,
the vast majority of us

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.960
came to the United States--
about 140,000 in the United

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.700
States; a little
bit more than 10,000

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.080
in France because of
the colonial history.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.970
So a lot of the things
that Pap talked about

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:34.780
are very much relevant to
Hmong experiences as well.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.450
So the vast majority, again,
came to the United States.

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:41.070
We had very small populations
went to Canada and Australia,

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:42.940
and about a couple
of dozen families

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.300
to Argentina and Germany.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.520
So today, I think
there are about--

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.820
the 2017 US American
Community Survey

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.190
estimated a little
bit over 300,000 Hmong

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.300
in the United States.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.910
And we are all
over the country--

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.770
California, Wisconsin,
and Minnesota

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.410
are the three states with
the largest Hmong population.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.870
So that will help to
explain some of the things

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.780
that I will show you about
why these things are happening

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.840
in these various
parts of the country.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.480
But one point to make
that's very important

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.460
is that the vast
majority of Hmong

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.170
came from an
agrarian background.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.750
They were Hmong people who
received formal education

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.240
in France, as well as
being trained in English,

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.340
to work with the
Americans during the war.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.580
But the vast majority of the
people who came to this country

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.980
came with very
limited education.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:33.610
So indeed, by the mid
1970s, early 1980s,

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:36.110
you see all these
Asian whiz kids.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:36.610
Right?

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:38.100
In Time, Life magazine.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:42.550
And for the Hmong Americans, we
couldn't live up to that model

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:44.870
minority identity.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.780
And so people began
to talk about how we

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.720
didn't belong in this country.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.000
Many people talked
about how we didn't

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.760
belong because we
didn't fit neatly

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.760
into that minority status.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.980
So beginning in
the mid 1980s, you

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:04.180
began to have Hmong veterans
creating organizations,

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.460
wanting to lobby Congress
to seek formal recognition.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.650
So very instrumental
is the creation

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:16.198
of several organizations--
veterans organizations.

00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:18.240
I mean, things like this
didn't exist before they

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.200
came to the United States.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.117
But they learned about
the different processes

00:51:21.117 --> 00:51:24.840
in this country and how to
get access to recognition.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.698
So the Laos Veterans
of America--

00:51:26.698 --> 00:51:28.240
and I won't read
through all of them,

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.410
but pay attention
to the mission--

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.120
the purpose of
these organizations.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:33.710
Right?

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:35.310
The Lao Veterans of America.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:38.910
Really very much pro-Vang Pao,
the Hmong general who the US--

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:41.730
the CIA in particular--
worked with.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:43.920
The organization's
purpose is really

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.740
about not just
recognition for Hmong,

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:50.370
but for US national security.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:53.370
So think about the language that
they use in their own missions.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:56.070
And then one of the most
common descriptions of Hmong,

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:58.740
especially by CIA and other
people who worked with them

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:02.400
in Laos is that the Lao Hmong
in American Coalition formed

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.030
in the mid 1990s was
that they were-- or we--

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.880
I should say we--

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.040
were America's
staunchest allies.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.140
Most loyal allies
in terms of all

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.050
the different covert
operations across the world.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:15.090
And then another organization
that's very active

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:16.440
now is the SGU--

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.270
the Special Guerrilla Unit--

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:20.160
and Family Development of USA.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.100
So really to get
benefits for Hmong,

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.220
be acknowledged as veterans,
and then also very much

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:30.450
talking about the Hmong's unique
military service to America

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:31.080
during the war.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.540
So they learned how things
work in this country.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:43.790
So legislative advocacy is one
of the most common examples

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.980
of Hmong trying to
get recognition.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.880
In 2000, signed by President
Clinton, the Hmong Veterans

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.380
Naturalization Act.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.870
Really, again, as I mentioned,
people came to this country

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.957
with very limited
formal education.

00:52:55.957 --> 00:52:57.040
They didn't speak English.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.380
Very difficult for people
who are 40, 50 years old who

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.150
have never gone to school to be
able to learn English and then

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:06.770
pass that citizenship test,
which I know when I administer,

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.130
most of my American
students can't pass.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.590
And I had to take that
when I was 18 years old.

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:14.660
But really, the Act
was to facilitate,

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.840
to make it easier for Hmong
soldiers in particular who

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.900
served in this clandestine
army who can prove that they

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.230
actually served in
those army forces,

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.880
to have the language waiver--

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.040
the English waived;
and then also

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.190
at the civic
education part waived

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:32.730
as well for some of them.

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.370
And spouses of those
who passed away

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.170
could benefit from that as well.

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:39.290
But perhaps the most
instrumental legislation,

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:42.290
which just passed very
recently, this spring,

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:48.120
is the Hmong Veterans
Recognition Act of 2018.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:52.200
And here, again, the whole idea
that Hmong veterans continues

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.710
[INAUDIBLE] perpetual
is that we were

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:57.200
willing to die for
the American nation

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.680
before we even set
foot on US soil.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.550
So as a benefit--

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:05.630
but they had been
advocating this for years--

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:06.980
for many, many years--

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.430
and finally, 2018, this passes.

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:12.050
And now Hmong
soldiers or veterans

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:14.600
who, again, could
document that they served,

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.020
could be buried in
national cemeteries,

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.582
with the exception of
Arlington National Cemetery.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:30.180
So besides legislation, one
of the most common activities

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:32.670
that Hmong communities
across the country have done

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:37.230
is to advocate for
and build memorials,

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:41.070
really getting their
supporters to support creation

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:43.080
of memorials at
the national level

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.120
as well as in local communities.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.760
And you'll see why they exist
in the different locations

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.470
that I'll talk about.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:52.680
So through much advocacy
work, and by the mid 1990s,

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.810
the CIA, especially
William Colby, who

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.510
had served during
the secret war,

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.360
and many other Americans who
worked with Hmong in Laos,

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.770
began to acknowledge this unique
role that Hmong people played

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:08.450
during the Vietnam War or during
the US secret war in Laos.

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:12.900
So in the mid 1990s,
the first memorial--

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.480
it's not even a memorial--
the little plaque--

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.250
can I get a show of hands--
has anybody ever seen this?

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:18.750
OK.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.550
So the gentlemen in back.

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:24.240
So this Laos Memorial,
recognizing Hmong and Lao

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.670
and Americans who
served in Laos,

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.100
is in Arlington
National Cemetery.

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.030
So small.

00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:32.340
It's right on Grant
Avenue, overlooking

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.340
the Tomb of the Unknown,
very interestingly.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.340
Small plaque.

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.610
But every year, Hmong
American veterans

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.920
come to have a
memorial service there.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.680
So very interesting
that it's actually

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.670
right in the heart of
the American nation

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.650
at the Arlington
National Cemetery.

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:51.390
But what's probably
more interesting

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.930
is all the different community
efforts across the country

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.940
to build war memorials.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:00.930
This one in Fresno, California,
the biggest single city

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:03.150
concentration of
Hmong in the nation.

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:06.670
The Twin Cities is the biggest
in terms of a concentration,

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:08.760
but in terms of a
city it's Fresno.

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.980
It's not really fair to
count Saint Paul-Minneapolis,

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.930
but we tend to want to be--

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.520
I grew up in
Minnesota, so we tend

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.970
to think that that's
the most important part.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:17.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:21.150
At any rate, in Fresno,
this wonderful memorial

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.940
is built right in front
of the courthouse.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.160
It's community driven.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.380
And it's also, you know,
the local leadership

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.720
that advocated for,
supported, the construction

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.980
of this memorial.

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.810
But you'll see this
dominant narrative

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.780
of the secret war, where
American soldiers were

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:41.430
rescued by Hmong pilots
and as well Hmong soldiers.

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:45.390
So that's a typical memorial,
in terms of war memorial.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.450
So around the base,
you'll have this history

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.910
about how the Hmong
deserve to be here,

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.400
and that these
memorials represent

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.670
why they are a part-- they
are friends in our community.

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:01.320
But something that's
very interesting.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:05.700
The next year, in
2006, a large memorial

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.060
is erected in
Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.710
And maybe most people have
never heard of Sheboygan.

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:14.010
About an hour
north of Milwaukee,

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:19.680
overlooking Lake Michigan,
right in a public park.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.650
When people come to this
event, it's like 24 panel,

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.530
with history, with
all kinds of rationale

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:28.260
for why Hmong people are
here in that community.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.843
So whether or not
people want to engage,

00:57:30.843 --> 00:57:32.760
people who visit the
park, whether or not they

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.680
want to engage,
they can't avoid it.

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.150
It's so big, right
in front of them.

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:41.178
So children, visitors from
all ages will have to engage,

00:57:41.178 --> 00:57:42.220
even if they don't want--

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.210
- [SNEEZES] Sorry.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:49.380
- And then, again, changing
a little bit to Minnesota,

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:53.040
where we have large
Hmong populations.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.350
It's interesting how
that didn't come first.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:56.040
Right?

00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.360
So in Wisconsin, Wausau,
Wisconsin is a place

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.380
that if you've ever read about
immigration and [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.870
in the 1990s really was
very important in lifting

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:08.670
or educating people
all over the country

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:12.810
about the problems with Hmong
refugees in Wausau, Wisconsin.

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:17.050
Today, Wausau's population
has over 10% that are Hmong.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.470
And before the Hmong
arrived, I think

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:22.280
that people of color
population was almost--

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.960
well, with the exception of the
Native population, very, very

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.230
few people, with the exception
maybe a few Korean adoptees,

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:30.810
but other than that there
were no "diversity" in terms

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:33.060
of racial composition.

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:38.550
But in Wausau, this wonderful
2016 memorial is erected.

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:42.030
Again, very typical, similar
to the one in Fresno.

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:45.510
And no longer are they
talking about Hmong and US

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:47.100
soldiers in Laos.

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.020
In fact, they're
claiming-- you know,

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:55.220
this is the Hmong Vietnam
War Memorial in Wisconsin.

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:58.760
And then, the same
year, right in front

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.330
of the state Capitol in
Saint Paul, Minnesota,

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.880
over 10 years of work, raising
money by the local Hmong

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.790
community as well as friends
of the Hmong community

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:11.120
in the Twin Cities,
2016, this memorial

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.390
is built, right in
front, on Capitol ground.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:20.100
So instead of soldiers,
you see this, you know,

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.320
vigorous sprout, is
what they call it.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:27.330
And around it, you have
stories of village life,

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.400
war, migration, around that.

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:34.110
So it tells a larger community
story than just veterans.

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:37.290
And then last but
not least, I have--

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:40.860
plans in the state of Wisconsin,
in La Crosse, Wisconsin, right

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.800
on the Mississippi River, there
is now, under construction,

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.630
a new memorial.

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:48.530
So Hmong people are
spread all over Wisconsin,

00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:50.650
and so there's going to
be a new memorial built.

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:53.350
But you'll see that now it's
called Hmong Lao Vietnam

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:55.010
Veterans Memorial.

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.130
So now including some
of the other ethnic Lao

00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:58.310
individuals as well.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.870
So just a couple of points
that I want to make.

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:07.440
This memorial building
practice is actually not

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.210
just unique to
the United States.

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:13.270
We are the largest population in
terms of Hmong in this country.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:16.290
However, in France
in particular,

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:20.280
the second largest Hmong
diasporic community, in 2013

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.180
there was a memorial erected
to recognize the Hmong who

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.220
have moved to France.

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.890
But what's interesting
is that the inscription

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:34.740
on that memorial in 2010, which
was located in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:37.320
And what the memorial
and the inscription

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.980
actually says,
[SPEAKING FRENCH]..

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.800
So this is really
recognizing the Hmong

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.430
who sided with the French
during the First Indochina War.

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:50.850
So interestingly,
neglecting the American war,

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.040
but really lifting
that colonial history

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.160
in that alliance with the
French during that war.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.480
In 2016, there's
ceremonies in Lyon.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.430
And then also, very,
very recently--

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:05.640
February 16, 2019,
at [INAUDIBLE],,

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.790
there's another memorial,
again, built, recognizing

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.950
the Hmong who died for France.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:13.320
So in fact, to me,
it's very interesting,

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.380
the picking up in French
Guiana where some of the Hmong

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.200
currently live, there's
now ceremonies to recognize

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.100
the Hmong combatants during
the First Indochina War.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.590
So just a few thoughts
in my last minute

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.750
here, is that I think
as Cold War refugees,

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.480
the Hmong were indeed
really voting with our feet

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.110
to come to the United States.

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:35.200
And as refugees, we were
legally admitted into the United

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.060
States, and we have access
to eventually become citizens

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.470
if we are able to.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:41.880
And for those who
couldn't, there

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.460
have been efforts to
facilitate that process

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.550
to enable them to
become US citizens.

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:49.830
But what's interesting
is that almost always,

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.530
in terms of Hmong veterans,
the Hmong Americans,

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:54.870
especially the
elders, almost always

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:58.350
referencing their sacrifice,
the ultimate sacrifice

01:01:58.350 --> 01:01:59.250
that one makes--

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:01.710
being willing to
die for a nation--

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:03.870
as the reason why we
in the [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:05.670
deserve to be here
in the United States.

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:07.440
That we earned our
place to be here.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.280
That's the message.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.390
Over and over again.

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:11.850
Politicians, people who
support Hmong Americans,

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:13.830
almost always--
you can't avoid not

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.650
talking about our
sacrifices during the war,

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:19.720
justifying our presence
in this great nation.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.920
So thank you so much.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.210
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.840
- So as with the
first panel, we're

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.960
going to take a few minutes to
sort of chat among ourselves

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.680
and then we'll open
things up for questions.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.740
I'm struck by the ways
that, in the first panel,

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.868
we thought about the
unevenness of citizenship.

01:02:41.868 --> 01:02:43.910
And there is a sort of
sense that there's perhaps

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:46.100
hierarchies that are attached
to that-- some citizenships are

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.392
better than other citizenships.

01:02:47.392 --> 01:02:49.070
But I think what
that first panel

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:50.903
was getting at was
actually something that's

01:02:50.903 --> 01:02:52.060
more complicated than that.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:52.430
Right?

01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:53.555
There's no clear hierarchy.

01:02:53.555 --> 01:02:56.420
There's a continuing set
of shifting possibilities.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.312
The ground is a little open.

01:02:58.312 --> 01:03:00.770
Two of the things that I heard
out of our papers-- and I'll

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:02.687
just sort of throw this
out, and perhaps folks

01:03:02.687 --> 01:03:04.520
would like to respond or not.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.730
Or perhaps you all just have
things to say to each other.

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:09.590
You know, in some
ways, there's perhaps

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:12.860
a little bit of a typology
that emerges out of this.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.293
So I was just listing--

01:03:14.293 --> 01:03:15.710
of course we have
the regular kind

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.780
of formal legal citizenship
that we think about.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.830
We have cultural forms of
citizenship-- cultural claims.

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:25.040
We clearly have racially
defined citizenships--

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.060
black colonial soldiers.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.780
And in France, blood quantum
is, for Native people,

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.090
sort of a racializing
practice that

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.370
goes to citizenship
at the very moment

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:38.213
that the institutions of
tribal governance are claimed--

01:03:38.213 --> 01:03:40.130
through a legal case
called Morton v. Mancari,

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:41.285
which is under
grave threat right

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:42.410
at this particular moment--

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:44.000
to be political,
not racial, groups.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:44.500
Right?

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.362
So there's a really interesting
and odd tension around this.

01:03:47.362 --> 01:03:49.070
There's clearly sort
of kin citizenships,

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:50.612
when Josephine Baker
doesn't actually

01:03:50.612 --> 01:03:52.020
have to prove anything.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.270
There's a famous citizenship.

01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:56.083
She gets to sort of count
for two different categories.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:58.250
There are certain kinds of
merit citizenships, which

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.050
we oftentimes hear about today.

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:02.570
We only want certain
people of merit

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:05.060
to be in certain kind of
places, which then concludes

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.590
the sense that if there
are people without merit,

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:10.070
they actually don't
deserve to be here.

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:13.160
There's a sense of a sort
of gifted citizenship,

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.960
with the question of
slavery in particular.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.890
Right?

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:17.980
You ought to be grateful,
because now we're going

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.790
to make you a citizenship.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.270
The value of citizenship
is your reparation.

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:22.770
Right?

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:24.680
You know, be quiet
and be grateful.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.680
And then this sort of sense
of repayment or service

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.320
citizenship, I think,
which is so often attached

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.190
to the military.

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:34.580
The sense of blood sacrifice
prior to even thinking

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.230
about citizenship.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.440
We see this with
African American

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.512
colonial French soldiers.

01:04:40.512 --> 01:04:42.470
We clearly see it with
Native American soldiers

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:45.920
in World War I, leading to
the Citizenship Act of '24.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.010
And World War II, Native
American stuff happens.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.870
And so there is this
sort of typology

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.960
that sort of
arranges itself here.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.960
And then I think there's a
set of pathways, also, of how

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.880
we imagine thinking
about citizenship.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.770
And certainly, the
African American narrative

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:02.978
in the United States gives
us one of these pathways--

01:05:02.978 --> 01:05:04.940
from slavery to
freedom to citizenship.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:09.050
Freedom is the weigh station
on its way to citizenship.

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:09.770
Right?

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.480
So the slavery to
citizenship thing

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.202
is not necessarily
kind of direct.

01:05:13.202 --> 01:05:14.660
And there are
certain meanings that

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.703
are implicated in freedom
in relation to citizenship.

01:05:18.703 --> 01:05:20.870
What I heard was a couple
of other pathways as well.

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:23.210
Sort of a military
kind of citizenship

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.940
that leads to a
claim of patriotism

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:29.210
as the grounds for a
claim to citizenship.

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:32.510
Or sovereignty, in a tribal
context, that leads to a claim

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:33.740
to citizenship.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.830
Or I think-- this is the
last thing I'll say--

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:39.980
what we heard in
particular is sort

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:43.580
of a sense in which
nationalism is a sort of route

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.900
into a claim to
citizenship as well.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.610
And I think it takes us to sort
of the very famous Benedict

01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:51.530
Anderson argument,
about citizenship

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.660
being-- or the nation
being constituted

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.600
as an imaginary
community, too large

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.820
to actually be a physical
face-to-face community,

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.253
but an imagined
kind of community.

01:06:00.253 --> 01:06:01.670
And of course,
Anderson said there

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:03.795
are many, many ways in
which that imagination takes

01:06:03.795 --> 01:06:08.720
place, including things
like memorials and museums.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.898
And I think it's not
out of line to suggest

01:06:11.898 --> 01:06:13.940
that the memorialization,
and particularly around

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.390
the patriotic claim of
soldiers and military service,

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.290
is really key here.

01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.060
Jill didn't mention it, although
we were talking about it

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.490
before-- the Native American
Veterans Memorial is

01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:23.590
being planned right now.

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:27.340
Will go up on the Mall
in 2020, as I recall.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.810
And then this list of
military memorials,

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:33.460
which are sort of everywhere
and extend into France.

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.320
So these to me feel
like the things

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.570
that are sort of on the table.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:39.440
And there's a relationship
here between citizenship,

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.790
nationalism,
rights, patriotism--

01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:46.238
all of these things, which
is a little hard to untangle.

01:06:46.238 --> 01:06:48.530
And so I'm wondering if folks
have thoughts about this,

01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:50.238
or perhaps if there
are things that you'd

01:06:50.238 --> 01:06:53.360
like to say to each other
relative to what you've heard.

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.360
- I just want to say that--

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:02.450
you know, you were speaking
about African colonial subjects

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:04.300
in Paris.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.210
I think most people know the
story much better now, too,

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.750
but you have so much of the
Indochinese colonial subjects

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:11.650
going to Paris.

01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:13.720
And that really
raised consciousness

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.560
of our most famous colonial
subject, Ho Chi Minh.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.110
Really, I think, very
fascinating to see

01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.330
how they come to Paris in
the idea of citizenship.

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:25.300
Right?

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.730
Or it's sort of
formed in that space.

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:32.410
But in the colonial
space, they're

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.470
not able to really
engage or benefit

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:39.820
from the kinds of
developments that were taking

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:40.930
place in their own nation.

01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:46.000
So I think many Indochinese
colonial subjects--

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.570
I think after the
war, many people

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:52.240
became French citizen as well.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.980
When I lived in Paris,
what's interesting

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.590
is that they had
ceremonies as well

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:59.470
to remember their sacrifice.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:01.960
But it wasn't until all
these different things

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.880
that were happening here
in the United States.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.620
So remember, things
were already--

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:09.100
legislative actions
were taking place here

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.730
in the United States
for years, and then just

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:16.000
a ceremony in France in 2013.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.109
So it is really through
this diasporic consciousness

01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:23.260
that Hmong in France
and in French Guiana

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.430
are now understanding how
they too can then demonstrate

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:31.090
their patriotism or commitment
to the French nation

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:34.779
by articulating their
sacrifices on the French side

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:37.439
during the war.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:40.990
- Well, there's Hmong soldiers
who served in the French Army

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:48.189
during the first
war in Indochina

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:51.250
are being honored now
with different memorials.

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.830
And I was surprised to
realize how many of these

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.500
were integrated, or
have been integrated,

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.189
for these past few years.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:09:00.760
But I would argue that there
are more of these memorials

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.080
regarding the soldiers than
African soldiers, you see?

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.689
So here, we are talking about
different kinds of merits

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:14.439
regarding the military
service, which

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:17.410
is a way for me, of course, to
get back to the issue of race.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:22.090
There are different kinds
of nonwhite soldiers.

01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:27.910
And in a way, it relates to
a somehow more positive image

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:31.700
of Asian migrants who are
seen as hard walkers, who

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.470
are seen as not complaining
about their situation,

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:38.034
unlike migrants
coming from Africa.

01:09:38.034 --> 01:09:38.680
- Sure.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.109
- So here, we're talking
about different kinds

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:44.770
of military service, which
is a way for me, of course,

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:47.270
to relate to what you said--

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:52.500
the idea that you deserve
or not becoming a citizen

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.800
is very central.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.970
The idea of a specific
merit, whatever it is--

01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:01.390
what you did, the
way you studied,

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.960
the way you fought, and
so on and so forth--

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:11.890
are very central elements
into the opening of the door,

01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:14.380
literally, of citizenship.

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.480
But when you look
at that, I think

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:24.340
what has struck me is the
highly fluctuant appreciation

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.700
of those merits, because
it's not written in the law.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.850
Is really depends
on local officials.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:35.980
It really depends on the kind
of interpersonal relationship

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.940
which people may have.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:45.730
So here, we deal with law as
a very fluctuant and practical

01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:51.490
set of practices which can
really vary from one place

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:54.260
to another.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:57.940
But again, the idea
that some people deserve

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.540
and others don't seem
to me very central

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:07.640
in the understanding of
who deserves to be French,

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.540
or American for that matter.

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:10.480
- Yeah.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.540
And I think-- you know, I
didn't talk about this too much,

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:17.290
but maybe I'll add in the
American Indian context,

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:21.640
the citizenship
was more a route--

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.460
the US was hoping, anyway, that
it would be more of a route

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.880
to assimilation and
disenfranchisement

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.650
from tribal citizenship.

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:33.730
So in part, the
1924 Citizenship Act

01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:37.390
was connected to
American Indians who

01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:39.730
served in the First World War.

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:43.000
And some of them
served potentially

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.580
out of patriotism to
the US, but many of them

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.400
served for a host
of other reasons--

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.000
because they were recruited
out of boarding schools,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.650
because there weren't other
economic opportunities

01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:57.430
available to them.

01:11:57.430 --> 01:12:01.140
And for some of them
also, participating

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.360
in the American military--

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.030
because by that
point, tribes weren't

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.980
having their own
military societies,

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.920
weren't active anymore,
participating in the US

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.320
and having that
battle experience

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.580
could inaugurate them into a
certain ceremonial societies

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.660
within the tribe.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.840
And so the US might
have seen it as,

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.630
oh, we're going to get these
American Indian soldiers.

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:27.570
They're going to become so
patriotic and assimilate.

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:32.700
And while that may be
true to a small extent,

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:36.350
by and large American
Indians have always

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:40.470
fought and advocated for
maintaining tribal citizenship

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:43.920
and that US citizenship
does not diminish

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.840
our tribal citizenship.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.460
And so there is the
tension of dual citizenship

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:54.630
for American Indians and then,
as I talked more about, the US

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:59.760
efforts to limit citizenship
in American Indian nations

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.360
to hopefully move towards
American Indians just

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:07.177
being US citizenship and
getting rid of their status.

01:13:07.177 --> 01:13:08.760
- I mean it's a sort
of amazing moment

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.218
where citizenship
for Native people

01:13:10.218 --> 01:13:12.780
really does function as a sort
of technology of erasure--

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.860
- Yes.

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.110
- --in terms of tribal
citizenship and sort of pulling

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:19.065
into a full assimilation
kind of thing.

01:13:19.065 --> 01:13:20.940
So it's interesting that
some of the dynamics

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.310
are like keeping people
away from citizenship,

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.950
when in fact pulling Indian
people into citizenship

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:28.438
for the purposes of making
them not Indian is this really

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:29.730
interesting thing that happens.

01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:32.460
So we've reached the moment
where we open things up

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.280
to questions.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.510
I will simply second my
colleague earlier this morning,

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:39.490
Kenneth Mack, in saying,
the microphone is here.

01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:40.710
Please step to the line.

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:42.250
Please tell us your name.

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:43.680
Please ask a question.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.150
Please don't make a statement.

01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:46.560
We all know how the rules work.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.540
If it works well,
things will go well.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.903
And we don't all have to
answer to every question.

01:13:50.903 --> 01:13:53.070
I think it's important for
us to have as many voices

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:55.320
as we can, rather than sort
of have everybody respond.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.730
So with that.

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:57.520
- Hi.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.660
I'm Adam Strom,
from an organization

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.990
called Re-Imagining Migration.

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:02.265
I loved the presentation.

01:14:02.265 --> 01:14:04.140
- Adam, can you get
closer to the microphone?

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:04.170
- Yeah.

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:04.670
- Thank you.

01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:06.293
- So I loved these
presentations.

01:14:06.293 --> 01:14:06.960
They were great.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.970
And they had me thinking both
about the texture of what

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:10.110
you said, but also broader.

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:13.590
So I'm thinking
about complementary

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:17.690
or transnational or communal
claims of citizenship--

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:20.310
when do they strengthen
the efforts for people

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:24.350
to get full rights and full
recognition of citizenship,

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:27.820
and when do they get seen as
weakening those arguments,

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.910
especially considering
many folks who

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:31.980
are claiming full
citizenship and are

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:35.970
deprived of them are already
stereotyped as disloyal?

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:37.860
So I'm just interested.

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:39.888
Especially-- I'm
thinking-- this is come out

01:14:39.888 --> 01:14:41.430
of the discussion
of the French case.

01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:42.555
That's where my head is at.

01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.230
- Should I?

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:46.440
- Yes.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:46.950
- Yes, please.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:47.450
- OK.

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:48.510
Yeah.

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:52.320
When I were interviewing
many, many French blacks when

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.650
I wrote a study on
that, a book on that,

01:14:55.650 --> 01:15:02.160
I was struck by how
much they insisted

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.900
on their French citizenship.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:07.590
They would just come forward and
say, oh, you know, I'm French.

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:11.520
And you had really to
spend time with people

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.330
so that they can mention their
origin and talk about that.

01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:21.770
But their first move really is
to insist on their Frenchness

01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:25.950
in ways which I think
blacks in the United Kingdom

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:27.830
do not do as much.

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:31.910
There is this idea,
oh, I'm French.

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:35.500
The insistence of French--
is interesting, of course,

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.760
because it can be seen as
a way to protect themselves

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:43.080
against issues regarding--
and people suspecting,

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.970
precisely, their Frenchness.

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:47.460
When you have to deal
with the police, when

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.390
you have to deal with
some administration using

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:58.140
the tu rather than vous as a
way to interact with people.

01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.570
People immediately
say, but I'm French.

01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:01.070
You see.

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:04.110
That's a way they're asking
for respect and et cetera.

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:07.050
And I was suspecting
at first that people

01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:13.460
would be more willing to
insist on their transnational,

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:17.970
multinational identities.

01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:19.530
But not so much.

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:23.430
In fact, unless they are in a
safe environment, of course,

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:26.100
among friends and
family, where, of course,

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.520
identity can be
more subtle and can

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.030
imply the national
origins in ways

01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:40.020
which people do not in a
more formal environment.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:40.520
- Hi.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.950
My name is [INAUDIBLE]
[? Singh. ?]

01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:48.860
And I've been catching
a theme here related

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:57.380
to Native Americans, especially
the question of identity

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:07.810
or citizenship being measured
by your bloodlines, basically,

01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:11.690
or analysis of blood.

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:15.260
And I know Professor
Deloria mentioned this

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:19.640
a few minutes ago, but I'd like
to tease that question apart

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.360
a little bit.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.740
There has been this theme
of blood percentage.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:30.770
There's the much
reviled blood and soil

01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:34.545
discussion from racism.

01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:38.230
And I'm trying to
reconcile those two

01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:44.350
in the face of a
global climate crisis

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:48.640
where actual citizenship
doesn't matter

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.040
because people need
to eat and they need

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.070
to go to where they are safe.

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:57.460
So I am struggling
with those questions,

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.910
and any insights you
have I would appreciate.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:01.415
Thank you.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.510
- Do you want to--

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.398
I don't know.

01:18:13.398 --> 01:18:14.440
- I can say a few things.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.280
I mean, I think sort of the
nature of blood quantum, which

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.830
as Jill, I think, really quite
artfully showed does not--

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.670
this is not part of sort
of older Native kinds

01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:27.220
of traditions of belonging,
acknowledgment, and membership.

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.900
Kinship matters, but blood
is a racial imposition.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.030
The United States does
in the late 19th century

01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:35.070
and continues forward.

01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:37.570
But it continues with such power
that actually Native people

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:39.910
end up sort of adopting
and appropriating

01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:41.380
that racialized
language in order

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.230
to think about themselves and
membership and affiliation

01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:45.280
kinds of issues.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.530
Many, many people
within these groups

01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:48.860
would say, well, that's wrong.

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.062
That's not a good idea.

01:18:50.062 --> 01:18:51.520
We should really
do lineal descent.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.270
This is a way of
thinking in kinship terms

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:54.760
and in family terms.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.210
But we should also think,
like, if we say, look,

01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:00.150
this is not a racial group.

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.870
Native people have
political relations

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.600
with the federal government
as tribal nations.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.970
Then we could be thinking
that citizenship in very, very

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:10.240
different ways with our own
naturalization processes,

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.700
which might involve learning
language, for example,

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:15.580
or doing other things, or living
in community, or making other--

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.650
certain kinds of
criteria for citizenship

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:19.630
then start to emerge
which are quite

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:22.640
different from saying there's
a racial identity attached

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.140
to that.

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.290
And that feels to
me like an option

01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:28.085
not just for Native
people to think harder

01:19:28.085 --> 01:19:30.460
about this question, but for
everybody to think about it.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:34.210
And it may speak to the question
about how we think citizenship

01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:36.890
in a global sense in a
moment of climate change--

01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.290
I don't exactly
know, and I don't

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:41.080
want to go too far down the
roads making claims about this,

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.450
but Native people
and the dilemmas

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:45.700
that they face
oftentimes are not

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:49.320
marginal to the larger
world in which we live.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:53.181
Although we oftentimes treat
it that way incorrectly.

01:19:53.181 --> 01:19:54.970
Go ahead, please.

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:56.370
- My name is Ricardo Cortez.

01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:59.010
And I would like to
know if any of you

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:02.070
could comment on
perhaps one item that

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:04.440
was not really introduced
on your discussions

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.490
on gatekeepers.

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:09.420
It's the perception of
how are you going to be

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.640
voting if you are a citizen?

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.630
I mean, Cuban immigrants that
are allowed into the country

01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:19.710
very easily, where citizens
from Central America, Mexico,

01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:20.666
they are not.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.420
- So the question
is about voting?

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:26.920
- Mhm.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:31.000
- Maybe-- so for a lot of
Hmong American veterans,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.440
things have changed over time.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:36.160
I think during the Cold
War in the '80s and--

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:40.600
when Hmong Americans were viewed
as these freedom fighters,

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.590
then in terms of
federal issues people

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:49.030
were very much supported by more
Republican legislators, right?

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:50.080
They were very much--

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.620
but in terms of domestic issues,
so many people struggling,

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.690
living in poverty,
then it is really

01:20:55.690 --> 01:20:58.240
voting more towards the left.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.190
That's been the trend over time.

01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:02.950
But as we live here
longer in this country,

01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:06.850
I see a larger split
in the community, where

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:09.940
many people are doing
better for themselves

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.800
and then they're beginning
to now be those gatekeepers.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:13.300
Right?

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.380
We came here.

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:15.400
We struggled.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.040
We made it.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.580
So those people should
do the same thing.

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.880
And so the policy changes
or thinking or affiliations,

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.740
alliances, are--

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:28.943
we're becoming like
other Americans.

01:21:28.943 --> 01:21:29.860
That's all I'm saying.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.140
Much more diverse.

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.500
Not all just freedom
fighters, but people

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.530
are thinking about
what they're interested

01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:39.910
in their local communities,
as well as the state issues.

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:41.950
So much more
diverse than before.

01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:44.410
Before, you would
have a certain kind

01:21:44.410 --> 01:21:46.450
of politicians that would
come to Hmong events

01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:47.680
to get them all to vote.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.190
And Hmong elder leaders
would always say, OK,

01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:53.390
everyone vote for this person.

01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:55.930
So it's not about the issues
that they're representing,

01:21:55.930 --> 01:21:58.210
but it's what the elders
tell people to vote.

01:21:58.210 --> 01:21:59.540
But that's no longer the case.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.790
And for those of you who
know a little bit about Hmong

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:03.820
Americans, we have
been very, very active

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.850
politically in the state
of Minnesota and Wisconsin

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:09.130
and California, in
particular Minnesota.

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:12.400
In the 2018 special
elections, we

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.930
had 11 Hmong Americans who were
elected to judgeships and also

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:19.690
state and local positions.

01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:22.580
So very-- we're
changing as well.

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:23.080
- Yeah.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.380
It reminds me a study I
did quite a few years ago,

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:30.100
asking people about
the reasons why they

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.860
applied to French citizenship.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:36.385
So they would start with
some lip service to France.

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:39.970
You know, I feel French,
and French history--

01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:42.310
I love whatever-- food--

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:44.215
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:44.215 --> 01:22:45.340
- --whatever would come up.

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.150
You know, just what
I call lip service.

01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:47.650
OK.

01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:50.725
And then, once the
lip service was over,

01:22:50.725 --> 01:22:54.280
you would get to very
practical things.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.820
No problem with the
administration anymore.

01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:00.410
And very important, the
possibility to travel.

01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:03.760
That's very, very important--
travel back and forth

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.220
between France and their
native countries, which

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:10.060
is a real serious issue because
each time you leave France

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.400
you never know if
you can come back,

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.330
if you won't get into trouble
at the police at the airport

01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:18.050
and so on.

01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:19.960
So these are very
practical issues.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.380
Then, I was expecting voting
rights to be very important.

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.540
Yes, they are
mentioned, but they

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.910
seem to be less important
than the possibility

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:30.250
to travel freely.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:32.590
Voting rights are
important, but they

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:37.630
depend very much onto the
political consciousness,

01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:40.390
so to speak, of the
people being interviewed.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:44.390
People, of course, being members
of political organizations,

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:48.730
trade unions, mentioned voting
rights as very important.

01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:51.640
But for the, you know,
just regular people

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:56.560
without any specific political
involvement, the most practical

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.480
matters are put on the forefront
once the lip service to France

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.785
is being paid.

01:24:02.785 --> 01:24:04.660
- It feels like this is
a discourse mobilized

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.300
by political parties that
does not necessarily match up

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.305
with the people on the ground.

01:24:09.305 --> 01:24:11.680
There's four Native American
folks in Congress right now.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.470
Two are Republicans.

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:13.220
Two are Democrats.

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.610
I mean, it's just not
as predictable, I think,

01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:16.680
as folks would say.

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.880
Please.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.870
- I'm David Allen.

01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:23.500
More on blood quantum.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:29.110
I am struck by the startling
contrast between what

01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:31.225
we've learned this morning--

01:24:31.225 --> 01:24:35.890
the Chippewa approach to the
question of percentage of blood

01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:40.880
and its role in belonging and
citizenship on the one side,

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.550
and on the other side the white
nationalist view that blood

01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:53.020
must be pure, which is of course
evocative of what underlies

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:58.210
here, us and them, the other and
us, what's inside and outside--

01:24:58.210 --> 01:25:01.390
the definitions of identity.

01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:05.650
The question is,
might we use some

01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:09.270
of what we learned
this morning as a model

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:12.720
much more broadly
here in our society

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.640
and otherwise for moving forward
on these questions of how we

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:21.240
live with each other,
overlapping memberships,

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.900
instead of the
horrors of 6 million

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.180
exterminated in the
Second World War

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.290
because their blood wasn't pure.

01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:31.225
Over to you.

01:25:31.225 --> 01:25:32.350
- [LAUGHS] Thank you.

01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:33.130
Yes.

01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:34.270
Yeah.

01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:38.850
This whole idea of
blood as a metaphor

01:25:38.850 --> 01:25:43.240
has huge meanings in a
variety of cultures over time.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.230
But the idea about
blood as being something

01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:50.740
measurable and quantifiable
and connected to citizenship

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.940
was really, by and large,
coming from the United States

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.530
as a way to reduce the
number of people, of American

01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:02.650
Indians, who had that legal and
political status as American

01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:05.440
Indians in order to
erase that status.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.000
And from an Anishinaabeg
point of view,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.680
the record is rich
and clear that we're

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.750
interrelated bodies
of kin and families

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:21.080
and we have obligations
to each other.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.970
We also have obligations to
this land, which might connect

01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:26.440
briefly to the other question.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.910
And so if we think about
our responsibilities,

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:34.540
perhaps, rather
than our rights--

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.460
we think about our
responsibilities

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.770
and our relationships,
that just gets

01:26:38.770 --> 01:26:41.650
us a whole other perspective.

01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:45.280
You know, like the record
of the Anishinaabeg leaders

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.130
who were speaking during
this time saying, what

01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:50.980
happens if we're guided by
the love of our children

01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:52.270
and our future generations?

01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:55.690
How does that change
our perspective

01:26:55.690 --> 01:26:58.040
and how we treat each other?

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:01.120
So it would be
wonderful if we could

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.220
be moving in that direction.

01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:06.600
It takes all of us, though.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.280
- We just have a couple minutes
left, so maybe we can quickly--

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.170
- Hi. [? Noni ?] Valentine.

01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:14.350
I have listened
with such interest

01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:19.530
to your exploration of
the dynamics of exclusion,

01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:22.320
and it's making me think
about the other side.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:28.100
And if each of you
was in a position--

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.380
a powerful position--
to determine citizenship

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:36.810
for others, to decide who
gets included, seriously,

01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:40.870
what would be your
fundamental criteria,

01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:44.130
especially in view of merit,
which you've spoken about

01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:47.600
and some of the other themes?

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.630
- Well, thanks for
like a huge question,

01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:51.440
as we're trying
to wrap things up.

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:51.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.870
I don't know if
somebody wants to--

01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:54.460
- I don't think anybody
told us we would

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:55.710
have to answer that question--

01:27:55.710 --> 01:27:56.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.990
--when we were invited.

01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.885
Yeah.

01:27:59.885 --> 01:28:01.690
You know, I don't
have an answer,

01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:06.400
but I want to steal a
little bit from Jill.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:09.250
I think what's more important,
if I think about the world

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:13.060
today, is that we need to
be more kind to each other.

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:16.510
We have this shared
humanity, shared experiences

01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:21.750
on this earth, so I think
it's important to have

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:27.210
some kind of documentation
and some kind of order

01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:29.520
within nations.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.270
I think that's important.

01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:35.550
But at the same time,
if I were in charge,

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:39.720
if I have the power you just
asked me to imagine I would,

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:47.200
I may not give citizenship
such a big priority.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.260
I might be very interested
in this whole idea

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:53.710
of the global citizen,
because what I do here,

01:28:53.710 --> 01:28:56.770
right here on this
campus, impacts somebody

01:28:56.770 --> 01:28:58.540
in other parts of the world.

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.940
In the corporations that
operate all over the world,

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.770
they have impact--

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:05.530
you know, the dollars might
come back to our community,

01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:07.780
but they impact those
local communities.

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:10.220
Very importantly, my
uncles live in Laos,

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.430
and the kinds of
development, globalization,

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:16.090
that's reached their villages--
the trucks coming to--

01:29:16.090 --> 01:29:20.260
you know, the
logging, all the film

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.860
and all the environmental
issues are impacting them.

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.500
So I think that's
what I would do,

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.330
is to put more emphasis on
who we are as human beings.

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:32.590
And we're more alike
than we are different,

01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:36.220
but we spend so much time
focusing on that difference.

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.740
- So we've reached and
actually exceeded our time.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.570
And I think this large question
and this quite lovely response

01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:43.112
is perhaps a good
way for us to end.

01:29:43.112 --> 01:29:45.070
Could you please join me
in thanking the panel?

01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:46.870
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:49.920
