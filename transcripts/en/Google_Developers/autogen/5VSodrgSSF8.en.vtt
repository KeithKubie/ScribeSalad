rather nice these studies and writing
 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.010

diseases and I was actually working for

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020
diseases and I was actually working for
 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.320
diseases and I was actually working for
a company that needed to share files

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330
a company that needed to share files
 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.440
a company that needed to share files
between windows and unix machines and

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450
between windows and unix machines and
 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.390

which was PC NFS which was horrible so
 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.600
which was PC NFS which was horrible so
essentially we banded together and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610
essentially we banded together and
 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.330
essentially we banded together and
started to develop something better that

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340
started to develop something better that
 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.450
started to develop something better that
taught the windows protocols and it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
taught the windows protocols and it
 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.250
taught the windows protocols and it
attracted more developers and has grown

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260
attracted more developers and has grown
 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.380
attracted more developers and has grown
from there really how many developers

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390
from there really how many developers
 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.950

amber and I would say there are probably

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090
amber and I would say there are probably
 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.750
amber and I would say there are probably
about 10 to 15 active developers so it's

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760
about 10 to 15 active developers so it's
 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.270
about 10 to 15 active developers so it's
actually quite a small project there are

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280
actually quite a small project there are
 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.550
actually quite a small project there are
many many other peripheral developers

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560
many many other peripheral developers
 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.430

do with more contributors so the kind of
 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.809
do with more contributors so the kind of
things that we need our while sandbur is

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819
things that we need our while sandbur is
 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.339
things that we need our while sandbur is
written in C so it's a kind of an old

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349
written in C so it's a kind of an old
 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:23.869
written in C so it's a kind of an old
project so if if you really want to do

technical work Sam was the place to do

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719
technical work Sam was the place to do
 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:31.549
technical work Sam was the place to do
it there's a lot of very hard very

00:07:31.549 --> 00:07:31.559
it there's a lot of very hard very
 

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:34.009
it there's a lot of very hard very
technical work than he's doing lots of

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:34.019
technical work than he's doing lots of
 

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:36.799
technical work than he's doing lots of
bugs that need fixing you can learn

00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:36.809
bugs that need fixing you can learn
 

00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:39.919
bugs that need fixing you can learn
about very many core technologies by

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:39.929
about very many core technologies by
 

00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:42.489
about very many core technologies by
working on Samba security technologies

00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:42.499

we also need people who can help

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:52.529
we also need people who can help
 

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:54.469
we also need people who can help
document it because like most open

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479
document it because like most open
 

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:57.279
document it because like most open
source projects it's terribly documented

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:57.289
source projects it's terribly documented
 

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:00.379
source projects it's terribly documented
we have I think we have a record for the

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:00.389
we have I think we have a record for the
 

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:02.479
we have I think we have a record for the
longest man page I think something like

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:02.489
longest man page I think something like
 

00:08:02.489 --> 00:08:05.149
longest man page I think something like
35 hundred pages all of which are

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159
35 hundred pages all of which are
 

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:07.699
35 hundred pages all of which are
configuration options many of which are

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:07.709
configuration options many of which are
 

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:11.239
configuration options many of which are
confusing and so so what would really
