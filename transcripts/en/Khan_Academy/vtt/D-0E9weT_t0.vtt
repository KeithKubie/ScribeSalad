00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.410
The graph below shows the
depreciation of a motorcycle's

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.000
value over time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.900
And they shows us the graph
and they say during which

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.480
two-year span does the most
rapid-- let me underline

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.220
that-- the most rapid
depreciation occur.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.290
So depreciation just means
loss in value.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.970
And this shows the motorcycle's
value.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.250
You can just eyeball
this here.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.360
Let's just look at what
this chart's saying.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.690
This is saying right when the
motorcycle is brand new, when

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.840
it's zero days old, zero
years old, I should

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.750
say, it is worth $10,000.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.560
And then when it's one year old,
it's looks like it's a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.630
little over $6,000.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.100
And when it's two years
old, it looks

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.280
like it's about $5,000.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.450
Then at three years,
it's about $4,000.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.900
And so on and so forth.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.560
So this curve shows how
it depreciates, how

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.180
it loses its value.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.760
And they're saying when
is the most rapid

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.190
depreciation occurring?

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.120
And they don't want to know
what year, they want a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.290
two-year span when we have the
most rapid depreciation.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.200
Now, one thing you can look at
here, you can just kind of

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.760
eyeball it.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.130
You could say, look, the
beginning of this curve is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.500
this steepest part.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.350
It's steepest over these two
years than over any other

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.180
two-year period.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.680
Out here, it's kind of a very
shallow-- it's almost flat in

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.580
terms of how quickly it's losing
value, so it's not

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.520
losing value too quickly.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.900
So if you just eyeballed it, you
would just say, well, the

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.090
most rapid depreciation is
occurring over the first two

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.490
years, from zero to two years
up to this point because you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.590
can see the curve is getting
less and less steep the entire

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.290
time, but it's most steep over
those first two years.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.310
Now, if you didn't want to just
eyeball it and really

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.390
verify that it loses the most
value over the first two years

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.590
than any other two-year
period, let's actually

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.010
calculate it.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:56.070
So after from zero-- so let me
write two-year period and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
let's write lost value, or we
could call it depreciation,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.300
either way.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.300
So from zero to two years, we
went from $10,000 to what

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.720
looks like about
$5,000, right?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.919
That looks right at
about $5,000.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.340
So we lost $5,000
of lost value.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.680
Then if we go from one to three
years, what happened?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.230
One to three years, that's the
other two-year period.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.500
You go from one to three years,
we started at it looks

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.560
like about $6,100, maybe
$6,200 or so,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.680
and we went to $4,000.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.550
So we lost about $2,200, so
definitely less than what we

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.770
lost in the first two years.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.740
Then if we look at the second
through the fourth year, we

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.850
went from about $5,000 to about
$4,000, so we lost about

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.370
$1,000 in value, maybe
a little less.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.690
Yeah, that's about what we went
from years two to four,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.390
about $5,000, or maybe a little
under $4,000, so I'll

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.340
give it a little bit more value,
so maybe it's like

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.160
$3,800 right there, so maybe
on the order of $1,200.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.350
And then if you go from year
three to year five, we're

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.834
going from about $4,000 to looks
like about $3,600 if I

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:27.770
had to eyeball it, so it looks
like we lost about $400.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.350
So if anything, as we go further
and further in time,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.560
each two-year period we're
losing less value.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.380
So then finally if we go from
four to six years, it looks

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.000
like we're at about $3,800 and
we end up at about-- I don't

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.360
know what this value
looks like.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.730
It's about-- I would say it's
maybe $3,500 or maybe we're

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.640
going from $3,700.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.740
We're losing about $300.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.930
It's shallower than
it was before.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.670
So the most rapid depreciation
occurs in the first two years.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.630
And you didn't have to go
through this exercise.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.210
You could have just looked at
the chart and said, hey, look

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.460
how steep it is the first two
years compared to all of the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.420
years after that.
