Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is radiolab, the podcast, the homecoming podcast.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.270
Actually welcome. One of the things that Robert and I had in common when we met,

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.680
way back when was that we both went to Oberlin, Oberlin college in Ohio.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.090
I did music as a composition major and this was in the 90s Robert studied

5
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:23.091
history in the a sepia colored sixties at least in my mind.

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.370
And despite our difference in ages,

7
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.990
we both left this school feeling like Oberlin was a really big part of who we

8
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:31.201
are.

9
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:36.201
So when we were asked to return to Oberland to speak on campus on March six 2008

10
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:39.180
as part of their convocation series,

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.210
we were totally thrilled and nervous and terrified and thrilled. Anyhow,

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.040
it was a snow covered night and we went into Finny Chapel.

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.830
All right. Finny Chapel. Those words mean nothing to you.

14
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:57.450
But to us Feeney chapel is like Madison Square Garden because this was,

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.721
you know,

16
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:01.740
this is where you went to see jazz greats play and you heard speeches by

17
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:06.360
cultural dignitaries. But there we were, these two schmoes onstage talking,

18
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.220
you know, to our old professors and it was really quite weird frankly.

19
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.160
So anyways, we did a whole long lecture,

20
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.280
which got into lots of Oberland Nostalgia and we're going to spare you most of

21
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.030
that.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.940
But I'm going to play you just a couple excerpts from the evening where we tell

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:25.590
stories about Radiolab that you may not have heard before to get started.

24
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
Here is the Robert and Jad Romance Story. Well,

25
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.750
not really a story of how we met,

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.350
which centers around the first radio piece that we ever made together.

27
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:38.010
I'm going to play that for you. Never before heard Radiolab piece.

28
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:41.340
Prepare yourself. This is Radiolab. The early years.

29
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.800
So five years ago I was working at w NYC.

30
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.550
I was sort of radio lab was not yet a thing. Um,

31
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.650
I was between jobs so to speak.

32
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.210
And someone hands me the program director hands me a stack of scripts and says,

33
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.250
go interview these people. And I did.

34
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.520
And at the very end of the stack was a guy named Robert Crow,

35
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:06.180
which I sort of knew the name a little bit.

36
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.080
And uh, he said, you, what's your story before we do any of this?

37
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:14.490
What's your story? I said, well, I work at m w NYC and I freelance for NPR.

38
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.870
We don't, he said, me too. And I said, when he asked me,

39
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.580
well what about before that? I said, well, I work at WBAI.

40
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.560
We do, you do. And then he said,

41
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.170
where did you go to school when I said Oberlin and yeah, that

42
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.470
and uh, I said like, what? So, so this is the deal.

43
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.660
Like you're like living my life 25 years after me.

44
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.920
Let's go have breakfast and you can tell me what it's like on the other side or

45
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.530
whatever you call it. And uh, somewhere.

46
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:51.810
And like breakfast number of 31,

47
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.110
we decided that we would try some radio together.

48
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.800
We started doing various weird oddly strange experiments that, um,

49
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.810
few of which have survived,

50
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.840
but we do have the very first thing we collaborated on,

51
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.760
which we thought was like fabulous.

52
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.050
We thought this is going to be the beginning of a revolution. And uh,

53
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.770
in a small way, small way.

54
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.680
The phone call we got was from IRA glass who runs this American life was a

55
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.170
friend of mine. But he's also like, you know the god. So he says, Hey,

56
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.940
we going to have a show coming up.

57
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.330
It's an hour show but it will only have two minute contributions.

58
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.570
So you had this record or something? Yes.

59
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.470
So the show that IRA was planning on airing was flag day.

60
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.090
That was the projected broadcast day.

61
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.410
I happened to have purely coincidentally a piece of archival tape and someone

62
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.244
had sent me,

63
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.250
which was a 1950s picture book audio that described the rules,

64
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.370
which you are supposed to approach the flag.

65
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.320
You are supposed to salute the flag,

66
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:51.010
how you're supposed to display the flag when there are other flags in the room.

67
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.350
All kinds of very arcane, um,

68
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.460
my new shit about how to respect the flag and it's completely ridiculous.

69
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.400
Totally. And here's what we did. Here's what we did

70
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.800
<v 1>a few weeks ago.</v>

71
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:06.801
My friend Jad got a tape from his friend Jake of an old record from 1960 1961 it

72
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:09.810
was a how to record,

73
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:14.811
how to handle and how to honor the American flag because of the narrator,

74
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.920
but the first hundred 50 years,

75
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.400
there were no rules for the flag to correct this situation.

76
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.610
In 1923 the representatives of 68 patriotic and civic organizations met in

77
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:34.081
Washington d c he insists that we follow the flight from the left to the rack.

78
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.580
No, no. It must be from the right to the left.

79
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.870
She drove off the national code of flag etiquette.

80
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.400
According to the law, our flag should always be raised briskly faster.

81
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.480
It's only faster, Andrew, the very peak of the statutes

82
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.360
when the flag is displayed over the middle of the street,

83
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.760
it should be suspended vertically with the union to the north. Yeah, on an east.

84
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.050
West street, excuse me,

85
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.850
or to the east on a north South Street does this treatment east where I think it

86
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:11.470
runs east west, but east west Westerns. I run north,

87
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:14.520
south and side. Been a kid. Mark. Yes.

88
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.510
D I got the American flag,

89
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:20.320
the police regimented a flag and I got eight thumbtacks. Now what should I do?

90
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.590
You put up both of them, man, they, but you've got to listen to them. The man,

91
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.210
the flag may be displayed against a wall crossed with another flag in this

92
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.170
arrangement. However,

93
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.060
the flag of the United States should always be on the left with its staff in

94
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:39.061
front of the staff of the other flag lightly before being lowered at sunset.

95
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.690
The flag should again be raised to the peak momentarily.

96
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.740
It should be lowered slowly with a solemn dignity be fitting the occasion.

97
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.320
Why slow down mom?

98
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.050
[inaudible] that's not with the Miami shooting. I say North Sattler.

99
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.130
I drop my phone. You

100
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.970
<v 0>have a compass mom.</v>

101
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.530
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.660
<v 0>so there you have it.</v>

103
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.190
<v 2>Thank you. Now</v>

104
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.530
<v 0>we sent it off to IRA. Ira opened it up or whatever.</v>

105
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:20.810
Put It on it and this is his opinion.

106
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.240
<v 3>It was horrible. Yeah, it was really hard.</v>

107
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.150
When you say I do it to the point where like we're like, you know, there's,

108
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.230
there's, there's stories which, which people turn in and, and you know,

109
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.180
then they need a little buffing up here and there and then there's stories that

110
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:36.620
are bad and then there's a special category where we really don't know what to

111
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:37.454
say.

112
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.860
<v 0>So apparently he didn't like it. Uh, here's what his producer,</v>

113
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:45.110
Julie Snyder had said.

114
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.150
<v 3>And I remember at the time I was working out of my apartment and so I remember</v>

115
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:55.151
even at one point standing in the bathroom staring at that brick wall listening

116
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:00.850
to the piece while I was on the phone and just being really, really confused.

117
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.810
<v 0>I thought it was past this,</v>

118
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:05.000
but I'm literally tearing up in embarrassment right now.

119
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.730
<v 3>I was just very confused. I was very, very, very confused.</v>

120
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:12.550
I have a better perspective on it now. I stand by my earlier job.

121
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.030
I am not confused and, and everything that was bad about it, it's still bad.

122
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.360
Like it, it doesn't have a point. You know what I mean?

123
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:23.610
Like it starts off in a place that, that, that,

124
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.840
that seems like it could go somewhere and then it's almost like the two of you

125
00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:32.580
take this premise of this old record and then you just kind of dance on the

126
00:07:32.581 --> 00:07:36.900
surface of this record and thrown a lot of shenanigans and then it ends and it

127
00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:40.320
says literally nothing. So at the end of two minutes,

128
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.260
it's both sort of complicated.

129
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.490
You keep waiting to understand what is it about and then ultimately you are left

130
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.600
wondering what was that about? I mean, I mean,

131
00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:53.110
it's just amazing that you were able to,

132
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:56.860
to put together such a wonderful program after that. I, I, you know, that,

133
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.640
that somehow, I mean, I don't,

134
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.730
I'm trying to say that that was listening back to it today. I was just like,

135
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:05.960
wow, it is really interesting to see sort of the incredibly early stages.

136
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.890
You just got really, really headed in the wrong direction.

137
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.940
<v 0>But if someone were to have walked in the room and asked both of you,</v>

138
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.270
will these two guys succeed at Vac at that moment you would have said no

139
00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:21.050
freaking [inaudible].

140
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.810
<v 3>Oh, absolutely not. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. A community.</v>

141
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.700
They're terrible influence on each other.

142
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.000
That jad allows a kind of stuff indulgence in Robert and Robert brings out a

143
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:34.700
sort of self indulgence and Jad clearly looked terrible chemistry.

144
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.490
Like I'd never, I'd never would've put you together on anything ever again.

145
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.500
<v 0>[inaudible] let</v>

146
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.150
<v 3>me just say like, this wasn't an episode where, where we were,</v>

147
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:44.990
we were demanding a lot. We were looking, all we wanted was,

148
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.710
things would be short. And if this is an episode where one of the,

149
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:53.711
one of the segments that made it where you guys didn't with simply scallops on a

150
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.070
beach, no narration, just going like click the cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook,

151
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.270
Cook, Cook. That's it. The sound,

152
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.110
the scallops for 25 seconds we ran that instead of running this.

153
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.680
<v 0>So we lost out the scallops.</v>

154
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.540
<v 4>Yeah. Well first of all, IRA went to Brown University.</v>

155
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.150
They don't know anything there. They don't have majors. They don't have any,

156
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.610
I don't know what they do there exactly.

157
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.670
But if that man thinks that clicking scallops beats our flag thing,

158
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.030
he should go back to radio school and start all over. It's my opinion,

159
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:21.920
my humble opinion. Yes,

160
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.540
<v 0>exactly. Got a little Oberlin. Yeah. Ah,</v>

161
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.820
<v 4>anyway, no, he's a great supporter of the show.</v>

162
00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:33.650
So this was an in auspicious beginning to say say the least. We thought,

163
00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:34.091
well if we get,

164
00:09:34.091 --> 00:09:37.010
if we failed on the two minute IRA thing like with now what are we going to do?

165
00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:37.844
So uh,

166
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.210
what your friend is in this situation is that there is a kind of a restless

167
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.910
newness and a kind of ambition that sort of,

168
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.810
and I really do feel it comes from here in some way that you,

169
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.570
you keep wanting to poke at things, you keep wanting to challenge things.

170
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.820
<v 0>The flip side of that as the IRA situation was,</v>

171
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.410
which just one bit of evidence of four is that sometimes it doesn't translate so

172
00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:05.760
well to the rest of the world. Yeah. I go by her. Yeah.

173
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.310
<v 4>Recently there was somebody who was a vomiting in color this week on campus.</v>

174
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.301
Like you know,

175
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:13.450
that's a little excessive either to taking color dye and then vomiting out in

176
00:10:13.451 --> 00:10:15.760
some kind of interesting tablet here though.

177
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.550
<v 0>Well, well I'll just give you an example. Personally,</v>

178
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:25.050
I spent four years, uh, and composition here, writing music,

179
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.930
uh, writing this kind of music basically.

180
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.860
<v 2>What were you thinking? I was thinking 200 years of,</v>

181
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.260
you know, European harmony handed down that, you know, screw that.

182
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.200
Why should we take the harmonies that are given to us from the European

183
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.250
[inaudible] what's that?

184
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.880
[inaudible] what does that ideal continent doesn't enter the new confidence

185
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.370
question, man. Question

186
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.060
<v 0>in did you makes perfect sense here.</v>

187
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.013
It overlap.

188
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.430
[inaudible] is the only room where you'd get applause for that kind of music.

189
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.620
And I love you all for it. But no, no quicker.

190
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.020
Could you clear a room then it put something like

191
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.240
on and people would just run from the room. And I've tried this in New York.

192
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:24.560
I've said, hey, check this thing out. I made when I was a senior and uh,

193
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.760
it didn't go so well. Um, for me,

194
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:31.770
Oberlin and the kind of uh,

195
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.800
thought process and respect for ideas and also hostility towards ideas that you

196
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:39.450
want to sort of, you want to poke at things that, oh,

197
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:43.740
very Oberlin's spirit is something that for me was like a grenade where you pull

198
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:46.740
the pin and it goes off later.

199
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.810
And for me that was about seven years later.

200
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.070
I mean I spent several years wondering what the hell did I learn here?

201
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.560
Like I know how to create some of the most awful and dissonant music to saw

202
00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:02.140
pianos in half, which was like encouraged and odd ways.

203
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.370
Not that I ever did that, but what does that really give you?

204
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:07.240
But what it gives you,

205
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:10.600
I think is something interesting and beautiful because those ideas come back in

206
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:12.730
a very different form.

207
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.250
<v 4>So you can see then that really what we're doing is,</v>

208
00:12:16.251 --> 00:12:18.290
this is about complex ideas,

209
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.450
but it is essentially because of Janet is a big musical composition that we are

210
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:24.284
doing.

211
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.430
This gives us a chance to do what music actually does when it's just naked and

212
00:12:28.431 --> 00:12:29.264
being music,

213
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.760
which is to thrill you or give you a feeling of deep sadness or grief.

214
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.133
<v 2>Sure.</v>

215
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.330
[inaudible]

216
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.200
<v 0>so anyways,</v>

217
00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:46.980
we went on and on and around who was where the overland nostalgia began.

218
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.940
So we'll leave it at that for now. But afterwards we had time for two questions.

219
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.270
The audience questions weren't recorded so Robert had to paraphrase. Here he is.

220
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.590
<v 4>The question is how do we choose what level to approach a topic at when our</v>

221
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:03.220
listeners range from people who know nothing to people who know all too much.

222
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.300
<v 0>Um, that's an interesting question cause it is maybe uh, Robert and I are very,</v>

223
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.310
uh, we like each other a lot. Um, but we this, we disagree on many,

224
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:20.080
many things and this is the one of the ones we always fight about cause I come

225
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:24.260
down on the, on one side of your question and he comes down on another often.

226
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.340
<v 4>I am a network trained reporter in my companies where I've worked at ABC for</v>

227
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.220
example, if you have a problem,

228
00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:34.220
like if you go jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch,

229
00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:35.960
I'm not sure exactly what kind of a substance it was.

230
00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:39.200
I then dropped the substance, make it a pale. He's going to just fetch a pail.

231
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.570
The Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail. Good.

232
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.870
We don't have to deal with a water issue at all. It also shortens the peace.

233
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.060
So I,

234
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.530
I find safety in less and what I discovered is he thinks,

235
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.400
he thinks to say to solve it is to say Jack and Jill went up the hill to get a

236
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.500
pail of, well first of all, we'll begin with two molecules.

237
00:13:57.501 --> 00:13:59.840
We'll put them together. Then we'll add another molecule in quarter.

238
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.170
Let's talk to 17 people about that. So no, we do not do that.

239
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.091
<v 0>So we have it.</v>

240
00:14:05.091 --> 00:14:09.200
We have a complexity disagreement that sort of runs through these shows where

241
00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:14.201
I'll come in with a 25 minute version of some sort of neuroscience story with,

242
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.330
with very exciting words like dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over and over.

243
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.580
And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

244
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.010
<v 4>no. What's had to say that him is like terrifying to me.</v>

245
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:29.920
I think if you have a latinate you just run from the room. That's what I think.

246
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.670
<v 0>So we have a,</v>

247
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:36.370
a bit of a tug of war often during the editing process where where I put in too

248
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:40.690
much, he takes out and then we sort of like, we find a nice balance where we,

249
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.980
we might be talking to, I don't know everybody,

250
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:49.600
but talking in a way that doesn't fall into the traps of talking to those who

251
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:52.010
know too much but also doesn't dumb down.

252
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.150
So there is a broad expansive geography in the middle. I think we both

253
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.490
<v 4>start also is very [inaudible].</v>

254
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.550
We don't really know what we're talking about at the beginning.

255
00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:01.950
And then we find out along the way and we make that very clear.

256
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.860
So we never pretend anybody that we're scholars because we're not.

257
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.670
And we do represent ourselves as novices, which is a good thing.

258
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.890
It is a good thing in a couple of ways. First it means we can say what honestly.

259
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.460
And the second thing it's like, could you explain that again? Honestly.

260
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.700
And then the third thing is it, um,

261
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.060
it allows us to challenge these people,

262
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.210
uh, as though we were ordinary. Curious folks say,

263
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.080
you can't mean that we have a show coming up right now about synthetic biology

264
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.290
where engineers are building life forms that are new to existence,

265
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.610
new to the history of life, and they're doing it quite aggressively.

266
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.110
And, uh,

267
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.790
we know we yell at them and we fight with them and we argue with them and I give

268
00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:45.624
right back.

269
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.400
But we're trying to model a kind of conversation with important people,

270
00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:53.910
powerful people, but particularly knowledgeable people where we say,

271
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:57.930
you can go up to a person with a lot of knowledge and ask him why.

272
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.720
Ask him, how does he know that? Tell him,

273
00:16:00.721 --> 00:16:05.721
stop asking him why he keeps going and get away with it.

274
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.470
And that's important. Yep.

275
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.160
<v 0>Also for me, I mean, just to add to that, uh, it's important to me. I mean,</v>

276
00:16:11.161 --> 00:16:15.030
I am the child of two scientists and uh, it's funny,

277
00:16:15.031 --> 00:16:19.320
I once tried to interview my mom and she went into scientist mode and it was

278
00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:20.400
really startling because she would,

279
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.390
I mean my whole life would come home at the dinner table and she's studying

280
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.050
intake of fat into cells. That's her thing. And so she'd say,

281
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.060
here's how I think it works. Jan.

282
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.450
She grabbed a Napkin and like kinda carve it into a circle, like a cell and say,

283
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:36.720
here's, okay, now this salt shaker, this is a, this is a fat molecule.

284
00:16:36.721 --> 00:16:39.240
It's trying to get into the cell and it's coming, coming, coming, coming,

285
00:16:39.241 --> 00:16:41.990
coming. But it needs something to ferry it through the cell wall.

286
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.680
So here's the fork. The fork is a protein. It's a protein I study in,

287
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:47.880
it takes the salt shaker, which is the fat,

288
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.130
and it ferries it through the cell wall and she's just like,

289
00:16:50.131 --> 00:16:51.990
I don't know what the hell she's talking about, but,

290
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:56.280
but what I get from her is this, like excitement. It's a passion. It's a just,

291
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.360
it's a sense of mystery of like figuring something out about the universe.

292
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.320
But then I tried to interview her and she went into a really sort of careful

293
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.200
mediated scientist way.

294
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.010
We're using like Alpha lipoic acid, kind of chronic really big words.

295
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.510
And so for me it's about challenging people and it's about challenging people

296
00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:16.980
who know as he was saying.

297
00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:21.870
But it's also about presenting science as something which is not inevitable.

298
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:27.240
It is not something where people who are esteemed sit behind podiums and convey

299
00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:31.590
knowledge to the rest of us who know nothing. It's about going into your lab,

300
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.400
screwing up, making mistakes, you know, breaking stuff,

301
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.780
doing it again and again and again till you get lucky. You know, it's just,

302
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.490
it's like anything, it's like, it's like a board.

303
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.330
Like you have to get lucky a lot of times. Yeah. So it's a, so for me, I, I,

304
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.610
there's a double edge to this. Like you want, you don't,

305
00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:48.990
you want to bring them off their podium.

306
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.460
You also want to make them feel a flawed and wonderful,

307
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.880
you know? [inaudible]

308
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.440
<v 4>well, we'll, we'll take one last question. If you got me. Yeah.</v>

309
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.380
<v 0>How do we pick what to talk about? Well, I don't [inaudible]</v>

310
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.980
<v 4>no, exactly. I W we live,</v>

311
00:18:05.981 --> 00:18:09.100
we talk about a lot of things and then something stick to the wall.

312
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.780
Like we were talking about sperm.

313
00:18:10.781 --> 00:18:13.930
We're not sure where we're allowed to talk about sperm in public, but uh,

314
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.330
sperm has gotten so interesting. Did you know recently in the last few weeks,

315
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.830
did you know that the testes have a blue whale that can weigh one ton?

316
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.650
I mean that just stops the traffic.

317
00:18:26.651 --> 00:18:28.240
So we have to sing that whether we're allowed to,

318
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.300
whether we're allowed to do that.

319
00:18:31.301 --> 00:18:34.570
So sometimes we have to like sort of test whether it's polite enough.

320
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:39.400
But the other thing is is do we continue to think about it? Does it Sorta,

321
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.600
does it stay sticky? And if we keep coming back, I'm sorry.

322
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.190
Hey, you're the school where they're vomiting for art out there. Uh,

323
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.710
so thank you all very, very much for coming. It's been a, a great,

324
00:18:53.711 --> 00:18:55.540
great delight to be here. Thanks

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.510
<v 5>you enjoyed the podcast.</v>

326
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.230
Thanks to everyone at Oberlin College for the warm homecoming reception
