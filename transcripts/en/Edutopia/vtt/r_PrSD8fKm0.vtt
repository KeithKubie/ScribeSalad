00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:16.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For centuries,
the Choctaw Indians

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:20.716
of Mississippi have celebrated
their culture in games and dances.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:30.566
&gt;&gt;Group: [sings]

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now the youngest
generation is learning

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.136
about their tribe's culture
and sharing their discoveries

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:40.206
with a global audience through
the International Education

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.876
and Resource Network's
First Peoples Project.

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:46.256
Indigenous people from
five continents participate

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:47.806
in this cultural exchange.

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:51.796
&gt;&gt;Student: [speaks Choctaw]

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:58.096
&gt;&gt;Man: Our ancestors were praising
the animals that provided food and...

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students conduct research
into their own unique heritage.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:06.596
They then write stories, draw
pictures and take photographs.

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:09.336
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going to
send this digital picture

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.706
to the [inaudible] group in Thailand.

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.306
What'll we write?

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:16.436
First a greeting and then
we're going to tell them

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:18.966
about the picture that
we're sending them.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:20.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The artwork is displayed

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.806
on the First Peoples Project Web
site, and it's also exchanged

00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:26.626
by mail each year with
other project schools.

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:31.166
&gt;&gt;Student: This is the kind of
painting done by Albert Lewis.

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:38.006
He's in fifth grade, and I
reckon the colors is well done.

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:42.126
&gt;&gt;Bob: We display the
artwork and different teachers

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:46.466
in schools may develop their
own curriculum activities,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.776
because we have this treasure
that's come in once a year.

00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:51.666
&gt;&gt;Student: They live
in houses like these.

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:58.126
They don't have very much
possessions and they sleep on mats

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:01.366
and don't have a lot of furniture,

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:04.556
and this is -- they
have small tables.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Mississippi
band of Choctaw Indians,

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:12.706
which operates the largest and most
tech-savvy reservation school systems

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:17.956
in the country has participated in
the First Peoples Project since 1995.

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:18.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Let's do that one.

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:22.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This year, the First
Peoples Project theme is "pastimes,"

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:25.156
and for the Choctaw,
that means stickball.

00:02:25.756 --> 00:02:29.686
America's first field sport, it was
called "the little brother of war"

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:34.336
and traditionally played to settle
disputes among rival factions.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.516
The rules are simple in
this rough-and-tumble game:

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:40.656
Carry or throw the ball
downfield using your sticks,

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:43.666
then bounce it off the
other team's goalpost.

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:47.896
&gt;&gt;Jason: You've got to be strong
body, mind and your spirit.

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:51.336
You've just got to be all toughened.

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.056
If not, you're going to get
hurt once you start playing.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:56.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition
to the art exchange,

00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:59.776
the First Peoples Project has
a humanitarian aid component,

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.146
an effort that began
several years ago,

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:04.966
when Choctaw students
were watching a videotape

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.706
that showed the stark conditions
of a project school in Thailand.

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:11.676
&gt;&gt;Woman: You can see all
-- what do you call --

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:15.516
the holes that the wind can seep in.

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:19.566
It's very cold in the night, and
the teacher said one of the things

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:24.976
that they need a lot is blankets
to help keep the cold away.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:27.896
&gt;&gt;Bob: Some students that were
watching the film at the time says,

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:29.246
"We've got plenty of blankets.

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:31.436
Can we just send them some blankets?"

00:03:31.436 --> 00:03:35.586
and at the same time the
kids in Zuni, New Mexico,

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:37.616
were seeing the film,
and they just happened

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:41.706
to say basically the same
thing: "Well, we make blankets.

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:42.466
We have blankets.

00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:44.216
Can we send them some blankets?"

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:46.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So the students
launched a humanitarian effort

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:48.726
that is still going strong today.

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:52.576
&gt;&gt;Student: So we made Christmas
cards for Thailand to raise money,

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.266
and we gave them a generator.

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:56.926
&gt;&gt;Woman: That's great.

00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:58.906
What did you think about that?

00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:01.116
&gt;&gt;Student: I thought
it was kind of nice.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:05.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So far, the tribe
has raised money to buy blankets,

00:04:05.236 --> 00:04:08.686
flooring and a generator and
fund a teacher's aide position

00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:11.436
and several student scholarships
for the Thailand school.

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:12.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look this way.

00:04:12.396 --> 00:04:13.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While the
humanitarian efforts

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:16.316
and the art exchanges connect
students to their peers

00:04:16.316 --> 00:04:18.136
around the globe, the process

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:21.136
of researching their own
culture has given these students

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:24.926
and even greater reward: a chance
to connect with their elders.

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:26.596
&gt;&gt;Student: What's your
favorite Choctaw dance?

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:30.906
&gt;&gt;Man: Snake Dance, because you
maneuver to the right, to the left,

00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:33.706
and you just wiggle around,
and that's the way life is.

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:36.366
Life is not always straight road,

00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:38.976
and that's what the Snake
Dance reminds me of.

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:43.546
&gt;&gt;Group: [sings]

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:48.556
&gt;&gt;Bob: The importance of this project
has been it prods us to research

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:53.076
and get the kids working in areas
that are significant here at home,

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:54.866
communicating more with their elders.

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:56.286
&gt;&gt;Student: When did
you start chanting?

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.796
&gt;&gt;Man: I was with John Levi Bell.

00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:00.146
You ever heard of John Levi Bell?

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:05.896
&gt;&gt;Bob: Researching culture, learning
how to research through the Internet

00:05:05.896 --> 00:05:08.336
and coming up with the information,

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:10.726
going through the process,
the learning process.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:19.686
&gt;&gt;I don't want kids to forget
about traditional dancing

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:24.176
or traditional cooking or
speaking their own language,

00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:29.516
and maybe I can influence or somebody
else can influence these kids

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:31.966
that we need to keep our
tradition and our culture alive.

00:05:32.516 --> 00:05:39.546
&gt;&gt;Group: [sings]

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:40.876
&gt;&gt;Man: Can you all speak Choctaw?

00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:41.386
&gt;&gt;Student: A little bit.

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:46.076
&gt;&gt;Man: And even if you just can say
a few words in Choctaw, that's okay.

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:48.106
Anything you want to
learn, you can learn.

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:52.526
We're all supposed to learn
from each other as we go along,

00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:53.926
because I can learn from you.

00:05:53.926 --> 00:05:55.626
I'm learning something from you

00:05:55.626 --> 00:05:58.166
about that humanitarian
-- I didn't know that.

00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:00.076
I learned something from you.

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:03.696
I hope you learn something from me.

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:08.616
