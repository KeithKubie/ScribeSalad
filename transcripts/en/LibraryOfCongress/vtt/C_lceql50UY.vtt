&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.310
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
Good afternoon and welcome

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.750
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.930
My name is Talia Guzman-Gonzalez
and I am a reference librarian

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.900
and Luso-Brazilian specialist
in the Hispanic Division.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.270
It is my great pleasure to
have you all here to talk

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.300
about Exile, Diaspora,
and Return:

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.760
Changing Cultural Landscapes
in Argentina, Chile,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.050
Uruguay, and Paraguay.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.620
A team research project by
Luis Roniger, Leonardo Senkman,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.890
Saúl Sosnowski, and
Mario Sznajder.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.500
Today we have with us two
of the authors of the book,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.020
two of the team members, Luis
and Saúl, who will be talking

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.840
with Professor Juan
Uriagereka from the Department

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.820
of Linguistics and
Professor Ernesto Calvo

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330
from the Department of
Government and Politics,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.310
both at the University
of Maryland College Park.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.110
I'm going to briefly introduce
Professors Roniger and Sosnowski

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.250
and then I'm going to pass
the microphone to Saúl

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.140
who will be the emcee
for the event.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.920
Luis Roniger is Reynolds
Professor

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.120
of Latin American Studies
at Wake Forest University.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.580
He is a comparative political
sociologist and his work focuses

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.650
on the interface
between politics,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.010
society, and public culture.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.720
He has published numerous
journal articles and books

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.980
on a vast range of topics
including human rights,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.670
transitional politics, exile
and democracy in Latin America.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.840

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.790
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
Hispamerica, sorry.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.430
Yeah. Currently in what,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.440
currently in what
issue, what-- Saúl?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.080
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
47th year.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.380
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Yeah.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.680
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
Amazing.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.150
And I lost where I was.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.370
Thank you.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.360
His work centers on issues
of civic education, democracy

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.920
and conflict management
and cultural politics

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.880

Please join me in welcoming
our distinguished guests

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.510
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.030
[ Applause ]

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.380
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
Thank you, Talia.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.800
And through you I would also
like to thank Georgia Durham

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.580
for the arrangements and for
the invitation to be able

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.540
to present Exile,
Diaspora, and Return:

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.620
Changing Cultural Landscapes
in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.010
and Uruguay, a book that was
produced by four colleagues.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.400
I was going to say quatro
amigos, then the reference is

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.810
to tres amigos and we are in the
[inaudible] pick for two room

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.640
and this is leading
us someplace else.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.920
And the four of us, Luis
Roniger, a sociologist,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.790
Mario Sznajder, a
political scientist,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.500
Leonardo Senkman a historian,
and I from the literary side,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.240
have been working on
these kinds of issues

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.060
from different vantage points

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.060
and different perspectives
for quite a while.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.590
And we decided at some point
that it would be a good idea

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.810
to approach a neglected area,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.530
what we consider the
neglected area of research

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.560
about which my colleagues will
be speaking a little later.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.590
So the first meeting took
place as many meetings

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.880
of this sort take place
in Jerusalem and it--

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.330
or the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.880
on the Mount Scopus Campus.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.350
And once we decided that we were
going to engage in this product,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.580
in this project that
turned out to be a product,

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.470
we held meetings in different
parts of Latin America as well

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.950
as here and more
than once in Israel.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.400
And this was due to the
fact that we were very lucky

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.440
to obtain the support from the
Binational Science Foundation

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.400
Israel to US that allowed us
to carry out this research

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.250
which mandated several trips in
order to interview a whole array

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.780
of people in each of
the four countries,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.540
and more about that
a little later.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.100
The transition to democracy
in each case was subject

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.240
to very radically different
approaches and conditions

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.500
which in turn conditioned and
affected the process of return,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.130
the policies to promote
such a return and the impact

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.690
that returnees have had on
the respective countries.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.860
And this is a subject that
I'm sure will be touched upon

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.130
by our colleagues.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.470
I think it is worth
noting that though none

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.360
of the four authors currently
live in our birthplace,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.490
three of us are from Argentina

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.640
and even the Chilean among
us was born in Buenos Aires

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.520
but he opted for
becoming a Chilean,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.440
a common mistake by some people.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.860
One of our defining
identities is clearly anchored

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.470
in the region.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.330
Objective analysis in carrying

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.830
out research has been
a guiding principle,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.360
but so I sense it's a sense
of commitment that each one

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.440
of us has to the region, sort

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.650
of a necessary unavoidable
commitment to both memory

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.640
and to the unfolding present.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.120
I'm very grateful to two of my
colleagues from the University

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.630
of Maryland who have agreed to
speak about some of the issues

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.100
that are addressed in the
book, maybe about the book too,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.900
but we'll find out shortly since
both of them have been very,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.180
very active in related issues.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.240
Ernesto Calvo who holds a PhD

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.160
from Northwestern University is
a professor and associate chair

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.330
in the Department of
Government and Politics

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.530
at the University of Maryland.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.620
His research on political
representation, elections

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.480
and congresses has
received numerous awards.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.930
He is the author of "Legislator
Success in Fragmented Congresses

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.400
in Argentina" published

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.690
by Cambridge University
Press in 2014.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.690
"La nueva politica de Partidos"

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.580
by Prometeo years
before in 2005.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.650
And relatively-- recently

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:25.360
"Anatomia Politica de Twitter en
Argentina: tuiteando #Nisman",

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.300
a project that gathered
the attention of many

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.310
of our graduate students
at College Park.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.320
He's currently conducting
research and patronage networks,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.850
co-sponsorship networks
and representation.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.310
Ernesto Calvo will
be going first.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.390
But in order to make it
a smoother transition,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:52.370
let me introduce already
Juan Uriagereka who says

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.670
that whatever I'm going

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.910
to be telling you right now
really does not represent him.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.670
And in a way it's sort of true

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.840
because he's a lot more
done what I'm going

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.140
to be reading to you.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.760
But that is the case of
our other friends also.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.750
He is a linguist who has
joined the University

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.660
of Maryland in 1989.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.930
I must say that when he
joined Maryland, he also came

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.970
in a joint appointment with
Spanish and Portuguese.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.780
Later he drifted
towards linguistic,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.770
but that mistake will be
remedied effective this coming

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.350
fall when he will become part
of the Department of Spanish

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.150
and Portuguese while
maintaining his affiliation

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.450
with linguistics.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.120
He has published a dozen books

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.720
on language structure
including two textbooks,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.070
"The Minimalist Program"
and its precursors,

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.030
as well as many articles
and chapters.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.150
He is a founding member of
the Linguistics Department.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.540
And in his capacity as
Associate Provost for Faculty,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.810
a post he held for quite a few
years, he lead the approval

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.580
and promotion of
family-friendly policies,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.230
regularizing the status of
professional track faculty,

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.970
organizing leadership forums

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.990
and updating promotion
and tenure policies.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.960
His current book
projects include the books

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.280
"Biolinguistic Investigations on
the Formal Language Hierarchy",

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.880
a monograph in progress and
structure with Howard Lasnik,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.760
and a multidisciplinary project
to formulate language structures

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.330
as linear operators of the sort
employed in machine learning.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.210
Having said that, which
sounds very technical,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.010
the most important part is
that when he came to Maryland,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.520
he said it works with
both sides of his brain.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.780
And he is a fiction writer.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.840
And not just-- and we have a
few things cooking along the way

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.130
that, well, maybe a little
presentation here one day.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.450
We'll see.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.370
Gentlemen, thank you first of
all for agreeing to be here

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.300
and the floor is yours, Ernesto.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:04.260
[ Applause ]

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.560
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: So first,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.760
thank you so much
for the invitation.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.510
And I love the book, so
it's a nice book to present.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.580
I do have to say that it's a
bit of a self-serving likeness

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.060
of the book because there's
a lot of things that happened

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.880
in the book and there are a
lot of things that are related

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.140
that actually go to
my personal life.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.630
So let me start by pointing to a
couple of anecdotes that I think

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.400
that highlight I think
what's a true contribution

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.410
at least for me of the book.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.440
So we're having common
Lazaro Cardenas,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.740
[inaudible], the Dow Jones, MTV.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.240
So let me start with a story.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.650
So when-- in 1976 my family
went to Mexico on exile.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.730
My mother is [inaudible] and
pretty much the entire side

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.750
of my family went to either
Mexico, Spain or Venezuela.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.900
So, most of the exile community
which is actually told here,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.150
you know, with the kids,
they put kids in communities

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.770
and we were connected to
each other, we form networks.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.070
The kind of networks that are--

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.370
we're able to describe
in the book

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.920
that have been persisting
for, you know,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.220
40 years at this point.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.070
So when a lot of us
went to one school

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.370
that was called [inaudible].

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.770
Maybe some of you,
if you're connected

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.280
to the Afghan-Mex
committee heard about it.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.320
And in the [inaudible] we would
have practices that we would go

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.840
to the countryside in Mexico.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.710
The first one that
we went was to do--

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.020
to analyze wood production
in Mexico in Michoacán.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.640
At the time the governor

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.570
of Michoacán was
Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.250
And his son, Lazaro Cardenas
was actually a classmate

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.550
of my brother.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.850
And because he was the
son of the governor,

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.890
he organized the meeting so
that we could put our tents

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.820
in the government
house the first day

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.970
because then we would
go to the area

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.840
that wood was being produced.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.070
So the first night when we
were in the government mansion,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.220
outside in the gardeners
with our tents,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.640
we start to hear
some odd noises.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.910
So we come out, several
of us, and start to hear

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.050
that something was
going on in the tent.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:07.450
And tent was Lazaro Cardenas
with one of our teachers,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.030
which was also a
refugee from Uruguay.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.570
And outside of the tent was,
you know a lot my friends

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.060
that was the son of Pepe Perez
[assumed spelling] which is one

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.640
of the historians at the time,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.090
historians for most
historians was the--

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.750
the director of the
museum archeology

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.030
and he was [inaudible] which was
the stepson of [inaudible] also

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.370
in the book which later wrote
the discourse of [inaudible]

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.900
and then was [inaudible].

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:39.290
So it was about twelve of
us from Chile, from Uruguay,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.660
from Argentina because a lot
of the community in exile puts

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.330
in kids in sort of
the same school.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.720
And it was a school on the
left political spectrum.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.650
We would organize
politically there.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.710
And we have formed strong
bonds and you would see

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.550
that through layers
of generations

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.940
that would call our [inaudible]
and we would be the, you know,

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.910
sons and daughters of the
people who went in exile.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.530
So the book is really good.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.830
I'm describing something

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.870
that generally has not been
well portrayed which is

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.080
that exiles are of very
different kinds and they're--

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.890
the sort of terror
and destruction

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.000
that triggers the situation
exile does not necessarily

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.290
continues in the
same way, you know.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.350
In a way eventually exile
for many other people

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.340
that I know became
a source of pride,

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.080
a source of community building.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.810
And most of us remain connected.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.850
So when there earthquake
hit Mexico last year,

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.430
we were calling all of
our friends in Mexico.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.370
And when one of our classmates
was kidnapped by the--

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.320
by Pinochet in 1997, we were
demonstrating in Argentina.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.790
We were demonstrating in Chile.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.740
We were demonstrating
in Mexico and Uruguay.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.080
So this community started

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.800
to produce very significant
networks

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.280
that connected our countries
and that remains the case.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.090
We have, you know, friends that
are musicians that are playing

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.010
in Mexico and some of them
are actually faculty here

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.690
in California, in MIT,
some of them-- my friends.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.990
That's not me.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.700
And so, then--

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.480
&gt;&gt; Which I turned it off.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.540
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: Santiago Perez
I was saying for example ended

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.480
up being the director of
Dow Jones for Latin America,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.790
[inaudible] ended
up in MTV as a--

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:17.740
one of the creatives of
MIT-- MTV doing publicity.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.850
So every one of those remained
connected to the network

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.470
and we have our own Facebook
page which is [inaudible]

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.890
where we connect and track
each other's history.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:33.400
The source and pride and glory
of the school is Chivo Lubezki

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.130
which is, you know, the one

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.240
that won three Oscars
for cinematography.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.940
That was actually was a Mexican.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.660
So and-- so one of
the interesting things

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.550
about the book is it starts
by narrating exile not just

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:53.960
as a source of a terror, demise,
death, sort of their picture

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.830
that you have from there
Nacional Buenos Aires

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.900
where a lot of you have
seen these pictures,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.200
a very classic picture
of [inaudible],

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.400
a picture of the class of
1975 in the Buenos Aires,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.690
most of which ended
up in exile or death.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.220
So that's a picture that most

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.570
of the narratives of
exiles begin with.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.780
But what they don't say
is what happen afterwards,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.560
which is how these
communities start to build roots

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.770
and they start to
become very transnational

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:26.070
and start operating a very large
number of countries socially,

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.890
culturally, politically, and
start to engage in activities

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.020
that will signify exile
and turn it into something

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.140
that is pretty different.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.640
So the book, what it does

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.830
that I think is wonderful is
rebuilding those later networks.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.430
OK. How these people that
were on exile are reabsorbed,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.950
are reintegrated, how two things
are at the core of the community

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.810
in exile that is returning?

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.110
One, they come back
with political capital,

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.310
with social capital,
with cultural capital

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.710
that allows them
to give a narrative

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.570
about both the dictatorship,
exile.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.380
The other one is that
it produces a network

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.400
that overlays the network
in Latin America where all

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.340
of Latin America is
touched by notes.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.390
So all of us have networks
in the other countries

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:23.710
and are connected with
the Onam in Mexico

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.780
or with the [inaudible] in
Mexico, FPB, the [inaudible].

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.550
You know, all the different
institutions have actually

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.950
members of exile.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.360
And it's not just the Argentina
exiles, the Argentina exiles,

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.590
the Uruguayan exiles,
the Chilean exile.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.970
Twenty out of 22 countries

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.190
of Latin America had
authoritarian regimes

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.750
when we moved to Mexico.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.450
And Mexico was a big hub.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.750
Most of those countries

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.690
that were authoritarians
produced communities that left

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.550
to Italy as they described, to
Venezuela, to Spain, to France.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.180
And all of us remain connected

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.040
because it was not different
families to different places.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.430
Oftentimes, we actually
have members in, you know,

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.760
each one of those places.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.800
So as I was saying, you know,
my family goes in exile.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.100
We went to Mexico.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.630
One of my uncles
went to Venezuela,

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.590
another one of my
uncles went to Spain.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.780
Then they moved to Spain,
the ones from Venezuela.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:15.090
Then all my cousins ended up
in the US doing academic work.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.020
And generally, I spend a couple
of months in a year in Argentina

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.130
and maybe a month in the
other places in the region.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.870
And by rebuilding
these other structures

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.000
that characterize
the exile, what--

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.220
what they do is to bring what
we actually remember from exile.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.240
Most of the pictures of exile
depict what happens with,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.710
you know, at the
time of departure.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.550
You know, the fact that my
father was in jail when he comes

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.920
out and we're going to exile.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.330
He actually produces-- an entire
operation to try to cover us

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.630
so that nothing would happen

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.930
when we were exiting
the country.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.580
We arrived to Mexico and
everything is depleted.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.460
But over two, or
three, or four years,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.850
these networks actually
starts to build things

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.720
that are extremely interesting,
and starts to build catalog

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.600
that was impossible to being
thought about later on.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:17.900
So in-- when in-- the
discussion, decision for example

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.160
to go back to Argentina,
they hit right

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.460
on the nail of the segregation.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.620
We had huge discussions
about where to go,

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.970
when to go, what to go for.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.150
So for example three months
after democratization,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.450
I went back to Argentina

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.980
but my parents were not
willing to do so yet.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.050
Not without knowing that
the situation was going

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.350
to be politically stable.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.030
So I arrived to Argentina,
15-year-old,

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.700
living on basically my community
or, you know, kids and parents

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.050
from exile that are
returning in different stages

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.210
and that are producing
the same kind of--

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.230
building bridges that we had
in Mexico when we arrived.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.780
So the networks starts

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.700
to be staged both going
forward and coming backward.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.930
And at the same time we have
some friends that had said

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.750
to go back to Argentina
that once they're

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.460
in Argentina realized that there
is no longer a political goal

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.590
that they actually can sustain
or are willing to defend.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.170
So some of them go back to
Mexico or ended up in the US.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.830
So you start to see these sort
of very different patterns

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.640
of migration that carried and
networks have been created

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.210
to a very large number
of places.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.850
So, each one of the chapters
is actually reconstructing part

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.150
of those debates.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.400
Debates about should we
accept for example payment

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.280
for the hardships that
we face in an exile?

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.580
There was a huge discussion

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.120
in the community whether
reparations should be accepted

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.510
and we were very divided.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.570
We didn't want to
accept reparations

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.980
but at the same time
other people wanted

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.030
to accept reparations
and the decision

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.540
to it was very personal, but
it was discussed collectively

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.500
as our problem in our community.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.850
The same happened with
the recent reparations.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.330
My father received one
but at the same time,

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.000
it was a huge discussion whether
you should receive reparations

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.780
for having been in prison
under-- or repent, you know,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.500
the national executive.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.920
So these sort of discussions are
building political narratives

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.840
that do not have to do
with the crimes committed

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.910
by the dictatorship and do not
have to do with the conditions

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.570
in which we left to the exile.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.180
But actually daily
political life

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.520
of constructing networks
once you are

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.210
in this position to accept.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:20.430
And that's I think what
makes this book different.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.730
Most of the other books,
they're not that many,

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.050
but most of the other books
that I've seen, what they tried

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.270
to do is to reconstruct the
source of the destruction

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.770
of this community knowing

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.860
and then consider how then
they say exile accentuates your

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.810
natural craziness, which
is absolutely true.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.160
We were all absolutely insane
in many different ways just

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.670
so that you have
a taste of that.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.800
For a few months, I
would go into stores,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.640
big stores like we had
Liverpool and stole things.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.970
And before getting to the door,
I would actually leave them

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.470
by the door so that when I
was obtained by the police,

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.000
I would actually start
shouting at them.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.650
We were very insane,
maybe different ways.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.970
But the interesting thing
is that this actually builds

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.790
into networks that produce
interesting political results.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.880
And we're-- there's
reparation, a certain reparation

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.850
that is done by the
community and by the networks

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.580
that are formed in
the community.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.520
I think that's a wonderful
result of the book.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:33.750
[ Applause ]

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.190
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka:
I have to apologize

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.510
because I'm not a professional,

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:42.280
so I wrote some notes
just to think about this.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.850
I was born in the '50s

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:49.270
in a normal Spanish
family from Spain.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.110
President Eisenhower had
just ended the blockade

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:57.470
that had us start
after the Great War.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:03.400
The alternative to invading with
Hitler in Mussolini defeated.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.020
It wouldn't have been easy
for the French or British

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.830
who hadn't been willing to
stop fascism in its inception.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.330
Stalin was eager too but fearing
the west wanted the Soviets

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.990
controlling the Mediterranean.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.630
Well over half a million people
had died in the Civil War,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.030
Spanish Civil War,
including 200,000 executed

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:27.610
in the [inaudible] and
other 50,000 were killed

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.040
after the war ended.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.930
Several thousand more died
in concentration camps.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.450
This is all in Spain.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.910
Some 200,000 became
permanent exiles.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:41.660
By the 1970s, about 4 million
had immigrated once it became

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.660
legal in the 1940s in a
country of 27 million,

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.840
again get the percentages.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.390
As I said, my family was normal.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:57.130
Some had survived the bombing of
Guernica that Picasso depicted.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.030
Others recounted that
in similar stories.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.080
I grew up in my grandparents'
[inaudible] farm

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.100
as my father worked
for a company in exile.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.790
Mom learned to read
from another--

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.810
from an urban teacher who
was relocated to our hamlet

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.340
as a punishment for
having defended democracy.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.670
That was actually a break for
us peasants as he gave her

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.930
and my uncles knowledge.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.420
Uncle Luis [assumed
spelling] was 15

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.800
when he left for Argentina.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.380
Uncle Antonio, 14, half the
family was already in America.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.100
In my mind, it was difficult to
figure out whether the letters

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.910
that relatives sent
home were from exile,

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.560
immigration, prison or what.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.370
It was just a distant place.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.900
In the '60s, much
unrest happened

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.150
in those remote places
of our relatives.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.150
Dad's company was then working
in Chile from where he wrote

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.990
of hope, illegally
mailing books and records

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.680
about Che Guevara
and by Violeta Parra.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.740
Practically all the Spanish
writers I read then were exiles.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.440
During our transition to
democracy, many returned

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.650
from the Southern Cone
escaping the dictatorships

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.970
that we're talking about today.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.060
The book that we are
presenting brought a smile

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.580
to my face reminding me of
my literary heroes, Onetti,

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.150
Galeano, Benedetti, Perry Rossi
[assumed spelling], Soriano,

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.850
Roa Bastos, or actors whose
skill impressed me the most,

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.150
Alteri [assumed spelling],
Rossi [assumed spelling],

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.450
Politi [assumed spelling].

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.780
Not to speak of the
musicians whose songs we sang

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.840
in the streets, [inaudible],
Sosa, Guevara,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.230
Warani [assumed spelling].

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.760
Our book notes on page
73, the difficulty

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.900
that American exiles had in
Europe echoing the complaint

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.230
by Perry Rossi that I
remember very vividly.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.050
That being said,
my dearest friends,

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.000
were those marginalized
intellectuals.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.540
Some of whom taught
me everything I know

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.390
about the theater, like the late
Claudio Narea [assumed spelling]

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.160
after learning his
craft from [inaudible].

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.280
I can't imagine the
Spanish movie there,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.700
the "Almodóvar" made famous

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.150
without the likes
of Cecilia Roth.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.770
And so I can't help asking
what really happened,

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.510
why this ties back and forth.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.690
I sent this on page 187.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.180
This is so that you
see I read the book--

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.880
reads, "whether clothed in
military or civilian guard,

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.840
authoritarianism has
been a mainstay."

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.750
While the book is talking
about Latin America,

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.570
the motherland is no different.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.870
In the two plus century
since the French Revolution,

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:47.140
one can count 25, 25
military [inaudible].

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.550
I don't care whether from
the right or from the left,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.110
military [inaudible]
in 200 years.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.210
The latest one in 1981,

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.760
five years before Spain
joined the European Union,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.780
still unclear who was behind it.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.810
During the 19th century, liberal
and conservative administrations

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.010
so commonly replace one
another after a coup.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.730
That by the time the
monarchy was reestablished,

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.290
they institutionalize
succession of government.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:17.250
So the opposite side routinely
change in every two years.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.720
Alas, that Solomonic
solution didn't last long

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.680
because both were
incredibly corrupt.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.600
Eventually further coups led

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.490
to the famous dictatorships
of the 20th century.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.050
As the book describes,
the fate of these dynamics

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:37.170
on page 32 citing Luna
involved [foreign language],

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:43.590
that is prison, expulsion or
entombment, so the dark aspects.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.500
And not all is bad that
stems from such chaos.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.150
It may have been harder to
otherwise realize the liberation

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.500
of American and Asian colonies
throughout the 19th century

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.490
or the African ones
during the 20th century.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.430
Just as not always good either
in the visionary governments

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.080
that stemmed from uprisings
like the French revolution.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.440
The Napoleonic standardization
fueled resentment leading

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.440
to successful fascist
nationalisms from Italy

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.470
to Germany to unsuccessful ones
from Iberia to the Vulcans.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.550
Later still lingering conflicts.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.340
Look at the Catalan one.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.570
Often find a trigger in
Civil Wars of that ilk.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.980
As David Armitage reminds
us, I am a revolutionary,

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:38.190
you are a rebel, and they
are engaged in the Civil War.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.490
This is why the question

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.780
of whether nationalistic
movements are good

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.730
or bad has no easy answer.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.880
After all, we describe by
the same word, the Mapuche

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.420
or the [inaudible]
nation, and the Russian

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.390
and the Chinese nation.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.610
Such dynamics are structure
for me in a deep sense,

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.220
and this is the linguist
in me talking now.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.320
Within material science,
physical tensions

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.230
of this sort are called
dynamical frustration.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.760
We may think of it as the
unresolvable coexistence

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.690
of conflicting tendencies
that never settle.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.260
For those raised in
the Marxist tradition,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.290
dynamical frustration
relates to the Hegelian clash

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.900
between thesis and antithesis
except you never achieve

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.200
a synthesis.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.990
Or if you wish, the synthesis
is a state of equilibrium

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.230
that arises from
the clash itself.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.020
I raised the idea because
yet a further ingredient

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.880
in the cauldron, one leading

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.770
to the exiles we are now
considering is radicalism

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.890
and reaction to liberalism.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.270
It is fascinating how liberal
and radical forces ally

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.840
to defeat conservatives
in the form of fascism.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.620
Although, first liberalism
aligned with conservatism

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.550
to keep radicalism confined
to the east, Russia and so on.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.580
And less than a decade later,
the logical combination closed

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.610
with at least in
Europe conservatism

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.860
and radicalism uniting over
how to partition Poland.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.720
In this light, one can read
the second A bomb in Nagasaki

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.330
under liberal reluctance to let
Stalin go for Franco and Salazar

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.100
as the new dynamical frustration

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.570
which crystallizes
into the Cold War.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.280
The book has several
further examples

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.320
of dynamical frustration
beyond that Cold War.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.240
We are reminded of the
vicious circle in which fear

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.530
of revolution brings
about repression

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:35.060
which fuels the desire
for revolution and so on.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.610
Or different instantiations
of modernity

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.530
when the ideological
path concocted

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:45.260
in the west an urban reality
confirms the multifarious nature

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.270
of the rural colonial or
frontier realities beyond.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.390
Indeed, these revolutions,
rebellions, civil wars,

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:59.180
whatever you want to call
them that led to the creation

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.250
of the very nations
we're talking about,

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.980
from the Spanish empire
and from one another.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.470
Those are all prime examples
of dynamical frustration.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.970
All these dynamics
are frustrating

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.750
and including the fact

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.200
that exile is both
welcomed and threatened.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.360
And this is another
quote from the book,

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.160
"You who left are now
returning like heroes and we

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.620
who stayed behind are
the ones who suffered."

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.220
Those are the inxiles [phonetic]
that are mentioned in the book.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.550
Those are very complicated
dynamics with--

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.150
There is no right or wrong here.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.670
The book also interestingly
brings

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.010
to the equation the
unintended consequence of exile

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.710
in a globalized world.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.510
The media related, university
and culturally driven,

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.560
and ultimately politically
effective role of exiles

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.490
in making their countries
change.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:57.260
Another example of this
earlier on is what intellectuals

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.560
from Nazi Germany did.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.130
That's one of the main pillars
of the American University.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.340
The book puts it on-- book
on page 26 as followed,

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.950
in the long run, exile
backfired given the connections

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:13.270
established by exiles and the
resonance their plight received,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.300
perhaps partly as a result,

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.330
while the Spanish dictatorship
lasted four decades, 39 years.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.240
And ones whose effects were
examined with the exception

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.780
of Paraguay, which is almost
as long as the Spanish were

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.830
between half and a fifth
shorter, depending.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.760
Now, that allowed for larger
role of the exiled communities.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.530
That's what chapter
7 mainly is about.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.070
And what chapter 5 goes into,
procedures for repatriation

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.090
that we were discussing,
investigation,

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.880
eventually fair trials, again,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.350
with the interesting
exception of Paraguay.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.200
Situation in Spain
aligns more with Paraguay

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.460
than the more democratic
Argentinean nations.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.880
Argentina, Chile and
especially Uruguay

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.130
where you have a former diplomat
are becoming the head of state.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.830
For a member of a
comparable armed group--

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.770
armed group in Spain, that
would be just unthinkable.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.200
Indeed, the moral
debate about arm struggle

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.810
that chapter 6 raises, extremely
interesting, inconceivable

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:17.180
in a country that only a
couple of weeks ago was ruled

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.750
against by the European
Court of Human Rights

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.610
for jailing activists
after burning effigies

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:28.590
of the king whose role in the
coup d'etat is still murky.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:33.980
Despite the fact that as
the book notes on page 70,

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.110
Southern Cone exiles had a hard
time explaining their messy

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.810
politics to Europeans.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.110
This is still the case.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.650
It's very difficult
to understand

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.690
by European standards.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.330
Spanish exiles with a more
traditional message were not

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:51.130
able to summon action
against Franco who died in bed

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.680
and as he wished, leaving
things very well bounded.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.230
To this date, speaking in
Spain not just of reparation

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:02.250
or restoration, but even
investigation is taboo.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:06.140
It is presently inconceivable
to find a situation equivalent

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.800
to what the book discusses
on page 149 where the day

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.880
of the national stop rising in
Spain turns into a national day

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.870
of memory, truth and justice

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:18.540
as is the case in
the Southern Cone.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.710
Chapter 8 speaks of shifting
frontiers of citizenships,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.660
exploring transnational
networks,

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.660
topic that fascinates me.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.680
This can be seen as
a new phenomenon.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.150
Describing present migratory
processes, this is a quote

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.960
as having complicated, the
possibility of defining diaspora

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.450
in purely ethnonational terms.

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.290
But this is now me.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.570
I would say modern notions

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:50.820
like nation itself are liberal
inventions of the 19th century,

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.200
while Diasporas are many, many,

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.170
many tens of thousands
of years older.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.810
Before the birth
of nation states,

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.960
those were immigration dynamics,

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.930
not conquest ones
for the most part.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:08.610
Now, mere emigrants built
humanity as we understand it.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.060
Interbreeding for example with
Neanderthals and Denisovans

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.120
to yield the miracles
of art and myth.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.570
Those errant Jews and gypsies
and aborigines and Indians

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.460
and other expatriates
of all kinds,

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.830
those are the holders
of human existence.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:29.910
Only very slow time in evolution
will tell whether it's dynamical

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.720
frustrations lead to
emergent structures

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.480
that we may call
forward thinking.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.910
Certainly new realities
will emerge that way too.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.130
Witness the web,
witness social media.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:46.790
The way art did-- and
eventually writing,

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:50.440
and eventually the printing
press, all as momentous

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.890
as the internet these days.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:59.320
In our world, it may not be
all that bad to start dreaming

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.160
of electronic exiles,
because one runs

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.880
out of physical locations to
take the children to in case

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.690
of real and tangible
civil wars or familiar

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.330
and not electronic prisons.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:16.110
Thinking of normal families in
Syria, Iraq does make me wonder.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.950
Our book cites Perry Rossi's
line representing the dilemma

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.880
of exile, "to part
is to part in half."

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.270
It echoes the one
line that Cole Parker,

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.600
adapting that unforgettable
goodbye,

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.730
which is to die a little.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.750
Then again, the horrors
we continue to witness

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.950
in other authoritarian
societies remind us

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:46.200
that to die is to part a lot.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.920
So let's hope that
before the finale exile,

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.370
we leave our children in a
more democratic, transparent,

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:56.040
pluralistic world of the sort
our dear exiles fought for,

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.190
successfully in that
they kept our hope alive.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.570
This is one tangible legacy
of this wonderful book.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.570
Well beyond the accurate facts
and testimonies in regard

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.600
to institutional transformation.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.430
As it notes on page
187, electoral democracy

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.250
and the periodic change
of government seem

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.460
to have taken a firm hold.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.190
It is uplifting to see such
a comprehensive analysis

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:26.700
of exile placed in the context
and exploring without anger,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.750
even nostalgia, how it
contribute to the development

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:34.740
of democracy in countries
where that exile originated

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.080
and in countries like
my own where it ended.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.880
Thank you.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:46.170
[ Applause ]

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:54.730
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: If
Roniger should join us.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.000
I could hear his comments.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.600
So let me tell you
something about,

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.290
one of the difficulties
in writing this book.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:09.910
There are four of us,
as I mentioned before

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:15.700
from different disciplines,
with writing habits

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.990
that are very far
one from the other.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.410
And Luis Roniger and Mario
Sznajder collaborated

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:29.240
on a number of books, so they
knew each other fairly well.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:35.310
Leonardo Senkman and I wrote
one book together about fascism

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:39.540
and Nazism in Argentine letters.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:47.050
But Leo Senkman has one way of
writing and one way of thinking

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.280
that is about, I don't
know, whether 180 degrees,

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.620
but at least 90 degrees
away from my own.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:59.780
And that was one of
the difficulties,

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.100
trying to find a common
voice, how are we going

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.060
to find some sort of language

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.280
that will accommodate
the perspectives

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.930
from which we were coming.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.950
The other thing is each one of
us has a very different style

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.330
of work and there
is one among us

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.480
who is the most workaholic
of all.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.130
No, it's not me.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.730
It is Luis Roniger.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.450
And he is the one who
really kept us in line.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:37.400
And so, in addition to all the
merits of his scholarly work

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.420
and so on, I have to tell
you that he is really--

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.820
I don't want to say slave
driver, it's not nice,

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:52.040
but he's the one who kept
us on track and partly it's

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.990
because he also has a secret
weapon, his wife Shirley

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:59.670
who is the one who also
did the index for the book,

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:05.730
a rather awesome task for which
all authors are most grateful

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.030
to you, Shirley.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.570
Thank you.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:14.850
Let me turn this over to
Luis and who is partly

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.090
to a good degree
responsible for the fact

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.580
that we were able
to finish this book.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.880
Luis.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.680
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Thank you.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.990
[ Applause ]

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.640
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Thank you,
Saúl, for your kind words.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:35.760
And thank you Ernesto and Juan
for the generous evaluation,

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.690
talk about the book
and also sharing your

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:39.990
personal perspective.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:45.990
And listening to you, I would
like to say that what is exile

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:50.180
and what is the key that
brings such creativities,

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:55.230
such innovation, not just to
the countries that we analyze

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:59.680
but overall there is an open
possibility that [inaudible].

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:08.450
And the idea of exile is that
at least in the modern world,

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:13.030
it breaks the hyphen
between nation and state.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:17.220
Whenever people are forced
to flee their own countries,

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.150
they are no longer obligated.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:26.160
They cannot take the markers
of that certainty for granted.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.560
They cannot take their
common assumptions

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.800
for granted, something
has broken.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.590
In the nation state,
collective identity

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.300
and political rights
are built together.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.780
This is the hyphen
between nation and state.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:46.120
But once they leave, they
cling even more to the nation

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.650
but they are no longer
committed to the state.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:52.990
And these open a range of
possibilities of learning,

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:57.760
of getting to use new-- getting
used to new institutions,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.440
new forms of interacting,
new forms of partnership,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.980
even the very conception of
being in a relationship changed.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:15.260
And as you know, many in exile
have eventually broken apart

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.890
diverse as being a
characteristic of--

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.350
thank you, diverse as being
a characteristic of exile.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:30.420
And there are many losses of
exile, but there are also gains.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.260
This possibility of opening
themselves to new ideas,

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.940
to new forms of understanding
the world,

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:40.530
understanding politics pays off.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:42.640
Because together
with the losses,

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.850
and losses certainly are
numerous and countless

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:55.250
and have been a-- both
in personal terms,

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.310
in terms of the life
of people going

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.740
to exile, many, many losses.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.230
But also gains not just
individually, not just in terms

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:09.230
of human capital but things
that will eventually come

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.480
to serve the countries
of origin.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.040
People will remain
attached to their countries,

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.460
to their background and
once the possibility opens,

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:24.530
they should consider
whether to return.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.690
And though-- although
the return, the word,

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.310
is in the title of the book, we
emphasized throughout the book

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.860
that this is just one
possibility among many.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.270
And therefore there are
not just the returnees

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:39.990
that we should consider.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.980
There are the sojourners
that people who stay abroad

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:48.210
but maintain relationship
with others in the diaspora.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:52.900
And let me-- beyond
the individual gains,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.790
it mentioned something about the
contributions to the country.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.700
Let's start with politics.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:06.430
We cannot understand the
transition from authoritarianism

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.660
to democracy in some
of those countries

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.790
without considering exile.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.050
The most evident
case among the four

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.800
that we consider is
the case of Chile.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.880
In Chile, exiles were
crucial in the transition

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.280
but because they were
crucial while in exile,

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.220
they recompose the
political alliances,

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.730
the socialist change
their attitude,

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.020
broke ranks with the communist.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.040
Within the communist
there were also divisions.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.120
Eventually they build a
coalition of 17 countries.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.030
This is called the [inaudible]
that led to the defeat

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.780
of Pinochet in the
referendum of 1998

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.540
and eventually opened
the door to transition.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:59.110
But also in the cabinet of the
successive governments that came

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:04.460
after the transition, exiles
played a crucial role.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:09.000
Even-- in terms of their numbers
among the cabinet members you

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.960
can trace exiles.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.860
They were a prevailing force.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:20.160
In Uruguay for example, Danilo
Astori, the vice president

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.680
of President Mujica
was an exile.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.000
The minister of education,
Ricardo Ehrlich was an exile.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.590
They were also scientists,
but they moved

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.340
into politics beyond
the politics

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.280
of the university
then in academia.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.360
In academia in Uruguay
for example,

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:42.650
until 1984 there was just
one university, the UdelaR,

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:47.200
Universidad de la Republica,
exiles opened a range

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.610
to new universities, new
disciplines, new investment

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.340
in science and technology.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.190
For example in biology, in
the biological sciences,

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:06.780
there were five tenure position
before the exiles returned.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:13.420
As exiles started returning,
they build a faculty of 100,

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.200
over 100, they invested
millions.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.030
They used their connections
with France,

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:22.310
with Mexico to create
new avenues,

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:27.320
new subdisciplines,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.500
Three of the four provosts in
Uruguay following the return

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:38.430
of democracy were exiles,
and some of them were very,

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:44.220
very instrumental in revamping
the entire educational system

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:50.420
of higher ed-- entire system
of higher education in Uruguay

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.620
in the realm of new disciplines.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.990
For example in Chile there
was no social history

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:03.920
until Gabriel Salazar
returned to Chile.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:09.000
Bioethics, in Argentina
there was no sense

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.560
of what is the ethics in
dealing with biological research

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.660
until somebody who did
his career in the US,

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.610
Victor Penchaszadeh,
returned to Argentina

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:26.030
and opened a new ground
supporting also the mothers

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.590
and especially the
grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.430
and eventually created
a new field

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:37.030
of research and investigation.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.450
In the publishing industry,
in each of the four countries,

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:49.340
you can find people who
recreated the impetus

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:52.730
that existed in the
'60s once back

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.960
in their countries after exile.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.470
Let me mentions some of them.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:01.690
Divinsky in Ediciones de
la Flor en in Argentina.

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.250
Pablo Harari, he founded
Editorial Trilce in Uruguay.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.360
Carlos Orellana in Chile.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:15.490
In the case of Paraguay,
[inaudible] by himself

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:19.490
on its own effort, as you
know Paraguay is a totally

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:20.790
different universe.

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.280
It's a universe of
an oral culture,

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.050
not necessarily a
written culture.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:30.560
But he managed somehow to
eventually fail in the long run

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.730
because Paraguay is Paraguay

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:37.370
with not enough readership,
but he tried so hard.

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:42.630
And other people who did not
go into exile collaborated

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:47.840
with people in exile,
exiles coming back.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:54.860
And for instance the
first-- a film, a long--

00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:00.340
a feature film in Paraguay
was done by a returnee.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:10.370
"Miramenometokei" was the
name of this film in 2002.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:16.780
And also, there were failures of
course, institutional failures.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.100
One may ask why the democracy
in Uruguay or democracy

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.580
in Chile seems to have overcome

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.450
to a larger extent
the polarization,

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:33.170
political polarization down
the democracy in Argentina.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:37.940
A part of this story is
that the contributions

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.260
of exiles is not enough.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:47.650
It is the meeting point between
the ability of the exiles,

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.620
the willingness to do
something for the country

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.160
and eventually the
long-term conditions

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.740
that enable those
contributions to be pervasive

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:03.160
or be fleeting away
and disappear.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.410
In the case of Argentina,

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:09.310
we have with initial
democratization starting

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:15.780
on December of 1983, we have
very important contributions

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:20.080
in science for example
with Sadosky

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.430
which democratized the
entire system of academia.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:30.900
They [inaudible] and
try to democratize it,

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.730
and that the realm of
politics the group of Esmeralda

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:40.610
who were the advisers
to president Alfonsin

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:46.740
and wrote these discourses
as was mentioned before.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:53.090
The Cultura Sosyalista that was
supposed to be an open ground--

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:57.320
an open meeting ground for
people to debate the ideas

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.640
without political polarization.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:07.180
Nonetheless, politics are
at large and the connection

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.930
between politics and
the political economy

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:11.890
for Argentina failed.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:16.270
And as you know, there were many
waves and ups and downs both

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:20.350
in transition of justice
and the recreation

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:21.700
of democratic culture.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.270
But nonetheless, the
level of civil society,

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:28.440
the transformation was
there to stay and as a--

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:34.380
and despite the institution
imbalances that we see

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.580
in Argentina and
still the tradition

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.440
of political polarization,

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.200
Argentina of the 2010
is not the same in terms

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.400
of embracing human rights.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:55.290
It has gained a lot
in that support.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:07.580
I think that political exiling
Latin America has something

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:13.390
to say-- something of
comparative relevance

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:16.320
for other regions of the world.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:23.100
And we are-- before Juan started
mentioning the case and talking

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:29.460
about the case of Spain
and this brings me--

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.890
it brings to my mind
also the case of Germany.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.690
Case of Germany and in
the case of this space.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.990
There's not been a
re-accommodation of exiles

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:44.890
as in the case of
the Southern Cone

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:48.800
and in particular I would
say the case of Uruguay,

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.470
then followed by the case of
Chile, the case of Argentina,

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.590
and finally the case
of Paraguay.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.050
Various degrees of
accommodation,

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:02.810
but there's been a willingness
somehow after initial period

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:08.360
of resistance to
re-accommodate exiles

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.690
and give exiles the
proper place.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:14.700
Of course Uruguay is at the top
because in the case of Uruguay,

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:19.470
they decided to bring the
people who lose their jobs

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:21.310
in the public administration.

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:23.270
They are called the exonerados.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.630
This was the word that was used.

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:29.010
People who lost their
position, what they were thrown

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:34.360
out of work and then many
of them left for exile.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:39.440
With democratization, Uruguay
decided to bring them back

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.970
to their former positions.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.210
For instance, Samuel
Lichtensztejn who was

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:49.530
in the '70s, in the early
'70s the provost of UdelaR,

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:55.220
of the Universidad-- Universidad
de la Republica was brought back

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:59.240
in the '80s and given
his old post.

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:04.930
Now with a new perspective and
new exposure, a new context,

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.970
transnational connections,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:15.790
And this is a fantastic push for
institutional transformation.

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:18.890
In the case of Germany, they--

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:23.400
Even the word exiles
was not used

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.830
for the people who fled Nazism.

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:31.460
The word [inaudible],
those who were pushed

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:35.500
out from their own land
was used for those who are

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:41.070
to leave East Germany and
were received in West Germany.

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:46.290
This-- even the label
recognizing

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:49.250
that something wrong
are being committed

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:53.080
against them was
not granted them.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.390
And the same with
the case of Spain

00:54:56.390 --> 00:55:01.710
that you saw wonderfully
exposed [inaudible].

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:12.890
And certainly in Spain the-- if
they have received the figures

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:18.580
of intellectuals, they
have tried somehow

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:23.930
to depoliticize them or try
to take any characteristic

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:32.500
that may be affecting
the view of the field.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.180
For instance Garcia Lorca

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:41.100
and his sexual orientation
was somehow taken apart

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:47.090
and not emphasized in the
celebration of Garcia Lorca.

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:53.710
Finally, a word about--
and just coming to an end,

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:58.150
a word about the networks.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:03.790
Exile opened a Pandora box
of multiple possibilities.

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:08.400
Again, return is just--
was just one of them.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.350
That as Ernesto emphasized,
people leaving their countries

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.820
as part of a wave of exile
may remain and many were

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:23.030
in such position, may
remain attached emotionally,

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:28.330
intellectually to what is going
on in their country of origin.

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:32.970
And even if they remained
abroad, many of them try

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:37.900
to contribute, become members
of networks, academic networks,

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:41.710
intellectual networks
and political networks,

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:47.120
and as such they
continue to contribute

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.360
to the opening of
those societies.

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:55.510
And the major sign of such
opening has been the embracing

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:58.810
of two characteristic of
modern and Latin America.

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:03.200
One of them is the rural
discovery of Latin America.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.750
This is not something new.

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:09.190
For instance if you
go back in history,

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:11.230
many of the revolutionaries

00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:15.710
of Latin America were playing
not just with the support

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:20.410
of their-- of the citizens
of their own country

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:26.160
but with a wide range of people
coming from all other countries.

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.450
This happened in
Central America.

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:32.110
For instance, look at
the biography of Sandino

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:35.380
and who were the
lieutenants of Sandino.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:39.980
And this is just one
example of many networks.

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:44.720
For instance, female
networks of intellectuals,

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.510
those were networks
of people building

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.610
on that transnational
identity which did not deter

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:55.490
from their support and
commitment to a national sense

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:59.550
of identity but was
combined and intertwined

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:01.810
with a national identity.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:08.000
And so the rediscovery of Latin
America beyond the national has

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.630
been part of this
experience of exile.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:22.220
And the second characteristic
is that through the dispersal

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:26.390
of these networks, some
of the countries have come

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:30.660
to the conclusion that they
should grant also political

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.920
rights to national [inaudible].

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.560
You can see that in Argentina,

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.860
you can see that in
the case of Paraguay.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:46.620
And in the case of Uruguay and
Chile it's more complicated

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.340
but still there have
been attempts

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:52.990
to launch this connection.

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:58.550
On the academic field, there is
what we call the [inaudible],

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:03.930
the drive of those countries
to reconnect with academics,

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:06.890
with intellectuals,
with people who--

00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:09.890
with professionals
staying abroad.

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:14.160
And this is an active effort
on the part of those country.

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:19.650
To sum up, to sum up, exile
has opened those countries

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.990
to globalization, to the
[inaudible] of human rights,

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:28.110
to rediscovery of Latin American
ties beyond their commitment

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:32.030
to national identities and
eventually to the possibility

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:36.930
that to reconsider that
the nation is broader

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:41.760
than the territory
of a single state.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:49.040
Just to finish with one
example of that in the realm

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.810
of literature for Saúl,
[inaudible] after exile,

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:59.360
during and after exile,
organized a multivolume work

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:06.310
of critical Argentine-- critical
space of Argentine literature,

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:09.910
which consider for-- but
it's not the first time

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:13.580
but which consider in
a proper place the work

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.860
of Argentine writers
writing beyond the territory

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.430
of Argentina.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:26.850
For me it has been a--
together with Saúl, with Mario

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:33.880
and with Leo and exercising
in long running field.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.080
It's not a short term
but long running.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.610
Somebody asked me how long have
you been working on this book,

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.490
and I told him, 20 years.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:46.880
Oh, 20 years?

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:52.170
Really? Yes, multiply
five years by four.

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:53.970
Thank you.

01:00:53.970 --> 01:01:00.000
[ Applause ]

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.420
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
Thank you, Luis.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.820
He just proved that I was right

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:07.100
in what I said in
his introduction.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:14.330
And we have time for
comments among us.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:17.990
We have time for comments
and questions, observations,

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:21.010
rebuttals from the audience.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.590
And the floor is open.

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:28.360
Let me just add one thing
in the context of exile,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.710
and that is the contributions

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:34.180
that exiles themselves have
done, have made to the countries

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.330
that have hosted them.

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:41.480
And since Juan eloquently
spoke about Spain,

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.770
what would El Colegio
de Mexico be.

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:48.980
What would be the
publishing industry in Mexico

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:55.160
and in Argentina without the
contribution of Spanish exiles.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.330
So this is an entirely
dynamic process

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:01.560
that we have to take
into account.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.380
And, obviously, the
issue of repatriation,

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.160
the issue of return,
the issue of recognition

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.610
of exiles once they return
home when they are allowed

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:17.150
to return home, the flag that
justice has not been meted

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:21.700
out equally in each of these
countries, that the process

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:26.930
of returning was radically
different in each one of them.

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:32.560
The flag that Spain still
refuses to address major issues

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.600
such as unearthing the tombs of
those who were executed during

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.140
and after the Spanish Civil War.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:44.270
These are issues that affect
us all in one way or another

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:47.990
and I-- They do address
some of the keywords

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:51.000
that appear in this book.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.780
So hopefully we opened up
something beyond addressing some

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.090
of the issues that we wanted

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:03.750
to incorporate into
this first book.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:11.000
The floor is open to all of you.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.300
Gwen?

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.050
&gt;&gt; Milagros Peran: Yeah, OK.

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:20.110
Hello. My name is Milagros
Peran [assumed spelling].

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:27.410
I'm a Nicaraguan poet and
translator and I also happen

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:37.120
to have a master's from the
University of [inaudible].

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.550
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Of course.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.850
Yes.

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.610
&gt;&gt; Milagros Peran: And you not--

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:49.740
Thank you so much because
you touched on two questions

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:58.130
that I have or comments
that I had.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:05.040
The first one about Sandino
because he, you know,

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.600
he was sort of like
politically trained in Mexico

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.440
and he [inaudible] his ideas.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:18.740
And the second one was about
the subject for the book

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.310
because when I received
this invitation,

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:25.500
the first thing I
thought was exile.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.370
Something that I've
been, you know,

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:31.740
that I heard more
than 20 years ago.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:38.660
And you just mentioned that
it took you maybe 20 years

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:43.770
to come up with the book.

01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:48.730
So, that's the comment
that I wanted to make

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:58.420
because I remember when I was
about to publish my second book

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:02.860
of poetry it was in 2000.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.220
And talked to the
professor, well,

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:09.920
about some of these themes.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:19.560
He said, oh, exile, you know,
that was more in the '90s but,

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.310
you know, not in
the 21st century.

01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:31.160
So, thank you so much though for
bringing this because I learned

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:41.590
so many things from you
today, from all of you.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.610
It's very valid and, you know,
we have such a problem now

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:45.910
with amelioration
and it's everywhere.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.210
It's everywhere.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.510
I mean, so [inaudible] you know,

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:54.220
people that have been here
all their lives, and now what?

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.600
They're supposed
to go back home?

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.560
And what if they don't have,
you know, the [inaudible],

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.830
what if they forgot about that,

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:07.330
what are they going
to do about it?

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.630
So, thank you so much.

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:09.930
Wonderful.

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:11.230
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Gwen?

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.170
&gt;&gt; Gwen: Yes, I was a--
thank you all very much.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.640
A lot to think about.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:22.690
I was thinking about so much of
the wonderful story of the weak

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:24.460
and creation and the
redemocratization.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.210
The different points in
some of these places focuses

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:37.840
on the contributions of people
who went back or who were able

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.360
to form strong networks,
educate themselves, et cetera.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:55.120
And I can't help thinking about
just a couple of things and--

01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:03.770
Around 2000 there was a Chilean
TV documentary called Guevara,

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:08.060
the people who were often--
other parts of the world

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:15.700
and some of it was
fun and wonderful.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:27.660
But there were a few
who had gone into exile

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.370
and was just sort of [inaudible]

01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:37.220
up on the shore, a
mechanic in Moscow.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:46.980
No-- And I think around the
characters in their novel

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.580
of Alejandro Zambra, you know,

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:53.640
standing on the snowy street
corner in Copenhagen and crying

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.750
because of his son who had
been separated for so long.

01:07:56.750 --> 01:08:01.450
And I guess I just wonder how--
I mean, that sounds very pathos

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:05.110
and all that but it's
also part of the whole

01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:08.070
like [inaudible] passage,
especially for those

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:09.940
who are less-- I think
of so many of them.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:14.020
[Inaudible] immigrants that
were exiled from Central America

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:18.440
who were not into--
not as well situated

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.120
to have some of the [inaudible].

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.630
I just-- I wonder if
that is in a-- in--

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:30.160
what part it plays in your
book or probably your part or--

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.700
with the literature I guess.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.850
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: That is
the part that we are going

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:40.400
to write in book two, but in--

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:46.320
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: There is one
more in contribution in the back

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.110
and then we may address the--

01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:51.420
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka: Yeah,
I think he has [inaudible].

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.720
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Why not.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.020
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.320
Happy Friday.

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.450
So I was wondering you guys
talking about the Southern Cone

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:01.110
and the [inaudible],
transnational ideas,

01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:05.560
if in your research you
talked about Brazil.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.590
If it has a model
that maybe similar

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:14.400
to these other Southern Cone
countries or a little different?

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.700
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: OK.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.700
Very briefly on Brazil
and then Luis can expand.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.410
We decided at the very
beginning to exclude Brazil

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:20.770
because it required a different
type of treatment all together.

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.070
And that was the only
reason why we stuck

01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:23.370
to these four countries.

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:24.670
Although we are all aware of
the fact that the whole wave

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:25.970
of coup-- coup d'etats
begin with Brazil in 1964,

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:27.270
that the impact it has had,

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:28.570
the fact that it also
received exiles from each

01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:29.870
of the other countries.

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:31.170
But we decided on the
methodological basis

01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:32.470
to leave Brazil out
of this consideration.

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:33.770
And in terms of what
Gwen was addressing,

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.070
the fact that some
people ended up in exile

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:36.370
in certain countries sometimes
was just happenstance.

01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:37.670
It just happened.

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:38.970
And the moment you mentioned
the mechanic in Moscow,

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.270
I was reminded of the case of
[inaudible] who was a Tupamaro

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:41.570
who spent about a
decade in jail and so on.

01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:42.870
When he got out of jail,
he ended up in Sweden.

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:44.170
I asked him, why did
you go to Sweden?

01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:45.470
That was the first ticket
that was offered to me.

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:46.770
And in some cases
that's how it happened.

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:48.070
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:49.370
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: So he went
to Sweden, he learned Swedish.

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:50.670
He published there.

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:51.970
He had great success
within the Swedish community

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:53.270
until one day he woke up and he
said, it happens to all of us

01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:54.570
at one point, what
am I doing here?

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:55.870
And that he's more a literary
and he's also visual artist.

01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:57.170
He was the director of
the National Library

01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:58.470
and several things are very,
very interesting about him

01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:59.770
because he broke with the
Tupamaros while being in jail

01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:01.070
and he decided that was the
wrong approach and so on.

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:02.370
So I asked him, so
what happened then?

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:03.670
And his response was
very clear, look at me.

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:04.970
I interviewed him
when he was a director

01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:06.270
of the National Library.

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:07.570
Pepe Mujica appointed him to
that point-- to that post.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:08.870
So that indicated to the degree

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.170
to which there was a certain
openness, ideological openness,

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:13.760
political openness, and as well
as experience in practicality

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.990
in terms of how they
related to each other

01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:19.760
within the Tupamaro movement
at least while in jail

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.680
and once they got out.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.520
But he goes to Sweden because
that's where the ticket was.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.900
Obviously the case of exiles

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.520
from the communist
party was different.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.110
Everything was very organized
and they moved in blocks

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.240
to certain countries, to
Eastern Europe and so on.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.650
So-- but it did vary
quite a bit.

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.600
And then there were the
cases of many people

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.650
who went wherever
they were able to go

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:47.180
and however they were
able to get to the border.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.630
So, I don't think we can make
a blanket statement that--

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:52.930
&gt;&gt; No, it wasn't that--

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:54.400
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Yeah, I
know you weren't making that

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.230
but I was-- basically
thinking of the whole process

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:02.920
of how somebody will end
up in a certain place

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.130
that is not necessarily logical.

01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:08.840
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: But I do,
I mean emphasize in something

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.610
that you said and the
book describes on my count

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.410
between half a million
and 800,000 exiles.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:22.330
And the group of people that
the Insulsas [assumed spelling],

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:23.770
the Portantieros, you know,

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:25.900
the ones that were mentioned
are a fraction of those.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.410
And many of those
that we are talking

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.430
about that are a fraction of
those were already Insulsa

01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:32.740
and Portantiero before leaving.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.040
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Absolutely.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.570
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: So Portantiero
had created [foreign language].

01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:39.360
Insulsa was on his own right
already an important scholar

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.830
and when he arrived he
forms [inaudible] Mexico.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:45.140
Most of them, when they arrive
from exile-- I mean on exile,

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.370
immediately they were
absorbed in the societies.

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.590
They did not train
and-- so that talks

01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:52.540
about social capital
what was there but not

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.860
about the entire million.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.370
There's a lot of people
that went on exile

01:11:56.370 --> 01:12:02.050
that only face destruction
but not face the other side

01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:04.270
of the book, you know,

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:08.760
the constructive part,
chapters 5 through.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.910
And they are in a sense the
ones that only pay the cost

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.370
and have none of the benefits.

01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:17.670
And that is sort of
a different picture.

01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:20.080
But I do think that is
something to commend on,

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.950
on the way which
they build a book

01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:25.350
which is generally that's the
only painting that we have.

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:27.670
Generally exile is
starting this way.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:30.270
I mean if we think of the
contribution of that book not

01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:35.410
as being 20-year-old but being
a roadmap for the next 20 years,

01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:37.570
we can think that,
you know, the refugees

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:40.320
that we're getting today
from Syria, you know,

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.920
are going to be also
refugees in 20 years.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.560
You can have an incredible
amount of structure

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.670
on the one hand and
an incredible amount

01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:48.660
of human capital and
political capital that's going

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.960
to be generated.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:53.610
And most people are
looking at the human costs

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:56.150
which are the most
important thing to focus now.

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:58.780
But it is true that there's
human capital to be built

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:01.100
and that's also an
important feature

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.340
that I think the
book does bring,

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.100
you know, very forcefully.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.730
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger:
Yes, if I may ask--

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:15.210
add something the label of
exile something sometimes--

01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:18.290
something very Byronic about it.

01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:22.630
That is maybe manipulated
as well.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:24.620
We should be aware of that.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:28.440
It's not by chance that we
distinguish between the exiles

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.220
of the Southern Cone and the
refugees of Central America.

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:38.590
Even the words that we use,
color, what we are looking for,

01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:42.170
but we may turn as analyst,

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:48.310
as people who started
this phenomenon.

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:52.250
We may turn it being
the word of the danger

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:55.290
of using these labels,
we may turn it

01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:58.190
into a tool of investigation.

01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:02.890
And this is what I think we have
done because we find differences

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:07.220
between the different
diasporas in the way even

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:12.310
in these four cases, in
the way in which the exiles

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:16.290
within the community
of nationals abroad,

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:22.510
unless you said-- and those
are not exactly the same.

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:27.300
Exiles are part of a larger
community of sojourners,

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:32.780
of diplomats, of
students, of migrants of--

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:36.160
and all sorts of people
who left their countries

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.740
for different reasons.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.280
Some for economic motivations,
others for political reasons

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.210
but still there is a core
of exiles and the question

01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:51.660
for research is did
they became the voice

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:54.390
that represented the community.

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:59.320
And in some cases we found
that exiles spoke in the name

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.260
of all the people
who are in some way

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:08.010
or another forced to
leave the country.

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:12.980
And in other cases,
this was less prominent.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.310
And so-- And this is
the differentiation

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:21.780
that we can trace in these
four cases and we trace them

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.680
and it can be also
traced in other cases.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.670
In about Brazil,
Brazil there is a lot

01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:35.870
of interest today
in Brazilian exile.

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:40.200
It started unlike of
what you were told.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.890
It started with a book
in 1999 by a historian.

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:49.610
You may know her,
Denise Rollemberg.

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.880
The title of her
book is very telling.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.340
It was called "Entre
Raizes e Radares".

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:01.490
This looking back and looking
forward and in the middle,

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:05.180
strength in the middle.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.390
We did not touch it but
there is a large community

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:11.730
of people working on
the theme of exile

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:15.020
and return now in Brazil.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.280
It came late, relatively late.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:23.060
In the period that you
were talking about exile,

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.510
this was the period
of many testimonies,

01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:28.830
many personal stories.

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:33.270
But it took another, almost
another decade or decade

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:37.580
and a half to reach the point
of being able to analyze

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.400
from a distance the
phenomenon of massive exile

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.880
and forced displacement.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.690
OK.

01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:47.990
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
One of the issues

01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:53.040
that we also touched upon
was and that was remind--

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.990
I was reminded by your comment.

01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:58.880
Some people when they went
overseas they had already

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.810
been established.

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:05.140
They had their own
signature and so on.

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.860
And they also carried wisdom
the same splits, particularly

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:13.170
in the case of the
Argentines, the same fractures,

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:17.850
the same oppositions, the same
internal fights that they had

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:21.730
within the country, they
carried them into exile.

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:26.730
And so you had even in
Mexico, you had two big groups

01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:28.570
that we're not particularly--

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:29.870
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: A
cast was way bigger.

01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:32.140
That's wrong in the book.

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.440
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Explain.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.740
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger:
Cast [inaudible].

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.040
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: What?

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.340
No, no, no, no.

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.640
I was just.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.300
I was in the cast but the
cast was in [inaudible].

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.600
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: I know.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.900
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo:
Had way more people.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.200
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
Yeah, that's true.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.500
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: But they're
very-- [inaudible] gets more,

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.240
you know, it gets a
lot of prominence here.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.050
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Because
it has been researched.

01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:51.350
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: Sorry.

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:54.880
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: For the
second edition there will be a

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.180
new footnote.

01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.630
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: Yeah,
and we will print size for.

01:17:57.630 --> 01:17:59.060
Sorry.

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:03.280
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: And then--
and by the-- By the way, Saúl,

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.540
following your-- no, later.

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:08.840
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: OK.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.110
And the other thing is that the
children that were born there

01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:21.030
and the impact on the
children once the possibility

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.580
of returning opened up.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:27.450
And that was another
issue that we touch up on

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:31.060
and at least we point
to an issue

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:34.660
that it was quite
significant to address.

01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:36.700
And within all of that, I would

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:40.140
like to stress although
Luis already has done so,

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:44.160
is the uniqueness of
the Paraguayan case.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:49.470
Yes, it is a different
universe in terms of what it was

01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:53.410
from the very beginning
to how the exile operated,

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:57.200
to how the Paraguayan
community operated,

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.920
to the fact that their most
important cultural institutions

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.290
were not based in Paraguay
but were based in exile.

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:11.440
And it is a way of
also marking the impact

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.950
of what the dictatorship
can have in the long term.

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:18.390
Namely we're talking
about the dictatorship

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:22.640
that is just a few years to
a dictatorship that lasted

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.860
for decades and therefore had
an impact on the entire country

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:29.390
that is still being felt today.

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.260
The dictatorship, the basis

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:36.060
for the dictatorship has not
disappeared and we see it

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:39.360
in the daily news
coming out of Paraguay.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.160
The fact that Stroessner's
birthday is still celebrated

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.710
by many, that many still say
[foreign language] referring

01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:50.520
to the fact--

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.470
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka:
Same thing in Spain.

01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:56.180
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
-- same as in Spain.

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:57.480
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo:
Yeah [inaudible].

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.780
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Yes.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.080
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Yeah, yeah.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.190
Namely these are issues that
had-- that have not ended.

01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:07.900
This is a life open channel.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:11.380
So this is one of the issues
that we have to keep tackling.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.680
It's not over.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.980
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Yeah.

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:16.530
And it's recreated
every generation.

01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:21.150
For instance, I'm thinking
of Patricio Guzman--

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.450
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Yeah.

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:23.750
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger:
-- as he retained--

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:25.050
the filmmaker from Chile.

01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:27.820
As he returns from Chile
and shows what he has done

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:33.200
for all the filming for the
battala for-- batalla for Chile,

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.500
he shows to the new generations
and people are amazed.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.780
They were not aware at all.

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:45.690
By the way, Patricio Guzman did
a wonderful film two years ago.

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:47.100
I don't know if you know it,

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.150
"El Boton de Nacar",
have you seen it?

01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:53.180
"El Boton de Nacar",
highly recommended.

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:56.180
Showing that the
entire perception

01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:00.180
of Chile being connected
to the land, to territory,

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:04.740
fighting the Mapuche is
a totally miscarriage

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:11.100
of the true identity of Chile
should be connected to the sea.

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:16.600
And the Mapuche were people of
the sea, not necessarily people

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.320
of the land despite their name.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.180
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
Any comments, please.

01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:27.690
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: Yeah.

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:28.990
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: One, two.

01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:30.290
Yes. Please

01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:34.240
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible]
presentation.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.500
And part of somewhere
the way you talk--

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:42.500
You are talking like
dictatorship is totally bad,

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.020
democracy is totally good.

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:50.570
But I don't see how you
explain like people are anti--

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:56.420
antifascism and then the
people here, they don't like it

01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:01.550
and democracy because they don't
really have their voice heard,

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:04.640
then another nonvoter
as you can see.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:10.400
And then I also don't see
why that our history tell us

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.950
that United Kingdom,
sometimes they explain,

01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:17.140
sometimes there is a
construct such as China,

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:21.450
sometime you explain-- you have
Manchuria, you have Mongolia,

01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:22.750
you have [inaudible]

01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:24.960
and sometimes you
don't have that many.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:30.210
And then some-- in terms of
culture, in other places,

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:33.350
they might [inaudible] confusion
is that the best is sent

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:36.450
in the world and the
people will travel far to go

01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:38.900
to India to some Buddhism.

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.690
So that kind of [inaudible]
value I don't think you

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:45.930
explained in your book
or in your presentation.

01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:50.620
You know, I just wonder if you
can comment of those if exile

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.280
or the way you intend criticism,

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:56.440
have you used a refugee
[inaudible] is interchangeable.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:00.020
I just wonder is
the exile is really

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:06.850
that some people are just
sort of being influenced or--

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:12.140
it's not really a threat by the
political power by the influence

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:16.300
by the affair or in the other
way people think they have some

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:20.140
entrepreneurship, they
want to go overseas.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.400
That before, several
decades ago,

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.760
people will think Brazil
is a good opportunity

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:33.020
for the entrepreneurship
to have a big ownership

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.740
of the big land,
something like this.

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.260
So I don't know if you
can address this issue.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:39.900
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
Is it official.

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.200
Yup.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.060
&gt;&gt; I work here at the
Library of Congress.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.340
I'm just wondering,
I know Argentina

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:52.650
like the United States is
a country of immigrants.

01:23:52.650 --> 01:24:01.120
I imagine all your families came
from somewhere else originally

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.830
and I wonder did you think about
that in terms of your discussion

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:05.130
and how might that have
affected your thoughts on--

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.340
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Yeah, OK.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.870
I'll start.

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:18.900
First of all, the questions
that you posed are far ranging

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:23.760
and certainly very important
from a comparative perspective.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:29.960
It's a-- what we have done
is part of a larger canvas

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:35.870
of human mobility and you
rightly indicated that some

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:43.190
of that mobility is for interest
to be open to opportunities,

01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:48.990
economic opportunities, for
instance all sorts of ways

01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:53.310
of migration coming to Latin
America or coming to the USA,

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:57.650
et cetera, et cetera, and also
that the boundaries of states

01:24:57.650 --> 01:25:01.400
in nations can expand or shrink.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.030
So our contribution is
more modest in the sense

01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:08.730
that we don't address
the entire range

01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:11.880
of phenomena of human mobility.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.390
We address especially that
part, a part of that universe

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:22.140
which is connected with forced
mobility or some connection

01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:27.070
between forced mobility
and some kind of prospects

01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:31.160
of a better life, but
especially forced mobility.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.320
And this has been a
tradition in the societies

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.180
that we have finalized
for a very long time.

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:41.880
Going back to colonial times,

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.030
they were already the
[foreign language].

01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:49.100
There was an institution of
forcing people to go out.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.430
Not simply for political
reasons,

01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:53.820
could be for social reasons,

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:58.190
for affecting the public
decorum, et cetera, et cetera.

01:25:58.190 --> 01:26:00.650
But by the way, you
mentioned China.

01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:04.770
Also in China the region of
Xinjiang [assumed spelling]

01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:08.720
in the western part of
China was used as a place

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:14.680
of sending people who the
Chinese empire did not want

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:20.200
to remain because of corruption,
because of other issues.

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.410
There was also exile in China.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:23.990
All empires use exile.

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:28.710
The UK use exile in Australia.

01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:32.780
The Russia used exile
in Siberia.

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.350
China in Xinjiang.

01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:39.620
So there is a longer
history even

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:43.370
of the narrow phenomenon
of forced exile.

01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:49.970
Our book is about the last
half century, if you wish.

01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:52.070
So it's more restricted.

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:56.790
It's more modest than the
topics that you suggested

01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:59.100
to cover, but thank you.

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:08.480
And about certainly in the book
we have a section or subsection

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:13.880
about Jewish or half
Jewish creators.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:21.270
And in that sense we connect
through their work we show

01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:27.180
that this out-migration as
we related to other waves

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.320
of migration crossing
the Atlantic

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:34.750
in previous generations.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:38.940
Also the phenomena of people
trying to flee a country

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:42.600
in disarray-- in economic
disarray which has been the case

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.690
of Argentina in the early 2000
following the economic crisis.

01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:52.610
Many rediscovered that they were
the descendants of Spaniards,

01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:59.940
of Italians trying to regain the
nationality of their forefathers

01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:05.360
in order to immigrate from
a country in economy crisis.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.470
So this is-- we-- there are
some sections of the book

01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:11.180
in which we address that.

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:16.970
Especially interesting for me
is the chapter on the Jewish

01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:22.920
or the subchapter, the
section on the Jewish

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.220
or partly Jewish authors
because they recreate

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:32.330
through their work the
reminiscence of their--

01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:36.590
the diaspora of their
forefathers.

01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:43.210
This is a-- I'm doing bad
service to the authors

01:28:43.210 --> 01:28:46.740
but it's wonderful to
read how they reflect

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:50.280
on their own personal
experience in the book.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.580
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo:
And the book does

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.250
in the beginning
discusses immigration

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:55.560
in these countries
and not just exile.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.860
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka: Yes.

01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:58.160
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo:
And in quite detail.

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:03.550
That said in-- so in
the US and the Latino

01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:05.350
in Argentina exile the--

01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:08.610
in Mexico [inaudible]
so you know the--

01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:10.050
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Yes.

01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:12.220
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: I came
to the US 20 years ago,

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:16.930
25 years ago now and
you know nothing of--

01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:18.540
in fact when you introduced me,

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:21.210
nothing of what defines
my professional career is

01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:25.460
in any way connected to
the fact that I am exilee.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.770
So we have competed
in identities.

01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:30.450
And on the book I
think it's very clear,

01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:33.880
I'm saying that at some point
being part of exile mutated

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.520
to a lot of very
different things.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.250
It's very clear by the end that,
you know, what you just said

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:41.920
about some journey, you know
this journey [inaudible]

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.070
that are taken on
different identities

01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:46.060
and making different
roles and choices.

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:52.060
So, my grandfather was a
refugee from Lithuania,

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:55.350
actually from Vilna
and got to Argentina.

01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:59.120
And my great grandmother died in
Auschwitz but I don't consider

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:02.490
that and he didn't consider
himself as an exilee

01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:04.040
and he moved when we was 15.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:07.200
And then my mother moved at 15
to Buenos Aires from [inaudible]

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.880
after the great depression
and then I moved to Argentina

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.740
when I was 15 by myself
because they were in Mexico.

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.100
So we are cut by different
identities but each one

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.110
of those movements were

01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:20.810
in a sense different
identity formation events.

01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:24.470
And here I think it's very clear
what they define as exilee.

01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:26.720
That reminds me in
a way of Chris Rock,

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.320
that he has his joke
about, you know,

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.040
I used to have a job,
now I have a career.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.950
You know I was a
dishwasher so I had a job

01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:36.980
and now I'm a comedian
so I have a career.

01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:40.380
So I do think there's a very
important class component--

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.680
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Oh, yes.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:42.980
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: -- on being
exilee rather than refugee.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.280
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Yeah.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.580
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: And that
that's not quite describing

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.880
the book.

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.180
I mean that's why I was,
you know, mentioning.

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:51.340
And being an exilee in a
sense is a status symbol.

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:56.140
Being a refugee is a sign of
being, you know, [inaudible].

01:30:56.140 --> 01:31:03.380
And so this is taking the most
positive and constructed--

01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:04.680
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Totally.

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:06.030
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: And to
some extent upper elite--

01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:07.330
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Oh,
definitely, yes, yes.

01:31:07.330 --> 01:31:10.290
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: -- view exile
with not necessarily corresponds

01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:12.180
to the million people
that weren't on exile.

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.480
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Absolutely.

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.780
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka: But there is
a testimony that you guys have.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.080
I don't know if it is Dorfman.

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:19.800
I forget who it is that says
they offered me the possibility

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.630
of being an exile which
had all of consequences--

01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:24.930
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Dorfman.

01:31:24.930 --> 01:31:26.230
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka:
Dorfman, right?

01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:27.530
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Yeah.

01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:28.830
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: Yes.

01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:30.130
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka:
And I said no.

01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:31.430
And he chose-- he made a
choice for that so-- but I've--

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:33.710
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Of all
the people he made the--

01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:36.870
Dorfman was already
Dorfman before he left.

01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:38.170
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka: Yes.

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:39.470
Yes.

01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:40.770
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: So he
can afford to play that

01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:46.500
but it's absolutely true that we
did cut across in the selection

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:51.750
that we have with the people
who are able to make an impact

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:54.930
on higher education,
in public policy,

01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:57.230
in governmental approaches
to [inaudible],

01:31:57.230 --> 01:32:00.550
redemocratization and so on.

01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:04.470
There is no question that we
did leave out the majority

01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:10.970
of the exiles who had
"the common people".

01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:16.020
And so yes, definitely,
that is the case.

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.600
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: And
without the graciousness

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.270
of over 150 such individuals--

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.570
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Yeah.

01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:27.360
&gt;&gt; Luis Roniger: -- this book
would not have been produced.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.930
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Juan was
going to say something else.

01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:30.230
&gt;&gt; Juan Uriagereka:
Well, I was just going

01:32:30.230 --> 01:32:31.590
to say a footnote on that.

01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:34.820
Those are the people I
know for two reasons.

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.710
A, because many of
them came to Spain.

01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:39.280
B, because I was a working
class kid so they lived

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.750
in working class neighborhoods.

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:44.140
In fact we faced very similar
problems including drug

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.250
addiction and things like
that but they had a level

01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:49.960
of education that I
certainly didn't have.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.320
So the reason they
taught us many things is

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.620
because they could.

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:58.760
Kind of like when this teacher
was internally exiled by Franco,

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:01.660
my mother learned how to read
from somebody with more culture.

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.960
So these are interesting,

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.060
unintended consequences
of these dynamics.

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.360
Yeah.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.660
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
Yup, absolutely.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:08.960
Yeah.

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.260
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: My
mother have medallion

01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:11.960
of [inaudible] she
have received, so.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:15.800
But yes there was
a-- And there's an--

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.900
We were in a sense a backdrop
of history but it is true

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:22.950
that you're talking about
a very particular group.

01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:24.250
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: You
might want to mention

01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:25.750
who your mother was,
not just the name.

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:27.050
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: I think--

01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:28.350
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: You
mentioned the name.

01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:30.390
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: Yeah, she
was a well known sequentalist

01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:33.630
and a writer.

01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:36.620
She had [inaudible]
10 years ago now.

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:38.890
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski: Yup.

01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:41.530
Final word.

01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:42.950
Thank you all.

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.250
Talia?

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:45.550
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzales:
Thank you.

01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:46.850
&gt;&gt; Ernesto Calvo: Thank you.

01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:48.150
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzales:
[Inaudible] questions?

01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:53.800
Well, thank you to our authors
and panelists for [inaudible].

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.100
&gt;&gt; Saúl Sosnowski:
Thank you [applause].

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:58.170

of the Library of Congress.
