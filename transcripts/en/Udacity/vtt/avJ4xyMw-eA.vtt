00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.735
What about all these other parts of the eye? What do they do?

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:06.206
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, there's a lot going on here. So, let's talk about it. right here, we have

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:12.341
this clear protective membrane and that's called the cornea. And the eye is

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:14.965
pretty important so, its job is basically just to protect everything that's

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:16.325
going on inside.

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:18.445
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And how about the blue part here?

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:25.220
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, that's the colored part of our eye. That's called the iris. And, in

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.870
addition to being very pretty, it's a muscle that constricts or dilates to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.445
change the amount of light that's let in through this guy here, and that's

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:40.204
called the pupil. And when it's dim, you'll notice that your pupils tend to be

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:44.483
pretty big. Versus when it's pretty bright out, they tend to be pretty small.

00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:46.355
Because they don't need as much light.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:48.005
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Then what about this guy right here?

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.409
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. That's the lens. Remember how before we were talking about how the light

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.782
gets bent when it enters the eye?

00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:55.333
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:59.429
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, the lens is what does that bending, that focusing, to make sure that the

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.174
light enters and is focused onto the back of the retina.

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:07.010
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And when it hits the retina, that's where our rods and cones are, right?

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.158
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, exactly. Those rods and cones are called photoreceptor cells. And so,

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:18.200
this retina actually contains many layers of these rods and cones.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.287
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so, rods, photoreceptor cells, photo means light, receptor means to

00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:27.314
receive. They actually are sensitive to primarily black and white vision, and

00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:30.170
they help us to see at night time.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.312
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So then, does that mean the cones help us see color?

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:37.074
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. And there's actually three different types of cones. Some are

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:41.023
sensitive to red light, which is a long wavelength. Some are sensitive to green

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:45.273
or medium wavelength light. And some are sensitive to blue, shortwave length

00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:48.069
light. So, these are used for color vision.
