00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.330
PROFESSOR: Cardinality
is the word

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.860
that's used to refer to
the size of infinite sets.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.720
And before we go further,
let's take a quick look

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.860
at why we're interested
in infinite sets

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.770
in a course that's Mathematics
for Computer Scientists.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.990
Why does computer science
care about infinite sets?

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.020
Well, like every data
structure that you'd

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.470
examine in computer
memory is finite

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.350
and the integers
individually are finite,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.700
you only calculate
with finite things.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.210
But, the infinite abstraction
happens right at the beginning.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.480
Although any given integer is
finite, the set of all integers

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.350
is infinite.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.680
And although any given
matrix is finite,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.090
the set of all the
matrices that might

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.490
be represented in a computation
are an infinite set.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.650
So, we take infinite sets
for granted and reason

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.030
about them all the time.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.420
The second, from a
pedagogical point of view,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.720
introducing the concept
of infinite sets

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.650
and reasoning about
them carefully

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.680
forces you to go
beyond your intuition

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.380
and really follow
the rules and reason

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.080
in a careful mathematical way.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.570
Because although some properties
that you're familiar with from

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.660
finite sets carry over to
infinite sets, others don't.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.160
And in order to
know which is which,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.420
you have to be thinking
carefully about the rules

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.470
and properties that
they have, as opposed

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.710
to just going by intuition
and familiar properties.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.200
And finally, the
reasoning that goes

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.460
into comparing the sizes
of infinite sets, which

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.670
is the topic of today's video,
has profound implications

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.420
in computer science
because it leads

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.100
to the insight about the
logical limits of computation

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.610
and examples of
specific problems

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.100
that computers can't
solve, which we'll

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.420
be taking up in a later video.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.000
But for now, let's go back
to the topic of cardinality.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.690
So, there was this mathematician
in the late 19th century

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.860
named Cantor who was actually
working on Fourier's series.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.360
And he discovered that
the kind of series

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.676
that he was working
with diverged

00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:23.770
in infinitely many places,
which sounds kind of bad.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.840
But he wanted to
get across the idea

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.480
that it didn't diverge in
very many infinite places.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.890
And that led him to
this idea of comparing

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.140
the sizes of infinite sets.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.610
So, this is Cantor's idea.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.430
We know from the mapping
dilemma that if you're

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.020
looking at finite sets A
and B, then the size of A

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.900
is greater than or
equal to the size of B

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.700
if and only if A
surj B, were surj

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.780
is this technical relation which
means there exists a surjection

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.070
function from A to B that
is a function with greater

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.670
than or equal to one arrow
into every element of B.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.200
And Cantor's idea
was saying, well,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.860
it works fine for finite sets.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.620
Why don't we take this as the
definition of what we mean by A

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920
is at least the size
of B for infinite sets?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.000
So, we're going to
think of A surj B

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.370
now as saying, A is as big
as B. And for finite sets,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.610
it's literally true that A surj
B if and only if the size of A

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.530
is greater or equal
to the size of B.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.750
Now, let me take a moment to
say that this notion of size

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.130
or cardinality, when you're
talking about infinite sets,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.630
it's kind of a no-no.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.696
There's an abstract concept of
what cardinal numbers are, what

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:41.820
these infinite numbers are.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.840
But the truth is, they're
technical and not of very much

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.600
use.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.640
So, we will never actually be
talking about the cardinality

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.100
or size of an infinite set.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.270
But what we will
do is compare them.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.170
We're going to have a nice
elementary theory of the idea

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.250
that the cardinality
of one set is

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.250
greater than or equal to the
cardinality of another set.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.780
And the basic definition is
going to be based on surj.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.150
Similarly, bijection
is even easier.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.455
A bij B means that there's
a bijection from A to B.

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:13.830
And we're going
to interpret that

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.990
as saying that A and
B are the same size.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.579
That is, for finite sets,
it literally means A

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.180
and B have the same
number of elements.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.800
We're going to adopt the
notion of a bijective relation

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.664
for infinite sets as meaning, I
don't know what their size is,

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:30.330
but I know it's the
same because there's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.550
a bijection between them.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.500
There's a perfect one to one
correspondence between As

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.560
and Bs.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.840
Let's look at an example of
where bijection comes up.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.140
The power set of N-- if N is
the non-negative integers--

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.080
the power set of N
is all the subsets

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.460
of non-negative integers.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.680
And let me just remark that
there is an obvious bijection

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.904
between the subsets of integers
and the infinite bit-strings,

00:04:55.904 --> 00:04:57.570
the infinite strings
of zeroes and ones.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.600
So, N is the set of
non-negative integers, 0, 1, 2.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.400
If you take any subset of
N, here's one with has 0,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.340
missing 1, has 2 and
3, missing 4, 5, has 6,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.300
and so on, then what I can do
is represent such a subset,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.580
possibly an infinite subset
now, by an infinite sequence

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.610
of ones and zeros.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.120
Put in ones in the position
where elements in the subset

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.120
occur and zeroes in positions
where elements don't occur.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.870
This was exactly
the same bijection

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:35.920
that we had found between the
non-negative-- the bit-strings

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.450
and the finite subsets of
the non-negative integers.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.672
But now, we're just extending
it to arbitrary subsets

00:05:42.672 --> 00:05:43.880
of the non-negative integers.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.770
So, this defines a
bijection between any subset

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.470
of integers corresponds to
an infinite bit-strings.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.630
And conversely, from
any infinite bit-string,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.770
you can reconstruct what
subset it refers to.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.900
So, we use this notation
[? 0,1 ?] to the omega,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.265
meaning the infinite bit-strings
that are infinite to the right.

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:02.880
They have a beginning.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.610
In comparison to [? 0,1 ?]
superscript star,

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.110
which refers to the finite
sets of bit-strings.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.840
So now, let's examine the
standard size properties

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.750
that you would expect if these
relationships of surj and bij

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.050
behaved like relationships
between sizes.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.530
So, one basic property
that finite sizes have

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.020
is that if A is equal to B
and B is equal to C in size,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.640
then the size of A and the
size of C are the same.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.690
That's certainly
true for finite sets.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.130
Does it hold for infinite
sets, where now equality is

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.790
going to be replaced by bij?

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.390
Well, we have to check it.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:47.700
Is it true that if A bij B and
B bij C implies A bij C, well,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.910
how do you prove that?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.720
Well, it's true, and here's how.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.030
By definition,
since A bij B, that

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.060
means that you have a
bijection g from A to B.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.600
And since B bij C, you have a
bijection f from B to C. Now,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.580
I need from these two
bijections that I'm

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.780
given, I need to find a
bijection between A and C.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.550
Well, that's easy.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.950
What you do is you use
g to go from A to B,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.950
and then you use f to go from
B to C. And you compose them,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.550
and that gives you the needed
bijection from A to C. So,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.590
define h to be the
composition of f and g.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.520
And it's easy to check that if
g and f are bijections, then

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.570
their composition
is a bijection.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.670
So, that's how I find the needed
bijection from A to C. So,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.820
this property works
out just fine.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.730
The similar property applies
to at least as big as,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.820
greater than or equal to.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.020
For finite sets, if A is
greater than or equal to B

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.950
and B is greater than
or equal to C in size,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.590
then A is greater
than or equal to C.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.070
And actually, the same
argument that worked for bij

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.460
works for surj,
because the composition

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.050
of surjective functions
is a surjective function.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.660
So, if A surj B and B
surj C implies A surj C.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.770
Now again remember, although
we're thinking of surj

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.910
as meaning greater than
or equal to in size,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.550
you cannot take these size
properties for granted.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.760
They have to be proved.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.130
Surj has a technical
definition having

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.980
to do with surjective functions,
functions with greater

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.600
than or equal to one arrow in.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.790
That is not the same as
talking about equality

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.470
of some kind of sizes.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.680
Well, let's look at an example
where the size properties hold

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.039
but they're less obvious.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.020
Because here's another
familiar size property.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.304
If A and B are each
of size greater than

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:41.679
or equal to the other one,
then they're the same size.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.350
So, if the size of A is greater
than or equal to the size of B

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.910
and the size of B is greater
than or equal to the size of A,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.097
then A and B are the same size.

00:08:49.097 --> 00:08:50.930
Now, this is certainly
true for finite sets.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.760
It's kind of, you don't
even think about that fact.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.800
And it holds for infinite sets.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.730
But, it's not so obvious.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.110
So, what we're saying is that
if I have a surjective function

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.310
from A to B and I have another
surjective function from B

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.810
to A, then there's a
bijection between A and B.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.200
And the problem here is that
this surjection from A to B

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.880
might not be a bijection.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.640
And this surjection from B to A
might also not be a bijection.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.710
So, where's the bijection
going to come from?

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.170
I have to build it.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.247
And so, this is not an
obvious property, it's true.

00:09:27.247 --> 00:09:29.080
It's called the
Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.460
And the trick, basically, is you
take the bijection from A to B

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.160
and the bijection from B to
A and you take parts of one

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.790
and combine it with
parts of the other.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.500
And in a slightly
ingenious way that

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.680
actually is contained in
a problem in the text,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.320
you can find the
bijection from A to B,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.300
but it does take a
little bit of ingenuity.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.320
So this is a size property
that works for surj and bij,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.460
but you can't say it's obvious.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.540
Well, let's look at an
unfamiliar size property.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.000
Something that's not
true of finite sets

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.990
where we have to start being
careful and not just hand wave

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.800
and use our intuition
about finite sets.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.170
Namely, for infinite sizes,
size plus 1 is equal to size.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.280
Now, what exactly
does that mean?

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.286
Well, let's just illustrate
it with an example.

00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:19.160
In fact, in some ways,
you can the definition

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.140
of an infinite set is
that its size plus 1

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.180
is equal to its size.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.800
Let's look at a simple example.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.790
So, on the bottom, I have
the non-negative integers.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.670
And on the top, I have
the positive integers.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.850
So, I can get from
the positive integers

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.400
to the non-negative integers
just by throwing in zero.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.320
So, that's where the
plus one comes from.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.960
Here's a nice infinite set.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.560
I add another element to it,
and I get another infinite set,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.146
but they are the same size.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.770
I have to show a
bijection between them

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.740
to show they're the set size.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.281
Well, you know what
the bijection is.

00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:53.990
Map 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.170
This is a bijection which you
know as the add one function.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.670
The add one function maps
the non-negative integers

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.030
to the positive integers,
and it's a perfect bijection.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.840
Therefore, adding one element
to the non-negative integers--

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.670
to the positive integers
does not get me a larger set,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.780
it gets me another
set of the same size.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.560
And this argument
actually generalizes

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.370
to any infinite set.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.340
If you throw in
one extra element,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.500
you could still find a bijection
between the original set

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.870
and the set with
one extra element.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.110
So, N is the same size
as the positive integers.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.530
Well, in fact, let's
look at this one.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.340
I can enumerate on the
top all the integers,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.730
both positive and negative.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.590
0, 1, minus 1, 2,
minus 2, and so on.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.730
And that gives me the set
consisting of all the integers.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.750
And over here, I
can have 0, 1, 2,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.400
just the non-negative integers.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.770
And you can see the
orderly way in which I've

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.150
listed the integers at the top.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.980
That implicitly
defines a bijection.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.840
I'm going to map zero to the
zeroeth element of the sequence

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.340
above.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.880
1 to 1, 2 to minus 1,
3 to 2, 4 to minus 2.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.410
And in this way, I
have actually defined

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.370
a bijection between the
non-negative integers and all

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.120
the integers.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.852
In other words, you take
half of the integers, namely

00:12:15.852 --> 00:12:17.560
the non-negative
integers, and it's still

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.390
the same size as all of them.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.080
There's a bijection
between N and Z.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.000
Now, you could write
a formula, actually,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.580
if you were trying to figure out
what does the number N go to?

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.130
What positive or
negative integer?

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.770
There's some not very
hard formula involving

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.999
dividing N by two and rounding.

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:38.040
But, that doesn't matter.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.100
Once I've figured
out some sensible way

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.760
to list all the elements
of the integers in a row,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.480
then I can wind them up against
the non-negative integers.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.310
And that listing, in
effect, defines the mapping

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.370
in a perfectly clear way without
necessarily having a formula.
