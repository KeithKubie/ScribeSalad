00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.360
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.190
&gt;&gt;Nora Krug: I have the pleasure of
introducing Karin Slaughter today.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.760
And, first thing first is she gets
this question a lot, I think it.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.060
That is her real name.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.360
And, she's the author of 17
books including pretty girls,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.920
copies books are hugely popular.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.220
35 million books.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.790
Amazing. Her crime stories
are vivid and detailed

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.500
and feature some strong female
characters, and as you know,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000
she does not shy away
from violent incidents.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.300
In fact, she has been
known to autopsy reports

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.820
to insure her murder
sound authentic.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.340
I do. Her latest book
is The Good Daughter,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.640
and it's a nail-biting tale

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.940
about the [inaudible]
of Pikeville, Georgia.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.240
And, the story takes us back
in time to a horrific crime

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.540
that tore her family apart.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.370
And, it's a cold case that
becomes less so 28 years later

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.670
when a second murder drudges

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.090
up terrible memories
and long buried secrets.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.630
And, if you don't have it,
you can buy a copy here.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.010
I'm thought going to give
any more of the story away.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.350
And, one of the bonuses is
being at the festival is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.930
that yeah can buy the book
and you can get a copy signed.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.480
In addition to her writing, Karin
is an advocate for libraries.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.280
She's the founder of the
Save the Libraries Project

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.480
which is an organization
that raises money

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.400 position:56%
for DeKalb County library foundation
in Georgia which is her home state.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.700
We are thrilled to have Karin
here to tell us about herself,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.840
her writing, her latest book,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.400
and perhaps what we can look
forward to in the next one.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
So, please join me in
welcoming Karin Slaughter.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.700
[ Applause ]

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.360
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter:
Thank you very much.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.660
Thank you, Nora.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.800
And, also thank you to the
wonderful volunteers here today

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.930
who have been doing
such a great job.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.980
Authors are basically incapable
of doing anything on their own

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.690
and so they've been telling us
you can stay here for ten minutes,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.190
you can eat here, you
can go to the bathroom.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.300
And, now, they brought me here.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.450
So, we have them to thank for that.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.750
Hopefully, this isn't it.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.220
I'll eventually end
up at the airport.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.940
But, you know, normally when
I do events I don't really --

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.040
I don't read from my book
unless someone wants me to.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.320
And, then I only read
from the very end.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.960
So, does anyone want me to read?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.970
No. Okay. So, what I do
is I'm from the south.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.630
I'm from Georgia so I do
what all good southerners do.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.470
I make fun of my family.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.150
I tell you a little bit
about my writing process.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.360
And, then, hopefully, by
then, I've talked long enough

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750
so that you can ask some questions.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.510
I will say please don't
give spoilers.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.260
Like if a character you loved is no
longer in the series or something

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.040
like that, please don't
ask about that.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.450
You can email me directly
from my website or Facebook.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.850
If you're here to beat
me up because that,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.910
my publicist is right here,
and it was her decision.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.570
So, or one of the many
helpful volunteers.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.870
They're in the purple shirts.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.280
Since Nora and also -- thank you
so much Nora for volunteering

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.560
to do this because, you know,
it's football season, right.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.060
It started to do so to show
up here is a big thing.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.110
But, I am a big library supporter.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.650
Not just my local library which
is DeKalb County in Georgia,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.870
but the Save the Libraries
projects does give block grants

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.780
to other libraries across
the country and actually

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.730
in the United States and
England and the Netherlands.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.720
We tried in France but they didn't
understand libraries needing money.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.450
They said we don't do
that, we just raise taxes.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.950
Why don't you do that in America.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.210
And, I said this is
why people hate France.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.310
But, we do try to give
internationally.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.490
Today, we've raised over
$300,000 for libraries.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.790
So, thank you.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.430
[ Applause ]

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.080
And, we try to give block grants,
and we tell them do what you want.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.650
If you need to paint the place,
if you need a reading program

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.520
for kids, whatever you need.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.630
Don't not for vacation.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.520
We had to be really
specific about that

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.580
because someone ended up in Tahiti.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.300
But she got an amazing
tan, I will say that.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.560
But, you know, I'm a big supporter

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.840
of libraries though I don't
necessarily like children.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.760
I find them kind of self-centered.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.480
The poor motor control.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.790
I just -- you know, when
they're 25 and up, yes.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.660
But, that's one of the
reasons why I support libraries

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.020
because children are so
selfish, and if they read books,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.240
they start to understand
that there's a world

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.720
out outside of them, you know.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.420
A herald has a purple crayon,
I have a purple crayon,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.800
so this is not the only
purple crayon in the world.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.750
You know, something
as basic as that.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.480
If I think about the books
the librarians gave me

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.670
like Are You There
God, It's Me, Margaret.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.080
Or [inaudible] Flannory
O'Connor, Gone With The Wind.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.370
You know, for all its flaws.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.750
The books that I grew
up loving and reading,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.900
I have really informed
my life as a writer.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.480 position:56%
No more so than Flowers in the Attic
come I thought was a beautiful love

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.390
story until I was in my early 20's

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.330
and then I thought
someone said something

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.200
about incest and I was like what.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.740
So, you know, I'm probably the only
person here with Game of Thrones.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.570
I was like yeah, I see it.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.180
I see it. So, you know,
also the important thing

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.180
about libraries is children who
learn to read do better in school.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.940
If they do better in school
then they go to college.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.990
If they go to college then they
get better jobs then they pay

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.650
higher taxes.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.030
So, this is something a Republican,
a librarian, or a Democrat

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.280
or a Communist, anybody
can understand that.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.050
It's a small investment.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.390
There's also all kinds of studies
about the brains of children.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.340
That children who read
develop pathways in their brain

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.970
for critical thinking that children

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.620
who do not read fluently
never will develop.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.100
If you talk to anyone in the
criminal justice system something

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.250
like 80% of all kids who
have contact with the law

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.480
or with the criminal justice
system are functionally illiterate.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.470
So, think about how much
cheaper it would be just

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.940
to put a book in their hands.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.090
And that's what we try to do.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.940
So, you know, even though I don't
like children, I do want them

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.100
to be able to pay for my
social security, Medicare.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.360
All of that stuff that I'm
going to need later on.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.340
And, you may say well, you're an
author too so you want libraries

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.920
to be open because
they buy your books.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.100
Yes, it's all very self
serving, but we are a non profit.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.760
So, thank you for listening to my
little spill about the libraries.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.350
Like I said, I grew up in
a small south Georgia town.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.990
I'm the youngest of three girls.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.910
My sisters are, you
know, when I was growing

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.640
up were horrible hateful people.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.400
When people say why are so drawn to
violence, I say because I lived it.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.730 position:56%
We did things like we beat each
other, we spit in each others faces.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.590
I broke my sisters leg once.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.170
I told her.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.220
I said if you don't give me back
my Kate Jackson trading card,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.210
I'm going to break your leg.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.510
She would not give it back.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.810
I broke her leg.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.950
So, from a very early age
I've been a person of my word.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:24.150
But, you know, when you live in
the south, especially in Georgia

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.960
when you say you go on
vacation, it's like when you go

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.240
to a restaurant and you order
a Coke they say diet or regular

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.280
because Coke is what soda is,
well, vacation means Florida,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.650
and it mean specifically
the redneck Riviera

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.370
which is the Florida Panhandle.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.850
Every summer we would go there.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:46.350 position:56%
My dad was a -- I love him to death,
but he was a really tough dad.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.310
And he was the original
story teller in our family.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.070
And most of his stories
had cautionary tales.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.700
You know, he had three girls
so he had to keep us in line.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.010
So, one of his favorites
was about the little girl

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.560 position:56%
who touched the thermostat and died.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.230
Or the little girl who left the
refrigerator door open and died.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.810
And, so, when we would go
to Florida, my dad would be

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.140
in the front seat and he would have
a cigarette in one hand and a glass

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.500
of scotch in the other and he
would drive with his knees.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.980
And, he would drive --
it was a six hour trip.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.720
He always wanted to make
it in under five hours.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.660
And, so, he didn't let us
turn on the air conditioning

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.220
because that waisted gas.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.280
So, he would role the windows down.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.330
You know, it was about 120,000
degrees outside, and I would be

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.960
in the back seat on the hump
because I'm the youngest.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.260
And, I shouldn't complain because
I've got remarkably strong thighs

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.950
because I just had to
hold everything together.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.310
And, my sisters were
on either side of me.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.700
And, you know, my dad
didn't believe in the radio

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.000
because he thought it wasted gas.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.550
Most of the trip was quiet car
because we would get in fights.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.900
You know, she's touched
me, she's breathing

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.100
on me, she's thinking about me.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.140
And, we would start
slapping each other.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.460
My dad would pull over.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.500
And, the rule was we all
got spanked no matter what.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.530
But, the joke was on him because
thighs were basically numb

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.000
from sitting on the
back of his vinyl seats.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.960
And, we would get up and
it sound like Velcro.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.150
So, he was spanking
basically dead nerves there.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:26.500 position:56%
But, one of the ways that he kind
of transported us away from the heat

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.180
and the oppression was
he would tell us stories.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.130
And, he love making fun of his
family because that's what you do

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.700
when you're in the south is you
just make fun of people who are

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.120
in your family though it's
very rude if someone makes fun

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.820
of your family, I want
you to know that.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.530
And, my dad would talk
about my aunt Bertha.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.130
And, my aunt Bertha, she
was born with a hair lip.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.320
And, the church raised
money to get it fixed

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.320
but she would not get it fixed
because she said she was touched

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.760
by Jesus when she was born.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.770
And, so, she worked at the local
Bingo parlor, and she would get

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.810
up there and she would
call out the numbers

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.720
on the ball and she would say B44.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.780
Or I shitty shit.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:17.780
And, I would remember as a kid
hearing my dad tell this story I'm

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.590
thinking holy crap, if you
tell stories you can curse.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.070
And, if you read my books
I curse all the time.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.540
I get a lot of letters for that.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.900 position:56%
You know, the child molesters, the
murderers, the rapist, they're okay.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.190
But, God forbid you should
have a woman say the F word.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.260
So, that's kind of
something that shaped me

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.030
as a writer is my dad
telling these stories

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.330
because he grew up very poor.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.860
Literally, dirt poor.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.270
He was one of nine kids.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.380
His mother and father
very, very poor.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.030
They squatted in shacks.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.810
And, when the owner of the shack
would come sometimes with a shotgun

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.200
and say you got to move your family
out, they would take the boards

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.990
with them so the next shack they
wouldn't have to sleep in the dirt.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.510
And, my grandfather
was a horrible person.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.550
He was kicked out of the clan for
not taking care of his family.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.220
If you wondered if
they had standards,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.700
apparently that's the one.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.120
And, you know, it wasn't a very
good life for my grandmother.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.870
One thing that the kids always
tried to do was tell her a story

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.470
that would make her
laugh or make her smile.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.640
So, that was something that
really very early on I learned

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.590
as a kid was, you know, if you can
make grandma happy then you've won

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.890
the day.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.970
And, she loved this magazine
called True Crime magazine.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.530
Do you guys-- maybe some older
here-- remember True Crime?

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.450
It was basically snuff porn.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.430
And, there was always like the
last line would say she should

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.060
of listened to her husband
or her father was right.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.540
And, it was all about
woman getting murdered.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.620
Just constantly murdered and
ravished and all these things.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.390
And, the magazine was only
available on the bad side of town

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.460
where we grew up at
the Piggly Wiggly

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.330
because they carry
that kind of trash.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.240
And, so, every Sunday my
grandmother would go to church

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.190
and then she would go
to the Piggly Wiggly

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.830
and get this magazine,
the latest edition.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.460
Then she would go to
our Kroger to get food.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.410
And, then she would go home and
she would cook our Sunday dinner

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.000
and she would read the magazine
while dinner was cooking.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.590
Well, then, we would pull up and
then, you know, we'd go inside.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.320 position:56%
This was back when you didn't really
have to see children so we had

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.060
to disappear once we
kissed her cheek.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.120
And, we would go and we
would look for that magazine.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.660
And, we would read
through Crime magazine.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.350
And, every Sunday night, we
just cried ourselves to sleep.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.250
And, our parents thought it was
because of the sermon, right,

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.010
that we had heard that
Sunday morning but it was

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.960
because we were afraid there was
going to be a hook on the door.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.620
And, my dad didn't help matters
because he love scaring us.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.100
You know, at Christmas where
your dad gets up and he's

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.580
like on the roof, you
know, ho, ho, ho,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.820
he would do that in the summer
time and he would say oh,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.820
that's the goblin who
eats little girls

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.090
who don't listen to their father.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.850
So, you know, we have this sense
of terror and we have this sense

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:15.170
of reading crime stories with
something you should be ashamed of.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.450
But, one thing we can all agree
on is when you went to church

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.300 position:56%
on Sunday you showed your best face.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.300
And, my grandmother loved
taking us to church.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.550
It was her favorite thing to do.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.910
And, one Sunday, Easter Sunday --

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.550
because my parents
were really careful.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.630
My grandmother children was
literally one generation away

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.260
from snake handling.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.030
My grandmother would say oh,
preacher didn't believe enough

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.180
and he died from snake bit.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:46.410
And, so, we would go to church with
my grandmother on Easter Sunday.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.350
The only reason we were
there was to show off, right,

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.170
so she could show what good kids we
were and that we had good manners.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.890
And, we were all in those pink
dresses with the white shoes

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.130
and the underwear with the
ruffles which was weird.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.430
My sister was 16.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.760
She got a lot of phone numbers.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.500
But, you know, my grandma
would introduce us

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.930
to her friends after service.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.230
And this was a real service.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.350
It was four hours, right.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.850
And we weren't allowed to go
to the bathroom or talk or draw

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.990
on something, so basically,
this is how I learned how

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.350
to sleep with my eyes open.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.670
But, she would introduce us

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.350
and she would say this is Mrs.
Smith or this is Mrs. Jones.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.070
And, as soon as the woman
would turn her back,

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.870
my grandmother would
say something awful

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.750
like well, you know, she drinks.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.910
Or, you know her husbands a cheat.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.010
And, so, I had this sense
from a very early age

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.980
that everybody had
a deep dark secret.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.470
And, if you read my books,
everybody has a deep dark secret.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.990
I have my grandmother
to thank for that.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.130
But, the Christmas
before she died --

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.240
I'm sure there are some
southerners in here

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.930
and you know southern grandmothers
are incredibly hard to please.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.600
And, my grandmother was
right up there with them.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.580
I remember my dad bought her
a frying pan and she found

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.220
out it cost $12 and she
made him hang it on the wall

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.760
because she said something
that expensive should be art.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.650
And, she had like a
closet full of hats

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.960
that were too expensive to wear.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.130
So, this was the type
of woman she was.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.410
You know, or like, you know,
you'd say to her oh, grandma,

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.280
your hair looks nice and she's
say do you mean it didn't look

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.580
nice before.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.630
So, at Christmas, we
decided we were going to try

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.400
to get her something nice.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.430
You know, by then my
dad had kind of given

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.850
up after the frying pan incident.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.680
And, so, I said well, why
don't we get her a subscription

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.960
to True Crime magazines
since she loves to read it

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.260
that way she don't have to go

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.090
to the Piggly Wiggly on
the bad side of town.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.380
And, my dad was like,
you know, okay, well,

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.310
at least we know she reads it.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:50.600
And, so, Christmas morning we're
rolled around, and I couldn't wait.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.300
I was just so excited about this
gift we got for our grandmother.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.720
I told you I'm the youngest so
you know I like to ruin surprises.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.990
So, we were sitting at
the breakfast table,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.780
and my dad's rule was we could not
open presents until he was finished

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.950
with breakfast which was usually
about 1 p.m. I just couldn't stop.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.290
I just said grandma, grandma, guess
what we got you for Christmas.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.110
And she said what.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.660
Already disappointed.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.730
And, I said we got you a
subscription to True Crime magazine

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.030
so you don't have to go

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.900
to the Piggly Wiggly on
the bad side of town.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.520
And, she was silent
which was very strange.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.470
And, she just looked at me.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.290
And, her bottom lip started to
quiver, and she started to cry.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.430
Just these tears pouring
down her face

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.740 position:56%
and her head dropped into her hands.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.180
And, she really just
started to Saab.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.470
And, my dad got up and
he said mama, you know,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.920
are you okay because we
just thought oh, my God,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.930
we finally gotten her something
that's moved her that she wants.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.060
I'm like this is like a
magical Christmas moment.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.360
And she looked at my dad

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:03.280
and she said I do not want the
postman to know I read that.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.810
And, so, the next business
day my dad had

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.530 position:56%
to cancel the magazine subscription.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.800
It cost more to cancel
it than the did

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.740
to get the subscription originally,
so I think this happened a lot.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.980 position:56%
I think a lot of woman were ashamed.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.960
So, I stand up here before you
knowing how ashamed my grandmother

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.260
would be.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.490
Not just that I'm wearing
pants but that I'm not

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.480
at home watching Georgia football.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.610
There are many strikes
for me being up here.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.650
But mostly that I write the kind
of book she would love to read

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.990
but she would be horrified
to know people love --

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.480
that people would know
that she loved them.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.210
But, when my grandmother
passed away,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.960
it was a really difficult
time for us.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.920
And, because we did,
we loved her so much.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.460
And, she's buried in the Sodom
cemetery in south Georgia

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.420 position:56%
where all the slaughters are buried.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.840
And, there's a preacher buried
there, the snake handler.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.010
And, he was so concerned
that there rapture would come

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.990 position:56%
and he would be forgotten about that
she was buried with a telephone.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.830
And, there was an actual
telephone in the coffin

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.950 position:56%
and a telephone line went out of his
grave and up to a telephone pole.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.170
And, this was before
cell phones, obviously.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.510
And, I guess, you know, it's sort

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.960
of like Harry Potter is the
most magician in the world

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.260
but he still needs glasses.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.180 position:56%
This guy thought Jesus and God would
bring the rapture but, you know,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.680
I got to call and make sure
they don't forget about me.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.320
I don't know what was on his
conscious, but there's more going

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.100
on than being snake
bit with that fellow.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.450
But, it terrified us, of
course, to think about a dead man

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.120 position:56%
in a coffin with a telephone, right.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.020
And, my dad loved that.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.530
She delighted in it.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.100
And, so, whenever we would
go visit my grandmother --

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.560
she was buried up here, the
preacher was buried here,

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.460
and the parking lot was here --

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.970
you know, normally you
would go like straight

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.560
across to see my grandmother but my
dad always made us go all the way

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.960
around and under the
preachers telephone line.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.930
You remember when telephones
sounded like bells?

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.970
So one time we were walking
under this telephone line.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.860
Me, my middle sister,
my older sister,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.530
and my dad was behind
us and he had a bell.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.670
And, he rang that bell, and
it's been years of therapy.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:35.590
None of us quite remember
what was going on.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.430
The next thing after the
sound of that bell that any

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.310
of us recall is screaming
on the floorboard

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.910
of the car covered in urine.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.380
And, so, when people tell me
your books really scary me,

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.470
I think that least you're
not covered in urine.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:58.070
So, that's the kind of
life I had growing up.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.810
So, people also say well, why
do you write the way you write.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.110
That's why.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:07.600
I am grateful for my -- the
way I was raised though.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.100 position:56%
I think that between, you know, my
grandmother and my dad and my family

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.530
and I mean, I can hold my own
in a fight thanks to my sisters.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.300
But, I do think that we just have

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.010
that story telling
ability in our family.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.750
And, I remember a long
time ago this reporter

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.940
from the Washington Post
came to interview me.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.080
And, we were up in the mountains.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.230
I have a cabin up in north Georgia
where I go to do my writing,

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.970
and my dad lives down the way.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.280
And, you know, he knew that I
had somebody there so he came

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.870
by to see if we needed anything.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.020
And, I had told the reporter
all these stories about my dad.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.930
You know, like the time I
had a spend a night party.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.690
It's the last one I ever had.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.430
My dad thought it would be funny to
put a ladder up against the window

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.910
and put a sheet on
his head like a ghost.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.720
But, for some reason, instead
of cutting the eyeholes,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.670
he used black magic marker.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.400
And, then he got caught when
he was climbing the ladder.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.410
And, so, we were just sitting
there minding our own business

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.710
and a ladder came through
the window.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:16.080
Which he thought was even
funnier than the original plan.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.550
But, so, this woman who
interviewed me, she met my dad.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.200
And, he was perfectly normal.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.100
I mean, anybody have a
parent like this knows

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.080
that they can pass for normal.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.240
And, he was normal
for about 30 minutes.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.990 position:56%
And, she just kind of -- I could
see her reporter brain saying what's

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.290
going on here.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.250
She Fed me a line.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.290
She's trying to, you know,
gin up that southern thing.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.700
And, then she started to leave

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.900
and she asked my dad the
best way to get back.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.030
And, he said well, you can
go left out of the driveway,

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.980
but the more scenic route is you go
right and you cross over a bridge.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.300
And, this is not the bridge

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.850
where that man was
caught molesting the boy,

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:02.040
it's the one where the body
was found that was burned.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.040
So, go fast over that one.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.700
And, then the next one you can
see where they drag this body.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.840
And, then she was looking at me
because the most interesting part

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.450
of an interview is always
when the tape recorders off

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.650
and the pencils down, and
she just looked at me like.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.970
So, that's my dad.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.280
So, people who say
you look so normal,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.890
I can't believe you write
these books, that's why.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.190
I learn from my father.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:35.230
I'll talk a little bit
about The Good Daughter.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.130
You know, a lot of times
people want to know

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.280
where do writers get their ideas.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.780
Most of the time we lie
because we don't know.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.210
They just happen.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.360
You know, suddenly you're
walking down the street or you're

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.550
in your car, especially if
you write crime fiction.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.040
You know, if you're in traffic
and somebody cuts you off,

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.070
you instantly think of five
different ways to murder somebody.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.510
But, for me, a lot of times
it starts with character.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.250
And the first character I thought

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.790
about in a Good Daughter
is a character named gamma.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.580
She's the mother of two girls.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.780
We meet in the opening
chapter of the book.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.600
She's married to a fellow
named Rusty who's a lawyer.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.230
But, gamma is not her real name.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.050 position:56%
It's her nickname because she worked
at [inaudible] lab and she worked

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:22.180
at NASA in the 60's
and 70's as a scientist

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.730
which as we all know is
a very difficult time

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.970
for a woman to be in STEM.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.680
It's a little better now
we can at least say that.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.850
And, she chose to give up
that life and move home

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.930 position:56%
and take care of her ailing parents.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.780
And, she ended up in mountain town
in north Georgia called Pikeville

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.900
which is loosely based on a lot
of towns up in north Georgia

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.660
that I know about but
not one specific one.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.270
So, if you think It's Blue
Ridge it's actually Epiworth

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.570
[assumed spelling].

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.110
And, if you think it's Epiworth,
it's actually Blue Ridge

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:57.330
because I still have to
go up there and write.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:01.940
But, I thought about this
character a lot, and there's a line

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.120
that I wrote down about
her three years ago.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.330
And I'm a real nerd.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:12.210
I've got like a water proof note
pad in my shower and it just says

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.510
up there and I write things.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.620
I clean the shower, don't judge.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.140
But, you know, I write note
to myself in different lines.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.310
There was this one line that
came to me because when I was

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.480
in ninth grade, my ninth grade
English teacher became the most

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.240
important person in my life.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.720
She was an amazing woman.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.990
She was very mean which you as
you can gather I respond well to.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.120
And, we wanted to please her.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.080
You know, people talk about
performance pay and how

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.190
to evaluate teachers
and that sort of thing,

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.630
I think she would get
the worst evaluations

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.210
because the kids were
just scared of her.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.360
But, she was the best teacher.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.130
Because I think you should be a
little scared of your teachers.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.720
I think you should
respect their authority.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.570
And, she commanded the classroom.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.180
But, she also said to me something

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.610
that no one had ever
said to me in my life.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.630
She said you're a good
writer but you can be better.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.060
And, of course, I thought I'm
pretty dam good, you know,

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.680
what are you talking about.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.570
But, she put books in my hands and
she said the way you learn to --

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.560
you're a writer or
you're not, right.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.120
And you're a writer, and you need
to learn how to hone your craft.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.700
The best way to do that
is through reading.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:28.000 position:56%
And, she gave me these amazing books
and she just really fostered my love

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.080
of reading and writing and
learning from what I read.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.110
You know, the mind is a muscle
that you have to keep training.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.970
And, I always say when people say
I want to be a writer they need

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.270
to read because that's important.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.160
That makes you aware of how
story works and what you

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.100
like in a book or don't
like in a book.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.590
It teaches you something.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.050
And, so, she was the
one who said that to me

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.040 position:56%
and who really put this passion
into me about being a better writer.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.290
And, every book I start
I think about her

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.950
and I want to be better every time.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.680
But, it started in ninth grade,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.350
and she was with me throughout
the last 17 years of my career.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.090
She was the second person after my
father I told about my book deal

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.020
when I first got published.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.530
She was always there, and sometimes

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.670
when I would travel she would
send postcards to wait for me

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.350
at the hotel and tell
me how proud she was.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.720
But, she passed away
a couple years ago.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.090 position:56%
And, it was really hard to lose her.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.990
But, the thing is a friend of
mine said at the time, you know,

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.590
when someone dies your
relationship with them doesn't end.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.590
And, I found that to be true.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.710
And, actually it felt
like it deepened.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.980
And, I think the reason it
deepened is she wasn't there

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.060
to tell me all the
things I was doing wrong.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.070
Because she was a difficult woman.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.010
And, you know, even literally

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.130
on her death bed someone had
given her a box of chocolates.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.920
You know, those fancy handmade
chocolates -- I ate them all.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.740
She was sick -- but there was like
a little note explaining, you know,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.690
the cows name was Harvey
who gave the milk for this.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:07.290
You know that kind of crap they do
to justify like having to pay $10

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.590
for one piece of chocolate.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:13.090
But, there was an apostrophe
error in the note.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.930
And, she wanted me to write a
letter to the company to tell them

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.780
that this was embarrassing them,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.110
and they're chocolates
were otherwise good.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.990
But, you know, they needed to
represent themselves better,

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.040
and grammar is important.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.750
And, so, we did that.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.540
And, that was just the
kind of person she was.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.750
And, you know, as a society,
we're wired to appreciate men

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.040
who are really intelligent, really
driven, really know what they want.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.040
We don't know what to do with
woman who are that way and we tend

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.790
to categorize them as difficult.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.290
And, she definitely was difficult.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.180
And, so, I wanted to write
a character like her.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.040 position:56%
In this line I wrote on my
waterproof notepad is one that shows

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.110
up on the first page of the book.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.510
And, it says that she was as pale
as an envelope and just as likely

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.520
to inflict tiny cuts
in inconvenient places.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.950
And, that was really
her all over, you know.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.620
She could hurt your feelings a lot,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.890
the chocolate company
certainly never wrote back.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.050
But, she thought it was important

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.810
that people knew what was
right and what was wrong.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:28.430
And, that was a character I really
felt that I could write about.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.320
And, so, that's how
the book started.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.820
And, I gave her two daughters
who are very different daughters

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.040
who have very different goals
in life, and I gave her husband

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.030
who was also inspired by -- well,
I guess not a real life character.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:49.050
But, she's kind to me
Addicus Finch in between

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.790
to Kill a Mockingbird
which, you know,

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.620
Scout thinks Atticus is this saint.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.960
He's almost this asexual being.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.900
And, then, the character
we meet Atticus Finch

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.590
and go set a watchman, right.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:06.440
I wanted him to fall somewhere
in between those two people.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.760
And Rusty is a lawyer.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.470
He thinks that what he
does is right and just,

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.110
but a lot of times he's not
right and just in his thinking.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.710
And, it really came out
of a conversation I had

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.010
with Greg [inaudible].

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.610
And, I'm saying this
because I checked

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.360
and Greg [inaudible] is not here.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.520
But, I was at a dinner.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.400
There's something called
Thriller Fest which is held

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.250
in New York City every year.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.850
If you want to be a thriller rider
it's a really great opportunity.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.400 position:56%
You know, you meet a lot of authors.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.810
You meet agents.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.840
They have something
called Craft Fest.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.250
And, there's actually even people
who are very serious about writing

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.160
who have attended this conference
and ended up getting a book deal.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.070
So, it's a very Worthwhile
thing to be a part of.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.260
But, we were all at
this author dinner,

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.320
and Greg [inaudible]
was one of the authors.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.620
I won't name drop.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.190
I was probably the
most famous one there.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.830
But, our phones started
buzzing because the exert

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.100
in the New York Times of Go Set a
Watchman had just been released,

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.290
and it was revealed that Atticus
Finch went to a clan meeting.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.370
And Greg is from Mississippi.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.180
I don't want to punch down but
he's so country that sticks come

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.660
out of his mouth when he talks.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.710
And, I'm from Georgia.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.270 position:56%
And, we were really -- other than
Steve Berry who now lives in Florida

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.710
so it doesn't count, we were
the only southerners there.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.880
And, Greg and I got
into this heated debate

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.150
because he said I don't think a
man of Atticus Finches education,

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:36.310
intelligence, standing, family,
would ever do such a thing.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.360
And, I had just done some research

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.040
for a book I had written called Cop
Town about a guy named Leo Frank.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.020 position:56%
And, that name may sound familiar to
some of you especially those of you

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.160
like me who love lifetime movies.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.150
But Leo Frank was in the early
1900's a Jewish businessman

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.690
from the northeast
who moved to Atlanta

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:00.680
and started working
at a pencil factory.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.000
And, one weekend, a year
girl -- I think she was 13,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.360
Mary Faggon [assumed spelling],
was defiled and murdered

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.350
and left in this factory.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.620
And, they couldn't
find any black people

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.210
so they did the next best thing.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.120
They found the Jewish guy from the
north and they pinned it on him.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.910
And, he ended up being tried for
this crime, but he was lynched.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.860
He was lynched by the towns people.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.880
And, there are photographs
of his lynching.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.910 position:56%
And, his neck is literally stretched
and standing in front of him

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.350
with their guns, you
know, looking like,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.460
you know, their happy about this.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.650
Their proud that they've just
murdered a man in cold blood,

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:48.190 position:56%
you see the son of a United States
senator, the sheriff, the policeman,

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:54.110
the local judge, a federal judge.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.880
All these men of the high rank
in the community standing tall,

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.800
standing proud in front
of this murdered man.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.220
And, so, I thought, you
know, that's the kind

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.300
of character I want to write about.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.510
And, I didn't -- I purposely
didn't choose it to be

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.530
about racial differences
because I feel

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:18.210
like as a southerner people
especially up north tend

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:23.140
to think racism only happens in the
south when it happens everywhere,

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.690
and so I didn't want that
to be Rusty's fatal flaw.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.360
I wanted his fatal flaw to be

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.620
that he thinks he's
right about everything.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.560 position:56%
And, to me that's a very destructive
belief for anyone to have.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.400
You know, he never
questions himself.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.330
He always thinks that
he's on the side of good.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.620
And, I talked to a lot
of different lawyers.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.380
You know, when I was going to
write the character of Rusty

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.870
because I thought, you know,

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:51.190
I write about a man named Will
[inaudible] in my usual books.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.530
And, I love being around
police officers.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.320
I love talking to medical
examiners and people who are

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.690
in the business of crime solving.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:05.600
And, everybody I think
understands the job of a prosecutor

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.050
because a prosecutor
puts away the bad guys.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:12.030
And, we watch Netflix and we
see the west Memphis three

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.520
and we see what happened in
making a murderer and all that

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.130
and we think oh, well, that's bad.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.110
Those are clearly bad prosecutors.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.290
And, we like to think that
they're an anomaly but they exist.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.580
They exist more often than
not especially in small towns

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.890
because it's an elected position.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.430
And many times a prosecutor
is incentivized

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.070
to appear tough on crime.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.890
Now, there's two reasons for that.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.390
One is, you know, they want
to keep getting elected.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.910
They want to keep their job.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.630
And, two is -- and this is
very understandable to me --

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.250
they don't want to let
someone go for doing a crime

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.120
and then have them commit
a more heinous crime.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.850
And, then people say
why did you let them go.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.380
Because everybody -- if it's
your cousin, or your son,

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.920
or your father, you want leniency.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.160
You want justice to be fair.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.830
But, if it's somebody
else's son or father,

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.170
you want them to have the
book thrown at them, right.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.100
I mean that's just human nature.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.770
So, I talked a lot of
different defense attorneys.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:18.040
And, I live in Atlanta and
we have a lot of athletes

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.920
who live there, a lot of musicians.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.260
Justin Bieber lives there
for what that's worth.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.410
You know, they tend to get in
trouble because they're not used

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:31.050 position:56%
to being called out for bad behavior
and so they get drug offenses or,

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.440
you know, they come and they play
a game in our Georgia stadium

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.640
and they end up being charged
with rape or they, you know,

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.850 position:56%
sometimes they murder people or they
get accused of murdering people.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.580
And, so, we've got some really
hot shot lawyers who deal

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.880
with those people, right.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.070
And, so I wanted to talk
to that kind of lawyer.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.270
And, I wanted to talk to the
kind of lawyer that helps people

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.990
who are basically without
any help, you know.

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:59.440
The thing about the justice
system is we don't spend lot

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.470
of money helping people
navigate their way through.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.540
I think lot of people probably saw

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.170
that 60 minutes episode a few
weeks back where there's one woman

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.570
in Mississippi who's in
charge of half the state

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.920
and she has over 500 clients.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.550
And, that's the one
person in Mississippi

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.840
who is representing people
who cannot afford a lawyer.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.540
So, you know, it makes
you think twice

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.790
about the criminal justice system.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.890
But, so, I wanted to talk to
both ends of the spectrum.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:33.080
And, this one woman I spoke to,
she worked with juvenile offenders

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:37.330
and then she later became a
judge in the juvenile courts.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.420
And, she said let me
tell you something.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.540
I had a kid many years ago,
and he was 16 years old,

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.770
and he had cut grass
and done chores and all

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.720
that since he was ten years
old to save up to buy a car.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.740
And, so his 16th birthday he bought
a car from somebody he didn't know.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.890
And, he was driving home and
he get caught speeding, right.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.640
So, the cop pulls him over.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.470
And the kids an idiot so
he mouths off to a cop

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.990
which you should never do.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.570
And, the cop pulls him out of
the car and searches the car.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:13.060
Well, he finds in the
glove box a bag of pot

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.360
that the kid had put in there.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.230 position:56%
And, then as he's searching the back
seat, he finds another bag of pot

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.590
that the previous owner had
left in there by accident.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.470
Kid had no idea it was back there.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.960
So, he went from being in
a little trouble to looking

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.560
at four years in big boy prison.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.840
And, if you're not a criminal
when you're go into prison,

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.450
you are when you come out.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.530
And, this woman said you know,
I had to talk to the prosecutor

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.640
and say look, this is a good kid.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.660
He did something really stupid.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.470
Let's talk about a
diversion program.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.960
He's got family support.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.470
He's doing well in school.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.400
Let's not ruin his life.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.410
And, she was able to negotiate him
being on probation until he was 18

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.030
and then it was expunged.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.970
If this kid had not had that
lawyer, he would of gone to prison.

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.610
He would of been in
prison for four years

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.090
and his life effectively
would of been over.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.230
You know, he had enough drugs
to justify a felony offense.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.860
And, if you're a felon in
Georgia, you can't vote.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.880
You can't qualify for housing
assistance or food assistance.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.070
You know, there are all sorts of
limitations that are put on you

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.870
after you serve your time.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.540
You're continually punished for it.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.540
And, there's really no
way to get out of it.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.790
So, she said to me that
is the point of my job.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:33.070
And, I thought well, that's
something I can understand,

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:36.660
so I'm going to make Charlie,
who is one of Rusty's daughters,

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.270
I'm going to make her that kind
of attorney who looks at her job

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.280 position:56%
as just levelling the playing field.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.510
But, then I had to talk to the
hot shot lawyers because I wanted

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:49.240
to get some idea of how these hot
shot lawyers depend these people

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.240
who I mean come on we all
know they're criminals right.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.190
And, so, I said to this guy

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:59.480
who had just gotten off some
extremely wealthy drug dealer

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.380
in Atlanta.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.410
There was footage of him shooting
a gun out the window of his car

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.290
and he hit someone in the shoulder.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:14.070
And, this person was okay but
the jury exonerated the shooter.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.020
That's how good this
lawyer is, right.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.720
And, I said to him okay,
well, how would you feel

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.280
if this guy gets off -- you
got this guy off and he turns

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.360
around and he does it again.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.970
And, this hot shot
lawyers said well,

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.300
you know what, it's not my job.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.500
It's the prosecutors job,
it's the police officers job.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.870
It's the forensics people,
it's the medical examiner.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.170
It's all of them.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:40.730
It is the state or the
federal governments job

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:42.780
to prove that he is guilty.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.980
So, that's not my fault
if they can't do that.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.890
And, I thought well, that's
why everybody hates lawyers.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:52.000
And, that's the kind of lawyer I
wanted to write about with Rusty.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.280
You know, and he'll take any case.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.020
He'll defend an abortion clinic
or he'll defend someone who wants

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.890
to bomb an abortion clinic.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.070
You know, he sees all sides

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.940
and he wants everyone
to have a great defense.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.790
And what he -- the one thing
that he is not is a good father

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:13.080
because he spends most of his
life trying to help other people

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.190
but he never turns around and
sees his daughter needs help --

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.280
his daughters rather need help.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.090
And, that all came out of a
conversation with Greg [inaudible]

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.860
who I don't thank in the book,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.370
but he should be glad
I'm mentioning him now.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.870
Does anyone have any questions?

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.690
I hope so.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:35.280
Oh, come on.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.590
My publicist is here.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.620 position:56%
She should have a question prepared.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.330
Why are you so young and beautiful?

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.720
Here. There you are.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.380
By the way, I love libraries also.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.250
When I was in my 50's I went
back for a Master's Inn it.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.550
Just for fun.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.940
But, I've got to admit, I have
never read a book of yours.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.030
And I have read a lot of books.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.830
So, I came today to hear
you so I'd say well,

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.600
do I want to read her books.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.450
And I do. You are wonderful.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:08.750
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter: Oh, thank you.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.350
&gt;&gt; Can you -- here's my question.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.320
Can you advise me where to start?

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.420
You have written so many.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.720
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter: Well, you know,

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.070
I really like my most recent
one, The Good Daughter.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:24.670
I'm not saying that because it's
the most expensive one out there.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.710
But, if you want to
just dip your toe in --

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:31.270
well, you'll probably go to
the library, it doesn't matter.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:35.590
The -- a couple of books ago, I
wrote a book called Pretty Girls.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.570
And, it's also about sisters.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.380
Three sisters which
one of them is dead.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.890
Which I said to my
sisters if you don't

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.560
like that, write your own book.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:52.240
But, I think that would probably
be a good one to start with.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.700
I should say I'm talking
about all this heady stuff,

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.000
but there's really lots of sex

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.760
and violence too so
if that's your jam --

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.210
&gt;&gt; I can deal with that.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.990
I've had three sisters.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.860
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter:
Oh, you know, yeah.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.780
No one else.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.010
Oh, there you go.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:14.320
&gt;&gt; Hi, I've read all of your books
through audio and I've heard this

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.600
from a couple different authors
as well, but I just wanted

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.440 position:56%
to hear your take on the performance
they do on the audio books?

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.740
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter: Well, the woman

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.060
who does my audio books
is Kathleen Early.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.090
And, I hope you like her.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:30.870
She's from Texas which is
not technically the south,

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.270
but I think she does
the accents really good.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:37.200
You know, it was really
a bono contention for me

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.810 position:56%
on my first audio books because they
would get these really well known

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:45.060
actress who were southern but
they would make my character sound

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.570
like someone had shaken a
trailer at a trailer park

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.130
and that's what fell out.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:55.390 position:56%
Because, you know, there's just -- I
say this knowing that Arkansas exist

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:58.370
and there's no way to get
rid of an Arkansas accent.

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:02.150
But you know, different education
levels denote different accents

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.450
and so she gets that.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.010
So, hopefully, you're enjoying her.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.320
I think she does a good job.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [inaudible]
got me on all the books.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.250
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter: Thank you.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:17.030
&gt;&gt; You know, I was so excited
when I saw you come to town it's

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:22.820
like I guess seeing Tina Turner
would be the only thing exciting

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.120
for me.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.450 position:56%
Anyway, are you making too much
money writing books to go on a trail

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.650
for comedy because you could
do stand-up I tell you.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.950
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter: Well, thank you.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.750
I appreciate that.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.080
[ Applause ]

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.380
Yes.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.450
&gt;&gt; So, I recently read
the late Pat Conroy's book

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.330
about reading and how
he got started.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.770
And, it's a fascinating book
how his mother read to him,

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.900
teachers that intervened in his
life, and how much he reads.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.230
I recommend that book to
anyone who hasn't read it.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:43:00.240
But, I'm curious in your life how
much you read and what you read.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.730
How do you decide what to read?

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:06.310
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter: You know, I read
anything that strikes my fancy.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.230
I read a lot of non fiction.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:11.060
I just read about the
[inaudible] uprising.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.930
I thought that was fascinating.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.620
I read a lot of the authors
who are here at the festival.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.050
Dianna [inaudible].

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.500
I love Lee Child.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.250
I have his new book at home.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.330
It's not on me so don't rush me.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.720
I just love reading.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.870
And, I spend a great
deal of time reading.

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.890
I think it's really important to
do that because the reason I want

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.210
to be a writer is I read
books and I loved them,

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.360
so it's a very important
part of my life.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:37.960
And, I'm kind of up there in age

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.210
so I can probably get
away with saying this.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.510
You look fabulous.

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.500
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter:
Oh, well, thank you.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.800
Anyone can say that actually.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.620
So, we have time for
one more question or.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.610
Fast, fast.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.800
&gt;&gt; Hello, I wanted to say
-- I'm from the south also.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.990
But, I wanted to say that I think
we have the same ninth grade

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.980
English teacher.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.220
You described her perfectly
and she did change my life.

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.350
And, I thank her for it every day.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:12.970 position:56%
But, you have such a wonderful sense
of humor and you are really funny.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:17.290
And, but your book seem
like pretty dark subjects,

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:19.350
and I'm just wondering
if you include

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:23.160
that wonderful sense
of humor in your books?

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.750
&gt;&gt;Karin Slaughter: Well,
I think they're funny.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:30.230
You know, the thing is most crime
writers are really laid back.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.420
It's the romance writers
you have to watch out for.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.640
And, I think it's because
we get it out on the page.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.080
You know, I mention Lee Child.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.410
Mike Connelly is a teddy bear.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.670
Jeff Deaver shows dogs.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:46.660
I mean, we're really mostly
just nice laid back people.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.980
But, you know, you read our
books and you think wow,

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.100
should you really be
out in the world.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:57.560
My answer is yes.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:10.110
Can we get this one woman here?

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.920
Nope, that's it.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.070
I'm sorry.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.870
Thank you.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:00.550
