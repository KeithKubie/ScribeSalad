00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.740
Inconsistent writes can result in forwarding loops or

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.925
security policy violations where traffic ends up going to

00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:09.395
parts of the network where it shouldn't go as

00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:12.650
a result of inconsistent switch state. The ability to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.980
respond to failures is orthogonal to consistency. A

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.160
flood of traffic at the controller technically involves problems

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.120
with reading state in a consistent fashion. But since

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.220
there also involves a step where the controller writes

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.720
state to the switches, while packets are still arriving at the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.890
controller, I would consider that answer to be correct as well.
