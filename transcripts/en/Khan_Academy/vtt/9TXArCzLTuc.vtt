00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.670
- [Instructor] Worried that her parents

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.340
would shoot through her plan
to go to college in Brazil,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.030
Marion told them after she
had already been accepted.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.440
Now, they underlined through

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.090
and this is a little bit
of a weird thing to say.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.760
Worried that her parents
would shoot through her plan

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.880
to go to college in Brazil.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.870
That kind of implies that
somehow they're reading the plan,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.170
they would read it really,
really fast somehow

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.980
or maybe they would
actually shoot something

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.320
through the actual, physical plan.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.290
I don't know but this is a weird phrase

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.340
and the way that it said it,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.220
it looks like she's
afraid that they would,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.780
that they wouldn't like
her plan to go to college

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.340
so that's why she waited,
to go to college in Brazil,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.630
so that's why she waited until
after she had been accepted

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.620
to tell them.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.640
So shoot through seems a little bit off.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.480
So worried that her parents
would shoot in her plan

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.450
to go to college in Brazil.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.380
Now, that's, what does it
mean to shoot in her plan?

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.330
So that seems weird.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.890
Worried that her parents
would shoot on her plan

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.040
to go to college.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.050
Well, that's also, how do
you shoot on something?

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.050
Now, I guess if shoot
had a different vowel,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.310
that might make some sense but anyway,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.643
that would be inappropriate but anyway,

00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:08.670
let's rule that one out.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.640
Worried that her parents
would shoot down her plan

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.500
to go to college in Brazil,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.710
Marion told them after she
had already been accepted.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.210
Well, that makes all
the sense in the world.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020
To shoot down a plan
would be to reject it,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.130
to say all the reasons
why it's not a good idea,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.330
why they're not going
to allow it to happen.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.580
So that makes complete sense

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.250
with the rest of the
context of the sentence.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.763
So I like that a lot, shoot
down her plan to go to college.
