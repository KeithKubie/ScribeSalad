[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: You
know, it's interesting,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.510
in learning about the
history of America,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.340
we take for granted
that we don't have

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.720
child labor in this country.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.710
But it's a relatively
recent idea.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.580
The protections that when
we take for granted now

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.610
in the United States
started 100 years ago,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.570
but they were ruled
unconstitutional,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.930
very interesting.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.730
And it wasn't until
the Depression

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.159
that it seems no
brainer restrictions

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.900
that we have on the misuse
of children in the workforce

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.210
became law.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.560
And even in the United
States, we today

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.900
have exemptions for things
like agricultural work.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.050
I was shocked to discover
that this problem exists

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.740
in the United States.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.560
What's interesting about
our Nobel Prize winner is,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.420
in addition to being a
truly great human being,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.170
he's one of the two Nobel
Prize winners in the Peace

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.620
Prize from India, and he's often
compared to the other, Mother

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.990
Teresa.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.710
That's what it takes, I think,
to serve the world in the way

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.030
that you have.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.510
And I thought it would be very
interesting to talk about what

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.120
the problem is, how we address
it, what Google can do to help,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.290
and all of that.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.290
There is one thing that
Google could do to help,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.610
which I don't think
you know, which

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.120
is that as of this
very moment, we

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.310
are announcing $150,000
donation to your charity to help

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.204
this in India and elsewhere.

00:01:37.204 --> 00:01:40.340
So congratulations.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.600
So that's a donation
from google.org

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.980
to sort of help along.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.220
The organization that
we know and we've

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.670
worked with that you've
built is fantastic.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.180
So maybe we could start
by, you're probably

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.770
the leader in fighting
against child exploitation,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.080
child slavery, all
that sort of stuff,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.290
I think for your
whole adult life.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.310
Maybe you can
define the problem,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.400
how big it is, where are
the pitfalls, those sorts

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.900
of things.

00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:15.350
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Thank you.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.560
And once again, I will thank
you for this new announcement.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.561
That's a surprise.

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:21.060
Thanks.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.280
We live in a world of
high speed internet

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.650
and globalization of technology
and science, information,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.570
knowledge, products, markets.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.500
And partly you should be
credited for that, the Google

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.955
and Google's people, in building
up a global knowledge village.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.440
But on the other hand, we
still have 168 million children

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.230
in full time jobs.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.770
85 million of them
are living and working

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.070
in most appalling
conditions, what

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.810
we call the worst forms of
child labor under the UN law.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.920
5 and 1/2 million children
are slaves, virtually,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.750
those who cannot move, those
who cannot change their jobs,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.140
and forced to work.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.800
And most of the cases
they're confined

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.090
to work places, in
mines, in quarries,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.080
at [INAUDIBLE], factories,
workshops, houses, restaurants,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.640
and so on.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.100
Children are sold and
bought like animals.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.560
If you allow, I will
tell you a short story.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.690
Some years ago,
we were organizing

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.460
a march against
child trafficking

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.320
for forced labor or slavery,
the South Asian march,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.470
involving India, Pakistan,
and Nepali children.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.470
And after the day long
awareness activities,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.170
we were just relaxing
after dinner,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.420
and I saw that a
group of children

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.670
were sitting and talking among
each other-- Indian, Pakistani,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.740
Nepali, Bangladeshi.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.690
And one of them
asked to other, that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.630
do you have any idea how much
money you have been sold for?

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.280
A girl said, I can't recall,
but maybe 5,000 rupees.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.560
That is something
about $80 or so.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.130
Then two other children
replied, oh, we

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.480
are even lucky that we have been
sold for 7,000 rupees, little

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.730
more, more than $100.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.745
And then another girl
stood up and said, oh, I

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:06.700
am even better
because I have been

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.940
sold many years ago
for 10,000 rupees.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.900
And then one of
the boys stood up

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.010
and asked four of them
that, can you recall,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.270
do you have any
idea that how much

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.290
is the prize of a buffalo
in your country, or a cow?

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.630
The buffalo was quite
common in South Asia.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.520
And they looked at each
other, and then one of them

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.100
replied, maybe 50,000 rupees.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.860
Another said, no, no.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.030
In my country, it's
about 100,000 rupees.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.875
I was listening,
and I was in tears.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.170
What are we talking about?

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.860
These children are comparing
with buffalo and cows.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.480
A buffalo is sold for
100,000 rupees and a girl

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.920
for 10,000 rupees, 10
times the buffalo's cost.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.655
We are not talking
about medieval slavery.

00:06:19.655 --> 00:06:22.430
We are talking about
the modern day slavery.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: I
think maybe everyone

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.096
is having the same reaction.

00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:28.369
How is this possible today?

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:29.910
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
It is the reality.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:41.760
And I would say that
the saddest commentary

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.890
on modern times in one sentence
is that child slavery still

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.260
exists.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.870
And this is possible because
we don't have enough political

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.430
will to control the systems.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.700
It is also because
of the social mindset

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.750
which does not
recognize and respect

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.230
the dignity of
childhood and dignity

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:13.110
of children, so social customs
and so on, cultural problems.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:21.940
Also, we have not been
able invested adequate

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.070
for our children.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.690
Look, only $18 billion
additional funding

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.920
is needed annually to bring all
children to school and educate.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.220
And that is less than a
week's military expenditure

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.050
of the world.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.050
We are not so poor.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.920
But even then, we are
not able to invest

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.870
enough on our children, on their
health, on their protection.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.120
We don't have
protective systems.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.140
That is also problem.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.205
So this combination of these
things keep on working.

00:07:58.205 --> 00:08:00.080
ERIC SCHMIDT: But there's
a whole convention.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.277
There's a set of laws.

00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:03.360
There's something called
the Internationally Labor

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.100
Organization, and rules.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.610
America, for example, with
exception of agriculture

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.260
has rules where you can't
be employed below 12.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.950
At 14, you can, but with
certain restrictions.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.480
At 16, you can, but with some
restrictions around danger.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.570
And at 18, you're
considered an adult.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.210
And I think that conforms
roughly with the rules.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.000
Is the problem that
they signed the law,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.375
and then they
don't implement it?

00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:28.074
Or did they just
not sign the law?

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.990
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Most
of them sign the laws.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.390
170 countries globally have
ratified the Convention

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.780
on Worst Forms of Child Labor.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.299
That means no child
shall be allowed

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.710
to work in hazardous
occupations in worst forms

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.460
up to the age of 18.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.450
But despite that, it goes on.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.790
As I said, 85 million
children are the victims

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.800
of worst forms of child labor.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.330
So one thing is moral
and legal accountability.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.780
Another thing is the serious
amount of political will

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.450
which is lacking.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.490
And thirdly, strong
civil society,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.235
because the politicians
act when there

00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:07.240
is a demand from their voters
or from the communities

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.620
and societies.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.480
And these children whom
we are talking about

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.100
are neither the
voters, or nor they

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.750
can influence the
politics of any country.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.900
So that's why it is very, very
important than the voices,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.030
strong voices should come
in favor of children,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.700
because children are not
able to speak for themselves.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:32.780
They are almost invisible,
most ignored and neglected.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.230
Civil society is not so
cohesive and strong that

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.390
can speak with
one voice and hold

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.100
the government accountable.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.630
Also, the business
is accountable,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.000
because businesses also
have very strong role

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.060
to play, especially when it
comes to the supply chain.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.820
Most of the products are
now which we are using,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.970
from [INAUDIBLE] to shoes,
and many more things,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.670
are produced by children in
different parts of the world,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.950
by the suppliers and the
local subcontractors,

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.360
petty contractors.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.220
So more transparency,
more accountability

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.590
in the entire supply chain
and the global business

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.820
is equally needed.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.680
So the combination of
those things are missing.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.340
ERIC SCHMIDT: You know, you
created this Save the Children

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.670
movement, and you're credited
with saving somewhere

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.310
between 60,000 and
100,000 children

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.800
from this sort of thing in
India and with many hundreds

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.260
of villages that you worked.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.970
What did you actually
do to make this happen?

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.030
Was it speaking?

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.890
Was it visiting?

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.400
How did you do it?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.430
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
Well, every day

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.430
when I come to my office
in South Delhi, in Kalkaji,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:49.470
almost every day, I find one,
at least, but sometimes more,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.420
parents are sitting and waiting
for my people and me to help.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.120
Whose children are missing?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.730
Whose children are
trafficked and sold?

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.370
They could not raise
those children.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.730
And they have no hope,
because they cannot easily go

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.490
to the police.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.610
The poor people in most of
the developing countries

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.480
don't have faith in
police, number one,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.120
and no confidence in police.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.980
Anyway.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.040
So they keep on waiting.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.500
So what we do, on
the basis of that,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.280
we do thorough investigation
about the clues they give

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.230
and the knowledge they give.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.860
Then we engage different
authorities-- police,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.650
magistrate, the
legal department.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.780
It is not so easy to coordinate
with different agencies,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.400
but we had to.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.470
And then be conducted
secret rescue operations.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.250
In that operation, we
don't inform anyone,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.440
even don't inform the
police the exact location.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.770
We say that in that
area, these children

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.850
are confined in the
factory or a mine,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.104
because it's always risky.

00:11:50.104 --> 00:11:51.270
I lost two of my colleagues.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.020
One was shot dead.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.106
One was beaten to death.

00:11:53.106 --> 00:11:53.980
ERIC SCHMIDT: Really?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.979
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Yeah.

00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:59.860
And I had my left foot
broken, my leg broken.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.730
My right shoulder is broken.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.250
My backbone has a lot
of bruises and scars.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.220
My head has scars.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.000
So these people are very
strong people, mafia.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.900
And if they come to know in
advance that we are going

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.200
to rescue children, then
they're prepared with arms

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.290
and become violent.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.580
So we have to be very,
very, very careful too,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:28.159
and very swift and secret to go
and do the rescue operations.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:30.200
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'm, sorry,
so you literally go in?

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.890
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
Very literally.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.260
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
rescue the child.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.350
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Yeah,
thousands of times.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.180
I have gone personally
thousands of times.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.190
I could not recall how many
times in the last 35 years.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.090
But right from the beginning,
I go, and my colleague go.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.800
And earlier, the police
was not so involved.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.210
But later on, when the high
courts and the Supreme Court

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.140
of India became quite
proactive and started

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.890
directing the
authorities and police

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.230
to help and to go in these
rescue operations, only

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.820
then they started going.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.520
So when we free
the children back,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.300
there are a lot of legal
formalities in terms of handing

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.620
them over to the parents.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.520
And then we bring those children
for rehabilitation centers.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.030
My organization runs three
rehabilitation centers,

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.750
one for girls and two for boys.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.160
And these children stay there.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:28.250
And we try to restore their
childhood and sense of freedom.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.820
But more importantly, we
build their self-esteem

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.790
so some of them can
become the leaders

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.660
and liberators for themselves.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:41.200
Some of my children came to
address the UN General Assembly

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.520
side meetings.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.420
Some of them have
addressed the Senate

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.580
and congressional
hearings in DC.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.480
Some of them have addressed
the European Parliament.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.480
So they have proven
that if they are

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.950
given the chance
and opportunities,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.787
they are no less than
anyone in the world.

00:13:59.787 --> 00:14:01.620
And they have shown
their leadership skills.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.453
ERIC SCHMIDT: And what
happens to the people

00:14:03.453 --> 00:14:06.470
who would enslave them?

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.360
KAILASH SATYARTHI: We have
strict laws on slavery

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.580
and human trafficking.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.510
So sometimes the problem is that
the civil society organizations

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.360
have no idea, and
sometimes they don't

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.900
have capacity to use the
laws, because, first off all,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.100
it is very risky.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.710
If you will use against
those mafias, legally.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.190
The softer approach is just to
take the help of authorities

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.030
and go and convince and take
the children out and send them

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.180
back home.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.000
That is not enough.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.270
But in my case, our
organization has

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.220
been working for the
enactment of laws,

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.540
for the enforcement of
laws, because if we rescue

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.100
these children under
the proper laws,

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.270
they would be entitled
for the rehabilitation

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.150
facilities and the governments.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.000
And their employers
would be arrested.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.210
Of course, in many cases,
employers run away.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.610
We cannot find them when we
go for rescue operations.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:03.930
But sometimes they are
caught, sooner or later.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.960
And then they are arrested.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.210
Of course, it's a very
cumbersome, very expensive

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:13.130
process to follow the
legal case in the court.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.330
And they are rich
and powerful people.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.060
They can go to higher court,
and then higher court.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.275
So it's difficult, but at least
there is some deterrent in it.

00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:25.570
ERIC SCHMIDT: Now, is every one
of these children illiterate,

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.070
essentially?

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.634
They've not been to school?

00:15:27.634 --> 00:15:29.800
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Some of
them have been to school.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.560
Many of them have
never been to school.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.430
Some of them are
registered in the schools,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.960
but they don't
attend the school.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.190
For instance, last year, we
have rescued 1,100 children

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.110
from Delhi itself, from
the capital of India,

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.720
with the help of
judiciary and police

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.590
in these rescue operations.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:52.600
And 850 out of
them were enrolled

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.180
in their native villages
in their schools.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.770
That means they were attending.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.740
All the datas
which were prepared

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.670
was that these children
were in schools.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.030
They were receiving a
stipend, and other facilities

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.900
of the government.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.830
And the local government
furnishes that information

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.690
to Indian Parliament.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.370
And the Indian government
furnishes that information

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.340
to UNESCO and other UN agencies.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.040
So they were attending
those things on paper,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.770
but they were enslaved,
and they were trafficked.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.720
So many of these children
are removed from schools

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.670
with the protection of better
life and better living,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.690
working conditions and so on.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.587
And these traffickers
are quite smart people.

00:16:38.587 --> 00:16:39.295
They move around.

00:16:39.295 --> 00:16:41.410
They identify certain areas.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.880
They engage the local
agents, subagents,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.250
and they successfully
bring the children

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.880
and sell them out
to different places,

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.346
including for child marriages,
or brothels, or other places.

00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:56.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: The
obvious question here

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.740
is, how much of this is sexual
exploitation of young men

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.130
and women, boys and girls?

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.782
And how much of it is
other forms of abuse?

00:17:07.782 --> 00:17:09.240
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
The sexual abuse

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.250
goes beyond the child labor or
child slavery or trafficking

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.859
issue, because sexual abuse
may occur inside the families

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.849
by some of the distant
relatives or in neighborhood,

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.829
in schools also sometimes.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.010
It is not very uncommon
in many of the developing

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.960
countries, the sexual
abuse in different forms.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:37.210
But when it comes to the
slavery and child labor,

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.420
commercial sexual exploitation
or child prostitution

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.030
is a very, very heinous crime.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.950
What else could be
worse than that,

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.320
sexual slavery for children?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.510
But when we compare with the
rest of the exploitative forms

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:58.970
of child labor and child
slavery, it's a small segment.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.690
I'm talking about
168 million children

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:08.060
in full time jobs, where
a few million children are

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.980
the victims of child sexual
exploitation as child slaves.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.590
But the newer forms are
evolving, like the pornography.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.670
The children are being used
for the pornographic proposes,

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.520
knowingly or unknowingly.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.110
They have no awareness
how they would be

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.750
used by the small smartphone.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.560
People who were
carrying a smartphone,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.290
they take the pictures,
they change the photo,

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.920
and then blackmail
the young girls.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.640
And that has become quite common
using this modern technology.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.630
So the awareness among
the youth and children

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.450
in schools and
colleges is very less,

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.870
that how to get rid of these
blackmailers and the people who

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.870
can manipulate their
pictures and so on.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:06.020
Also, the tracking about such
people is equally important

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.120
and how to address this problem
with the service providers,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.660
for instance, both in case
of the phone companies

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:20.890
as well as the websites
and other social media.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.070
These things are new
challenges in the exploitation

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.730
of children in modern times.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
important to address it.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.130
You're here in New York to visit
with United Nations, I believe.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.410
Tell us, how do you
actually do this at scale?

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.840
I understand you go in
and you rescue a child,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.550
very dangerous, and so forth.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.170
But with 168 million children
in this kind of situation,

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.572
you need a scalable approach.

00:19:52.572 --> 00:19:54.480
What's the best
way to start this?

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.440
You're talking to the UN
now about this, right?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.530
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Yeah.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.070
I have been to UN several
times, not the first time.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.850
I realized right
from the beginning

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:09.620
that rescuing 1 or 10 or
100 children is not enough.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.330
When I started in
1981, after giving up

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.210
my career as an electrical
engineer, it was very hard.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.800
Many of you must
have been genius.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.950
In those days, we did not
have the software engineering

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.530
or the computer sciences, so
I did not go to that course.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.580
So the most advanced was
electrical engineering.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.690
And one has to secure
very, very good marks

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.940
to get admission in electric
engineering in those days,

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.720
40 years ago.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:45.350
Anyway, so those days, we did
not have any law in India.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.500
The United Nations
systems did not

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.510
have any international
convention

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.460
on rights of children.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.830
It came into being
only in 1989 when

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.720
UN Convention on the
Rights of the Children

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.410
was adopted by the
international community.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.660
So it was a hard time.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.610
But we realized, I realized
that we have to fight for laws.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.140
Without that, we cannot.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.550
So we fought for it in 1985.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.210
We succeeded in '86.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.300
There was a new law in
India, the first time,

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.580
the Indian law against child
labor has been enacted.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.650
We knew it.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.155
Then be tried to link this
whole issue with education.

00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:24.850
Right from the beginning,
I was advocating

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.610
that eradication of child labor
and education for children

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.660
are the two sides of same coin.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.010
We have to ensure that the
government have good policies,

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.050
good programs, good investment
on education for children,

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.330
has preventive measures as well
as rehabilitative measures.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.630
Then we realized that it
is not an Indian problem

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.620
because many of the
multinational companies

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.270
are operating in India.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.840
All of the products
made in India

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.120
are sold in other
parts of the world.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.190
The global political policies
and economic policies

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.810
are also affecting children in
different parts of the world.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:04.850
So I had an idea to launch
a worldwide movement

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.690
against child labor
with a clear demand

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.520
that international
communities should

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.100
adopt a new international law
on worst forms of child labor.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.990
In 1989, we organized
a worldwide march,

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.550
a global march
against child labor,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.450
which went across 103 countries.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.530
We have covered 80,000 kilometer
distance, which is double

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.500
the periphery of the earth.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.240
And 71 heads of the nations--
presidents, prime ministers,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.970
kings, and queens--
joined or supported it.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.420
It had resulted in the
international legislation which

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.750
we are talking about now, this
worst forms of child labor law.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.610
Similarly, we
realized, I realized

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.180
that I'm freeing 10 children,
but another 20 or 30 children

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.300
are entering into
slavery, trafficked,

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.606
to work in carpet
industry in India.

00:22:56.606 --> 00:23:03.960
And I trusted in the
power of human compassion.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.220
And everybody has some
element of humanity.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.200
That was my belief.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.270
90% of the carpets produced
in India, and 95%, those days,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.310
produced in Pakistan
and Nepal, they

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.530
were sold to United
States and Germany

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.790
and other European countries.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.750
So an idea cropped up
in my mind that why

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.440
should I not go to the consumers
and launch the campaign

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.930
to educate them, not to call for
boycott of South Asian carpets,

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.250
but with an alternate,
with a solution,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.100
because I always
believe in solutions.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.270
Problems, one can talk hours
and hours and days and months.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.370
It's very easy to talk
about the problems,

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.680
but sometimes difficult.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.730
But solution is must.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:54.630
So I brought an idea that let
evolve a social monitoring

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:59.610
and labeling mechanism
through proper inspection,

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.860
transparent and professional
inspection mechanism,

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.600
running numbers of the carpet,
the code numbers and so

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.980
on, which can guarantee
that this particular rug is

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.800
free of child labor
in South Asia.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.660
So that was the
first social labeling

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:20.840
introduced when the [INAUDIBLE]
corporate social responsibility

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.880
was not coined.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.830
It was not invented.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.190
Before CSR, we had
a successful story

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.590
to tell about the
carpet industry.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.240
And the number of
child laborers,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.890
according to various studies,
including the US Department

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:40.060
of Labor, those days in
mid '90s, was 1 million

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.120
in India, Pakistan, and Nepal.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.070
And the latest figures
suggest that it

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.900
is no more than 200,000.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.270
So there was a
significant decrease

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.970
in the number of child
laborers in carpet industry.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.870
And as a result, we can
find job opportunities

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.730
to 800,000 adult people
in place of children,

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.150
because the quantity of
carpet did not fall down.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.310
It is even more.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:12.840
So many more adults could
find job in place of children.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.110
So that was one thing.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:19.950
ERIC SCHMIDT: So when you talk,
it sounds like this problem--

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.940
and you've done
your work in India--

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.300
but it must be a
pretty global problem.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.740
So it's a problem in India.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.722
It's a problem in Southern Asia.

00:25:27.722 --> 00:25:28.930
That's a problem in Pakistan.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.832
Where else is it a problem?

00:25:30.832 --> 00:25:32.540
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
It's a global problem.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.310
As you mentioned, that there's
a problem in United States

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.640
as well.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.710
In the West Coast, we have
children, Hispanic children

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.460
still working in agriculture,
farms, and other places,

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.015
and sweatshops also
in some places.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.710
I started in India.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.725
Then I realized that it
is a South Asian issue,

00:25:53.725 --> 00:25:55.760
so I started working
in Pakistan, Nepal,

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.180
and Bangladesh.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.120
And then, after the
global march in 1998,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.530
we built a worldwide platform,
or worldwide coalition

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:10.480
of civil society organizations,
teachers unions, trade unions,

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.750
some of the businesses,
and brought them

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.500
in one platform, that is Global
March Against Child Labor.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.400
We kept the name intact.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.980
So we work in more than 100
countries, practically, now.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.430
We have our regional
offices and coordinators

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:29.760
in South Africa, Central
Africa, East Africa,

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.310
similarly southern
part of America,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.450
and Central America,
and North America,

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:40.510
similarly in Asia, South Asia,
and Southeast Asia, Europe.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:46.100
So we work through 2,000
partners across 144 countries,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.390
to be precise.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.910
But some of them are
dormant and not so active.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.570
But about 100
countries are active,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.380
where we can raise
the collective voice.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.220
ERIC SCHMIDT: So I
think what we should

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.920
do is we should go to the
questions from the audience.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.346
And we also have
an internal system

00:27:01.346 --> 00:27:02.970
which we called Dory,
which has already

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.867
submitted a few questions.

00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:06.700
So I'll ask the first
question, and maybe we

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.824
can have people who have
comments or questions come

00:27:08.824 --> 00:27:10.280
to the microphones.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.540
First question on the Dory
is, "In India, we often

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.660
see children from poor
backgrounds working

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.490
in roadside shops,
factories, and mines.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.540
They and their parents
often support this,

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.800
saying that if their
children don't work,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.300
they won't have enough
money to eat food.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.565
What is your answer
to this argument?"

00:27:27.565 --> 00:27:28.940
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
First off all,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.040
the children who are
working in the street,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.640
restaurants, or whatever,
mines, they are not

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.970
responsible for poverty.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.220
Somebody else is responsible.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.840
This is the moral issue.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.240
Who will take the
responsibility of poverty?

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.140
Why children should
take the responsibility

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.751
on their shoulders,
to carry it on?

00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:50.750
And they will remain poor
for all of their life.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.070
They will remain illiterate.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.720
They will remain sick
while working as child.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.900
This is moral.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.960
But the economic argument
is that, globally, we

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.180
have 168 million children,
as I said, in full time jobs,

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.710
and 200 million
adults are jobless.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.690
There are many studies
in several countries

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.150
which have proven that
there is a parallel

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.950
between adult unemployment
and child labor.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.680
And also, most of these
children who are looking

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.920
are the very children
of those parents

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.750
who don't find jobs for
more than 100 days a year.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.351
So that becomes
a vicious circle.

00:28:33.351 --> 00:28:35.850
Children are preferred in jobs
because they are the cheapest

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.650
source of labor,
sometimes free labor,

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.530
if they are bonded labor.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.210
Adults have to be
paid more money.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.440
Adults would work only
8 hours or 10 hours.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.270
Children are going to work
for 14 hours, 18 hours.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.760
They will sleep and work in
those smaller restaurants,

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.730
street side restaurants,
but the adults won't.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.580
So we have to break
this vicious circle,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.225
and that understanding has
to be broadened and deepened.

00:29:00.225 --> 00:29:01.600
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Obviously educating

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.724
them will also help, right?

00:29:02.724 --> 00:29:05.137
Because they will become
more educated adults

00:29:05.137 --> 00:29:06.970
and have higher paying
jobs and all of that.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.570
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Absolutely.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.653
We are living in the age
of knowledge economy now.

00:29:09.653 --> 00:29:12.960
We cannot think of any
sort of social justice,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.890
we cannot think of economy
growth of a society or getting

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.320
rid of personal poverty
without education,

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.400
and not only education.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.630
Good quality education is must.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.220
And access to the most
advanced knowledge is

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.040
must to be empowered and
to be the equal partners

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.915
in the globalization.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: First question.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.290
Thank you for coming.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.570
As consumers who maybe
don't know a whole lot

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.540
about this issue, or don't know
where to find out information,

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.410
what do you think that we
can do in terms of voting

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.739
with our dollars, or any other?

00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:50.780
Can you just look at a
tag on a piece of clothing

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.410
or a sticker on an item
and know whether or not

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.922
it was made with child labor?

00:29:56.922 --> 00:30:01.210
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Well, this
is a very, very important

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.260
question.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.860
I try to find answer at least
in rug industry with this label.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.390
So if you go to buy a carpet--
which is not so often.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.870
You don't go to a buy
a carpet every day.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.850
But definitely the people
go to buy shoes and clothes

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.910
quite often, or the
sporting goods, or toys

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.380
for the children.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.980
Unfortunately,
there is no credible

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.150
labeling system of
certification so far.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:35.780
One of my future objectives
is to introduce not exactly

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.460
the same child labor free label,
but some sort of child friendly

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:45.016
labeling system, where the
companies who are committed

00:30:45.016 --> 00:30:49.220
to certain things,
certain criterias,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.280
including no child
labor, zero tolerance

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.040
to exploitation of children,
helping in education,

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.140
helping in health
care for children,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.960
and also involving in
engaging supply chain,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.100
building capacity, and
holding the supply chain

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.880
accountability,
then we can think

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.760
of introducing some
sort of certification

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.340
or some labeling where the
people can get something

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.890
better, not with 100%
guarantee that there's

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:21.990
no child labor involved.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:27.440
But if the processes
are properly controlled,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.570
then more chances that
there is no child labor.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:35.200
Because when we go to do
the inspection at ground,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.640
we need hundreds of thousands of
inspectors for garment industry

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.140
alone.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.810
Garment industry is some
of the very common thing,

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:48.100
and which highly
depend on supply chain

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.130
and the local subcontractors.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.330
So you need a parallel
inspection system

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.950
then the government
inspection system.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.680
So we have to see that how
we can hold the government

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.670
inspectorate system more
accountable and more active,

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.900
rather than creating
a parallel system.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.530
But those companies
who pledge to take

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.370
certain measures-- and we
can check those measures time

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.460
to time.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.060
We can think of some
label, some sort of label

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.505
of being child friendly.

00:32:15.505 --> 00:32:16.880
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Another question we

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.160
have from our remote
audience, "How can individuals

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.159
get involved in fighting
for children's rights?"

00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:25.200
In other words, obviously
people care about this.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.070
How do they make a difference?

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.820
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
First of all, everybody

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.399
has to be friendly to his
own child, spend some time.

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:37.565
ERIC SCHMIDT: Start at home.

00:32:37.565 --> 00:32:39.856
KAILASH SATYARTHI: We are
all busy with our own careers

00:32:39.856 --> 00:32:40.860
and our own lives.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.590
Start with home.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.200
Start with oneself.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.150
Be friendly to your
brothers and sisters.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.030
If you are living
with them, it's fine,

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.660
otherwise you can use
the modern techniques.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.920
Google is here.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:58.630
So you are the people who can do
some Google Talk, or whatever.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.370
So that is another possibility.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.930
But to spend some time,
be friendly, respect them.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.220
Listen to the children.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.760
That could be the beginning.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.370
And then the second thing
is that you are connected

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.650
with the [INAUDIBLE] knowledge.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.380
And once you get to
know that in some place,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:21.130
somewhere there is a systemic
violation of child rights,

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:24.010
and the children are
denied childhood,

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.380
you can simply
react to it by just

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.850
pushing some of your
fingers on your computer,

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.080
on your mobile phone.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.090
Raise voice.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.410
Break the silence.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.010
By taking simple
measures, you can

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.190
be the part of bringing
about the change in the lives

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.000
of those children, and creating
more child friendly world

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.860
and respecting child rights.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.730
Some of you, or many
of you can really

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:54.740
help in devising new
apps or new ways which

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.130
can be very helpful to
connect to the people

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.130
in terms of awareness
building, in terms

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.940
of engaging the young people.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.740
Like him who was
asking what to do,

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.930
one can put some
[INAUDIBLE] on a Google app.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.580
You can create some apps
to Android or whatever.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.680
And I can't do it, actually.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.429
I have my limitations,
because those days,

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:13.679
there was nothing like Google.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: You are
an electrical engineer.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.840
We expect you to be a program.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.060
KAILASH SATYARTHI: But
I have my own limits.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.560
And you guys are not only
sitting on enough knowledge

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.580
and creating [INAUDIBLE], but
you are the brightest brains,

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.670
really, in the world.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.960
I am sitting here and
feeling so delighted

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.020
amidst you as the
brightest brains who

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.080
can bring about a lot
of changes in the world

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.330
through technology, and
through [INAUDIBLE] technology

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:45.320
in particular, and creating
new ways of engaging people,

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.290
giving them a feeling that
they're also partners of change

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.560
by just clicking some button.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.310
They can stand for the
rights of children,

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.268
or something like that.

00:34:53.268 --> 00:34:53.870
I don't know.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:58.190
But that leave up
to you to think.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.890
You have a lot of
innovation programs.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.300
And I am so curious
to do something.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.040
I highly depend on Google.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.800
Let me tell you, Eric,
one thing, that the day

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.830
when the Nobel Peace Prize was
announced, I was on my computer

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.890
and googling one thing.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.690
I was trying to find it
cheaper ticket for me

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.990
to visit to Germany.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.470
So I thought that the
Google is the right answer

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:26.620
to find me a cheap
ticket to visit Germany.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.520
And I found some good answers.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.340
Then suddenly, some
journalist called me up.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.210
He was an Indian journalist.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:41.490
It was daytime.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.880
And he said,
[NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE] Nobel

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.030
Prize.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.757
[NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE]
is some sort of respect,

00:35:48.757 --> 00:35:50.590
to pay some respect,
[NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE].

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.300
[NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE]
Nobel Prize.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.840
He was so excited because I was
the first Indian born Indian

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.870
to receive the Nobel Prize.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:02.100
And I was standing in the
league of Mother Teresa.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.050
So he was so excited, so
he said half sentence.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:10.010
So I thought that he's
asking for some response

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.240
or some reaction from me.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.830
Somebody might have got
the Nobel Peace Prize,

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.900
and I thought that it might have
been declared in the morning.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.410
So I thought the best way
to find is the Google.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:24.780
I shifted myself from
one Google search

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.010
and opened the new window
for a new Google search.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.551
I don't want to miss
my cheap ticket.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.480
So I was looking, and
I started googling.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.410
But I was a little
upset, frankly speaking,

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:43.520
because I was just
printing "Nobel Peace Prize

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.820
2015," and that time
it was appearing 2014.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.780
And it was a matter
of a few seconds.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.860
It will not even one
minute, actually.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.130
He got the message, because
it was being announced.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.940
It was still going on in Norway.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.392
And this journalist was fast.

00:37:00.392 --> 00:37:03.190
And I was a little
upset, that I always

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.580
try to find answers to
every single question, right

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.850
my health, to my acidity to
everything through Google.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.980
And I could not find answer to
give it to this journalist who

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.435
got the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:37:15.435 --> 00:37:21.570
And he was clever, with no time,
it appeared on your screen.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.010
And also, some of my
friends came from downstairs

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.000
in my office and
hugging and kissing.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.290
But it was there in few seconds.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: This is why
we work at Google, guys.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.613
This is it.

00:37:37.613 --> 00:37:40.394
KAILASH SATYARTHI: And this
is why I am sitting here

00:37:40.394 --> 00:37:43.050
and and want to work
more with Google.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.390
And I'm so happy you were
able to simultaneously

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.070
be awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize and get a cheap ticket.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.370
using Chrome.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.156
OK, go ahead.

00:37:55.156 --> 00:37:57.810
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
that child exploitation is

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.534
a global problem, obviously.

00:37:59.534 --> 00:38:01.450
But I think there's this
notion that, well, it

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:04.930
happens in India, Pakistan,
maybe Nigeria, elsewhere.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:08.180
How much of a problem is it
here in the United States,

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.190
and is it happening
right outside our door?

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.390
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Well,
as mentioned before,

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:23.410
that many of the children who
are working in tomato or potato

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:27.440
farms, many of the children
who are working in oranges,

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:35.450
orange farms, in the West Coast,
some of them, or many of them

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:36.500
or Hispanic.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.790
They are Haitian.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.570
They are Mexican children.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.870
And their passports
are controlled

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.760
by their contractors, and so on.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.920
So they are working as child
laborers in this country.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.940
But you cannot compare the
problem with the children

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.240
in South Sudan or children
in Pakistan or some parts

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.510
of India, children
in Afghanistan,

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.100
those who are the victims
of multiple problems.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.920
They have to face systemic
violence, suicidal violence,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.305
economic violence, and so many
other things, sexual violence.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.400
So that is the problem.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.010
But we know that in
sub-Saharan African countries,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.450
this problem is more acute.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:31.500
In South Asia, also a
serious problem, but a little

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.790
bit improvement.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.609
In Central America,
we have some problems,

00:39:35.609 --> 00:39:36.900
and different kind of problems.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.640
Like, in Central
America, the problem

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.870
of commercial sexual
exploitation, child

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:47.130
prostitution, below
the age of 18,

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.920
girls are being used
for this, prostitution,

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.910
this is a serious problem.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.490
In Southeast Asia, the
sexual exploitation

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.090
is another serious problem in
comparison to forced labor.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.580
South Asia, forced labor,
or traditional labor,

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.520
where the children are born
and grew up in those families

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.060
where the parents
or grandparents have

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.780
borrowed money from the
grandparents of the landlords

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.330
in the agriculture sector,
or the stone minors.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.112
That is a serious
problem, what we

00:40:19.112 --> 00:40:20.570
call the
intergenerational slavery,

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.200
or intergenerational
bonded labor system.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:29.280
So it varies from place to
place because of the traditions,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.074
also because of the structures
of the society, then so on.

00:40:33.074 --> 00:40:34.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: As I
mentioned, in the US,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.680
there's an agricultural
carve out for this.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.107
The steps stones are
no labor below 12,

00:40:40.107 --> 00:40:42.194
14, 16, and 18 in the US.

00:40:42.194 --> 00:40:43.860
But there are exemptions
in agriculture.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.670
And there's a set of people
who are, for example, trying

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:50.210
to stop children working
on tobacco farms because

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.100
of the exposure to
carcinogens and so forth.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.320
Obviously an issue
for adults as well.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.820
It strikes me as
this is just a bug.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.780
This needs to get fixed.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.680
There's no scenario in
the US where we need

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.100
to allow the sort of thing.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.920
It must be a holdover
from an ancient time.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.920
Yes, ma'am.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.884
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
in, or at least

00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:12.300
in the carpet industry, a, lot
of the buyers were foreign.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.060
I imagine it's similar
for, especially,

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.720
garments and other things.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.430
And I was wondering if the
countries that you know

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.080
are probably importing a
lot of these goods made

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:28.460
with illegal labor, if they've
taken any measures to bar

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.030
the import of goods with
kind of questionable origins?

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:36.360
And if so, have those
been successful or not?

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.480
There's probably
barriers to doing this

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.810
that I'm too naive to
think of right now.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.525
And I was just kind of wondering
if there's been any success,

00:41:43.525 --> 00:41:46.110
or what the situation is
from a policy perspective

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:50.170
from the countries that
are importing these goods.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.170
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Yeah.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.890
At least in United States,
there is a specific law

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.350
to deal with the forced labor,
child labor, and bonded labor.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:04.900
And the Department of Labor
produces a frequent report.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.570
It's, I think, four yearly
or three yearly report which

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.110
is brought, and they
name the industries

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.730
in countries which
involve child labor

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:16.480
and try to negotiate
and pressurize

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.820
the countries of import,
as well as the industries.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.970
But the blanket ban on any
industrial or any country

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:27.140
is not going to
solve the problem.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.210
There are other ways
to deal with it,

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:33.730
as I've mentioned before, that
how to engage the suppliers

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:37.660
and supply chain, how to create
more protective environment

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:42.080
for children, how to invest
more on education for children

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.650
in those communities,
how to raise

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.280
the consciousness in
the communities itself,

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.250
because communities
and parents themselves

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.040
could be the very best
protector of those children.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.280
They can be involved in it,
which is normally not done.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.370
So awareness building and
consciousness raising,

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:07.700
engagement of the suppliers
and the subcontractors,

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.530
building their capacity,
sensitizing them is important.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:16.860
Equally important to form the
multi-stakeholders initiative,

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.550
where the governments,
if possible,

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.830
but the businesses,
the civil society

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.420
organizations,
community organizations,

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:31.020
religious groups, the
teachers, the faith leaders

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.145
can come together and help
in finding the solution.

00:43:34.145 --> 00:43:35.630
And of course, the
representatives

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.920
of the subcontractors
and suppliers

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.310
should also be brought into
account so that everybody

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.200
can work hand in hand.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.250
So wherever we have
been able to find

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.750
some sort of
multi-stakeholders initiative,

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:50.410
we have seen some
positive results.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.560
But that has to trickle
down at local level.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:58.941
It should not remain an
international stakeholders

00:43:58.941 --> 00:43:59.440
initiative.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.820
It should go down at district
level, or state level, country

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.530
level.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.940
And that process, this
is not just one go thing.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.340
It's an ongoing
process for education,

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.570
and making the
people responsible

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.123
and eventually accountable.

00:44:13.123 --> 00:44:13.956
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:15.122
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK, thank you.

00:44:15.122 --> 00:44:16.084
Yes, go ahead.

00:44:16.084 --> 00:44:17.500
AUDIENCE: You spoke
briefly before

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.867
about deterrents
that are in place.

00:44:19.867 --> 00:44:21.950
I was hoping you could
elaborate a little bit more

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.250
about the deterrents in
place, where you think

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:29.750
they might be falling short
on the social, economic, legal

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.590
levels, and looking
at it not just

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:36.124
from within Southeast
Asian countries, globally,

00:44:36.124 --> 00:44:38.290
but the local levels, like
you were just mentioning.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.700
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Actually,
the laws are important.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.350
But they are like the
tools, or the weapons.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:57.150
Somebody should use those tools
at the right time, right place.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:59.330
And that education
and that capacity

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.690
is needed when we talk of law.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:07.400
Then the more important
is creating awareness

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:14.120
in the society and holding
the stakeholders more morally

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.140
accountable and
socially accountable.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.800
The accountability is
something which is missing.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:25.100
And accountability should be
evolved as a culture, not just

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.230
as an imposition,
legal imposition

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.390
that you have to show it.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:32.950
Combination of both would
be the best ideal situation,

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:37.800
where the businesses and
other institutions, including

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.730
the government should be held
accountable if they're not

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.240
properly enforcing their laws.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.079
But on the other
hand, everybody should

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:47.120
feel morally accountable.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.480
I think the moral
accountability is

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:56.311
most effective and sustainable
than any other legal system.

00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:57.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:58.740
Why don't we have our
last two questions

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.800
right here on the left.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.450
Go ahead.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.720
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.560
You mentioned that one of the
reasons that child labor is

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.660
favored, obviously, is
that it's much cheaper.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.030
Children will work
for much longer days.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.580
Whereas an adult might only
work for eight hours a day,

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.170
or something like that.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:17.330
So there's a clear
economic incentive.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.580
Do you think that
part of the problem

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.170
might be over-regulation
of adult labor?

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.740
That's clearly a very
tough position to take,

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.990
but at the same time,
there must be some way

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:30.000
that we can make the economic
incentive of choosing

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.100
child labor less favorable
for those companies.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.040
So do you think
it's in deregulation

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.224
of other types of labor?

00:46:37.224 --> 00:46:38.640
Or do you think
there's other ways

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.180
to close the gap of
making the incentive less?

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.110
KAILASH SATYARTHI:
Actually, using child labor

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:50.730
is illegal in most countries.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:56.100
So when they go for
employing child labor,

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.560
they already do some
illegal activity.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.520
But by way of
employing children,

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.040
they can save lot of
money as black money.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.580
On paper, most of these
people spent, 30%, 40%,

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.180
50% of the production
cost as labor cost

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.530
that is shown on paper.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:16.220
But practically, they
spend only 2%, 3%

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.200
by feeding them or keeping them.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.320
Sometimes if they
give [INAUDIBLE],

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.960
it would go up to 5%
of the total production

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.020
cost, the labor component.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.300
But the rest of the money
goes as black money.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:37.580
And that black money propels
corruption and breaking

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.380
the laws.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.000
So the people keep
on breaking the laws.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.840
On the other hand,
the labor laws

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:53.450
are not really so different
in most of the countries.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:57.540
In case of agriculture
labor, across the globe,

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.200
but mainly in
developing countries,

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.435
not properly implemented in
agriculture sector, no labor

00:48:03.435 --> 00:48:04.870
law, properly.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:11.730
Like, the minimum wage
and safety majors,

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.755
they're not enforced.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.550
It is also a big,
big [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:22.880
that how the very basic
labor laws in relation

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.850
to minimum wage and
protection of workers

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:31.190
is properly enforced,
which is not yet done.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.490
Only a few percent of people are
unionized, those who can fight.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:38.210
And they are clever to fight for
much better conditions, better

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:39.730
wages, and so on.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.330
But the rest of the
people who are not

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:49.700
unionized yet and living in
informal or unorganized sector,

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.220
they are not even getting the
benefits of the existing laws.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.980
More important is to, first off
all, have good laws in relation

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:03.100
to child labor and
effective implementation.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.220
And secondly,
investment on education

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.350
is preventative measures.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.160
The answer lies in
education, basically.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.186
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:14.186 --> 00:49:17.050
ERIC SCHMIDT: Why don't
you have the last question.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.950
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering, you

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:22.350
mention about how you save all
these children from slavery,

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:26.160
and also measures
on how to get buyers

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.990
to stop buying the carpet
to prevent the income.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.960
But where do these children go?

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.320
Because their families
are still in poverty.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.760
They still have to work.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.180
Is there any measures to make
sure they get educated instead?

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.120
Where does the money from?

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.230
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Yeah.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.380
There are many social
protection programs

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.440
for children in many countries.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.220
For instance, in India, we
have very strong measures

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.030
for rehabilitation of children
who are free from bonded labor.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.610
That is the part
of legal system.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:02.730
In Brazil, we have
very strong laws.

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:06.130
In Philippines, there are
some strong schemes for that.

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.960
There are many countries.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.080
So those schemes have
to be properly enforced.

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.280
That is, again, a
challenge, also, because

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.650
of weak coordination
among agencies,

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:26.520
also because of
weak civil society,

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:29.800
or incapable civil society to
raise their voice strongly.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:35.200
It goes on, no accountability.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.810
In case of carpet
you raised, I did not

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:41.040
call for the total boycott
of South Asian carpets.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.810
I called for the child
labor free carpets.

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.730
So the people should demand
child labor free carpet.

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:51.190
Calling for boycott of
anything is an easy thing.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.510
But it did not work anywhere
in the world on any issue,

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.520
because people eventually
need those things.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.530
If I called for boycott
of, say, apparels or shoes,

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:01.670
it's not going to work.

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.430
Maybe some people,
sentimentally or emotionally,

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:08.572
ideally, they can be engaged
for a few days, or a few months,

00:51:08.572 --> 00:51:10.030
or a few years,
but eventually they

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.210
will go to buy the product.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:17.690
So I was proposing that
consumers should demand a child

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:20.100
labor fee carpet.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.640
And I have to find the answer.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.930
Of course, I took advise
from many good minds

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.420
that how we can evolve a full
fledged monitoring and labeling

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.170
system so that consumers
can find the solution.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:38.750
These children who
were withdrawn,

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:42.860
they created jobs
for adult people.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.580
And the adult people were not
imported from other countries.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.022
All those adult people
were found locally.

00:51:50.022 --> 00:51:51.230
And they could find the jobs.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:56.140
So the parents were able to get
better employment opportunities

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.390
in place of children.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:59.070
And these children
went to school.

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.210
If they're not working
as child laborers

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:03.520
and there's no other job
opportunities for them

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.420
in that local area
of carpet production,

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.150
then they have gone to school.

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:10.350
And we did a regular followup.

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.820
We have devised certain
databases, certain tracking

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.280
systems.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.460
And most of the
children whom we free,

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.730
right from the
identification and rescue

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.280
operations to legal actions to
rehabilitation and education

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.020
followup and so on,
that is also not enough.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:31.990
And that's why in the future
I would love to learn and take

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.790
advice and cooperation
from Google

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:38.360
to help us in devising
more concrete tracking

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:43.510
systems, monitoring systems,
beside some kind of app

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.230
of engaging people, which
I was suggesting before.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:47.684
Could be opportunities.

00:52:47.684 --> 00:52:49.225
ERIC SCHMIDT: So as
you know, we have

00:52:49.225 --> 00:52:52.610
had some meetings with you today
to talk about this precisely.

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:56.010
But what I would say is
that you were very kind

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:58.365
in your description
of us, but I think you

00:52:58.365 --> 00:53:00.630
are the one who has courage.

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.951
I think you can see
what it takes to change

00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:05.200
the world in the way you have.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.760
I think we admire you.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.480
We admire what you
did personally,

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.280
the risks you've taken,
and the many, many things

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.840
you will do for the next
decades in saving children.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.402
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:53:16.402 --> 00:53:17.610
KAILASH SATYARTHI: Thank you.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:18.510
My pleasure and my honor.

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:19.110
Thank you.

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:30.260
