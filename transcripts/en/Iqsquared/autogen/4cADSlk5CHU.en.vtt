people who are in that conversation can
use both those languages so I think

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940
use both those languages so I think
 

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.690

separately and that's the way I conclude

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280
separately and that's the way I conclude
 

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.700

the book with the kind of appeal to to

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:54.710
the book with the kind of appeal to to
 

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:57.670
the book with the kind of appeal to to
hierarchy so I think there is a

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680
hierarchy so I think there is a
 

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.160
hierarchy so I think there is a
tremendous amount there for us to digest

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:00.170
tremendous amount there for us to digest
 

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.290
tremendous amount there for us to digest
this evening I will say that you really

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:02.300
this evening I will say that you really
 

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.750
this evening I will say that you really

Ferguson's last point do you think

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:01.700
Ferguson's last point do you think
 

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.140
Ferguson's last point do you think
networks generally are corrosive of

democracy in that they're not
 

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.540
democracy in that they're not
accountable or are they actually very

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:09.550
accountable or are they actually very
 

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.640
accountable or are they actually very
democratic or can they be both at the

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:12.650
democratic or can they be both at the
 

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.859
democratic or can they be both at the
same time excellent and let's take a

00:54:14.859 --> 00:54:14.869
same time excellent and let's take a
 

00:54:14.869 --> 00:54:17.440
same time excellent and let's take a
third one and then go to the go to go

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:17.450
third one and then go to the go to go
 

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.000
third one and then go to the go to go

networks have a particular importance as
 

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:27.609
networks have a particular importance as
in the smaller the network the rate of

00:54:27.609 --> 00:54:27.619
in the smaller the network the rate of
 

00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:29.620
in the smaller the network the rate of
the premium of the network the people

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:29.630
the premium of the network the people
 

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.359

they can know each other they can act as
well more effectively so for example in

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:36.470
well more effectively so for example in
 

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.260
well more effectively so for example in
the 19th and 20th century the labor

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:38.270
the 19th and 20th century the labor

smaller and more organized they could
 

00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:54.190
smaller and more organized they could
win in the end great questions each and

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200
win in the end great questions each and
 

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.790

every one I'll take them

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800
every one I'll take them

features of large networks that I

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:05.340
features of large networks that I
 

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:07.420
features of large networks that I
mentioned was the tendency for them to

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:07.430
mentioned was the tendency for them to
 

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:11.480
mentioned was the tendency for them to
self segregate into clusters the idea

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:11.490
self segregate into clusters the idea
 

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:13.070
self segregate into clusters the idea
that we'll all just be one big global

well do we have another number going on
there yes number one okay go ahead I was

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:00.940
there yes number one okay go ahead I was
 

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.690
there yes number one okay go ahead I was
just wondering if you think networks

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:03.700
just wondering if you think networks
 

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.700
just wondering if you think networks
have become more fickle in this day and

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:05.710
have become more fickle in this day and
 

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:06.870
have become more fickle in this day and
age it's very easy to follow and

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880
age it's very easy to follow and
 

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.460
age it's very easy to follow and
unfollow someone in Twitter and if

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:08.470
unfollow someone in Twitter and if
 

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:09.990
unfollow someone in Twitter and if
that's had any more significant

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000
that's had any more significant
 

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.670
that's had any more significant
behavioral impacts on society

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680
behavioral impacts on society
 

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.650
behavioral impacts on society
thank you much excellent question let's

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:13.660
thank you much excellent question let's
 

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.090
thank you much excellent question let's
take one more in this round number two

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:15.100
take one more in this round number two
 

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.010
take one more in this round number two
right here go ahead you said earlier

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:17.020
right here go ahead you said earlier
 

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.930
right here go ahead you said earlier
that smaller networks are not as

they started off and then it basically
 

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:36.660
they started off and then it basically
spread out at that small network

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:36.670
spread out at that small network
 

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:39.030
