00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:02.998
(lively music)

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.070
- Getting ready for labor is exciting

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.750
and can be intimidating.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410
By learning what to expect,
you'll feel more empowered

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.210
during your experience.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.870
Here at UC San Diego you will
labor in the same private room

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.260
that you'll deliver in.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.330
You may choose who you
would like to stay with you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.740
during your labor and delivery.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.020
During flu season children
may be asked to remain

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.670
off the labor and delivery floor.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.600
When you first arrive
at labor and delivery,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440
you will be evaluated
in a triage room similar

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.040
to an emergency room for pregnant women.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.610
Once you've been admitted to the hospital,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.680
you'll be escorted to your
labor and delivery room.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.070
Your care team will
monitor your labor progress

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.100
with cervical examinations.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.890
If you desire an epidural,
the anesthesiologist will come

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.010
to your labor room for placement.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310
Often patients are able
to eat and drink freely

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.430
during labor unless they have an epidural

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.540
or require labor
augmentation with medication.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.250
Once your cervix has
become completely dilated,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.300
your provide will encourage
you to start pushing.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.470
Your team will help you to
learn how to push effectively,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.160
bearing down with the contractions

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.050
to help move the baby
through the birth canal.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.570
Pushing often takes a few hours.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.470
Think carefully about who you would like

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.120
in the room during this time,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.720
who will support and
encourage you the most,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.670
keeping the focus and energy on you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.760
and what you need while you're pushing.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.810
Anyone else can wait in the waiting room.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.850
While your baby is delivering,
your provider will be guiding

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.720
and supporting you during the process

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.030
to help minimize your risk of tearing.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.560
Episiotomy or cutting the vaginal opening

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.950
to widen it is only used for emergencies.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.080
The rest of your care team

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.750
will be checking your vital signs,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.320
monitoring the baby's well-being,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.390
and anticipating the
needs of your provider

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.963
to give you excellent care.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.260
Immediately after delivery
your baby will be placed

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.730
on your chest, ideally in
a skin-to-skin fashion.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.280
This will be one of the
best moments of your life.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.190
By keeping your baby
directly on your skin,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.750
you will also be helping to keep her warm

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.120
and enhance her sense of safety

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.543
with your sounds, smell, and person.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.920
This also helps with nursing,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.930
and sometimes your baby will
start to nurse right away.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.900
Don't worry if your baby
takes a little while

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.910
to learn to nurse.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.260
Our lactation team is available to help,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.610
and all the nurses and
providers are trained as well.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.270
Your care team will be
evaluating your baby carefully

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.870
while she's with you to make sure

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.370
that she's transitioning well.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.000
We routinely perform
delayed cord clamping,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.620
which allows your baby to get as much

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.000
of the the blood supply as possible

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.360
before clamping and cutting the cord.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.780
Your provider will clamp
the cord and encourage you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.910
or your support person to cut the cord

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.863
while your baby is still skin-to-skin.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.040
You'll then be given a medication

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.150
that helps prevent postpartum bleeding,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.750
and your provider will help you

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.770
to deliver the afterbirth
called the placenta.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.930
If you do have a small
tear, which is common,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.670
especially in first-time mothers,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.980
your provider will make sure

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.050
that you have sufficient pain medication,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.530
usually with a local
injection around the area,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.860
prior to suturing the tear.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.040
Absorbable sutures are
used, which will be gone

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.840
by about four to six weeks
without having to be removed.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.530
Your team will then
help get you comfortable

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.010
for nursing your baby.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.120
Ideally you'll be able

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.450
to continue uninterrupted
skin-to-skin time

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.650
with your baby for at least 30 minutes.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.800
Please encourage your loved
ones to resist the urge

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.400
to interrupt this precious time.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.260
After a few hours of recovery period,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.330
you and your baby will be
escorted to your postpartum room

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.160
where you will both complete
your hospital stay together

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.263
until discharge.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.490
If at any point during delivery

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.670
or postpartum your team is
concerned for your baby's health,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.660
they may recommend further assessment

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.480
in the baby warmer in your
room; or, potentially,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.900
a short stay in the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit or NICU.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.380
Your team will always
explain what the concerns are

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.630
and why temporary
separation may be necessary.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.950
You may designate someone
to be with your baby

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.020
if you're recovering and
unable to personally go

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.950
with your baby to the NICU.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.630
Once you have recovered,
you have 24/7 access

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.690
to your baby in the NICU.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.090
Throughout your delivery,
please ask questions

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.970
or voice concerns or desires.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.530
This is your delivery; and
as your treatment team,

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.070
we want this to be the
best experience it can be

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.820
while ensuring the ultimate goal

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.739
of healthy mom and healthy baby.

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:27.406
