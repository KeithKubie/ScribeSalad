00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.700
Welcome back.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.770
So where we left off is, there
was 1,000 people who all

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.800
needed, let's say, $1
million loans each.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.260
And they were all going to
pay 10% on their loans.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.990
And they borrowed it
from this bank.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.900
It's kind of a standard
commercial bank.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.160
And this bank says, well you
know, I just handed out $1

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.040
billion and I'm getting these
interest payments.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.970
And my vaults are empty.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.450
I want to have money
back in my vaults.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.310
Or I want to have money back
on my balance sheet.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.670
So I'm going to sell
these loans.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.020
I'm going to bundle them all
together and sell them to this

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.189
investment bank.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.140
And now what is this investment
bank going to do

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.800
with these loans?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.700
And why is it doing it?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.220
So let me delete this.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.630
So we had the investment bank.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.430
I randomly picked the color
green, but I think it is

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.680
appropriate for the
investment bank.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.250
So now I have all of the, you
know, me-- that's a little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.200
smiley face.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.270
There's 1,000 of me, and we are
now going to pay the 10%.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.670
We're now going to make all of
our mortgage payments, the 10%

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.010
payment, to this bank,
this investment bank.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.280
But the investment bank, they're
not in the business of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.670
servicing loans or keeping loans
on their balance sheets.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.980
So what they do is, they
create a corporation.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.630
They create an entity, maybe
a special purpose entity,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.680
whatever you want to call it.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.820
So they create a company.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.170
Let me make that in purple,
another color.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.420
So they created this company.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:44.720
And what they do is, they will
take their rights to these

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.760
payments that they got.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.960
Right?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.160
They paid $1 billion to that
first bank in order to get the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.250
payments from all
of these people.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.030
And they say, you know what?

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.600
The rights on those payments--
that's the asset.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.460
They bought all these loans.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.050
The rights on those payments,
we are now going to transfer

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.690
to this special purpose
entity, to this other

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.560
corporation.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.150
So now everyone is going to,
essentially-- all their

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.500
mortgage payments are going to
be funnelled into this entity.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.190
Right?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.630
And this is a corporation.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.020
And so what the bank will do
is issue shares in this

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.550
corporation.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.760
So let's say that it issues,
let's sat for simplicity, a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.010
hundred shares.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.300
So what's in this corporation?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.560
The entire corporation gets the
mortgage payments on the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.510
$1 billion in loans, right?

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.975
It has $1 billion of
loans outstanding.

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:38.960
And it is going to
get 10% a year.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.350
So it's going to get $100
million per year right?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.140
Because it's a thousand
loans out there.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.315
It's going to get $100 million
per year for 10 years.

00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:49.220
And at the end of the 10 years
it's also going to get $1

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.880
billion, right?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.020
That's its asset it has.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.770
Its asset is the rights on those
payments streams that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.210
are going to come into
this corporation.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.530
And it has 100 shares.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.030
The way I think about
is you can split

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.270
this company 100 ways.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.590
And I'm doing this to
further confuse you.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.280
So what is each of those-- the
owner of each of those shares,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.590
what does it entitle them to?

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.330
Well, it entitles me to 1/100 of
what this corporation gets.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.400
So if I have a share-- let's
make it look like a share, a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.080
stock certificate-- I'm going
to get 1/100 of this thing.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.530
And normally you wouldn't
have 100 shares.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.440
You would have, let's say,
a million shares.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.840
Actually let me make it a
million shares, just because I

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.530
think that's, in some strange
way, more realistic.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.600
So let's say there are
a million shares.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.100
So if there are 1 million
shares, each share will get 1

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.380
millionth of the cash
flow stream that's

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.170
entitled to this entity.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.180
So instead of getting $100
million every year, it gets

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.110
one millionth of that.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.390
So it gets $100 per year.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.940
And then on the last year,
instead of getting $1 billion

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.030
it gets $1000.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.230
So what the bank will do is
it'll take these shares and

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.890
then it'll sell it to
the general public.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.380
It'll IPO it, essentially.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.420
You can think of it that way.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.360
And tons of people will buy it,
especially hedge funds,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.635
and pension funds, and mutual
funds, and bond investors.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.029
And it's important to think
about how the money's flowing.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.960
So now when they sell these
shares in this entity, people

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.620
are going to give them, well,
hopefully more than what they

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.840
paid for it, right?

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.830
Maybe there's a lot of demand
for this type of asset, where

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.080
I get this type of
income stream.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.950
So maybe once they sell all the
shares, they get, I don't

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.760
know, they get $1.1 billion
for them, right?

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.702
So this is the investors.

00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:48.360
And the investors collectively
buy these

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.700
shares for $1.1 billion.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.280
Essentially, let's say they
paid $1.1 billion for a

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.470
million shares, so they
paid $1,100 per share.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.720
Right?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.840
Each of the investors paid
$1,100 for each of these

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.430
shares, so that $1.1 billion
goes into this

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.630
special purpose entity.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.630
And if you think about
it, the bank made out

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.620
like a bandit, right?

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.890
Because the bank paid $1 billion
for the rights to

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.520
these mortgage payments, and
it's getting $1.1 billion from

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.340
the investors.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.190
And all the bank has to do is
kind of set this whole legal

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.150
structure up and service
the loans.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.350
It actually doesn't even have
to service the loans.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.580
We'll go into that later.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.520
So let me summarize, I guess.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.980
Just because I know this
can be a little bit

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.230
of a daunting subject.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.800
Let me summarize.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.200
And this purple I don't like.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.830
Anyway.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.315
So you have tons of investors.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:52.730
So, each of these
is an investor.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.690
Actually a mortgage,
a borrower.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.030
All of these people need
to buy houses.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.670
These are all smiley faces.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.980
They all need to buy houses.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.370
And then they collectively
get $1 billion.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.830
Right? $1 million each.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.080
And they each use that $1
million to buy their house.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.100
And then that $1 billion
initially came from just their

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.350
local bank.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.800
And when the $1 billion came
from that local bank, all the

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.640
payments, the interest payments,
went to the bank.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.600
But then an investment bank came
along and said, well no,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.195
I want to buy the rights
to those payments.

00:06:36.088 --> 00:06:38.910
And an investment bank came
along and says, well, I'm

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.160
going to give you $1 billion.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.640
And now instead of
you getting the

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.720
payments, I get the payments.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.080
And then the bank sets up a
special purpose entity.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.130
Essentially it sells
a bunch of shares.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.380
Let's say it sells
a million shares.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.560
And let's say it was able to
sell each of those shares for

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:12.950
$1,100 from the investing
public.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.270
So it raises $1.1
billion, right?

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.180
So the value of this company is
$1.1 billion that now goes

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.030
to the bank.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.180
And now the payment stream
instead of going to-- let me

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.340
do a different color-- now the
payment stream goes to this

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.580
special purpose entity
instead of the bank.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.080
And the bank essentially made
out like a bandit because it

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.920
paid $1 billion and it got $1.1
so it made $100 million

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.010
just for doing this
transaction.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.280
I'm not saying that's how much
a bank actually would make,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.150
but this shows you why every
person is kind of, what

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.040
they're doing in this
value chain.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.600
And as I said before, this
bank also probably did

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.310
something similar.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.050
They probably took some fees or
sold the loans for slightly

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.300
more than they issued
the loans for.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:07.920
So these shares-- each of these
one million shares--

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.400
this is a mortgage-backed
security.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.400
And it makes sense.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.040
It's a security.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.690
A security is an ownership
that's tradable in a company.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.100
And that company has the right
to payments that are secured

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.120
by mortgages.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.420
So if all these people promised
they would pay, and

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.590
they're going to pay to this
special purpose entity.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.429
But if, by chance, one of these
people lose their jobs

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:41.000
or they can't pay, or for
whatever reason, instead of

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.440
the payments, this entity is
going to have the rights to

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.130
their property.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.890
And that's why we
say that it's a

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.240
mortgage-backed security.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.980
So it's not just a promise
to get money.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.470
The money is actually backed
by people's mortgages.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.660
And of course, then this entity
is going to, if this

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.970
guy defaults on his loan--
he's one of a million, so

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.200
statistically you might be
able to predict that.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.900
I don't to put too much stock in
these statistical models--

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.780
then this entity will just have
that property auctioned

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.520
off or sold.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.570
And the cash flow will
come back to it.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.510
So that's what a mortgage-backed
security is.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.980
Hopefully I didn't confuse
you too much.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.260
My next presentation, I'm going
to take it to a further

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.430
level of confusion and show you
what a collateralized debt

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.430
obligation is.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.150
And then I'll do a more
philosophical video on why

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.190
these things even exist, and
why they're useful, and why

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:35.190
people may benefit or may not
benefit from these things.
