00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, that we have the equations for the SIR model, compute the sum of rate of changes.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The rate of change of the number of susceptible persons plus the rate of change of the number

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of infectious persons plus the rate of change of the number of recovered persons,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
then look at the result.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What do you learn from that result.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Do you learn from the result that an epidemic will develop or that no persons are lost or

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that everybody recovers eventually or that the number of infections per time stays constant.
