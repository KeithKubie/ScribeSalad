Lisbakken: Hey there.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.534
My name's Ben Lisbakken

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.534
and I'm an engineer
here at Google.

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:10.734
I'm gonna be giving a session
at Google I/O

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:13.167
called Fun Hacks
and Cool JavaScript.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.801
It's about just that
as it pertains

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:18.400
to the AJAX API Playground,
a creation of mine.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.634
The Playground is a place
where you can go

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:22.968
and be educated on Google's
JavaScript APIs.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:26.267
It has over 190 samples
that you can select from,

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:28.834
see the code for,
and see what they output.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:31.234
Then if you want
you can edit the code,

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:33.767
you can customize it to do
exactly what you want it to do,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.200
then you can run it again
on the same page.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.367
You can save your code.

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:41.167
You can also export it
to a sticky URL

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.300
where you can share it with
your friends.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.100
But talking about just
the Playground

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.567
isn't quite enough.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:46.767
What I'd really like to do

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:49.100
is delve into how
I created the Playground.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.067
Specifically, I think
that web developers out there

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:54.734
know JavaScript, but they don't
know JavaScript well enough

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.701
because there's a lot
of advanced techniques

00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:58.767
that you--that can be used
in JavaScript.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.767
So I'd like to spend
some time teaching

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:02.567
a little bit more advanced
JavaScript.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.834
Then I'd like to talk
about some of the fun hacks

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.133
that went into the Playground.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.501
For instance, I found out
how I could run code

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:13.734
on Google.com and have this be
arbitrary JavaScript

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:15.300
that you developers
were creating

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.033
but not have any security issues

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:18.767
with you guys trying
to hack Google.

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.901
Also what I'll do is show

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.067
how I created break points
for JavaScript

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:24.667
written in JavaScript,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.267
which was definitely
a fun hack.

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:28.467
Then if there's time,
I'd like to talk about

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:30.334
the XSRF vulnerability,

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:32.868
which is a very serious
and common vulnerability

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:34.367
for web applications.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:36.067
And after that if there's time,

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:37.701
I'd love to talk about
web performance

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.000
because front end web
performance is very important.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.801
You could increase the traffic
to your site

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.100
by having a performance site

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.467
and it's very easy to increase
the performance.

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:47.400
So if you guys have time,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.067
come on down and stop by
my session.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.200
I'd love to have you

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.868
and teach you guys
some cool JavaScript

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:53.400
and other front end
fun stuff.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.100
All right, thank you.
