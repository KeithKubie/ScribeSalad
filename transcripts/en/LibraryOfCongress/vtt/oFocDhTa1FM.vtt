From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.680
Hi, I'm Karen Keninger, Director
of the National Library Service

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.620
for the Blind and Physically
Handicapped.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.360
We call it NLS.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.010 position:56%
I'm pleased to announce our latest
development, the NLS BARD Mobile app

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.520 position:56%
for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.160
The BARD Mobile app will let you
download and read NLS Braille

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.050
and talking books directly
from the NLS Braille

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.720
and Audio Reading Download
site we call BARD.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.930
BARD contains nearly 50,000 books,
magazines and music scores in audio

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.190
and Braille formats, and the
collection grows every day.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.440
With BARD Mobile, you
can play talking books

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.550
and magazines on your i-device.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.200
You can also read WebBraille
books, magazines

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.810
and Braille music scores using
a refreshable Braille display

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.260
connected to your iPhone, iPad
or iPod touch through Bluetooth.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.960
Before you can use BARD Mobile,
there are some things that you need

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
to have in place.First, you must
be registered with a Braille

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.940
and talking book library
in the NLS network.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.950
If you aren't registered, check

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:34.020
out the eligibility
requirements at www.loc.gov/nls.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.030
You may qualify for this service if
you can't read standard print due

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.640
to a visual or physical disability.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.370
Second, you must establish
a BARD account.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.120
Only registered NLS patrons
are eligible for BARD accounts.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:58.420
Go to http://NLSBARD.loc.gov

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.270
and follow the instructions
to set up your account.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.610
And third, you must
download the BARD Mobile app

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.210
through the app store.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.430
It's free, but will only work
for people with a BARD account.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.620
When that's done, you'll be
ready to log into BARD Mobile

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.610
with your BARD user
name and password.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.210
You'll only need to do this
the first time you use the app.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.850
The app has four tabs or
sections: Bookshelf, Get Books,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.180
Now Reading, and Settings.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.670
From the Get Books tab,
you can download materials

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.460
from your personal BARD wish list

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.760
and from the BARD recently
added books and magazines list.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.690
You can also search
the BARD website.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.570
When you find a title you want to
read, add it to your wish list.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.060
Then you can download it from the
My Wish List section of the tab.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.850
If you're using an iPhone,
we recommend downloading

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.340
over Wifi to save data charges.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.020 position:56%
Once your book is downloaded, go to
the Bookshelf, and select your book.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.680
The Now Reading tab will open.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.510
If the item you selected
is in audio format,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.860
you'll find the same
basic layout you're used

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.400
to on the digital talking book
machine, with additional options

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.870
for navigation and information.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.400
You'll find the Bookmark
button, the Menu button

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.370 position:56%
which changes navigation levels, the
Previous and Next buttons to move

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.330
through the book or magazine, the
Fast Forward and Rewind buttons

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.960
for moving back and forward
by seconds or minutes,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.910
and the Play-Stop button.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.820
You'll also find controls to
adjust the speed and tone.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.680
Just activate the Play button,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.860
and begin listening
to your talking book.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.790
If the item you selected
is in Braille format,

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.340
you'll find navigation
controls including the Previous

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.810
and Next buttons, a Menu button--

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.320
which allows you to skip through
the item by page, volume, bookmark,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.070
and line, and a Bookmark
button to set bookmarks.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.800
If you're using VoiceOver,
listen to the prompts

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.310
that are spoken each
time you touch a control.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.030
They'll help you learn the
various gestures to use.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.760
You can also find the BARD
Mobile on-line user manual

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.100
on your bookshelf.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.960
The manual has more
in-depth help information.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.270
That concludes our overview
of the BARD Mobile app.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.600
