00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.766
City Councilwomen
Kelly wants to know

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.140
how the residents
of her district

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.920
feel about a proposed
school redistricting plan.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.690
Which of the following
survey methods

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.130
will allow councilwomen Kelly
to make a valid conclusion

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.350
about how residence
of her district

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.980
feel about the proposed plan?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.980
So before we even
look at these, we just

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.960
have to realize that
if you're trying

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.630
to make a valid
conclusion about how

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.360
the residents of
her entire district

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.420
feel about the
proposed plan, she

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.200
has to find a
representative sample,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.770
or not kind of a skewed
sample that would just

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.030
sample parts of her district.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.810
So let's look at her choices.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.970
Should she just
ask her neighbors?

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.980
Well, she might live in a
part of the neighborhood that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.070
might unusually benefit
from the redistricting plan

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.304
or might get hurt from
the redistricting plan.

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:47.720
And so just her
neighbors wouldn't

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.500
be representative of
the district as a whole.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.900
So just asking her neighbors
probably does not make sense.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.410
Ask the residents of Whispering
Pines Retirement Community.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.430
So once again, the first
one skews by geography.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.330
She's oversampling her neighbors
and not the entire district.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.700
Here, she's oversampling a
specific age demographic.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.710
So here she is oversampling
older residents

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.690
who might have very
different opinions then

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.160
middle aged or
younger residents.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.060
So that doesn't
make sense either.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.100
Ask 200 residents
of her district

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.904
whose names are
chosen at random.

00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:25.070
Well, that seems reasonable.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.877
It doesn't seem like there's
some chance that you somehow

00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:29.460
over sampled one
direction or another.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.120
But it's most likely to give
a reasonably representative

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.620
sample.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.620
And this is a pretty
large sample size.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.292
So it's important to say, what
is the random process, where

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:39.500
she getting these names from?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.010
But this actually
does seem reasonable.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.420
Ask a group of parents
at the local playground.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.020
Well once again, this is just
like asking your neighbors.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.500
And it's also sampling
a specific demographic.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.070
Now, this might
be the demographic

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.860
that cares most
about the schools.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.310
But she wants to know how
the whole district feels

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.290
about the redistricting plan.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.470
And once ago, this is
at a local playground.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.530
This isn't at all the
playgrounds in the district

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.029
somehow.

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.180
So I wouldn't do
this one either.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.500
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.650
Mimi wants to conduct a
survey of her 300 classmates

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.700
to determine which candidate
for class president-- Napoleon

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.610
Dynamite or Blair Waldorf--
is in the lead in the upcoming

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.540
election.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.110
Mimi will ask the question,
if the election were

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.380
today which candidate
would get your vote?

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.100
Which of the following methods
of surveying her classmates

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.710
will allow Mimi to make
valid conclusions about which

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.070
candidate is in the lead?

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.720
So let's see, ask
all of the students

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.980
at Blair's lunch table?

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.660
No.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.202
That would skew it in
Blair's favor, probably.

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:39.660
That's not a
representative sample.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.690
Ask all the members of
Napoleon's soccer team?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.520
No, same thing.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.200
They're likely to
go Napoleon's way

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.320
or maybe they don't
like Napoleon,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.736
maybe they'll go
against Napoleon.

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:48.850
But either way this seems
like a skewed sample.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.710
Put the names of all
the students in a hat

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.740
and draw 50 names.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.650
Ask those students
whose names are drawn.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.900
Well this seems like
a nice random sample

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.230
that could be nicely
representative

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.100
of the entire population.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.540
Ask all students whose
names begin with N or B?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.870
Well, this could be
perceived as kind of random.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.380
But notice, N is the same
starting letter as Napoleon,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.020
B is the same starter
letter as Blair.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.760
You might say,
well, that's fair.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.000
You're doing it for
each of their letters.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.860
But maybe there's like 10 people
whose names start with an N

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.580
and only two people whose names
start with a B. Once again,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.237
you're not even
getting a large sample.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.820
And then on top of
that, maybe there's

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.142
some type of people with
the same starting letter

00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:29.350
somehow like each other more.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.600
So I would steer
clear of this one.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.610
Ask every student in the class?

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.010
Well, that would work.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.150
There's 300 classmates,
that might not

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.927
be that time consuming.

00:03:40.927 --> 00:03:43.010
You can't get a better
sample than asking everyone

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.750
in the population.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.645
Which of the following methods
of surveying our class which

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.770
will allow Mimi to make a
valid conclusion about which

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.686
candidate in the lead?

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.409
Well, that's a pretty
good conclusion.

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.700
People might change their mind.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.790
So it's not a done deal.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.540
You can't get a
better sample size

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.260
then the entire population.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.937
Assign numbers to each
student in the class

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:03.520
and use a computer
program to generate

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.780
50 random numbers
between 1 and 300.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.697
Ask those students whose
numbers are selected.

00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:10.238
Well this is pretty close to
put the names of all the student

00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:11.400
in a hat and draw 50 names.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.740
So I would give this one.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.475
That seems reasonable as well.
