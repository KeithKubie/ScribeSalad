00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.350
Here is a simple example of creating threads with pthreads,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.250
let's look at the main function first.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.460
We see that in a loop we create pthread_create a number of times or, and

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.050
we create four threads where each of the threads executes the function hello.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.000
All this function does is print Hello Thread, it doesn't take any arguments and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.340
that's why we pass NULL as a argument to the pthread creation function.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.490
We also pass NULL in the attributes field because we're okay with

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.160
just using the default pthread's behavior.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.810
That also means that these threads will be joinable, so

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.990
then we have to, in a loop, join every single one of these threads.
