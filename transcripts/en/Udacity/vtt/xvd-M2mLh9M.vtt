00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The one we're thinking about this is that there is degrees of hardness of different kinds or problems.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Kind of like rocks. If you've ever studied rocks there is a scale for how hard a rock a is.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well there's kind of a scale for how hard problems are as well and some of the entries on this scale

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
include things like, well some problems are actually not computable.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can define a problem and we can show that

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
there is no computer program that can actually solve that problem.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That's hard and sometimes that's maybe as hard as you can imagine.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
An example of a problem in this class is the halting problem,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and you can see I have music video about the halting problem if you want to take a look at it,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but we're not going to talk about it more in this class.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There some other problems like I mentioned before that are computable.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can actually solve them with a computer program, but they require at least exponential time.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I mentioned generalized checkers is an example of that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There's problems that are computable and can be solved in polynomial time

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
like the shortest path problem with Dijkstra's algorithm, and some are computable

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
can be solved really quickly in linear time at the same amount of time

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
it would take to just look at the example.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can actually get an answer.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So graph connectivity is an example of a problem in that class.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So the way we think about this is the hardness of a problem like how two nodes in a graph connected.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The hardness of the problem is the running time of the very best possible algorithm for that problem.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
For some problems, we're not exactly sure how hard they are,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but we have lower bounds and upper bounds.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So for example, we might know that a certain problem requires at least nÂ˛ time to solve,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but we know that it requires no more than nâ ľ.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So the true complexity, the true hardness of this problem is somewhere between those two bounds.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So here's a question for you. What's a good way to find an upper bound on a problem's hardness?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We know an upper bound and a lower bound that gives us a sense of how hard the problem is.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
How do we find an upper bound? So here's some choices.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
One is device an algorithm to solve the problem, run it on a bunch of inputs,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and then look on the graph to see what the shape of it is and that tells us the bound.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So that's one choice. Another choice is. Again device an algorithm to solve it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Run that algorithm on all possible inputs and take a look at the running time that results from this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that gives you the upper bound.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Third you can imagine devising an algorithm to solve the problem and then analyzing it,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and whenever the big O or big Î˜ is that you get from that analysis is an upper bound

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
on the hardness of the problem, and then the final choice is, this is a trick question.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The whole question of upper bounds must be some other class

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because it's not what we've been studying in this class.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So decide which one do you think is the most appropriate and check it off.
