00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.740
Sandy is taking a
cab in New York City.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.230
The taxi fare includes a base
charge of $2.50 as soon as you

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.870
enter the cab, plus an
additional $2.50 per mile

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.990
traveled.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.480
If Sandy starts off
with a $20 bill,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.390
takes the cab for five
miles, and leaves a $1 tip,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.540
how much money will
she be left with?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.660
Well let's first just think
about how much this five mile

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.000
cab ride is going to cost her.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.425
So cab-- I'll call
it the cab fare.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.860
So it's going to be $2.50 just
when you get into the cab,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.310
plus $2.50 per mile.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:55.050
Well she's going
to go for 5 miles--

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.010
let me write it this way--
times $2.50 per miles.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.630
So the cab fare here is just
going to be $2.50, this $2.50,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.404
plus 5 times $2.50.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:16.970
Let's see, 5 times
$2.50, that is $12.50.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.070
So this is plus $12.50.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.280
$2.50 plus $12.50
is going to be $15.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.230
So just the cab fare
is going to be $15.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.700
And then Sandy gives a $1 tip.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.700
So fare plus tip is going
to be equal to the cab fare

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.124
$15 plus $1 which
is equal to $16.

00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:49.040
So then answering the
question, how much money

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.630
would she be left
with with a $20 bill?

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.420
Well we could
write her change is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.010
going to be, she's going
to give a $20 bill,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.560
the fare plus tip
is $16, minus $16.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.069
So she's going to have
$4 left in change.
