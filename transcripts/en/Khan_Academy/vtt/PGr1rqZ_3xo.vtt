00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:02.534
These are questions that I got from the

00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:04.570
Center For The Future Museums.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.080
They say for readers who
may be unfamiliar with

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.673
Khan Academy, can you
give a capsule description

00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:12.242
of your work? I'll make
it even clear. It's just

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:15.161
not my work anymore, we're
a team of 15 and growing

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.005
people, actually, I think we're now at 16.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:21.413
It started off as, essentially,
it got most know for

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:24.162
video library that I
originally made for my cousins,

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.673
put them on YouTube, got
really popular. I was

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:29.669
doing it as a hobby
really, I had a day job as

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.866
an analysis at an investment
fund. I was also working

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.003
on a primitive version
of software to quiz them

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.490
and things like that.
Then in 2009 I quit my job

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.411
to work on it full time.
2010 we got funding to

00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:44.943
work on it. Most of the
funding is actually to work

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:48.488
on the software platform.
The software lets students

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:50.673
start at any place 1
plus 1 equals 2. It will

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:54.271
generate problems for them.
It'll allow them to move ahead

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.007
as they gain proficiency
as they gain mastery

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.487
of subjects. They learn at
their own pace. They make

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:02.003
sure that all of the gaps
are filled. The videos

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.760
are there to compliment
the exercise platform.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.487
Right now there's over
2,700 videos covering

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:08.931
everything from basic
mathematics to calculus

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:12.082
to college level differential
equations in your algebra,

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:15.831
and sciences, biology,
chemistry, and a little bit

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.000
of history, economics, and finance.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.003
The exercises are deeper
K through 12 math.

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.075
Over the next year,
hopefully, we'll all see it

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:28.408
get to fairly deep K through,
I would say, 14 math,

00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:31.161
so cover all the advanced
mathematics. Then beyond

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.339
that we're going to see
the exercise platform move

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:35.826
into physics, chemistry,
and even parts of biology,

00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:37.495
and maybe grammar, and things like that.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:40.937
The whole idea for us as
not for profit, is to be ...

00:01:40.937 --> 00:01:47.003
1. For anyone. Anyone to get an education.

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:49.086
Our mission to going to be
a world class education.

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:56.151
Anyone, anywhere for free. Free education.

00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:00.606
2. Is to be a tool that
can be levered inside

00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:03.533
the classroom to make the
classroom more interactive.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.590
Tool to make the classroom
more interactive.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.044
Classroom interactive. When
I say his, it's a little

00:02:10.044 --> 00:02:12.460
intuitive, because we
are a technology tool,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.462
and we involve on demand
video. We involve exercises

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:17.190
that are done on the
computer. How are we making

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.129
it more interactive? When
I say more interactive,

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.795
I literally mean interactive with humans.

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.249
In the model we're experimenting with now,

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.316
and the initial results
seem very very promising

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:28.313
in the real classrooms
that we've been dealing

00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:31.122
with. So much of the
scaffolding of knowledge,

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:34.920
the conceptional
development, so much of the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.584
exercises can be done
on the online platform.

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:40.586
What we're saying is take
that part out side of

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:42.928
the classroom experience.
This can be done at

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:45.885
a students pace at their
time. Give that data

00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:47.719
to the teacher, and so
when the student goes into

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.986
the classroom you have
all this freed up time

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:54.385
so the students can teach
each other. Their all

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.807
learning at different
paces, and the teacher can

00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:59.888
do more focus more deep
interventions with the students.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:04.184
The teachers now have all of this data.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.722
It frees up time, and powers
the teacher with data.

00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:09.680
All of class time no
longer one pace fits all,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.222
one size fits all lectures,
its all about everyone

00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:16.141
working at their own pace.
Every minute of a teachers

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:19.224
time and every minute of
a students time is either,

00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:21.558
working at their own pace or
interacting with each other.

00:03:21.558 --> 00:03:23.998
That's what we talk about
it as a tool. Right now

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:27.664
most of the users are right
over here. Most of the

00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:29.465
users are right over here.
We have about 2 1/2 million

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.977
unique students a month, and that
numbers growing exponentially really.

00:03:32.977 --> 00:03:35.928
They've already watched
over 70 million videos,

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:37.742
and they've done over
100 million exercises.

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:40.794
We have about a million
exercises done per day now.

00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:45.660
That number is also
growing rapidly. That's

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.597
kind of the general overview
of what we're doing.

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:50.076
One thing I want to be
clear here is for both of

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:55.413
these, we've only had
funding for about 12 months.

00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:58.741
I've been doing this
one form or another for

00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:00.824
5 or 6 years now, or
actually closer to 7 years.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.489
As an organization we've only
been around for less that a year.

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:10.930
These are works in progress.
We are all ready seeing

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.748
good results and good traction
with what we all ready

00:04:12.748 --> 00:04:15.930
have. We hope to learn
more and more from the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.466
schools and the teachers and the parents

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.659
and the students that we're
working with. To just improve

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.192
them better and better and
make this part, make the

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:27.334
education, the classroom, more
and more rich experiences.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.505
Either through things we
do directly, or through

00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:31.597
the things that we enable
because we're taking

00:04:31.597 --> 00:04:33.412
other things off the table.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:36.392
Question number 2. What
do you see as the greatest

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:38.669
barrier technological,
cultural, or political to

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.594
mainstreaming the Khan Academy
system into public education?

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:46.003
I think the first is
something that I'll put firmly

00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:48.997
on Khan Academy shoulders,
on our shoulders, is that,

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.376
we have to make a very compelling case.

00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:52.786
A compelling case isn't just
a cool piece of software

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.990
that a lot of people are
using, or a bunch of videos

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.058
a lot of people are
using, that's part of it.

00:04:57.058 --> 00:04:59.525
We do have traction. That
traction happened organically,

00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:02.689
which I think does speak
to it. No one forces

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.655
these 2 million or 2 1/2
million students every

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:07.183
month to use our sight.
They, themselves, find it

00:05:07.183 --> 00:05:10.717
compelling. That by itself
isn't enough. We need

00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:13.599
to go into classrooms,
and I think it's very

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.358
important that people
understand that we don't

00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.453
think we have a perfective
solution. We think we

00:05:17.453 --> 00:05:20.357
have the start of a
compelling solution. What we

00:05:20.357 --> 00:05:22.524
want to do is work with,
and this is what we are

00:05:22.524 --> 00:05:24.520
doing with our pilot
classrooms. We want to work

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.449
with these teachers, students,
parents to make a better

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.719
product and see how this
product can be used,

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.783
to see how we can make
the classroom as human

00:05:34.783 --> 00:05:36.859
of an experience as possible.

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:39.237
Then, of course, we have
to prove that it works.

00:05:39.237 --> 00:05:41.736
Proving that it works,
you know, there is one

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:44.404
metric that people, the
education, or maybe the

00:05:44.404 --> 00:05:46.796
policy world like, which
is performance on test

00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:48.662
scores. We definitely
want to make sure that we

00:05:48.662 --> 00:05:51.593
have improvements or at
minimum know negatives.

00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:54.265
So far, it does like we are
seeing dramatic improvement

00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:59.328
in certain classes using
the model [advocate] and

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:01.797
using these tools.
Improvement also happens in

00:06:01.797 --> 00:06:06.666
intangible ways. If now
kids are able to as good

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.736
on the test as they were
before or even better

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:11.911
on the test, but now they
have a better attitude

00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:14.499
towards mathematics. Their
more attentive in class.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:19.263
Their able to be exposed.
You have all this

00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:21.910
freed up class time to
projects and experiences

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.907
that they wouldn't
otherwise been exposed to

00:06:23.907 --> 00:06:26.536
that can't necessarily be
captured on an assessment exam.

00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:28.792
If those things are
happening, we also view that

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:31.397
as signs of success. These
are things that we have

00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:34.746
to prove. Once we do and
hopefully we are able

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:36.419
to prove all of those
things, and it seems like

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.414
we are on track, hopefully, knock on wood

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:43.127
to do those things. The next
thing is to really just ...

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:48.862
we are a free solution.
We are not for profit.

00:06:48.862 --> 00:06:50.993
People know that we
aren't doing this to make

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.205
money off of it, we're doing
this because we generaly

00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:58.599
care about education. I think
people want to understand

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:00.828
what we are talking about.
Right now there's some

00:07:00.828 --> 00:07:03.262
[knee jerk] reactions
that thinks were all about

00:07:03.262 --> 00:07:05.600
kids spending all of
their time on a computer,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.992
spending all of their time watching videos

00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:10.499
that somehow replace
teachers. We're about the

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:12.762
opposite of that. We
think class time should be

00:07:12.762 --> 00:07:14.830
about interaction. We
think we are the catalysis

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.868
to take lectures out of
the classroom, to make the

00:07:16.868 --> 00:07:20.494
classroom more interactive.
People have to get over

00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:24.869
those [knee jerk] reactions,
which I think aren't

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:27.262
correct perceptions of
what we're trying to do.

00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:30.421
Then beyond that is just
a willingness to change.

00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:32.669
I think the willingness
to change, there are

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:35.496
many opened minded teachers
that are all ready doing it.

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.335
Those are the ones we are working with

00:07:37.335 --> 00:07:39.149
to really help define what
we are and help define

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:42.563
what our future should
be. Those are going well,

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:44.470
and I don't know what
percentage of teachers will

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.331
fall into that cap, where
they will see a good tool

00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:49.286
and like and it seems it has good results.

00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:51.133
It gels with their was of
teaching, they'll adopt it.

00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:56.465
The last thing I'd want
to see is people being

00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:58.874
forced to use Khan Academy.
I really want it to

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:04.923
be something that's opted
into. If you force them

00:08:04.923 --> 00:08:06.522
to use even something
that's the best tool on

00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:08.852
the planet, and they don't want to use it,

00:08:08.852 --> 00:08:10.918
they can make it a not-so-great tool,

00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:14.116
and a not-so-great
experience. Our main concern

00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:16.785
is really to show that
it's a viable model,

00:08:16.785 --> 00:08:19.924
it's a good model. It has
all of the effects that

00:08:19.924 --> 00:08:21.924
we want it to have, but
it really is improving

00:08:21.924 --> 00:08:24.826
education, both from
assessment point of view

00:08:24.826 --> 00:08:29.748
and from a intangible point
of view. We offer it free.

00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:32.403
We give as much information
to teachers, policy

00:08:32.403 --> 00:08:36.323
makers, and parents so
that their own schools can

00:08:36.323 --> 00:08:38.407
adopt it if they want
to. All of our tools are

00:08:38.407 --> 00:08:40.415
all ready available for
free, all the tools our

00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:43.412
pilots are using. Any
classroom can use today, and

00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:46.590
then just see what happens,
I guess is the simple answer.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.855
Next question. Currently,
Khan Academy content

00:08:49.855 --> 00:08:53.459
is heavy on subjects that
focus on facts and absolutes,

00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:56.916
math, chemistry, physics.
Is that mostly a function

00:08:56.916 --> 00:08:59.496
of your background and expertise,
or inheriting the format?

00:08:59.496 --> 00:09:02.387
What are the limitations
with your current model

00:09:02.387 --> 00:09:05.121
for covering squishy topics
like art, literature,

00:09:05.121 --> 00:09:07.382
that are about aesthetics
and interpretation?

00:09:07.382 --> 00:09:11.462
I would say it is true we
are covering math, chemistry,

00:09:11.462 --> 00:09:14.461
physics, and sometimes their
not as fact or absolute

00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:16.952
basis, sometimes people
perceive them to be.

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:18.124
With that said,

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.884
I've also started making
videos on history and

00:09:20.884 --> 00:09:23.786
economics. Although
economics is often considered

00:09:23.786 --> 00:09:28.702
a science, it can be a squishy
subject where aesthetics

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:31.288
and interpenetration do begin to matter.

00:09:31.288 --> 00:09:33.708
One thing you will see, and I
think this is very interesting

00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:37.255
for the audience for the
future of the museums is,

00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:40.381
you will start to see we
are bringing some people

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:42.719
on board in the very near
future on art history.

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.648
They've all ready made
some really tremendous

00:09:45.648 --> 00:09:47.796
videos, and I will make
the formal announcement

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.878
once we have everything
integrated. They've done

00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:53.206
a really good job with
art history. They've had

00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:55.048
these interesting conversations about it.

00:09:55.048 --> 00:09:58.880
I think that's actually
a good model not for just

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.318
art history, but it's a good
model for a lot of the humanities.

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.795
In something like history
or whatever humanities

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:08.463
you want to pick, it's
nice to have scalpel,

00:10:08.463 --> 00:10:10.132
even in art history you
want to have a scalpel.

00:10:10.132 --> 00:10:16.457
You want to know what it
means to be a serial painter.

00:10:16.457 --> 00:10:20.916
When did the broke period take place?

00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:23.918
Or, whatever it might be.
That's where, kind of,

00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:25.804
more traditional Khan
Academy style videos are

00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:28.121
useful to get you the
scalpel of information.

00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:32.711
The conversation type style
which these professors have

00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:35.446
kind of pioneered, is
really interesting to get

00:10:35.446 --> 00:10:37.380
multiple view points.
Even if they don't cover

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.010
all of the multiple view
points, it kind of gives

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.261
us the freedom to realize
you can have multiple

00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:45.594
view points. They, themselves,
can form their own.

00:10:45.594 --> 00:10:48.009
You're going to see a lot more
of that in the near future.

00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:50.185
That's on the video side.
On the exercise side,

00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:52.843
once again, we can start
to develop exercises that

00:10:52.843 --> 00:10:55.094
help. At least make sure
you have the scalpel

00:10:55.094 --> 00:10:57.710
of information. You know
where the Civil War fit into

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.758
the scope of US History. You
know what the Magna Carta

00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:05.095
even was and how it
relates to other documents.

00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:08.447
Once you have that
scalpel, you're prepared to

00:11:08.447 --> 00:11:10.266
participate in a deeper
discussion in class,

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:14.254
a deeper project, or a deeper
type of simulation in class.

00:11:14.254 --> 00:11:17.543
Next question. Can the Khan
Academy model as it currently works

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:20.738
help kids go from learning
facts and operations

00:11:20.738 --> 00:11:23.808
to critical reasoning,
or does that require a

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:28.407
different model? I'd actually
say this what we're about.

00:11:28.407 --> 00:11:32.464
Right now the problem I
think with a lot of text

00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:34.467
books and some classes
is that they are focused

00:11:34.467 --> 00:11:39.080
too much on facts and
operations. If you look

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.904
at any of the Khan Academy
math videos, sometimes

00:11:41.904 --> 00:11:44.268
the facts and operations
are shown, but their

00:11:44.268 --> 00:11:46.869
never shown devoid of
the motivation for doing

00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:49.664
that fact and operation.
Their never devoid of

00:11:49.664 --> 00:11:51.471
the conceptional
understanding. Why it makes

00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:53.995
intuitive sense? Why you
can critically deduce

00:11:53.995 --> 00:11:56.164
that. You can reason
those facts and operations

00:11:56.164 --> 00:11:58.832
just by thinking about the
problem in the right way.

00:11:58.832 --> 00:12:01.417
How multiple problems in
different fields actually

00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:04.412
reduce to the same core distilled problem.

00:12:04.412 --> 00:12:06.832
I actually think that
right now Khan Academy

00:12:06.832 --> 00:12:09.914
is all about critical
reasoning. Especially on the

00:12:09.914 --> 00:12:12.604
video side. I think on
the exercise there's a lot

00:12:12.604 --> 00:12:14.835
more work we have to do,
but we do want to get

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:17.736
there. So, we do expose
students some more simulations,

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:22.339
more projects, more things
that require more than

00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:24.336
just knowing the steps
of how to do a problem.

00:12:24.336 --> 00:12:26.832
This is, I think, in the
videos we're all ready

00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:28.739
doing this to a large
degree. I thinks that's why

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:31.010
Khan Academy videos have
gotten popular. On the

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.673
exercises we're starting
with the base scalpel

00:12:33.673 --> 00:12:35.735
right now, and right now
the exercise are more

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:37.868
in this direction. I think
over time we're going

00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:40.014
to see more and more
exercises that point to

00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:42.177
critical reasoning,
simulations, things where

00:12:42.177 --> 00:12:43.916
you're going have to
manipulate, kind of virtual

00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:46.791
manipulative's to get
to some type of goal.

00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:50.397
Next question. 25 years
from now, what do you

00:12:50.397 --> 00:12:52.726
think a school day will
be like for an 8-year-old

00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:55.205
kid in America? Will she
be commuting to a physical

00:12:55.205 --> 00:12:57.656
classroom or accessing
content from home? How will

00:12:57.656 --> 00:13:00.259
she study? Who will her
teachers be and what

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:02.208
will be their role? I'll
answer the first question.

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:06.459
Ideally, they will be going
to a physical classroom.

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:09.129
If their in a very rural
place, or they don't

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:12.551
have access, they might
be able to learn accessing

00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:15.725
content from home. I think,
we the organization think,

00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:18.468
physical interaction with
other people is a huge

00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:23.715
part of maturing, and we
hope there's a physical

00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:26.393
classroom. We think it
might be a very different

00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:29.396
type of physical classroom.
I kind of imagine

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:32.260
every student can work at their own pace.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.393
You don't have to separate
kids by age group anymore.

00:13:35.393 --> 00:13:38.393
The benefits of kids
helping each other. I would

00:13:38.393 --> 00:13:42.331
imagine one really large
room, or maybe several

00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:44.858
really large rooms.
Instead of having 30 kids

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:47.996
in that room, maybe you
have 200 kids in that room.

00:13:47.996 --> 00:13:50.470
Obviously, instead of
having 1 teacher, you have

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.393
maybe ... 200 kids and
you obviously want to

00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:56.142
have as many teachers
as possible. The lower

00:13:56.142 --> 00:13:57.729
the student to teacher ratio the better.

00:13:57.729 --> 00:14:05.058
Maybe you have ... N
teachers ... if you have

00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:07.260
25 to 1 ratio, you would
have 8 teachers here.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.661
You would have 8 teachers
here. I think that's

00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:12.060
about consistent with many public schools.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.859
Every student would be
working at their own pace

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:15.969
for some part of the day in every subject.

00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:19.526
All the way from grammar
to history to mathematics.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.725
The teachers are there
to mentor them, to guide

00:14:21.725 --> 00:14:25.725
them, to help them get
past hurdles. So much of

00:14:25.725 --> 00:14:28.067
the learning can hopefully
be done in very efficiently,

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:32.393
most of the day is spent doing projects.

00:14:32.393 --> 00:14:35.813
If this is the school day
we want this part course

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:41.726
skills, and the rest
of the day is projects.

00:14:41.726 --> 00:14:44.802
The rest of the day is projects.

00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:47.323
Kids writing software.
Kids conducting scientific

00:14:47.323 --> 00:14:49.793
experiments, real scientific experiments.

00:14:49.793 --> 00:14:53.313
Kids producing video content or web pages,

00:14:53.313 --> 00:14:57.056
blogs, newspapers, composing music, or

00:14:57.056 --> 00:14:59.993
writing short stories.
Whatever it is, their

00:14:59.993 --> 00:15:02.390
doing projects, and the
main role of the teachers

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.993
will not only be to
help kids get past their

00:15:04.993 --> 00:15:06.895
hurdles with the course
skills, so that the kids

00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:09.478
can still perform on
these other external exams

00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:11.663
and all the rest. Also,
be the mentor for the

00:15:11.663 --> 00:15:14.993
projects. We see not just
the teachers being the

00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:18.066
mentors for both of
these parts, we see the

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:20.402
students mentoring each
other. If you have kids

00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:23.229
of all different age groups
together, then you can

00:15:23.229 --> 00:15:25.327
have students who are
more advanced or have an

00:15:25.327 --> 00:15:27.596
act for it, to mentor students
who are less advanced,

00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:30.899
or who need help in a specific domain.

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:34.820
We like to see the eventual
real powerful transcript.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.490
This is something we
all ready take to heart

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.592
when we're hiring people.
It's nice if you went

00:15:38.592 --> 00:15:40.823
to a fancy school, with
a fancy GPA, with a fancy

00:15:40.823 --> 00:15:42.823
standardized test scores,
but what we really care about

00:15:42.823 --> 00:15:44.993
is what have you built
before? What have you

00:15:44.993 --> 00:15:47.739
started with a blank
slate? Have you ever put

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.991
your ideas into action? Have
you ever built anything?

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.736
We think that the resume
of the future will really

00:15:52.736 --> 00:15:56.926
be the projects you
work on over the course

00:15:56.926 --> 00:15:59.733
of your school years, both
in K through 12 and college.

00:15:59.733 --> 00:16:02.529
Frankly, I think that
division between K through 12

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:04.860
and college will also
start to get blurred.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.990
Last question. You've said
your goal is to create

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.796
tens of thousands of
videos in pretty much every

00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:13.459
subject, and the worlds
first free, world-class

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:15.408
virtual school where
anyone can learn anything.

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:17.660
Can you suggest ways
that museums or museum

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.827
practitioners could
contribute to Khan Academy?

00:16:19.827 --> 00:16:25.993
I encourage museums or
museum practitioners to both

00:16:25.993 --> 00:16:29.074
make content, and I think
some of the art history

00:16:29.074 --> 00:16:30.656
content you'll see from us
in the near future, will

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.798
give a very good idea
of how to make that type

00:16:32.798 --> 00:16:35.745
of content. So, one to
make content and maybe

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.997
share it with Khan Academy,
maybe make it part of

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.728
the Khan Academy library.
We're hoping to build

00:16:39.728 --> 00:16:41.530
tools so that other people
can contribute to the

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.125
library in some way. I
think the other possibility

00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:50.164
to leverage Khan Academy
material or Khan Academy

00:16:50.164 --> 00:16:52.863
like material. If you
have an instillation or

00:16:52.863 --> 00:16:56.595
you have a painting on
something, instead of having

00:16:56.595 --> 00:16:59.490
a little plaque or next
to the thing that has a

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.727
hundred word description
of it, why not have

00:17:01.727 --> 00:17:03.797
an explanation of it? Why
not have someone, maybe,

00:17:03.797 --> 00:17:05.665
Khan Academy style
explaining what that painting

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:08.199
is all about. Maybe,
using some of our videos

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:10.245
that you're about to see
in the next months on

00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:15.261
our history. Why not have
people contribute their own

00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:17.670
interpretations of the
art done Khan Academy

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.504
style or just an audio
track. I think it lands

00:17:21.504 --> 00:17:23.927
itself to a very interesting
question which is

00:17:23.927 --> 00:17:27.085
where are museums going?
I think their similar

00:17:27.085 --> 00:17:29.166
to schools in that. Before
you had to have a physical

00:17:29.166 --> 00:17:31.088
location to have a
school. Similarly you have

00:17:31.088 --> 00:17:33.126
to have a physical
location to have a museum.

00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:34.912
I think where museums
are going to go is that

00:17:34.912 --> 00:17:36.749
their going to turn into these amazing ...

00:17:36.749 --> 00:17:38.131
I mean most museums I know of are amazing.

00:17:38.131 --> 00:17:40.186
Physical spaces, architectural
spaces, community

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:42.754
spaces, and I think
they'll always be there.

00:17:42.754 --> 00:17:44.924
I think they'll always be a
role for those physical spaces.

00:17:44.924 --> 00:17:48.127
I think what will happen
is that the content

00:17:48.127 --> 00:17:50.689
in those physical spaces
will be much more dynamic.

00:17:50.689 --> 00:17:52.862
They won't just be this
insulation that sits

00:17:52.862 --> 00:17:55.088
there for 3 months or 6 months or a year.

00:17:55.088 --> 00:17:57.796
They'll be information
and installations that

00:17:57.796 --> 00:18:01.059
almost change based on
the interactions with

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:03.500
the people who visit the installations.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.529
A lot of that static
content, the paintings,

00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:08.525
or the installations, those
can also be virtualized.

00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:11.174
If someone goes to the
physical museum that's

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.926
obviously the best
experience. If you virtualize

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:17.198
them in the right way, you
can also then bring the

00:18:17.198 --> 00:18:18.863
museum experience to
people who don't have the

00:18:18.863 --> 00:18:20.794
privilege of going to
museum. I think the Google

00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:23.014
art projects starts to
hint at some of this.

00:18:23.014 --> 00:18:25.924
If you have the Google
art project, which gives

00:18:25.924 --> 00:18:28.758
us very high resolution
pictures of art, that

00:18:28.758 --> 00:18:31.462
one can zoom into. You
couple it with kind of

00:18:31.462 --> 00:18:34.467
a conversational commentary
on art history or

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:38.087
on the art itself. I think
you start to get close

00:18:38.087 --> 00:18:41.596
to that type of experience.
