00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.330
I will stop my server with Ctrl+C and

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.510
start it again to
reflect my code changes.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.990
Now, I have two URLs I can visit, each
rendering a unique page to my browser.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.470
Add the hola functionality
into the web server.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.480
The Python code for this section is
also available in the instructor notes.
