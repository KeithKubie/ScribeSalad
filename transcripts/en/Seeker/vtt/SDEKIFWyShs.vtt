Hey everyone, Trace with you for a DNews Short
We like to think we’re special, that life

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.030
only pops up once in a planet’s history.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.839
But new research published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences says there

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.340
might have been complex life on Earth before
us that eventually died off!

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.130
It might have developed in the oceans far
earlier than we previously thought.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.090
Looking for ancient life is hard because not
everything gets preserved as a fossil.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.360
In fact, according to the researchers, the
probability of an organism becoming fossilized

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.550
is pretty low.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.370
So instead of looking for direct evidence
of life, they have to search for evidence

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.880
of the conditions to support life.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.610
In this case, they looked for a form of the
element selenium in sedimentary rocks over

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.450
2 billion years old.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.329
Selenium reacts when it’s exposed to oxygen,
so the researchers were trying to find evidence

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.970
of this oxidation.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.329
This would be clear sign that there had been
oxygen in the air at that time.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.579
And they found it!

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.980
Based on the selenium traces they analyzed,
the researchers were able to reasonably conclude

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.920
that oxygen was present in the Earth’s atmosphere
between 2 and 2.4 billion years ago, which

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.490
is much earlier than our oldest recorded fossils
of complex life; those are only about 1.75

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.690
billion years old.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.500
Their research says that oxygen levels were
possibly high enough to have an impact on

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500
the planet’s ecology!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.320
After this time period though, the oxygen
levels crashed, and the life, if it had evolved,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
likely died off.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.030
So the next question is, what caused global
oxygen levels to drop so dramatically?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.380
There’s work to be done, but in the meantime,
this type of research might help us look for

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.180
ancient life in extreme environments, like
distant planets and moons!

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.409
And speaking of, what if life didn’t start
on Earth but actually came from space?

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.670
We talk about that idea in this video.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.610
What else would you like to know about fossils
and the history of the planet?
