00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.726
The elephant is a creature
of epic proportions,

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:16.454
and yet it owes its enormity to more
than 1,000 trillion microscopic cells,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:18.765
and on the epically small end of things,

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.966
there are likely millions 
of unicellular species,

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.476
yet there are very few we can see
with the naked eye.

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:26.585
Why is that?

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:28.867
Why don't we get unicellular elephants,

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:29.997
or blue whales,

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.657
or brown bears?

00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:34.929
To find out, we have to peer into
a cell's guts.

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.986
This is where most 
of the cell's functions occur,

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:40.247
enclosed by a cellular membrane

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:43.876
that acts as the doorway into 
and out of the cell.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.037
Any resources the cell needs to consume,

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:48.736
or waste products it needs to expel,

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:51.497
first have to pass through this membrane.

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:54.477
But there's a biological quirk 
in this set up.

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:58.476
A cell's surface and volume increase
at different rates.

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:00.717
Cells come in many shapes,

00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:05.427
but imagining them as cubes will make
the math easy to calculate.

00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:07.036
A cube has six faces.

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:11.545
These represent the cell membrane,
and make up its surface area.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:14.636
A cube measuring one micrometer
on each side,

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:16.757
that's one millionth of a meter,

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:21.137
would have a total surface area
of six square micrometers.

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:24.068
And its volume would be 
one cubic micrometer.

00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:26.171
This would give us six units 
of surface area

00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:28.601
for every single unit of volume,

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:30.787
a six to one ratio.

00:01:30.787 --> 00:01:35.152
But things change dramatically
if we make the cube ten times bigger,

00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:38.086
measuring ten micrometers on each side.

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:41.973
This cell would have a surface area
of 600 square micrometers

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:45.541
and a volume of one thousand
cubic micrometers,

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:48.457
a ratio of only .6 to one.

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:53.388
That's less than one unit of surface area
to service each unit of volume.

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:58.367
As the cube grows, its volume increases
much faster than its surface area.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:02.132
The interior would overtake the membrane,

00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:08.088
leaving too little surface area for things
to quickly move in and out of the cell.

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:13.900
A huge cell would back up with waste
and eventually die and disintegrate.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.038
There's another plus to having multitudes
of smaller cells, too.

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:22.768
It's hardly a tragedy if one gets 
punctured, infected, or destroyed.

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:26.320
Now, there are some 
exceptionally large cells

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.868
that have adapted to cheat the system,

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:30.889
like the body's longest cell,

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:35.090
a neuron that stretches from the base
of the spine to the foot.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.621
To compensate for its length,
it's really thin,

00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.020
just a few micrometers in diameter.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.619
Another example can be found
in your small intestine,

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.450
where structures called villi
fold up into little fingers.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.860
Each villus is made of cells with highly
folded membranes

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.513
that have tiny bumps called microvilli
to increase their surface area.

00:02:56.513 --> 00:02:59.690
But what about single-celled organisms?

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.450
Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae
that can reach 30 centimeters long,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.001
is believed to be the largest 
single-celled organism in the world

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.819
thanks to its unique biological hacks.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.222
Its surface area is enhanced with
a frond-like structure.

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:20.513
It uses photosynthesis to assemble
its own food molecules

00:03:20.513 --> 00:03:22.671
and it's coenocytic.

00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:26.171
That means it's a single cell
with multiple nuclei,

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:31.471
making it like a multicellular organism
but without the divisions between cells.

00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:35.161
Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms
have limits,

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:40.061
and none grows nearly as large
as the elephant, whale, or bear.

00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.321
But within every big creature
are trillions of minuscule cells

00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:47.152
perfectly suited in all their tininess

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:50.251
to keeping the Earth's giants 
lumbering along.
