00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.850
Get up and running with
your first Angular 2.0

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.490
application and new tools
to speed up your workflow.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.440
I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.270
This is "LazyWeb."

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.510
Get an early look at Angular
2.0 in this short tutorial.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.670
Alex Eagle from the
Angular team demonstrates

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.250
how to build a to
do list, combining

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.950
the latest from Angular with
Firebase, a backend service

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.435
for storing real-time data.

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:24.810
The video also
highlights working

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.376
with TypeScript and Microsoft's
new Visual Studio Code editor.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:32.750
Addy and Matt show off some
of their fancy Sublime tricks

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.050
in the new "Totally
Tooling Tip" series.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.500
Episode one covers linters
like JSHint and JSCS for code

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.455
style, managing
colors in your app

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:43.430
with Code Highlighter and Color
Picker, and autocomplete tools

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.400
for filenames and CSS prefixes.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.980
You can catch "Totally
Tooling Tips" every other week

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.482
on the Google Developers
YouTube channel.

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:53.315
Mark Marron and James
Mickens from Microsoft

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:55.637
demonstrate a new feature
in the F12 developer tools

00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:58.220
that add the abilities to step
backwards through your program.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.552
Debugger uses an efficient
snapshotting technique

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:02.510
of the JavaScript runtime
to keep your overhead

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.000
down so that way it can run as
you work without significantly

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.576
impacting performance.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:10.970
Leave yourself a
note with this voice

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.670
recorder for the mobile web.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.350
Paul Lewis details the process
of building a material design

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.610
voice recorder using features
like Recorder.js for waveforms

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.320
and Babelify for ES6.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.260
The post takes an honest
look at issues still faced

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.630
by the web when it comes
to building applications.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.210
If you want to check
out the source,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.980
it's available now on GitHub.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.090
"DevTips Daily" highlights
a new filmstrip view

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.010
which display snapshots of
your site as it was loading.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.152
Based on a similar
feature from WebPagetest,

00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:39.610
the tool helps
developers determine

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.180
when their site is first
usable and cut down

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.762
on render blocking assets.

00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:45.220
To try the feature
yourself, you'll

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.945
need to download a
copy of Chrome Canary.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.810
Jake and Paul return for
Season 2 of "HTTP 203."

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.560
Season 2 begins with
a brief discussion

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.420
of Jake's impending demise.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.810
Paul grows a beard.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.220
And somewhere in
the middle, they

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.050
rehash the age old debate
of web versus native.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.440
If you have a few
minutes to kill

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.480
or just want to feel
better about your suntan,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.280
tune in to this season of "HTTP
203" on the Google Developers

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.769
YouTube channel.

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.060
That's it for this week, folks.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.150
Take a deep breath, enjoy
the visuals, and to all

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.789
you LazyWebbers

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.080
