00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.346
Only two of these are true. All real numbers are complex and all imaginary

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:08.742
numbers are complex. Let's look at our diagram. We can see that the complex

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:13.402
number rectangle contains all of the other rectangles inside it. So that means

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:18.302
that every rectangle that's inside the complex number rectangle Contains numbers

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:22.668
all of which are complex numbers. Since the imaginary numbers and the real

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:27.196
numbers are all inside of the complex numbers they are all complex. However the

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:31.809
complex number rectangle is not contained inside any of these other rectangles.

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.315
All of those categories are subsets of it. So there is no other category that we

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:40.704
can group all complex numbers into on this diagram. Since the real numbers and

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:44.400
the imaginary numbers are completely separate rectangles, they are separate

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.635
groups. Neither one is a subset of the other.
