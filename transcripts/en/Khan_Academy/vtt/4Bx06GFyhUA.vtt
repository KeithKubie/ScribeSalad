00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.856
Which quadratic has the
lowest maximum value?

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:06.230
So let's figure out the maximum
value for each of these--

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.869
and they're defined
in different ways--

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:09.410
and then see which
one is the lowest.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.600
And I'll start with the easiest.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.250
So h of x.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.022
We can just graphically look
at it, visually look at it,

00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:16.480
and say-- what's
the maximum point?

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.560
And the maximum point looks
like it's right over here

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.900
when x is equal to 4.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.110
And when x is equal to 4, y or
h of x is equal to negative 1.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.560
So the maximum for h of x
looks like it is negative 1.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.140
Now, what's the
maximum for g of x?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.860
And they've given us some
points here and here.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.530
Once again, we can just
eyeball it, and say-- well,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.400
what's the maximum
value they gave us?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.110
Well, 5 is the largest value.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.350
It happens when x is
equal to 0. g of 0 is 5.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.925
So the maximum value here is 5.

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:48.860
Now, f of x.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.059
They just give us an
expression to define it.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.850
And so it's going take
a little bit of work

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.990
to figure out what
the maximum value is.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.700
The easiest way to do
that for a quadratic

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.920
is to complete the square.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.390
And so let's do it.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.940
So we have f of x is equal
to negative x squared

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.855
plus 6x minus 1.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.480
I never like having
this negative here.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.730
So I'm going to factor it out.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.750
This is the same thing
as negative times

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.670
x squared minus 6x and plus 1.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.420
And I'm going to write
the plus 1 out here

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.122
because I'm fixing to
complete the square.

00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:25.080
Now, just as a review of
completing the square,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.450
we essentially want to add
and subtract the same number

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.900
so that part of this
expression is a perfect square.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.420
And to figure out what number
we want to add and subtract,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.320
we look at the
coefficient on the x term.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.770
It's a negative 6.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.010
You take half of that.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.220
That's negative 3.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.710
And you square it.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.630
Negative 3 squared is 9.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.070
Now, we can't just add a 9.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.130
That would change the actual
value of the expression.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.502
We have to add a 9
and subtract a 9.

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:52.960
And you might say-- well, why
are we adding and subtracting

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.140
the same thing if
it doesn't change

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.460
the value of the expression?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.980
And the whole
point is so that we

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.720
can get this first
part of the expression

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.610
to represent a perfect square.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.480
This x squared minus 6x
plus 9 is x minus 3 squared.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.479
So I can rewrite that
part as x minus 3

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.380
squared and then minus 9--
or negative 9-- plus 1 is

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.972
negative 8.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.430
Let me do that in
a different color

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.410
so we can keep track of things.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.300
So this part right over
here is negative 8.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.970
And we still have the
negative out front.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.920
And so we can rewrite
this as-- if we distribute

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.650
the negative sign-- negative
x minus 3 squared plus 8.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.920
Now, let's think about
what the maximum value is.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.420
And to understand
the maximum value,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.780
we have to interpret this
negative x minus 3 squared.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.100
Well, x minus 3 squared-- before
we think about the negative--

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.980
that is always going
to be a positive value.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.646
Or it's always going
to be non-negative.

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.104
But then, when we
make it negative,

00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:01.870
it's always going
to be non-positive.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.220
Think about it.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.780
If x is equal to 3, this
thing is going to be 0.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.500
And you take the negative
of that, it's going to be 0.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.360
x is anything else,
x is anything other

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.450
than 3, this part
of the expression

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.477
is going to be positive.

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:15.810
But then, you have a minus sign.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.590
So you're going to subtract
that positive value from 8.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.610
So this actually
has a maximum value

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.350
when this first term
right over here is 0.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.830
The only thing that this part
of the expression could do

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.142
is subtract from the 8.

00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:34.600
If you want to get
a maximum value,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.070
this should be equal to 0.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.200
This equals 0 when
x is equal to 3.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.890
When x is equal to 3, this is 0.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.370
And our function hits
its maximum value of 8.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.750
So this has a max-- let
me do that in a color

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.450
that you can actually read--
this has a max value of 8.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.180
So which has the
lowest maximum value?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.805
h of x.
