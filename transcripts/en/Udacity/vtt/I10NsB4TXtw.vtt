00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.720
If you're already sold on progressive
web apps, and you don't need to make

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.240
a business case for them,
you can probably skip this video.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.036
But if you need to convince one of those
business decision makers, stay tuned.

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:17.390
The Web is an amazing platform
that has easy access for

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.540
developers and users alike.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.700
It's low friction,
provide easy distribution,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.308
offers immediate redeployment and
enables simple AB testing.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:32.490
When Flipboard launched on the web for
the first time this year,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.160
they reported that their monthly
active users increased by 75%.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.080
On the Web, users can get to
a new site with a single tap.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.950
Apps can be a bit more limited.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.480
In many countries, app installation
happens when you buy the phone.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.870
Three or four apps are side-loaded
at the outset, and that's it.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.900
In other countries,
you may have access to an app store, but

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.900
over the air data is expensive and
wi-fi can be difficult to find.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.750
Downloading and updating apps
can be a significant challenge.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.770
Even in North America and Europe,
many users by multiple app

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.630
when they get a new phone, then the
purchases trickle off to almost nothing.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.610
When a user clicks on a link in
the browser, they don't have to make any

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.050
heavy weight choices up front, and they
don't implicitly sign up for anything.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.130
Progressive web apps, are just websites
that took all the right vitamins.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.630
They add new capabilities, like being
top level in the task switcher, or

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.040
on the home screen, and
in the notification tray.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.326
Beyond the Rack, who recently
added push notifications saw

00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:50.250
a 72% increase in time spent and a 26%

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.140
increase in average spend per visit for
users arriving via push notifications.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.700
And repeat visits went
up by more than 50%.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.500
Flip Cart, India's largest e-commerce
company switched from an app

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.905
only strategy to launch Flip Cart Light,
a progressive web app.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:16.650
63% of Flip Cart Light users
reach the site via 2G network.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.310
So a fast user experience was essential.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.370
To decrease load times Flip Cart
added service workers and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.510
streamlined the site to
help consumers quickly

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.250
reach the product they were looking for
by using three times less data.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.360
Users can even continue
to browse categories,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.340
review previous searches, and
view products all while offline.
