00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.340
The game of Jeopardy
has three rounds.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.379
Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, where
the dollar values are doubled,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.790
and Final Jeopardy,
when contestants

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:26.070
can wager an amount of money
on one single question.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.800
Each round has five
questions in six categories.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.170
It consists of a wide
variety of topics,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.710
over 2,500 different categories.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.630
Each question has dollar value.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.950
The first to buzz in and answer
correctly wins the money.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.380
If they answer incorrectly,
they lose the money.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.380
An example of a round involves
the following categories:

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.830
Dinosaurs, Notable Women,
Oxford English Dictionary,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.770
Name That Instrument, Belgium,
and Composers by Country.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.970
The type of questions
Jeopardy includes,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.459
includes cryptic definitions
of categories and clues.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.680
And the answer is in
the form of a question.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.500
Let me give you two examples.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.930
Question is: Mozart's last and
perhaps most powerful symphony

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.840
shares its name
with this planet.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.740
The answer should be,
"What is Jupiter?"

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.550
Another example: smaller
than only Greenland,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.620
it's the world's
second largest island.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.400
And the answer,
"What is New Guinea?"

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.320
Welcome back.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.080
Ken, you've got your
signalling device ready I see.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.170
Here are the categories
for you to select

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.170
from in Double Jeopardy.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.140
First off, Etude, Brute.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.550
Next, Hedgehog-Podge.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.289
Don't Worry About It.

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.630
The Art of the Steal.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.320
Cambridge.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.440
And finally, "Church" &amp; "State"
with each of those words

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.410
in quotation marks.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.210
Start us off.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.590
Let's try "Don't
Worry About It",

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.750
all the down at $2,000, Alex.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.200
It's just acne!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.900
You don't have this skin
infection also known

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.900
as Hansen's disease.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.699
Watson.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.150
What is leprosy?

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.110
You are right.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.610
"Etude, Brute" for $1,600.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.220
Music fans wax rhapsodic
about this Hungarian's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.720
"transcendental etudes."

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.560
Watson.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.900
Who is Franz Liszt?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.800
You are right.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.020
"Don't Worry About
It" for $1,600.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.420
You're just a little stiff!

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.640
You don't have this painful
mosquito-borne joint illness

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.460
with a Swahili name.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.340
Watson.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.730
What is Dengue Fever.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.950
Dengue Fever, correct.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.590
"Etude, Brute" for $1,200.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.400
Paganini's "24 Capricci"
set the standard for etudes

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.240
for this instrument.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.950
Watson.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.990
What is violin?

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.540
Good.
