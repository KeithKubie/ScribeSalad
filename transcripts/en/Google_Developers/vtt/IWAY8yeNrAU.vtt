TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.590
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'd like to thank you

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.620
for helping "The Dev Show"
get to its 50th episode.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.910
Thank you.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.160
Please keep clicking and
sharing so we can bring you

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.650
another 50 updates about
the coolest developer news

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.940
from Google.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.130
Here's this last week.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.870
We recently rolled
out the final update

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.270
to the Android 7.1
Developer Preview.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.790
It includes the developer
features already available

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.110
on Pixel and Pixel XL devices,
and adds optimizations and bug

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.454
fixes on top of the base
Android 7.1 platform.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:33.120
For more information
on what's included,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.100
check out the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.300
The Google Maps APIs
have several services

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.610
that you can use to
convert addresses into

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
coordinates-- the Geocoding API,
the Place Autocomplete Service

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.589
and Places API, and the Place
Search service in Places API.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.630
To better understand the
differences between them

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.860
and when you should use each
one, take a look at the post.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.290
We introduced the next
generation of universal app

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.980
campaigns to help you show your
apps to the iOS and Android

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.280
customers that matter most
based on your specific business

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.090
goals.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.880
Now we've got new innovations
to make your holiday app

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.190
campaigns more
engaging and effective,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.200
covering immersive
video ads, new ways

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.090
to showcase your
app on Google Play,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.130
and using Play data
to find users who

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.840
are likely to make a purchase.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.490
Details are on the post.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.110
And while you're
at it, check out

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.540
some Display Ads
innovations, as well,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.090
including catalog
experiences with Gmail ads,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.670
and responsive ads.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.370
Chrome will soon mark
non-secure pages containing

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.200
password and credit
card input fields

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
as Not Secure in the URL bar.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.470
You should really update your
site to avoid this warning.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.010
For some help with that,
check out this post.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.350
Firebase App Indexing
for Personal Content

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.010
lets users find personal content
like messages, notes, music,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.000
and more across apps like Open
Table, Ticketmaster, Evernote,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.820
and Gmail from a
single search box.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.880
And now, it's available
to all Android developers.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.330
Starting with version 10.0,
the Firebase App Indexing API

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.450
on Android lets you
add your app content

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.630
to Google's on-device
index in the background,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.770
and update it in real time as
users make changes in the app.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.030
Getting started is easy, and
the details are on the post.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.550
You can now start using
Firebase Test Lab for Android

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.870
at no charge.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.320
deploy, update, and delete
resources like Google Compute

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.860

Google BigQuery, Google Cloud

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.290
Storage, and Google Cloud SQL.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.970

manage and automate

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.410
your cloud environment.

Skylake-- in early 2017.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.210
The upcoming Xeon Processor
is an excellent choice

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.250
for graphics
rendering, simulations,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.920
and any CPU-intensive workload.
