This is an example of a creative thinking test, the alternate uses test. This

00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:07.992
test consists of a list of everyday objects, such as a brick or a newspaper,

00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:11.112
and asks the person to come up with as many different uses for an object as

00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:16.361
they can in a three minute period. The answers are scored on how original they

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:20.682
are as compared to thousands of other responses people have given. How many

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:23.626
answers they can come up with and how flexible their answers are meaning, how

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:28.731
many different categories of answers people can come up with. Now creative

00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:32.761
people have more ideas, more flexible ideas and more original ideas than less

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.729
creative people.
