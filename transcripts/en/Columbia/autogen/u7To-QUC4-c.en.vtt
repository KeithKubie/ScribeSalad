to us about the project and it reduced
 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.089
to us about the project and it reduced
us to oral history and the different

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099
us to oral history and the different
 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.550
us to oral history and the different

early on about 1983 1984 so we had a

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:24.949
early on about 1983 1984 so we had a
 

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:27.189
early on about 1983 1984 so we had a
fairly intimate knowledge of the

these doctors was have a kind of
 

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.150
these doctors was have a kind of
credibility that went beyond journalism

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160
credibility that went beyond journalism
 

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.760
credibility that went beyond journalism
that when you sat down with them you

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:09.770
that when you sat down with them you
 

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.920
that when you sat down with them you
could communicate you could broadcast

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:11.930

the fact that you really knew about AIDS

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480
the fact that you really knew about AIDS

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:18.670
about their research you could ask
 

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.820
about their research you could ask
scientific and personal questions which

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:21.830
scientific and personal questions which
 

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.260
scientific and personal questions which
were based on this kind of deep

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:23.270
were based on this kind of deep
 

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.329
were based on this kind of deep
knowledge and I think that was very

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:25.339
knowledge and I think that was very
 

00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:28.540
knowledge and I think that was very
helpful in getting them to answer more

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:28.550
helpful in getting them to answer more
 

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.870

particularly for these doctors who have
been interviewed many times they have

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:44.779
been interviewed many times they have
 

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:48.910
been interviewed many times they have
stock answers you may want to ask the

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920
stock answers you may want to ask the
 

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.070
stock answers you may want to ask the
same questions but you don't want the

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:51.080
same questions but you don't want the
 

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.760
same questions but you don't want the
stock answer and therefore you really

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:54.770
stock answer and therefore you really
 

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.079
stock answer and therefore you really
had to think about how you're going to

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:56.089
had to think about how you're going to
 

00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:57.790
had to think about how you're going to

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.729
to go through the list of questions you
may begin with the same questions but

may begin with the same questions but
 

00:13:23.739 --> 00:13:28.799
may begin with the same questions but

very intense interviews you had covered

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:56.049
very intense interviews you had covered
 

00:13:56.049 --> 00:13:58.019
very intense interviews you had covered
those questions but not in any

00:13:58.019 --> 00:13:58.029
those questions but not in any
 

00:13:58.029 --> 00:14:02.220
those questions but not in any
particular order one of the things that

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:02.230
particular order one of the things that
 

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.780
particular order one of the things that
was nothing interesting was the purpose

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:06.790
was nothing interesting was the purpose
 

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.470
was nothing interesting was the purpose
that thing's questionnaire served you

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480
that thing's questionnaire served you
 

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.409
that thing's questionnaire served you
went in with a structure which was often

00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:13.419
went in with a structure which was often
 

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.819
went in with a structure which was often
useful because while some of these

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:14.829
useful because while some of these
 

00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:16.850
useful because while some of these
doctors have been interviewed many times

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860
doctors have been interviewed many times
 

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.619
doctors have been interviewed many times
I would say that the majority of the

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:19.629
I would say that the majority of the
 

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:22.229
I would say that the majority of the
doctors had never been interviewed they

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:22.239
doctors had never been interviewed they
 

00:14:22.239 --> 00:14:24.389
doctors had never been interviewed they
were not famous they were office space

00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399
were not famous they were office space
 

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:28.799
were not famous they were office space
or Hospital doctors and and basically

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:28.809
or Hospital doctors and and basically
 

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:32.869
or Hospital doctors and and basically
they were composing their autobiography

00:14:32.869 --> 00:14:32.879
they were composing their autobiography
 

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:37.759
they were composing their autobiography
in this in this interview and so the

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:37.769
in this in this interview and so the
 

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:41.069
in this in this interview and so the
questionnaire that and the research

00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079
questionnaire that and the research
 

00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:44.460
questionnaire that and the research
allowed you to provide the skeleton

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:44.470
allowed you to provide the skeleton
 

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:49.260
allowed you to provide the skeleton
of of this autobiography often this was

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.270
of of this autobiography often this was
 

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.240
of of this autobiography often this was
the first time that these doctors had

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:51.250
the first time that these doctors had
 

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.400
the first time that these doctors had
actually spoken to anyone in this kind

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.410
actually spoken to anyone in this kind
 

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:02.640
actually spoken to anyone in this kind
of full way about their experiences and

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:02.650
of full way about their experiences and
 

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.920
of full way about their experiences and
the number of them afterwards actually

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:04.930
the number of them afterwards actually
 

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:09.510
the number of them afterwards actually
wrote wrote of their experiences I think

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:09.520
wrote wrote of their experiences I think
 

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.790
wrote wrote of their experiences I think
we actually influenced them to do that

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800
we actually influenced them to do that
 

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.940
we actually influenced them to do that
so because it was the first time for

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:17.950
so because it was the first time for
 

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.130
so because it was the first time for
these and because we could ask questions

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:20.140
these and because we could ask questions
 

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.490
these and because we could ask questions
of leaking of the veterans of interviews

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500
of leaking of the veterans of interviews
 

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.730
of leaking of the veterans of interviews
these were very intense interviews said

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:26.740
these were very intense interviews said
 

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.500
these were very intense interviews said
the average four hours some were you

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.510
the average four hours some were you
 

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.540

these doctors tell us things that they
 

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.880
these doctors tell us things that they
probably had told very few people if any

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:29.890
probably had told very few people if any
 

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.710
probably had told very few people if any
one else and there were moments when the

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720

they were they as they talked about
 

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.000
they were they as they talked about
patients as the talk about events they

patients as the talk about events they
 

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.689
patients as the talk about events they
began to weep the

00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699

I began to tremble and they excused
 

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:55.009
I began to tremble and they excused
themselves men and women but it was a

00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019
themselves men and women but it was a
 

00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:59.109
themselves men and women but it was a
very intense and emotional interchange

00:16:59.109 --> 00:16:59.119
very intense and emotional interchange
 

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:01.549
very intense and emotional interchange
and to me one of the things I was really

00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:01.559
and to me one of the things I was really
 

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:04.879
and to me one of the things I was really
interesting was this is not true of

00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:04.889
interesting was this is not true of
 

00:17:04.889 --> 00:17:07.750
interesting was this is not true of
other doctors have interviewed but

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760
other doctors have interviewed but
 

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.939
other doctors have interviewed but
doctors are trained to be in control

00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:10.949
doctors are trained to be in control
 

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:12.980
doctors are trained to be in control
even if they don't know what they're

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:12.990
even if they don't know what they're
 

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.179
even if they don't know what they're
doing they're trained to be in control

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:14.189
doing they're trained to be in control
 

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:16.730
doing they're trained to be in control
and so I thought there would be a

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740
and so I thought there would be a
 

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.699
and so I thought there would be a
difficulty here and yet in almost all

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:19.709
difficulty here and yet in almost all
 

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:25.279
difficulty here and yet in almost all
cases but maybe two that was not so it

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:25.289
cases but maybe two that was not so it
 

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:28.850
cases but maybe two that was not so it
was quite remarkable of that once once

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860
was quite remarkable of that once once
 

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.149
was quite remarkable of that once once
we got into the interview something

00:17:32.149 --> 00:17:32.159
we got into the interview something
 

00:17:32.159 --> 00:17:34.759
we got into the interview something
happened and it was almost always

00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:34.769
happened and it was almost always
 

00:17:34.769 --> 00:17:36.409
happened and it was almost always
uniform and maybe other people who've

00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:36.419

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:42.320
done if you see this too we would start
with certain stock questions it was just

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.330

the tape is going and and then we start

00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:00.929
the tape is going and and then we start
 

00:18:00.929 --> 00:18:05.899
the tape is going and and then we start
talking we would have an interchange and
