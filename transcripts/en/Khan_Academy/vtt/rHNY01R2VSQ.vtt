00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:02.573
- Which expressions are equivalent

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:06.860
to x plus two-y plus x plus two?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.867
Select all that apply. Alright.

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:13.281
Let's see if I can manipulate
this thing a little bit.

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:16.657
Let me just rewrite it so I have x plus...

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:21.611
x plus two-y plus x plus two.

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:23.379
So, the first thing that jumps out at me,

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:24.637
before I even look at these choices,

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:27.299
here I have an x over here,
I have an x over there.

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:29.351
Well, if I have one x, and
then I can add it to another x

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:32.846
that would be two-x so
I could rewrite this...

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:34.350
let me do this in a different color.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.376
I could rewrite this x and this x,

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:40.078
if I add them together
that's going to be two-x.

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:43.471
So, this is...actually, I
don't want to skip any steps.

00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.945
So, that's x plus x plus two-y...

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.242
now I'm just switching
the order...plus two.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:51.517
And then these two x's right over here,

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.220
I can just rewrite that as two-x.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.575
So, I have two-x plus two-y...

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.955
plus two-y plus two.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:03.240
Now, let's see, out of all my choices...

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.767
so, this one,

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:10.247
this is two-x plus four-y plus four.

00:01:10.247 --> 00:01:13.581
So, that's not right, I have
two-x plus two-y plus 2,

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:15.247
so I can rule this one out.

00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:16.871
Now, this one's interesting, it looks like

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:17.950
they have factored out a two.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.509
Let's see if we factor out
a two here, what happens?

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.642
So, we do see that two
is a factor of that term,

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:25.507
it's a factor of that term,
and it's a factor of that term.

00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:28.717
So, let's see if we can factor it out.

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:32.516
So, this is going to be two times x,

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:37.373
I'll do the x in that same
magenta color, two times x plus,

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:40.847
we have just a y left when
you factor out the two.

00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:42.350
And then if you factor out a two here,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.895
you're just going to have a one left.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.983
So, two times x plus y plus one.

00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:49.705
Which is exactly what they have over here.

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:51.513
And since I was able to find a choice,

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:56.355
I will not pick "None of the above".
