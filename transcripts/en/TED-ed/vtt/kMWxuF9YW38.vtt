00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:15.966
My wife is pregnant right
now with our first child,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.351
and when people see her
with her big baby bump,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.205
the first question people ask,
almost without fail, is,

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.806
"Is it a boy or is it a girl?"

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.307
Now, there are some assumptions
behind that question

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.489
that we take for granted

00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:30.140
because of our familiarity
with our own human biology.

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.899
For human babies, we take it for granted
that there's a 50/50 chance

00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:35.976
of either answer, boy or girl.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.498
But why is it that way?

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:40.976
Well, the answer depends
on the sex determination system

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.637
that has evolved for our species.

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:43.976
You see, for most mammals,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.591
the sex of a baby
is determined genetically

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:48.487
with the XY chromosome system.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.043
Mammals have a pair of sex chromosomes,

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:53.459
one passed down from mom,
and one from dad.

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:54.976
A pair of X's gives us a girl,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.655
and an X and a Y together gives us a boy.

00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:01.679
Since females only have X's to pass
on in their egg cells,

00:01:01.703 --> 00:01:04.822
and males can give either an X
or a Y in their sperm cells,

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:06.976
the sex is determined by the father

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.791
and the chance of producing
a male or a female is 50/50.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:13.455
This system has worked well for mammals,

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.222
but throughout the tree of life,
we can see other systems

00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:18.958
that have worked just
as well for other animals.

00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:22.506
There are other groups of animals
that also have genetic sex determination,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.048
but their systems can be
pretty different from ours.

00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:28.745
Birds and some reptiles have
their sex genetically determined,

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:31.008
but instead of the sex
being determined by dad,

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:32.711
their sex is determined by mom.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:35.976
In those groups,
a pair of Z sex chromosomes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.976
produces a male, so these males
only have Z's to give.

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:44.770
However, in these animals,
one Z and one W chromosome together,

00:01:44.794 --> 00:01:46.575
as a pair, produces a female.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.083
In this system, the chance of a male
or a female is still 50/50,

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:53.791
it just depends on whether
mom puts a Z or a W

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:54.976
into her egg.

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:58.606
Certain groups have taken
genetic sex determination

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.976
in completely other directions.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.976
Ants, for example, have
one of the most interesting systems

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.390
for determining sex, and because of it,
if you are a male ant,

00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:09.243
you do not have a father.

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.516
In an ant colony, there
are dramatic divisions of labor.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.745
There are soldiers that defend the colony,

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.293
there are workers that collect food,
clean the nest and care for the young,

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:21.416
and there's a queen and a small group
of male reproductives.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.776
Now, the queen will mate and then
store sperm from the males.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.324
And this is where the system
gets really interesting.

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:30.714
If the queen uses the stored
sperm to fertilize an egg,

00:02:30.738 --> 00:02:32.976
then that egg will grow up
to become female.

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:35.976
However, if she lays an egg
without fertilizing it,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.652
then that egg will still
grow up to be an ant,

00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:40.976
but it will always be a male.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.976
So you see, it's impossible
for male ants to have fathers.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.976
And male ants live their life like this,
with only one copy of every gene,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.622
much like a walking sex cell.

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:51.976
This system is called
a haplodiploid system,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.976
and we see it not only in ants,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.430
but also in other highly social
insects like bees and wasps.

00:02:59.092 --> 00:03:01.045
Since our own sex is determined by genes,

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.784
and we do know of these other animals
that have their sex determined by genes,

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:06.976
it's easy to assume that for all animals

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.976
the sex of their babies still
must be determined by genetics.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.913
However, for some animals, the question
of whether it will be a boy or a girl

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:15.729
has nothing to do with genes at all,

00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:19.108
and it can depend on something
like the weather.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.128
These are animals like alligators
and most turtles.

00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:25.945
In these animals, the sex
of an embryo in a developing egg

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.692
is determined by the temperature.

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:30.126
In these species, the sex of the baby

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.404
is not yet determined
when the egg is laid,

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:35.376
and it remains undetermined
until sometime in the middle

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.929
of the overall development period,
when a critical time is reached.

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:41.714
And during this time, the sex
is completely determined

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:43.528
by temperature in the nest.

00:03:43.552 --> 00:03:45.076
In painted turtles, for example,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.976
warm temperatures
above the critical temperature

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.977
will produce females within the eggs,

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:52.458
and cool temperatures will produce a male.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.561
I'm not sure who came up
with this mnemonic,

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.377
but you can remember that when
it comes to painted turtles,

00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:00.508
they are all hot chicks and cool dudes.

00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:04.976
For some tropical fish, the question
of will it be a boy or will it be a girl

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.810
isn't settled until even later in life.

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:10.837
You see, clownfish all start
out their lives as males,

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.976
However, as they mature,
they become female.

00:04:14.452 --> 00:04:18.269
They also spend their lives in small
groups with a strict dominance hierarchy

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:20.976
where only the most dominant
male and female reproduce.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.391
And amazingly, if the dominant
female in the group dies,

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:27.729
the largest and most dominant male
will then quickly become female

00:04:27.753 --> 00:04:30.360
and take her place,
and all of the other males

00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:32.245
will move up one rank in the hierarchy.

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:35.396
In another very different ocean animal,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.483
the green spoonworm,

00:04:36.507 --> 00:04:38.241
the sex of the babies is determined

00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:40.698
by a completely different aspect
of the environment.

00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:43.991
For this species, it is simply
a matter of where a larva

00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:46.837
happens to randomly fall on the sea floor.

00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:50.516
If a larva lands on the open sea floor,
then it will become a female.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.338
But if it lands on top of a female,
then it will become a male.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.976
So for some species,
the question of boy or girl

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.617
is answered by genetics.

00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:01.941
For others, it's answered
by the environment.

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:05.421
And for others still, they don't even
bother with the question at all.

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:07.157
Take whiptail lizards, for example.

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.685
For those desert lizards,
the answer is easy.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.841
It's a girl. It's always a girl.

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.927
They are a nearly all-female species,
and although they still lay eggs,

00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:18.566
these eggs hatch out
female clones of themselves.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.329
So will it be a girl or will it be a boy?

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.501
Throughout the entire animal kingdom,

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:26.683
it does really all depend
on the system of sex determination.

00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:29.806
For humans, that system
is a genetic XY system.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.976
And for me and my wife, we found out

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.520
it's going to be a baby boy.

00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:35.761
