00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.240
Toking up during pregnancy sounds like a hella
chill way to stop that morning sickness in

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.250
it's tracks, not to mention the ankle and
lower-back pain; but are there side-effects

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.570
for the bun in the oven?

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.949
Howdy preggo people and their partners and
pals, Trace here proffering for DNews.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.539
Pregnancy comes with a lot of physiological
changes.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.609
Some women have problems with severe vomiting,
nausea, lack of appetite, and pain during

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.739
pregnancy; one study found more than 21-percent
of women experience severe symptoms!

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.870
A quick search will bring up stories of women
who choose to use cannabis medicinally to

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.120
help keep food down -- which, they argue,
ultimately helps the fetus.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
Other women choose cannabis over other drugs
to manage their pains.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.961
As of June of 2016, weed is legal for either
medicinal or recreational use (or both) in

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.690
half of the states plus the District of Columbia.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.250
It's now a billion dollar business in Colorado
alone and is, more generally, the most used

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.130
"illicit" drug in the U.S.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.220
Because it has never been legal on such a
scale, people are getting curious about when

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.760
it's okay to toke up, and when it's not; and
slowly (as it often does) science is weighing

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.760
in.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.200
According to a new study in Biological Psychiatry,
as much as 13-percent of women worldwide use

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.430
cannabis during pregnancy.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.899
Pregnancy is already rife with rules, restrictions
and requirements for mothers, but now thanks

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.889
to this study, there's another: maybe don't
toke up when pregnant.

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:26.990
Their research compared children who'd been
exposed to tobacco while in the womb, and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.690
children who'd been exposed to cannabis while
in the womb.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.530
The results showed children exposed to cannabis
had thicker frontal cortices.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.799
Though, to be honest, it's not clear what
that means.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.999
Some scientists have associated thicker frontal
cortices with higher intelligence, and better

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.509
executive attention, while others have associated
it with lower intelligence in youth and then

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.029
higher in middle age.

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:52.270
And still others warn that assuming physical
structures tell us anything about intelligence

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.029
is akin to phrenology -- the study of bumps
on the scalp to tell the future.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.279
Obviously, this isn't the only study on weed,
women and wombs.

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:05.319
An oft-cited study from 1994 of only 42 Jamaican
children found no measurable difference in

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:11.360
the children of pot-smoking moms and non-pot-smoking
moms that couldn't be explained by socioeconomic

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
status.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.080
But other studies have shown newborns of toking
moms tremble more, have different responses

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.200
to stimuli, and have neurological deficiencies
in areas of problem solving, memory, and attention.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.930
The World Health Organization says, "Children
exposed to cannabis in utero demonstrate impaired

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.460
attention, learning and memory, impulsivity
and behavioral problems and higher likelihood

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.240
of using cannabis when they mature."

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.990
And even though marijuana can help appetite,
nausea, and vomiting for cancer patients,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.820
it's important to mention, some states will
remove children from parents if the newborn

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.890
tests positive for THC in their stool.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.210
Obviously, we can not and would not call any
of this "medical advice"; we're not doctors.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.440
But the American Medical Association, the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.550
World Health Organization all recommend against
preggo pot use.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.900
Regardless, as the nation's grip on control
over marijuana loosens and it becomes legal,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.590
decriminalized, or openly accessible in more
places, women may choose to self-medicate

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.510
with marijuana for pregnancy-associated complications.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.340
And because the science is still ongoing,
no one can provide these women with the true

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.500
risks of that behavior, which preliminary
findings seem to indicate do exist.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.640
More research is desperately needed, like,
yesterday.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.030
Unfortunately, there are so many confounding
variables and unknowns in pregnancy, for now,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.840
true scientific conclusions are caught in
a bit of a purple haze.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920
Look, sometimes, when people get a little
weed and then they get a little frisky, what

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920
if you're pregnant?

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920
Can you

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920
||whisper||

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.920
still have sex?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.920
SURE!!

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.640
Find out why it's a-OK right here with my
girl Natalia!

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.010
Are you worried about a pregnancy diet?

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.010
Drugs?

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.010
Exercise?

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.010
Sleeping?

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.610
What's tickling your curiosity about the human
experience?
