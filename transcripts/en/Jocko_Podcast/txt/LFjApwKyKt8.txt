Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Just remind me to never complain about anything ever again. You know what I mean? Yeah. Don't, don't, don't let me complain about anything ever again. I mean, I don't consider myself a big complainer, but come on, this is just, we have no reason to complain about anything. Yeah, yeah man. What's crazy too is one of the heavier parts there where I felt it was when he talked about the claustrophobia heart. Yeah. I know you have an issue with, Dang it, it's there, but he's not saying it's not, I'm not super sensitive to it, but it's something I know. I feel that, that, that's like a tough one to get over, you know? Yeah. And especially going through all that stuff first and Dayton, you got to deal with the cla. I Dunno, man. This might be too heavy for me. Well, it was too heavy for a lot of people and yeah, I mean it's almost like you, you, we almost don't need to have a discussion about this book.

Speaker 1:          01:02          You know, magnus just stopped talking about it. Everyone go read it. I get it. You know, and just, let's move on. You know, because like I said, it just makes you realize just what kind of suffering there can be and how good you've got it. How good you've got it. I'm going to go to bed tonight in my bed and it's going to feel good. You feel good to appreciate that I'm appreciated every night. Yup. Yeah, so cause you think about like some little things you don't even think about, but they're like a real luxury. It's just things that you really enjoy but you don't even think about it. They're just, they're just like a whatever. Like for me, I really like a nice cold, you know, big a bottle of water. You know, I have a big, just a big bottle of water. I completely take it for granted.

Speaker 1:          01:58          When I go to work out in the morning, I dropped a couple of ice cubes in there and fill it up. It's all nice and filtered and whatnot. Oh I don't think anything about that. You know, that would be like Heaven, heaven. And then you get D, You know, you go to bed at night, you just crawl into the, to the, the 500 thread sheets or I don't know, there's some, there's some kind of sheets that are in this, but whatever they are kind of cotton sheets that are all nice. Yeah. Declining to those. You don't think about that. You're not thankful for that every night. Yeah. Pit pretty much everything. Like I said, pretty much everything. Even like, Oh yeah, you know how you're breathing right now. Look at, consider that compared to that. What you just read there? Just, we'll just breathing. Listen, let's just start with that.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Let's just break it down with air. Yeah. That's the beginning. And I remember, um, the cable guy was coming [inaudible], which already sounds silly. I know. And um, and he was late. He was supposed to come this to was the cutoff, right? Where he was going to cut it. It was like, you know, before the struggle is real. The cable guy was late. Yeah. So he can't, I don't know, two 15 or something, and I had to go, I want to see it go to workout or something. This is getting worse and worse than no. This the [inaudible]. Yeah. For my 15 minutes later, he's, you know, he's, he's fixing, not fixing for an unannounced. Yeah. And yeah, and that's one of the things I thought of primarily when you said, think of all the little luxuries. So not only, I'm not only am I complaining about something I don't need, I'm complaining about something that I'm kidding. Like a supreme luxury. I'm complaining about that, you know, because it didn't come out 15 minutes of all things, um, before the time that it did.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Yeah. I'm going to check myself to good idea. I'm going to check myself too.
