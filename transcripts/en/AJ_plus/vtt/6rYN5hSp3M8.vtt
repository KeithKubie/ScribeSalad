00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Bankruptcy is expensive AF. For many
consumers bankruptcy is out of reach

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.840
entirely. The idea that they would ever
be able to come up with the money in

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.549
order to pay for a lawyer either for
chapter 7 or for chapter 13 is not a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.750
realistic possibility. Commercials like
this one are aimed at the financially

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.160
perilous looking for a way out. But with
the evolution of bankruptcy law, how much

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.510
of a new beginning does bankruptcy
actually give people? I had to file

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.619
bankruptcy twice. I was like, "I have to
file bankruptcy all my bankruptcy! Who

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.469
does that?" So I just felt like
a failure. Hey fam,

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.710
I'm Imaeyen. And this Sunday we're
exploring the complicated history of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.360
personal bankruptcy law and how it
affects how lawyers get paid.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.000
That's about as painful as a bankrupt
gets.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.730
Pat Sajak is wrong. Bankruptcy can and
often does get much worse.  On "Wheel of

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.480
Fortune" bankruptcy is just a part of the
puzzles game of chance.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.220
In reality, bankruptcy is a tool for survival 
for those who owe debt and are

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.520
unable to repay it. And the IRL Wheel of
Fortune can cause bankruptcy with

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.960
something as mundane as unpaid parking
tickets. I felt like I was stuck between

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.250
a rock and a hard place. Whenever you
have to do something that drastic is

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.220
with filing bankruptcy, I just felt like, "Why me? Why am I in this situation?" It

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.080
makes you feel like you're not good
enough.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.650
Rachael White was a full-time dental
assistant getting only part-time hours

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.479
when she filed for bankruptcy in 2016.
The mother of two now-teenage boys was

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.310
making only $12 an hour,
and she'd accumulated about $1,500 in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.410
parking penalties since 2015 -- penalties
she didn't even know she was getting.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.840
They won't have the signs where you can,
where you can see them visually, you know,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.430
throughout the street. So I would park
and I wouldn't see any signs necessarily,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.090
and I would end up getting a ticket. The
citations were being sent to an address

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.959
where her car was registered, but where
she no longer lived. White thought

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.400
bankruptcy was her best option to stay
afloat -- and keep her car which she used

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.880
for freelance gigs like driving for uber.
When I initially filed bankruptcy,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.350
I had like tunnel vision. The only
thing that I was concerned about is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.910
keeping what I had. I didn't really have
the means to just go get another car at

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.959
that time, and I was just honestly I was
drowning. I was just trying to stay

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.530
afloat. White knew where she'd go to get
help. Debtstoppers. DebtStoppers. You know that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.680
song just kept running over and over and
over again in my head.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.070
She'd heard commercials for a
self-described debt relief agency based

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.540
in Chicago called DebtStoppers. She'd
heard their radio ads and seen their

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.320
television pitches like this one: DebtStoppers is one of the nation's leading

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.190
bankruptcy law firms. We've helped
thousands of families stop foreclosure,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.400
repossession, and wage garnishment. An
initial $350 filing fee got DebtStoppers

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.980
to work with White. They found
her counsel, and she had to pay a

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.120
separate fee to that lawyer. Her
bankruptcy case made her one of the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.140
thousands in the U.S. who've gone through
the process of looking to discharge debt --

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.170
aka be released a personal liability of
debt to creditors. In 2016, more than

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.099
three-quarters of a million people filed
for bankruptcy. That's the equivalent of

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.659
about 28 percent of Chicago's population.
That stat includes all bankruptcy

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.299
filings like Chapter 7 ,11, 12, and 13.
Bankruptcy law expert Megan McDermott

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.140
says there are only two options
available to someone overwhelmed by

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.260
consumer debt. You either file for
Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. So there are a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.959
couple of important differences. Chapter
7 is a relatively quick inexpensive and

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.870
streamlined proceeding to a discharge.
Usually from start to finish, a Chapter 7

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.370
bankruptcy typically takes at most six
months, assuming it's a relatively

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.109
straightforward case. Chapter 13 is more,
a more expensive and more time-consuming

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.049
process. The debtor is basically pledging
to pay a certain portion of their future

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.539
wages over a three-to-five year period
in order to pay off their existing

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.220
creditors. The difference is important
because the type of bankruptcy you

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.620
choose matters. And Congress has had a
big impact on which is most accessible

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.840
to you. Bankruptcy law's very long history
in the U.S. began when the flag only had

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.720
45 stars. The first bankruptcy law became
permanent in 1898. That national

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.070
Bankruptcy Act was the basis of the law
for the next 40 years. It was amended

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.430
during the next several decades,
including important changes during the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.760
period that gave us disco dancing like
this...

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.800
In 1978 when the code was enacted, I
think it did a fabulous job of providing

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.620
two very good options for consumers in
different situations. But since then,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.190
Congress and the courts have really
scaled back the protections that are

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.250
available to ordinary consumers. And I
think it is fair to say that it does not

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.680
provide the same relief that it did 40
years ago. Let's use student loans as an

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.510
example. Before 1978 you could discharge
all student loans through bankruptcy.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.000
After that year, you couldn't eliminate
government student loans. Then in 2005,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.960
new regulations meant you also couldn't
get rid of private student debt via

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.370
bankruptcy -- which is why some of you know
Sallie Mae so well. Congress tried to

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.970
move more people away from Chapter 7--
where all the eligible debt is

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.560
discharged -- to Chapter 13 -- where you're on
a years-long payment plan. The

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.210
progression has impacted some of the
most financially vulnerable people. Those

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.290
protections are not available
potentially to the people who need them

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.630
the most, which is low in very low income
debtors. Congress basically made certain

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.160
types of debtors ineligible for the
quick and easy relief under Chapter 7,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.270
and also took out some protections that
made it easy for low-income individuals

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.580
to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Legal
changes haven't only affected debtors

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.410
like White, who filed for Chapter 13
bankruptcy a second time in October 2017,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.210
because she couldn't afford to keep up
with the payment plan. Bankruptcy lawyers

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.280
incentives have changed significantly
since 1978. Basically when Congress

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.480
initially created the code, they put a
provision in place that debtors

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.600
attorneys would be able to collect. But
in 1994, Congress removed that explicit

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.440
language. Sometimes attorneys have added
language to bankruptcy plans that says

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.180
they must be paid before any outstanding
debt. So basically you could be paying a

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.320
bankruptcy plan for years that really
only pays off your attorney, your court

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.190
costs, and yet almost none of the
original debt that forced you into

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.350
bankruptcy in the first place, like in
this very real-life example. A man owed

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.680
about $5,000 to the city of Chicago in
parking tickets,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.389
and he filed for bankruptcy and he
proposed a plan in which he would pay

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.040
$4,300 over
the course of three years. And

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.060
$4,000 of those dollars were going to
pay his lawyer, and the remaining balance

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.400
went to pay administrative expenses. And
so you see these situations where the

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:30.240
the client is going into Chapter 13, and
the only one benefitting from this extra

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.840
time in an obviously extrajudicial
effort as well is the lawyer. Critics are

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.710
weary lawyers may steer clients to the
much more expensive, and lengthy, Chapter

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.810
13 process, even when Chapter 7 is in
their best interest.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.380
But others say, what the lawyers are
really doing when they pay themselves

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.240
first, is making sure their clients have
representation for the duration of their

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.889
bankruptcy plan -- having a lawyer on
retainer. White says she only remembers

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:03.090
being responsible for DebtStoppers and
her lawyers upfront fees during her

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.020
first bankruptcy. And she's unsure if her
payment plan included payouts to her

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.950
attorneys. We called DebtStoppers a few
times to talk about their payment

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.840
process, but they didn't return our phone
calls. When White filed a second time, she

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.460
got new representation and gave up the
car she tried so desperately to hold on

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:27.120
to during her first bankruptcy. To be in
a situation where a parking ticket, or a

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.860
moving violation dictates your
livelihood, is mind blowing. I sit

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:40.620
back and think I'm losing everything
over parking tickets. These days White

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.730
relies on public transportation to get
around. The bankruptcy process isn't one

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.140
White wants to go through again. But the
woman juggling multiple part-time jobs

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.520
is not sure she'll be able to avoid it.
Despite those odds, she's still hopeful

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.380
about her financial future. My life is
not going to be dictated by debt and

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:05.720
bankruptcies and I'm just ready to move
forward and just keep living. Work it!
