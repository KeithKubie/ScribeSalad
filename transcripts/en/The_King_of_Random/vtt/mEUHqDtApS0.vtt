00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.620
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're going to be taking
a look at how to fill up a balloon

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.247
from the outside using
a vacuum cleaner and a bucket,

00:00:05.247 --> 00:00:06.040
and then filling

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.080
the balloon with a bunch of 
things that wouldn't normally

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.700
fit inside a balloon.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.840
Normally, when you inflate a balloon,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.580
you're increasing the
pressure inside the balloon,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.920
and not doing anything
to the pressure outside it.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.100
Well today we'll build a device
that lets us do the opposite.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.860
We will decrease the pressure
outside the balloon

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.760
while leaving the pressure
inside the balloon the same.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.500
We should get the exact same
effect causing the balloon

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.160
to inflate even though the
mouth of the balloon will be

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.900
completely wide open.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.640
Here is the basic plan.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.360
The bucket should act as a sort of vacuum
chamber to the outside of the balloon.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.340
When we pull all the air
out of the bucket,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.680
the low pressure should
cause the balloon to expand.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.020
To start off, we're going
to need a large bucket,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.580
a plastic container 
with a decently wide mouth,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.040
and we're also going to be
using this plastic ball valve.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.480
If you don't want to use this, 
it's not 100% necessary

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.340
but I think it should make it easier.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.740
This container is what we're going
to use to attach our balloon

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500
onto the bucket lid.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.470
So the first thing we have to do is
cut the top off of the container

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.700
so it can be attached to the bucket.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.920
We now need to attach
this container top onto our bucket.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.820
And to do that, we want to cut a hole
in our bucket the same size

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.240
as the neck fit it up through the bucket
lid from the bottom

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.480
and then glue it in place
with some hot glue.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.880
There we go.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.860
Our little mouth is now in place so
let's glue it on with our hot glue gun.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.480
In addition to attaching
this piece onto the bucket lid,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.920
we also want to try and make an airtight
seal going all the way around.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.860
If it's not perfect, it should still work.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.780
It just won't work quite as well.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.740
We'll have this hole where the balloon
goes and where we can then

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.280
put other things inside of
the balloon while it's inflated.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.920
Next up.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.780
We need to add a spot
that lets us pull all of the air out.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.600
And for that, 
we've got this PVC ball valve.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.420
We're just going to drill a hole
the right size for the valve,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.320
and then glue this in place
down at the bottom of the bucket.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.960
Now you can make this work
without adding a valve.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.780
You can cut a hole into the bottom
and hold the vacuum hose up to it.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.680
It will suck the air out
that will inflate the balloon.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680
But if you want to be able to do anything, 
you're going to have

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.180
to leave the hose attached to the side
of the bucket with the vacuum running.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.080
Otherwise the pressure will equalize
and the balloon will just shrink again.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.760
With the ball valve glued
in place in the opening in the lid,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.660
we should be able
to start vacuuming this out.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.290
Let's give it a quick try
and just make sure that our air

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.040
flow is doing what we want it to.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.160
Oh yeah.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.780
Now what we need to do is stretch this balloon
neck all the way around this opening

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.520
that we added into our lid.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.760
At this point, if we attach the vacuum
on to our valve down here at the bottom,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.340
it's going to start pulling air
out of the bucket

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.900
and when that happens, there will be low
pressure in the bucket

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
and normal atmospheric
pressure inside the balloon.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.440
Normally atmospheric pressure is equal
to or less than what's inside a balloon.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.140
If you're not blowing into it, it's equal.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.920
If you are blowing into it, it's less.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.580
But we're going to alter the setup.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.260
So that what's inside the balloon
at atmospheric pressure

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.400
is still higher than what's around it.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.280
And that should cause it to inflate.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.380
All right.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.860
See if we can get this to inflate.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280
Beautiful.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.800
So the vacuum pulled all the air out
and while it was pulling,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.240
I turned the valve and we now have 
our balloon inflated inside the bucket

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.920
even though the top
of the balloon is wide open.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.020
The mouth of the balloon
is completely open.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.460
Look at this. Weeee.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.380
I can stick my arm down
inside the balloon with no resistance.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.480
Now this is pretty cool
and it's working really well.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.180
However, there is
a modification I want to make.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.460
And this isn't something that you need
to do if you're building one of these.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.139
This is just so we can see it better.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.110
I want to put a window into the side
of this bucket so we can

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.340
check out what's going on.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.400
This is an acrylic sheet that 
I just melted a little bit

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.340
with a heat gun to give it a little bit of curve.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.360
Now we're going to cut a hole
in the side of the bucket

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.700
and then we are going to use some very
strong tape to attach this here.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.620
And again this is not
a functional aspect of the build.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.720
This is just so we can watch
what's happening inside the bucket.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.100
We've got our window.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.320
Let's reattach our lid.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.600
Now that we can see what's
going on inside the bucket,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.880
let's try this again.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.780
Look at that.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.260
You can actually see the window
through the balloon.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.620
This balloon when fully inflated,
which it's definitely

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.040
not inside the bucket,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.920
it should be almost
three feet in diameter.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.480
So let the air back in
and watch this thing shrink.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.840
And I can stop it
by putting my hand on it.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.840
I can open it all the way
and just shrinks quickly.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.580
Let's blow that back up.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.780
Close the valve again.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.040
One of the interesting things
about blowing a balloon up

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.660
like this and of course leaving
the opening open is that you can then

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.820
put other things inside the balloon.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.580
Like I could blow up another full-size
balloon inside this balloon.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.160
Or if I wanted, I can
put some other things.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.080
And I'm going to actually try
and create a little design

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.700
that will go inside the balloon.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.839
After it's finished, I'll take the neck
of the balloon off of the top

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.020
of the bucket, all of the extra air will
rush out of course as the seal

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.440
is broken, then I'll remove the
balloon with the stuff inside it,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.340
and then I'll blow the balloon 
the rest of the way up.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.720
So we have a big clear
balloon with stuff inside it.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.760
So, let's give this a shot.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.820
Let's start with a bunch
of water balloons.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.640
Just gonna start throwing these in.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.700
These are only held
closed by rubber bands.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.500
Almost always enough
for water but for air,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.680
it can sometimes leak out.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.860
Next up, we've got a shark.

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:47.749
We're gonna try and fit the shark down in.

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:52.711
Now obviously the shark is uh... 
well he's not going to fit in like that.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.360
So we're going to have
to squish him a good bit.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.900
But before we do that,
there's another modification

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.000
I think we need.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.540
Sharks with frickin' lazers on their heads.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.660
Normally I would have to
do something to modify it.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.499
So I was constantly pushing down
the button but this laser pointer

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:09.069
was really really cheap and I
don't think it was very well made

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:12.509
because it just stays on all the time
as long as there batteries in it.

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.879
Not sure if hot glue is what Dr. Evil

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.200
had in mind for attaching the lasers
to the sharks heads but it works for us.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.640
Such a happy shark
with a laser on his head.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.940
Fortunately this shark is quite squishy.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.100
Okay.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.320
I think that'll do it.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.060
This thread is attached 
to the shark's head,

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:41.499
and we're going to actually leave
that outside of the balloon

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.620
because that's we're going
to try and use to suspend

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.480
the shark right where we want it.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.700
Now we're going to let
some of the air back in.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.300
That's starting to push the shark out.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.420
Okay instead of that, we're just
going to take our balloon neck

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.300
and peel it back up over the mouth here.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.900
So we've now got a shark and
a bunch of compressed balloons

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.100
inside a bigger balloon.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.680
We want to blow the bigger balloon back
up and we're going to use a pump to do that

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.340
rather than breath because breath
has a lot of moisture in it

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.140
and we want it to stay nice 
and clear on the inside.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.980
There is our shark with 
a fricken' laser on its head

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.560
floating around in it's
blue balloon water.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.420
Very cool.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.340
Blowing up a balloon from the outside
and filling it with all sorts of things.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.460
But I did get another idea
while I was filling this up.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.080
You know I used all of
these water balloons

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.820
and I just blew them up with air.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.780
I gotta try filling a balloon with water
balloons that are actually full of water.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.240
So yeah, let's try that.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.300
I'm going to end up 
with some extra water

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.080
just at the bottom of this
balloon but that's okay.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.820
Yeah.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.520
Like I was saying the extra
water that kind of sprays out.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.580
It was definitely surrounding all of them.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.300
So it's like a water balloon full
of smaller water balloons at this point.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.720
Try and pick it up.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.020
Hopefully it doesn't just pop.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:24.720
There we go.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:29.940
3

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:30.880
2

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.880
That worked better than I thought.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.260
I thought a lot of the smaller
balloons would survive.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.360
But I only see like one
maybe two that didn't explode.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.140
So just what I was hoping for.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.440
How to make a giant
water balloon grenade?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.779
Compound water balloon.

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:03.779
I don't know what to call it.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.120
But it was really fun.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.760
Bucket with a valve in a vacuum lets
you inflate a balloon from the outside

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.720
by lowering the pressure
around the balloon, the atmospheric

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.060
pressure inside the balloon
is enough to push it open.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.280
Very cool stuff.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.160
Guys, thanks for watching.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.520
We've got more for you to see though.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.700
That box at the top will take
you directly to our last video.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.880
You should go check that out.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.580
The box at the bottom will show 
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.760
you should be watching now.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.560
And this bomb in the middle is
how you subscribe to the channel.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.100
So you never miss out on the fun.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.000
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see the next one.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.639
Talk to you then.
