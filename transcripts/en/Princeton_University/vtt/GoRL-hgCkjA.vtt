OGE UDE: Music theater at
Princeton, and specifically

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.320
on this project, has
been a huge journey.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.960
So much of my focus has been on
theater projects and the dance

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.990
projects that I'm
working on at the time.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.600
It makes me make
sure that if I'm

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.810
going to go take a class,
if I'm going to do anything

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.190
academically, I need to
make sure I'm reflecting

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.430
on my artistic practice.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.540
And if I'm going to be
taking so much time doing

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.490
my artistic practice,
I need to be sure

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.380
that my academic work
is coming into it.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.760
The lesson to you
right now

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.720
is begin just recollecting
all that we did yesterday.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.280
It's really helped me in terms
of just becoming a better

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.690
listener, becoming more
aware of what's around me,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.160
and just trying to see and make
the connections in all that I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.710
do.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.180
I learn something in an English
class, and I'm just like,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.940
this makes so much more sense
to how I see this scene.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.640
And so it's just
been a great way

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.320
to channel in the entire
spectrum of my Princeton

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.500
education and then my
entire personal experience.
