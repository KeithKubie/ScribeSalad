00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.740
Let's think a little bit
about what the Big Bang

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.030
theory suggests.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.770
And then based on
the theory, what

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.370
we should be observing today.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.660
So the Big Bang starts with
all of the mass in space

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.465
in the universe, an
infinitely, an infinitely dense

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:15.965
singularity.

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:17.630
And a singularity
is just something

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.270
that the math doesn't
even apply to it.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.510
We don't even know how
to understand that.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.140
But immediately
after the Big Bang,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.830
so this occurred 13.7 billion
years ago, 13.7 billion years

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.390
ago, immediately after it, this
little tiny infinitely small

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.750
singularity begins to expand.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.780
And so the first 100,000
years, it's still pretty dense.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.550
So let me just to
show this right now.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.770
So then it starts to expand.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.790
So maybe it gets to this
level right over here.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.890
And I do not know if the entire
universe is infinite or finite,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.210
whether it's a four-dimensional
sphere, whether it goes

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.490
infinitely in every directions,
or whether it's just

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.320
slightly curved here and there
and maybe flat everywhere else.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.670
I won't go into all of that.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.140
But then it starts to
expand a little bit

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.015
from the singularity.

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:09.610
But it's still extremely dense.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.850
It's still extremely dense.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.210
So dense that atoms
can't even form.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.500
So you just have the basic
fundamental building blocks

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.000
of atoms.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.500
They're just all flying around.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.780
Electrons and protons, they're
just flying around in just

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.180
this ultra-hot, ultra-hot,
white hot I could say,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.540
or maybe even white hot plasma.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.815
So I'll call it
white hot plasma.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.430
And then if we fast
forward a little bit more.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.599
And now this is a point that
we think we understand well.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.890
But this number-- I actually
looked at some old physics

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.389
books.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:48.700
And this number has changed in
really the last 15, 20 years.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.300
So maybe it'll change more.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.070
But after 380,000 years from
the beginning of the Big Bang,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.420
300,000 years after
the Big Bang--

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.460
I'll call it the BB-- 380,000
years after the Big Bang,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.139
and obviously this is give
or take a couple of years,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.669
the universe expands enough, the
universe is now large enough--

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.210
and obviously, I'm
not drawing things

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.930
to scale-- the universe is now
large enough and sparse enough

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.740
that it can cool
down a little bit.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.540
You don't have as
much bumping around.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.160
It's still a hot place.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.820
But now, it cools down
enough that electrons

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.870
can be captured by a proton.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.360
And you could actually
have-- the first hydrogen

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.310
atoms can begin to form.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.430
The first hydrogen
atoms begin to form.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.755
They actually condense.

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:46.130
And we estimate this temperature
to be around 3,000 Kelvin.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.197
So we've cooled to 3,000 Kelvin.

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:50.280
But this is still a
temperature that you would not

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.113
want to hang out in.

00:02:51.113 --> 00:02:53.440
It's still extremely,
extremely hot.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.670
Now why is this moment
important, the first atoms

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.170
forming?

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.961
So let's think about
what's happening here.

00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:00.980
You have all of this
bumping and interactions.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.670
And if because of a bump,
or some energy release,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.270
or because of the
heat temperature,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.220
if a photon is released
it'll be immediately absorbed

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.840
by something else.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.472
If some energy gets
released, it'll

00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:13.180
immediately be absorbed
by something else

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.800
because the universe
is so dense,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.680
especially with
charged particles,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.767
Here, all of a sudden,
it's not that dense.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.600
So over here, things
that were being emitted

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.390
could not travel long distances.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.790
They would immediately
bump into something else.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.830
Well, you go over
here and the universe

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.650
is starting to look like
the universe we recognize.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.580
All of a sudden, if one
of these really hot--

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.290
and it's still nowhere near
as hot as this universe

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.870
over here-- but if one of
these hot atoms emits a photon,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.767
and they would because
they are at 3,000 Kelvin,

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.350
if they emit a photon,
all of a sudden

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.312
there's actually space
for that photon to travel.

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.520
So for the first time in
the history of the universe,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.960
380,000 years after the Big
Bang, you now have photons.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.530
You now have
electromagnetic radiation.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.500
You now have
information that can

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.545
travel over long,
long distances.

00:04:03.545 --> 00:04:04.920
So given that this
happened, it's

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.600
still roughly 13.7
billion years ago.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.230
380,000 years is not a lot
when you're talking about 13.7.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.545
It still wouldn't even
really change the dial

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.670
because we're talking in
the hundreds of thousands.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.644
0.7 is 700 million years.

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:20.310
So this is actually
a very small number.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.870
So it's still
approximately 13.7 billion.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.820
It's really 13.7
minus 380,000 years.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.560
But given that this was the
first time that information

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.490
could travel, that photons
could travel through space

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.262
without most of them having to
bump into something, especially

00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:37.720
something that's
probably charged--

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.178
the other interesting thing is
that these atoms that formed

00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:43.025
are now neutral-- what could
we expect to see today?

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:44.150
Well, let's think about it.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.240
These left.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.230
These photons were emitted
13.7 billion years ago.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.680
And they were emitted from
every point in the universe.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.595
So this is every
point in the universe.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.950
The universe was a
pretty uniform place

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.404
at that time, very
minor irregularities.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.820
But you could see because it
was this white-hot thing that

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.945
had just began to condense.

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:10.519
It hadn't formed a
lot of the structures

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.185
that we now associate
with the universe.

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:15.570
It was just kind of a
fairly uniform spread of,

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.655
at that time, reasonably
hot hydrogen atoms.

00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:20.280
So this is every
point in the universe.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.029
So let's think about
what's going on here.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.915
Let me draw another diagram.

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:26.290
So we're talking
about this point

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.870
in the universe right over here.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.350
The universe is, at even 380,000
years after the Big Bang,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.000
still much, much,
much, much smaller

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.460
than the universe today.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.210
But let's say that this is the
point in the universe where

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.530
we happen to be now.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.260
At this point in time,
there was no Earth,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.420
there was no solar system,
there was no Milky Way.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.270
It was just a bunch
of hot hydrogen atoms.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.370
Now if we were at this
point in the universe,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.340
there must been
points in the universe

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.995
at that exact same time that
were emitting this radiation.

00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:13.410
And actually, every
point in the universe

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.300
was emitting this radiation.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.050
The point of the
universe where we are now

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.000
is emitting this radiation.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.280
So the points that
were closer to us,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.750
it was emitting that radiation.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.500
But it got to us much sooner.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.750
It got to us billions
of years ago.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.755
But there are some points
that were far enough

00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:36.205
that that radiation must
be getting to us right now.

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:37.663
Or another way to
think about it is

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:41.820
that radiation has taken 13.7
billion years to reach us.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.970
So let me draw.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.499
So if I were to draw the
visible universe today--

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:47.290
and you know from the
video about the size.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.550
So it's not going
to be to scale.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.064
It would have to
be far, far larger

00:06:50.064 --> 00:06:51.230
than the circle I drew here.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.020
But let's say that this
is the visible universe.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.810
Let's say this is the
visible universe today.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.340
We should be receiving-- and
we're in the center of it

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.660
because we can always look
roughly the same distance

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.280
in every direction.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.470
We're not the center
of the universe.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.270
I want to be clear.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.810
We're the center of the
observable universe because we

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.710
can only observe the same
distance in all directions.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.590
Now, we're receiving some light
from 100,000 light years away.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.940
And then we're looking
100,000 years in the past.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.430
We should be receiving
some light that was first

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.284
emitted a million
light years before.

00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:26.450
And that's like looking a
million years in the past.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.539
Because the light we see was
emitted a million years ago.

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:30.830
I think that's a bit redundant.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.150
We could see light
that's just getting

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.570
to us after traveling
for a billion years.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.544
And so we're actually
looking at those objects

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:39.960
a billion years
ago because that's

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.126
when they emitted the light.

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:43.390
So the same way, we
could look at objects

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.400
that emitted their light
13.7 billion years ago,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.910
right at the beginning.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.650
Right at this stage
over here, right

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.620
after 380,000 years
after the Big Bang.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.020
And so since that light
is only just reaching us,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.920
we will see it as it was
13.7 billion years ago.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.370
So we should see this
type of radiation.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.620
Now the other thing to remember,
the universe was expanding.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.030
When this was emitted, the
universe was expanding.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.090
The universe was expanding
at a very-- well,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.320
it's all relative what's a
fast rate and all of that.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.410
But it was expanding.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.560
And we learned on the
video in red shift

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.996
that when the source of the
light is moving away from you,

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:26.440
or the source of the
electromagnetic radiation

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.670
is moving away from you,
the radiation itself get red

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.490
shifted.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.289
So even though this is at a
relatively high frequency--

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.559
you can almost imagine it
was kind of red-hot gas.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.890
It was at 3,000 Kelvin--
because it was moving away

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.159
from us, these things--
and we learned in the video

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:48.739
on the actual size of
the observable universe,

00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:50.530
even though these
electromagnetic waves are

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.960
taking 13.7 billion
years to reach us,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.190
in that time, this point in
space, the point in space that

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.390
emitted those
electromagnetic waves are

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.124
about 46 billion
light years away.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.290
So that's our best estimate.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.120
So this is still
stretching away.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.225
So theory, if you
believe all of this,

00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:10.490
that this was about 3,000
Kelvin and it gets red shifted,

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.250
theory would have
it that we should

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:19.370
see not something analogous
to electromagnetic waves being

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.440
released from a 3,000
degree temperature atom.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.980
We should see
something red shifted

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.200
into the radio spectrum.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.020
So we should be
observing radio waves.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.270
And the reason why we're
observing radio waves and not

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.580
something of a higher frequency
is because it got red shifted.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.600
It got red shifted down
into a lower frequency.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.230
And remember, we
should be seeing it

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.260
from every point in the universe
where the photons have been

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.040
traveling for 13.7
billion years.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.290
We should see it all around us.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.690
This is almost a
necessity for us

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.730
to really believe in the
current Big Bang theory.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.130
And it turns out that
we did observe this.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.690
And this is very unintuitive.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.270
Because you look at any
other point in the universe,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.104
it's nonuniform.

00:10:03.104 --> 00:10:04.520
Every other point
in the universe,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.176
you have stars and galaxies.

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:07.300
These aren't atoms anymore.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.190
These are stars, and
galaxies, and whatnot.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.940
And so there's some
points in the universe

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.750
where you see a
lot of radiation.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.375
And there's other points in the
universe where you see nothing.

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:17.090
It's just black.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.900
But if this is correct,
if this really did happen,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.850
we should be able to
observe uniform radio

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.290
waves from every
direction around us.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.150
And you go 300-- or
more than 360 degrees.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.030
We're going in three dimensions.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.540
Any direction you point an
antenna, a radio antenna,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.852
you should be receiving
these radio waves that

00:10:37.852 --> 00:10:40.060
were at much higher frequency
when they were emitted.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.351
They had been red shifted then.

00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:44.020
But they were emitted
13.7 billion years ago.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.810
And, it turns out
in the late 1960s,

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.080
they did find these radio
waves from every direction.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.250
And these are
called the cosmic--

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.440
let me write this down.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:06.600
This is the cosmic microwave
background radiation.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.729
And it's this in combination--
so it's this data

00:11:11.729 --> 00:11:13.270
that we're getting,
this observation,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.380
in combination with the
fact that the further

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.810
we look out to galaxies
and clusters of galaxies,

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.640
they all seem to be
moving away from us.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.430
They're all red shifted.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.013
And they get red
shifted more and more

00:11:24.013 --> 00:11:25.170
the further we look out.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.410
So this and everything being
redshifted away from us

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.150
are the best two points of
evidence for the actual Big

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.920
Bang.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.510
So hopefully, you found
that reasonably interesting.
