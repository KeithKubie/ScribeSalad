00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you for
coming to our most recent NASA

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.780
at Google Talk.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.005
We are pleased to welcome
Steve Hipskind today.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:09.670
Is that right?

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.380
Pronouncing it correctly?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.040
Steve is the chief of the Earth
Science Division at NASA Ames.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.350
He has been at NASA
Ames for 35 years

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.630
and is retiring in three days.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.950
So we caught him
right before he left.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.010
He's going on a 9-day
backpacking trip

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.760
to celebrate his 35 years.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.180
Steve has done a whole slew
of exploration in the Arctic,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.049
and the subarctic, and
many places in between.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:35.840
And we're really pleased
to have him today.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.832
So please help me welcome Steve.

00:00:37.832 --> 00:00:39.756
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.070
STEVE HIPSKIND: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.115
Thank you for coming.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:47.730
I'd like to thank Terry
Fong for suggesting

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.870
this and Mary for inviting me.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.940
It's always a lot of fun to come
and talk about your passion,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.540
so appreciate you guys
coming here today.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.350
I am going to talk about
NASA's Earth science program.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.360
So I'm guessing people here kind
of know what that's all about.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.480
But a lot of times, people
have no clue that NASA actually

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.280
studies the Earth.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.270
But before I get
into that, I wanted

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.000
to give a little shoutout to our
friends in planetary science.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.290
We had one of the
co-investigators

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.950
on the New Horizons
mission which

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.770
just did the flyby of the dwarf
planet Pluto, but very exciting

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.270
event.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.320
We had a lot of
people over at Ames

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.310
that we're watching kind
of the real-time feed.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.050
And actually, Dr. Cruikshank,
who is our co-investigator,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.830
was actually at the
Applied Physics Lab

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.880
at Johns Hopkins for
the fun and excitement.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:54.310
So this mission was selected
to go ahead in 2001.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.620
It actually launched in 2006.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.760
So it took nine years
to get to Pluto.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.510
That's 3 billion miles.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.630
So if you figure that out, it's
about 40,000 miles an hour.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.420
So this is a picture of
approaching the dwarf planet

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.410
at about a million
kilometers out.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.800
So the other interesting thing
about the New Horizons mission

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.940
is it was-- because
it had to go so far,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.320
it was intended to be a
pretty simple mission.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.410
Its instruments were
not articulated,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.640
so you had to move the
spacecraft to view the planet.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.910
But that meant that you
couldn't view the planet

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.740
and do communications because
you had to turn the spacecraft

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.640
to do communication.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.110
So as they were
doing the flyby, they

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.030
turned communications
off so that they could

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.610
do all of the observations.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.220
But the bandwidth to get that
data 3 billion miles from that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.010
far away in the solar system
is 2 kilobits a second.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.710
So it's taking a while
to get all of the data

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.030
that they took on the mission.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.800
So again, this is
from a-- I'm sorry,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.230
this was from about 100
million kilometers out.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.460
This was at about 50
million kilometers.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.580
And then as they got
a little bit closer,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.380
they started seeing
what they thought

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.720
was a heart-shaped
feature on the planet.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.160
But the closest approach-- this
is released for the first time

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.200
ever-- they found Pluto.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.130
So it's pretty exciting stuff.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.190
OK, what I'm going to talk about
is really NASA's Earth science

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.320
program.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.360
So I don't know.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.520
Does everybody
recognize this image,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.990
know what year this
image was taken?

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.980
Any ideas?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.990
1968.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.140
So it was actually the
first mission to the moon

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.570
where they actually just
went around the moon

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.700
and didn't land on the moon.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.480
So this was actually-- I think
it was Christmas Eve in 1968.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.860
But this really
demonstrated the power

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.029
of using the space observation
perspective to look back

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.850
at our home planet.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.240
I mean, this was at a time where
environmental issues were just

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.760
coming to the fore.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.160
It was when the Environmental
Protection Agency was created,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.080
the Environmental Protection
Act, so pretty exciting stuff.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.280
But a lot of people-- if
you follow politics at all,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.400
you recognize that
there are certain people

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.340
in the country that
don't think NASA

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.440
should be doing Earth science.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.410
And to them, we can look at
the authorizing legislation

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.310
of NASA, which actually, if you
look at what that authorizing

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.580
legislation asks us to
do, the first priority is

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.390
the expansion of human
knowledge of the Earth

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.380
and phenomena in the atmosphere.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.240
So clearly it's in our charter.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.210
But it's actually only been
since the human spaceflight

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.770
program that we've really
focused on a program

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.250
to look at the Earth from space.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.920
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.620
-T minus 10--

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.620
STEVE HIPSKIND: And so--

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.964
-9, 8, 7--

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:23.422
STEVE HIPSKIND:
Yeah, that's funny.

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:25.990
It's not showing up
the same way on my-- so

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.982
this is a little
picture of what we do.

00:05:28.982 --> 00:05:31.140
-0, and ignition.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.340
And liftoff of the Atlas V
rocket on the Landsat Data

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.740
Continuity mission,
continuing the 40-year legacy

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.194
of preserving Earth's
natural resources from space.

00:05:42.194 --> 00:05:43.860
STEVE HIPSKIND: So
probably a lot of you

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.190
have heard about Landsat.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.110
It's really the oldest
Earth observing program

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.430
that we have at NASA.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.330
It started in the early 1970s.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.210
And so it's been almost
a continuous 40 year

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.981
record of Earth observation.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.480
And for the kind
of stuff that we're

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.640
trying to do on the Earth,
the time series aspect

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.500
of these observations
is absolutely

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.070
critical to really
understanding what's

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.040
going on on our home planet.

00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:14.880
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.210
STEVE HIPSKIND:
So this next video

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.010
is just a time lapse, again
through the Landsat program,

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.410
of changes to this
particular urban area.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.190
Does everybody recognize
where that urban area is?

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.800
Shout it out.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.040
Come on now.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.060
AUDIENCE: Las Vegas?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.143
STEVE HIPSKIND: Las Vegas.

00:06:35.143 --> 00:06:40.320
So actually, this is showing
a full 40-year history

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.850
of the development of Las Vegas.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.660
And if you watch
this closely, you

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.450
can see that it basically
went from a very small,

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.160
confined area around
the strip to now

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.000
really building
out into the desert

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.720
there to the left
of the downtown

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.890
and to the left of the image.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.260
So again, it's really
that time continuity

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.120
of these observations
that really gives us

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.756
the ability to look at what's
going on on the planet.

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:14.130
And so some of
the things that we

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.000
can do with this
perspective from space

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.130
is we can look at the biological
productivity on the earth.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.680
This is the SeaWiFS mission.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.070
But this basically shows-- this
is a six year sequence showing

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.500
the seasonal greening
of the planet

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.160
and then the receding
in the winter months.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.220
But again, just a simple
time series of that image

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.307
shows very quickly
a global snapshot

00:07:41.307 --> 00:07:42.890
of what's going on
with the biosphere.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.520
So what is NASA's ambition?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.650
It's a pretty modest ambition
to try to understand and model

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.000
the whole planet.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.150
And so this was
actually a diagram.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.920
It's actually a
famous diagram called

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.720
the Bretherton diagram
that was actually

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.880
created in the late 1980s.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.560
But it basically
tried to pictorialize

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.680
all of the different
subsystems on the Earth,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.610
and the interconnected
nature of the subsystems,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.560
and the challenge of
trying to understand

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.500
the nature of those systems,
but also the interconnections

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.120
of those systems, so
systems of systems.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.030
And you'll notice there
on the right-hand side

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.370
is the human activities.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.429
That's not something
that we have focused

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.610
on very much in the history
of the Earth Science program,

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.730
but it's something
that we're beginning

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.350
to really put more focus on.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.330
And I'll get back
to that in a minute.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.450
So what do we do to
try to understand

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.890
all of these subsystems?

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.900
This is the current
constellation

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.130
of NASA satellites.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.380
And so we have
this constellation.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.060
There are currently
somewhere between 18 and 20

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.800
Earth-observing
satellites from NASA

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.270
that are currently up there.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.410
And then the color-coding shows
the existing constellation,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.450
then the missions that
are in development

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.190
and planned for future launch.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.980
But it's a fairly
complex endeavor.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.310
People typically
don't think of NASA

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.090
when they think about
doing Earth science,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.006
but we actually have the
largest Earth science

00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:25.360
program on the planet.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.670
And it's largely because
it's fairly expensive

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.145
to do these kinds of
space-based missions.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.470
So this next image
is just an image

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.350
of what these satellites
look like in space.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.000
And so typically for
Earth observation,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.730
we have what are called
Sun-synchronous polar orbits,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.200
which means the
satellites are crossing

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.830
the same place on the
Earth at the same time,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.390
but they're doing
it in polar orbit

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.240
so that as the Earth
rotates, we eventually

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.410
image the entire planet.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.130
And so this, again,
is a sequence

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.270
of those constellations.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.866
One thing you'll notice is
there's a bunch of them.

00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:08.990
I'll show this in a second.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.930
But there are a bunch of them
that, for the first time,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.220
we've been attempting
to fly several

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.460
of the satellites
in close formation.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.000
And basically, that
just leverages the power

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.520
of getting these co-located
in time observations, which

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.460
makes it much easier to
do some of the analysis.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.480
In the last, oh,
year and a half,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.080
we've launched a number
of new satellites--

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.950
the Global Precipitation
mission, which

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.180
is-- one of the things
that I didn't say

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.920
is that the work that we do
is very heavily interagency.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.130
So there are a lot
of agencies in the US

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.110
that have a piece
of Earth science.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.700
Typically, other
agencies have kind

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.400
of operational responsibility.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.800
NOAA does weather forecasting.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.850
USGS does earthquake
observation and response.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.445
And indeed, a lot of what we do
is we actually build and launch

00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:07.070
the satellites.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.611
So we build and
launch the satellites

00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:10.180
for NOAA, for the
weather satellites.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.950
We also-- Landsat
is fundamentally

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.910
a US Geological Survey mission.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.940
But we build and launch
that satellite as well.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.660
The Global
Precipitation Mission is

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.280
an example of the international
flavor of what we do.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:29.260
And so the Japanese
actually built the radar

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.290
on the GPM mission.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:37.880
But if you think about it,
2/3 of the planet is ocean.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.030
And so other than having these
space-based observations,

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.150
there's no way to get
precipitation measurements

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.590
over the ocean over a
big part of the planet.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.740
So it's only been since we've
been doing these observations

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.470
from space that we have
a critical component

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.050
of the weather
system on the planet,

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.800
but also how the climate system
is changing, how precipitation

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.260
around the planet is changing.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.710
SMAP is one of the most recent
missions that we've launched.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.950
It's the soil
moisture measurement

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.690
using an L-band radar
tuned to humidity

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.440
in the top several
centimeters of soil.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.010
But again, for
the first time, we

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.990
have a global picture of what
the soil moisture looks like,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.150
which is hugely important for,
for example, agricultural water

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.250
demand and things like that.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:33.060
Unfortunately, SMAP has only
been up for several months.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.960
And it has two instruments--
a radar and a radiometer.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.370
They're having problems
with the radar right now.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.620
We've gotten some
global data sets.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.290
But right now, the
instrument is being

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.850
debugged to try to figure out
what's going on with the radar.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.900
We still have the radiometer,
which also provides a soil

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.000
moisture but not with the same
level of spatial resolution

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.240
as the radar instrument.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.080
I mentioned the
constellation-- we

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.860
refer to it as the A-Train--
which is largely making

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.580
atmospheric measurements.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.310
And so again, these
satellites are

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.930
flying within a
minute of each other

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.880
in terms of when they actually
cross a particular place

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.310
on the Earth.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.770
And so I mentioned
one of our challenges

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:25.270
really is to better understand
the impact of human activity.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.640
And if you read the little
blurb in the introduction

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.230
to the talk, I want to show you
some of the measurements that

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:36.760
are really truly the
measurements from space that

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.730
are really most uniquely showing
human presence on the planet.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.900
And that's the nighttime images.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.620
So you've seen a lot of
the night lights images.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.050
They have a lot
of global images.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.770
This actually is
an image that was

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.780
taken from the
International Space Station

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.260
by one of the astronauts--
actually, Don Pettit, who

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.540
actually is from Oregon state.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.040
But he actually figured out
how to take their cameras-- he

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.920
actually took a Makita drill
and created his own motion

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.260
compensation, because of course,
the space station is traveling

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.990
at thousands of miles an hour.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.134
And so trying to take
a picture of the Earth

00:14:16.134 --> 00:14:17.300
is a little bit challenging.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.950
They actually have
much faster cameras.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.340
This was done probably
close to 10 years ago now.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.210
But the really
neat thing that you

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.370
can see from night lights
images, particularly these ones

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.940
from the space station which
are much higher resolution

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.220
than the other satellites where
you've seen night light images,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:40.080
you can really start to see not
just the presence of humans,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.180
but you can see different
aspects of human activity.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.090
For example, you can easily pick
out transportation corridors.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.480
You can pick out
industrial sections.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.470
Cities-- you can see
San Francisco there

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.990
at the top end of the Bay
is very brightly colored.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.190
And so one of the
things that you can do

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.090
is begin to use this as a
surrogate for where the carbon

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.390
emissions are.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.900
That's not so much of a
problem in the United States

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.440
because we have a lot of other
information that tells us that.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.804
But around the rest of
the world and particularly

00:15:10.804 --> 00:15:12.220
the developed
countries that don't

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.610
have that kind of
data-taking capability,

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.670
it's a really nice way to
pinpoint where the carbon

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.380
emissions are coming from
in terms of writing carbon

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.090
treaties and things like that.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.510
The other fantastic
thing about night lights

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.400
which I find really
intriguing is the extent

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.330
to which you can see the impacts
of human decision-making.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.920
And so we all very much
benefit in the Bay Area

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.020
from decisions that were
made in the '50s and '60s

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.030
where people set aside
open space in the Bay Area.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.420
So what you see
there, of course,

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.990
is Silicon Valley, San Francisco
at the top end of the Bay,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.780
San Jose at the bottom end.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.780
But what you don't see
is where the mountains

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.490
are, because we've
kept development out

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.430
of the hills for the most part.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.580
And so you can see that very
clearly in an image like this.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.060
It's even actually more
striking in this image,

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.760
which is of Washington DC.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.220
And for those of you know
that know Washington DC,

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.400
you know that it was
developed as a 10 mile

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.780
on a side square turned on
its side so it's a diamond.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.700
But the remarkable thing to
me, the very bright lights

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.200
are kind of the central
DC, the mall area.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.920
But you can see the outline
of that 10 mile square

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.950
in this image with
nothing other than lights.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.070
And so basically
what that says is

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.580
that people are making
decisions in one neighborhood

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.950
about nighttime
lighting that are

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.210
very different from the
community next door.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:51.310
So it's a very powerful tool
for looking at human presence,

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.370
changing human
presence, and impacts

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:00.270
of human policy management
decisions on the Earth--

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.640
pretty exciting stuff.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.440
Right now, the regular
satellite images

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.869
are much lower resolution
than these images.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:11.990
We at NASA Ames have
really pushed hard

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.980
to get NASA to think about
putting up a night light

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.390
imager that would give you
this kind of resolution,

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.802
and you could really do
some interesting things.

00:17:21.802 --> 00:17:23.260
I'm going to talk
a little bit more

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.343
about public/private
partnerships in a little bit.

00:17:25.343 --> 00:17:30.760
But I think this is one
where if we don't do it

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.020
in the government, I'm
hopeful that others will find

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.640
this interesting and valuable
enough to actually look

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.610
at doing.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.790
So one of the other things
that we do at NASA--

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.460
and because we can't see all
of the detailed geophysical

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.450
phenomenon from space just
because we're so far away--

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.760
and it is interesting how
it's changing all the time

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.610
in terms of our capabilities.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.670
But one of the other tools
that we have in the tool set

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.290
is aircraft.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.230
And so NASA has
historically had aircraft

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.300
that focus on high
altitude measurements.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.690
So that aircraft in the
upper left, for example,

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.820
is really a converted
U-2 spy plane

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.580
that we've converted to do
geophysical measurements.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.820
We've had that since
the early '70s.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.660
We actually started the NASA
Airborne Program at NASA Ames

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.440
back in the '70s.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.975
You notice that we
paint ours white

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:33.480
because we're the good guys.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.460
But more recently,
we've been starting

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.480
to use the NASA
Global Hawk, which

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.890
is the aircraft on the
upper right, which is kind

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.075
of a replacement for the U-2.

00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:45.740
It flies roughly the
same altitude, roughly

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.620
the same payload capability.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.730
But it really allows us to
get to places on the planet,

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.670
particularly in the
upper atmosphere, that we

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.190
just-- there's no
other way to get

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.090
to those kinds of measurements.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.920
And so again, even though
people don't really

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.920
think of Earth science
when they think of NASA,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.990
we actually have the
largest airborne program

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.660
of any agency on
the planet as well.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.180
The DC-8 in the
lower left is just

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.110
an old commercial airliner,
but we've pretty much

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.490
stripped it completely bare
so that we can actually

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.270
put laboratory-size
instruments in that aircraft.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.830
And we have a really nice
program every summer.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.330
It's actually called the Student
Airborne Research Program.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.740
So if any students out
there in the audience

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.590
are interested in
doing this, we actually

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.370
bring in about 30 students
from around the country.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.580
We actually put instruments
on the aircraft.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.870
That's a picture of some of
the students on the aircraft.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.230
They take the data.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.619
They develop their
own research project.

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:46.160
And then they actually
take the data,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.530
do their research and
analysis, and then

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.550
present it at the
end of the summer.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.290
It's a really exciting program,
really hands-on opportunity

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.965
to do Earth science.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.540
And so one of the prime examples
of how the airborne program

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.010
really plays is
that in the 1980s,

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.170
there was the ozone hole,
and nobody really knew

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.100
what was going on with that.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.390
NASA actually had just launched
the Total Ozone Mapping

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.440
Spectrometer, or TOMS.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:23.490
And so we could see those
images of the globe looking down

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.090
on the South Pole.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.910
We could see the ozone
hole, but we couldn't

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.510
determine what was causing it.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.190
So there were several
theories at the time.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.249
Nitric oxide is
released by aircraft.

00:20:36.249 --> 00:20:38.040
And there was a concern
that there was just

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.310
a climatological shift in
the circulation patterns.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.720
But one of the top
contenders was CFC,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.930
is the chlorofluorocarbons
and whether those were really

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.020
causing the ozone hole.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.610
It wasn't until we were able
to take our high altitude

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.950
aircraft, which was really
the only way in the world

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.670
to get these measurements,
and we actually went down

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.970
based out of Punta Arenas, which
is on the Strait of Magellan

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.820
at the southern tip
of South America.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.910
And we are able to make
measurements directly

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.550
into the ozone hole which was in
the stratosphere over the South

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.570
Pole.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.240
And we were able to bring
back what we've always

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.680
referred to as the smoking gun.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.020
It showed that there was
this tremendous correlation

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.005
with the chlorine
molecules that we

00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:22.620
were seeing, which ended up
being the source of the ozone

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.580
hole.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.980
And the exciting thing
about that for us

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.420
is that that data that
we took fed directly

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.030
into international policy,
which became the Montreal

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.850
Protocol which basically
calls all the developed

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.050
countries to phase out
the development of CFCs.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.780
And we averted losing
our stratospheric ozone

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.064
layer, which protects us.

00:21:50.064 --> 00:21:50.730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.370
-NASA scientists
are joining with--

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.610
STEVE HIPSKIND: This is
just a quick video clip

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.420
of some of the other
more recent work

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.020
that we've done with the
Global Hawk aircraft.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.800
But essentially, we put
instruments on that aircraft.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.400
And in this case, we were
very interested in what's

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.050
the impact of climate
change on the water

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.680
cycle, and particularly,
how does water vapor

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.520
go from the lowest
part of the atmosphere

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.110
into the stratosphere?

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.470
Because if you get more
water in the stratosphere,

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.210
it actually has a huge
impact on the ozone cycle

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.630
and potentially leads to
more ozone production.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.310
And so we actually-- again,
this was really the only way

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.270
to get that data in
the upper atmosphere

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.220
over the middle of the Pacific.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.990
The Global Hawk gives us
a new measurement domain

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.840
because it can stay up in
the air for 31 hours compared

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.757
to the U-2, which can stay up
for only about eight hours.

00:22:41.757 --> 00:22:42.340
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:42.980
STEVE HIPSKIND: And
so we're actually

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.660
able to go get
those measurements.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.470
And indeed in this project
that we got funded here

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.690
at NASA Ames, we actually
showed that there's much more

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.600
water vapor getting
into the stratosphere

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.120
than people had anticipated.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.320
So again, our stuff
is not quite as sexy

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.100
as doing a flyby of the planets,
but it's really the stuff

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.940
that NASA does that's most
directly impactful to life

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.600
here on Earth.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.380
Another thing that we've
done with aircraft,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.280
this is actually a satellite
image of the big wildfires

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.310
in Southern California.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.340
This was actually in 2007.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.700
But again, the
satellite gives you

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.570
kind of the overall picture.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.810
But in terms of decision
making for the firefighters,

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.470
it's not nearly enough detail.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:32.020
And so we embarked
on this program

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.320
where we put a very high
dynamic-range infrared

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:42.220
sensor on the Ikhana UAV
and really changed the way

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.950
that the US fights fires.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.320
We actually worked with
folks in Terry's organization

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.780
and intelligent
systems and took some

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.860
of the autonomy and intelligent
planning and scheduling,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.980
and repurposed actually software
that was developed for the Mars

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:03.490
rovers, and repurposed that for
managing the data coming down

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.380
from the UAV.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:09.480
Put together a satellite
link, on-board processing

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.500
on the aircraft so that
we were able to generate--

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.920
So the image on the left
there is what the firefighter

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.750
sees on the ground.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.730
It's very hard to see kind
of where the fire fronts are,

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.310
where it is relative
to the terrain.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.210
And so with the
infrared sensor, we're

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.790
able look through
the smoke, determine

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.330
where the hot spots are or
where the fire fronts are.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.490
And then we actually
use Google Earth

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.670
because that was
very standardized

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.200
in the firefighting
community, and we're

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.700
able to show them
where these fire

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.130
fronts were and were moving.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.190
And so they, for
the first time ever,

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.460
used real-time data that we
were giving them from NASA.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.190
And they were using that to make
decisions about putting boots

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.560
on the ground.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.850
Typically, they had done
infrared imagery before,

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.170
but they would go up in an
aircraft, take the data.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.470
Aircraft would land.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.630
There would be a group that
would process the data.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.220
And maybe six hours later, the
firefighters got those images.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.690
Well, a lot happens in
six hours in a big fire.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.030
So we were giving
them real-time images.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.210
And indeed, we were
doing basically

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.500
a web-based distribution so
our data was going directly

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.600
onto the incident command center
set up for the big wildfires.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.190
And that was going
up on their boards

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.670
within five minutes
of taking the data.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.370
And so NASA doesn't fight fires.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.240
And so one of our
challenges is kind

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.910
of the research operations.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.710
How do we transfer
this technology

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.630
into the hands of
the agency who has

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.750
the responsibility-- in
this case, the US Forest

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.690
Service-- for fighting fires?

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.390
And so they've
actually adopted what

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.360
we referred to as a
Collaborative Decision

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.670
Environment, the software.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.790
And that now they use that at
NIFC, the National Interagency

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.780
Fire Center, in Boise.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.220
And they actually use that
software to manage wildfires

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.340
across the United States.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.220
We also gave them,
on permanent loan,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.960
the infrared sensor
so they actually

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.560
can duplicate the capabilities
that we demonstrated.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:11.605
We're more recently looking at
using smaller robotic aircraft.

00:26:11.605 --> 00:26:15.730
The images in the left there
are of our Sierra aircraft,

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.590
which we went from not
ever using this for science

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:23.380
to going to Svalbard, which
is the island owned by

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.010
and north of Norway, so
above the Arctic Circle.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.680
So we kind of went from testing
this thing out here at Ames

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.420
to going to one of the
most extreme environments

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.350
on the planet.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.980
But we demonstrated
that you can fly

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.590
these aircraft for about 10
hours and return useful data.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.140
In this case, we were looking
at the surface roughness

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.180
of the Arctic ice sheets
to look at can you

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.850
determine the age of the
ice from remote sensing

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:53.830
and improve your remote
sensing algorithms from space.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.910
The image in the
lower right there

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.190
is actually some much
smaller aircraft-- actually,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.780
Dragon Eyes.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.980
And we were able to
work with, actually

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.710
in this case, NASA JPL that
had a very small SO2 sensor.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.680
And we were able to fly
these-- this is actually

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.409
Mount Turrialba in Costa Rica.

00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:15.200
And so we were actually
able to demonstrate

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.320
that we could fly
these aircraft actually

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.900
at much higher than they had
originally been intended to fly

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.100
and we could look at sulfur
dioxide emissions coming out

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.600
of the volcanoes.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.760
And so our next step
actually this summer

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.490
is to fly these
aircraft in formation,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.800
and so rather than having
to talk individually

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.990
to the aircraft, talk
to them as a group,

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:41.600
and be able to do broader
spatial measurements

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.490
with these small platforms.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.420
And then another-- so
this is a little bit

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.845
of the public/private
partnership.

00:27:49.845 --> 00:27:51.220
I don't know how
many of you know

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.900
that your principals
actually have

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.160
a bunch of private aircraft
that they keep over

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.140
at Moffett Field.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.510
And one of the quid pro quos of
this public/private partnership

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.830
is they've allowed us to put
our scientific instruments

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.510
on this aircraft that they own.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.960
It's called an Alpha Jet.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.840
And so we've developed
a greenhouse gas

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:18.220
payload that we put on there
to measure CO2, methane, ozone,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.430
water vapor, et cetera.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.810
And the image in
the middle there,

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.550
one of the things that we do
with satellite observations

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.370
that the aircraft program
is very helpful for

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.790
is doing validation of
the satellite images.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.270
So we look at places
on the planet.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.960
This is Railroad
Valley, which is

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.560
a very high, very uniform playa
in the high desert in Nevada.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.680
But with this partnership,
we can actually

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.630
make very routine measurements
that we wouldn't otherwise

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.550
be able to make if
we had to propose

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.520
to use the NASA aircraft,
which are in very high demand.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.320
So we've been making
these measurements

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.170
over Railroad Valley every
month for the last five years.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.260
So it's a very powerful tool.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.224
And this is just a little image.

00:29:03.224 --> 00:29:03.890
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.306
STEVE HIPSKIND: We were working
with the Japanese who also

00:29:06.306 --> 00:29:08.320
are measuring CO2 from space.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.940
So this is a Japanese
team that were actually

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:15.576
in Railroad Valley
making measurements

00:29:15.576 --> 00:29:18.020
of CO2 and methane.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.640
So we're able to fly the Alpha
Jet from here at Moffett Field

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.600
and fly right over that playa.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.245
And then we have them circle
up and do a vertical profile

00:29:26.245 --> 00:29:28.770
to compare to the
satellite measurements.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:33.020
So it's a really
exciting capability.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.890
It's actually kind
of fun because we

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.450
try to get the profiles as
close to the surface as we can.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.024
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:38.024 --> 00:29:40.190
STEVE HIPSKIND: This is
probably a little bit closer

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.890
than we expected them to do.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.154
But you can't say we're
not close to the surface

00:29:45.154 --> 00:29:46.906
with those measurements.

00:29:46.906 --> 00:29:47.489
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:47.489 --> 00:29:51.210
And so what do we do with
all of this information?

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.380
The whole idea is to try to
not only understand, but to be

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.060
able to predict what's going
to happen in the future.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.220
This is a really
nice, colorful image

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.000
of some modeling work
that's actually done

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.430
at NASA Goddard in Maryland.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.570
But it's looking at
the atmospheric aerosol

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.280
and it's color coded
by aerosol source,

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.200
but very high resolution
meteorological analyses

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.490
showing how aerosols, for
example, from Saharan Africa

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.840
get transported
across the Atlantic.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.850
So again, this is the ultimate
goal of that Bretherton

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.570
diagram, is to put all
of this information

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.860
together and be able to
predict into the future.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.550
One of the things that
we're doing at NASA Ames

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.620
is what we call the
NASA Earth Exchange.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.660
It's actually very
similar to-- and we've

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.440
had some collaborative
relationships

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.510
with the Google Earth
Engine folks here at Google.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.360
But we can use that
to really assimilate

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.800
all of these very
large satellite data

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.930
sets into a single
place and then have

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.180
the data co-located with
the various analytics

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.600
and large models.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.620
In this particular
case, we're using

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.290
it to look at irrigation
demand in the Central

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.560
Valley of the US.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.730
We had done a lot of
work up at Napa Valley,

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.860
doing that for grapes.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:20.005
So we had the opportunity a
few years ago to scale this up.

00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:22.130
And now, we're looking at
the whole Central Valley.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.670
But we're showing
that you can actually

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:29.060
reduce the amount
of irrigated water

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.840
to kind of an optimum
level, still maintain

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.100
the same level of
agricultural productivity,

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.232
but fairly significantly
reduce the water.

00:31:38.232 --> 00:31:41.234
In some side-by-side tests
in the Salinas Valley,

00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:43.900
we were able to demonstrate that
you could maintain productivity

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.382
with up to 35%
reduction in water.

00:31:46.382 --> 00:31:48.590
You're not going to get that
across the whole Central

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:52.350
Valley, but even if
you could save 5% to 7%

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:57.240
of the water usage in
California, that would be huge.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.340
Another thing that we've been
able to do with the NASA Earth

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.200
Exchange is climate downscaling.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.460
We've actually recently scaled
this up to the whole planet.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.100
But this is taking the IPCC,
the Intergovernmental Panel

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.590
on Climate Change, and kind
of the best models that

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.640
come out of that group.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.410
I thought that was
set up to repeat,

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.860
but let me see if I
can show that again.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.860
This is basically just showing
from current to 2100 what

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.530
the state of the art model show
for temperature in the United

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.140
States, which actually,
if you look at this,

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.920
it's pretty scary.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.340
Because you can see that
the whole central part

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.670
of the United States
actually looks

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:43.290
a lot like the southwestern
United States by 2100.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:48.480
That's using the scenario of
not a lot of carbon reduction.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.370
But it's really
kind of the scenario

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.590
that we're currently on.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.620
So it's actually a pretty
accurate portrayal.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.280
One other example I'll
show really quickly-- this

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.160
is some recent work mapping
fallowed fields in California,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.380
again, just using remote sensing
but using fairly sophisticated

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.730
analysis tools to get to what's
a fallow field versus just

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.530
roadway or whatever.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.200
And so we're
producing these maps.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.180
This is from 2011 to 2015.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.340
But you can track the increasing
amount of fallowed fields

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.440
in the Central Valley,
which is basically

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.780
a direct impact of the drought
on California agriculture.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.410
And so this work has been used
by the California Department

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:41.810
of Water Resources to brief the
governor's drought task force.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.360
It actually just
came out last week

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.740
in a White House missive on
what is the US government doing

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.270
to address climate change.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.540
So this data was
featured in that as well.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.200
So I'm going to quickly shift
gears and talk about some

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.840
of the interesting stuff that
we're doing at Ames in looking

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.360
at, again, remote sensing.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.960
This is what we end up
calling fluid lensing.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.510
But in my humble
opinion, I actually

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.800
think this has the possibility
of completely revolutionizing

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.380
the way we do remote sensing.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.750
And so what you're
seeing here is an image

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.500
of the Venus transit
of the Sun that

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.440
happened several years ago.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.489
And so this is an
image of the Sun.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:33.159
Of course, the black spot is
the Venus transit of the Sun.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:36.449
But the remarkable
thing is we were

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:40.721
able to get this kind of detail
on the surface of the Sun.

00:34:40.721 --> 00:34:42.179
And you would think
that that might

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:46.850
be a satellite circulating
around the sun,

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.139
but this is actually
the telescope

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.360
that those images
were taken from.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.789
And so normally when you
have a piece of glass,

00:34:54.789 --> 00:34:56.330
that gives you the
diffraction limit.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:59.700
It limits your spatial
resolution that you can see.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:05.240
But what this young researcher
Ved Chirayath is doing

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.210
is actually using atmospheric
turbulence as a lens.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.660
And so it basically gets
around the limitation

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.170
of having to put big giant
pieces of glass in space

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.240
and allows you to
use the atmosphere

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.610
to lens those images.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.760
And so I actually got him to
do some work in Earth science.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.810
And so I asked him if he
could take that same technique

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.260
and look downward,
and what could you do.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.830
And so he actually recognized
that one really interesting

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.530
thing that you could do
is imaging shallow water

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.010
ecosystems.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.880
And so this is actually an
image at the Stanford pool.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.920
That's Ved on the
right looking up.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:51.220
And so he's got a little logo
that's hung above the pool.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.740
And you can see
that's what it would

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.770
look like if you're sitting
on the bottom of the pool.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:59.870
But if you apply the fluid
lensing-- so basically

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.400
in this case, you're using
that air/water interface

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.680
in the waves.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.050
And you can imagine that
when the wave goes by,

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:10.840
it actually acts as a lens and
it both magnifies and sharpens

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.510
the image.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.720
And so you can go from that
image in the upper left

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.540
to that image in the lower left.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.460
So you can see that it
actually is slightly

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.810
magnified from the real image,
but it also basically gives you

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.500
an accurate portrayal
of what's really there.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.100
And so he's taken this.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.180
He's actually put it on
a small quadcopter UAV.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.900
And he's imaged two places now.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.280
One was the coral reefs
in American Samoa.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.010
And this is actually in
Shark Bay in Australia

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:45.210
where there are these
stromatolite pools.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.730
Stromatolites are the oldest
living organisms on the planet.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.440
They're responsible for creating
the oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.030
And this is the
first time anyone's

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.360
ever gotten permission
to actually do

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.890
flying over a remote
sensing of Hamelin Pool.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.870
But this is what you would
see from that imagery

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.710
if you're just flying along.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.390
And this is applying the
fluid lensing technique.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.020
So he's actually
generated literally

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.650
centimeter scale,
three-dimensional images

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.780
of both these stromatolites
as well as the coral reefs.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.930
And it gives you this
incredibly powerful capability,

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.670
for the first time, to
use a remote sensing

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.690
to do things like
identify species

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.400
differentiation in coral reefs.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.990
And so you can look at
impacts of changing climate

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:35.970
on specific species
in the coral reefs.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:41.780
So I'll finish by
just saying that we

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.530
as humans on this planet
face tremendous issues

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.110
environmentally.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:51.210
And it really takes much
more than the US government

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.350
or all the governments.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.080
It takes all of us
working on these problems.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.600
And so I really
personally feel that

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.750
public/private partnerships are
an important way going forward

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:06.240
in that it's really
a way to leverage

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.370
the financial resources
that companies like Google

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.550
and others can
bring to the table

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.960
and looking at
different ways to get

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.320
these measurements or different
ways to analyze that data.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.240
This actually looks
like a cartoon picture.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.170
This is actually the
launch of some CubeSats

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.330
from the International
Space Station.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.390
That one in the
center is actually

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:32.910
what was referred to as
PhoneSat at the time.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.100
But it's the same
guys that were working

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.770
at Ames that went off and
created Planet Labs up

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.380
in San Francisco.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:45.530
But I think it's really
important for private sector

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.580
companies, like Skybox,
like Planet Labs,

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.980
to really push the
federal government.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:56.510
Because we're not the most
fast-paced nimble organization

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:01.130
on the planet, but there's
sort of this balance.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:06.990
Because it's important to have
the sort of the long-term view,

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:11.670
which the US government
has, combined with sort

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.050
of new capabilities, new ideas.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.300
And I think that's
the way that we're

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.260
going to move forward and
solve some of these problems

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.130
that we face.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.460
So thank you very much.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.392
Appreciate being here.

00:39:22.392 --> 00:39:24.256
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:27.518 --> 00:39:30.180
AUDIENCE: Fluid lens must
be highly irregular, yeah?

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.555
STEVE HIPSKIND:
Highly irregular?

00:39:31.555 --> 00:39:33.974
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean,
it's not a nice, smooth lens

00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:35.140
like a lens in my telescope.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.431
STEVE HIPSKIND: Oh, absolutely.

00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:39.090
So I mean, there's a tremendous
amount of compute power

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:43.370
that-- I mean, so
those original images

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:47.140
were created with a GoPro,
which is pretty remarkable when

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.960
you see what he was
able to retrieve.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.050
But he's actually
gotten some funding

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.060
from the Earth Science
Technology office, which

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.600
is our technology
development at NASA,

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.370
to build much more
sophisticated cameras which also

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.230
have incredibly
powerful CPUs on them

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.280
to do the image processing.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.640
It's essentially machine
vision because you

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.900
have to look at the
scale of the turbulence,

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.560
and then you have
to figure that out.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.010
And then you have to be able
to stitch all that together.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.600
So it's a pretty
challenging problem.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.120
But we've actually just put in
a proposal to put those cameras,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.710
which are kind of
state-of-the-art video cameras.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:31.550
I think they are 4K
by 4K imagers that are

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:33.720
doing like 90 images a second.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.390
So it's a tremendous
amount of data

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.360
that's being generated,
a tremendous problem

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.380
to solve in terms of
just processing the data.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.955
But we're hoping that that
proposal will be successful

00:40:43.955 --> 00:40:45.780
and we'll launch these
things into space

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.800
and test what he's
done on a quadcopter

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.290
from space, see what we can get.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:51.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.350
STEVE HIPSKIND: So
the dome actually

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.710
covers a large
steerable antenna.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.520
And so of course, we're
dependent on satellite

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.380
communication to
use that aircraft

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.750
because we're typically sending
it from Southern California.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.500
We can send it all the way
to Australian and back.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.460
So we need a way to communicate
with the aircraft in flight.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.960
So yeah, so there's a
big rotating dish that

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.310
sits under that big dome.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:20.620
Unfortunately for us, it
takes a lot of payload space,

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.620
so we complain about that.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.190
We'd like them to
shrink the dish.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.230
But if any of you
guys have any ideas--

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.900
And one of the challenges
that we face in Earth science

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.650
is there's so many
things that we

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.720
need to understand that
it's hard to sort of pick--

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.780
in fact, we as a community
have a hard time prioritizing

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.460
where we should put
our resources because

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.080
of that reason.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.520
In fact, one of the
things that NASA does

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.460
is it seeks input
from the community

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.780
through the National
Research Council.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.850
And we actually--
every 10 years, we

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.490
generate what's called
a Decadal Survey.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:00.500
And so we actually ask know the
smartest people in the country

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.500
to give us those priorities.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.582
I think more and
more, one thing that's

00:42:07.582 --> 00:42:09.040
becoming more and
more important is

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.530
spatial resolution and
the ability to see things

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.664
at much finer detail.

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:15.080
Because we're
getting to the point

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.250
where our models can
actually give us--

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:23.280
we're getting projections down
to regional and local scales,

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.290
but we need the data sets to
corroborate the model results.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:33.830
And so clearly, spatial
resolution is a big one.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.570
Just coming up with new
kinds of measurements.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:41.250
I didn't show it, but the
results from the soil moisture

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.820
measurement-- we showed
the global picture of soil

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.980
moisture, and it's
hugely impactful.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.840
Because again, for
the first time,

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.690
you have this global picture
of what things look like.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.810
Unfortunately, one of the
things that was most striking

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:58.610
is how similar Saharan Africa
was to the Western United

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.150
States now in terms
of soil moisture.

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.990
But yeah, so it's is very
hard to pick top priorities.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.390
I mean, I think we're sort
of moving down that road.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:11.220
The global precipitation
measurement

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.136
has been huge in terms
of understanding.

00:43:14.136 --> 00:43:15.760
That's one of the
biggest uncertainties

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.405
that we have now in climate
models is understanding

00:43:18.405 --> 00:43:20.280
what climate change will
do to precipitation.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.560
One of our big
focuses at NASA Ames

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.300
is better trying to understand
clouds and aerosols,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.170
because they're, again,
one of the largest

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.120
uncertainties in our ability
to the forecast climate.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.470
Because depending
on the type of cloud

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.880
and the location of the
cloud in the atmosphere,

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.700
it can either have a heating
effect or a cooling effect,

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:53.030
and so better understanding
that phenomenon.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:57.700
In fact, we just got funded--
a little plug for us.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.030
We just got funded for
a five year project

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:04.240
where we're going to base
actually the ER-2 aircraft out

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.280
of Western Africa.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.530
And there's a phenomenon
there similar to the West

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.180
Coast of the United States where
you get a low strata stack,

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.840
but they have an awful
lot of biomass burning.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.885
And so you get the smoke that
comes off of the continent.

00:44:19.885 --> 00:44:22.910
It creates a bunch of the
aerosol that generates

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.510
cloud condensation nuclei.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:28.780
And so it's a perfect
place on the planet for us

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.390
to try to better understand
how you distinguish

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:35.740
between these aerosol particles
and the clouds underneath them.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.010
And so in that one,
you really need

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:41.360
those very detailed
measurements that you can only

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.110
get from an aircraft.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:51.300
So I guess my wish list is
to change the NASA budget

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.430
by an order of magnitude.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.760
How about that?

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.510
How do you get the data back to
farmers in an actionable way?

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.620
Well, so that's again
an excellent question.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.280
And indeed, one of
really the strengths

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.470
of that project that we're
doing in the Central Valley

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.890
is that we're working with the
California Department of Water

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:16.660
Resources who has an
irrigation forecast system.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.840
We're working with the
Western Growers Association.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.340
We're working with a number of
growers, both large and small.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.409
So some of the growers
have approached us

00:45:25.409 --> 00:45:26.950
because they've
heard about the work.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.770
So we just, about a
year ago, had Gallo come

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.090
and ask to be part
of this program.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.760
And so we work very
much hand and glove

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.550
with the growers to see
what their needs are.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.300
If you notice that one
little image I showed,

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:47.220
the ultimate is to have it on
a smartphone or a mobile device

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.720
because the farmers
typically aren't

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.472
sitting at their computers
back in their homes.

00:45:51.472 --> 00:45:52.930
They're typically
out in the field,

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:54.860
trying to figure
out what's going on.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.890
So we are definitely
working with them

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:00.820
to figure out what
best meets their needs.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.660
Again, classic case,
though, of sort of NASA--

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.050
we're a research and
development agency.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.720
We're not an operational agency.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.410
So for us, when we demonstrate
these things, part of it

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:16.660
is just kind of figuring out
how to hand that technology off,

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:21.570
either to private companies
that will sell those services,

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.640
or other agencies like the
US Department of Agriculture

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.220
that can adopt some
of these capabilities.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.404
And they have a whole
agricultural research service

00:46:31.404 --> 00:46:33.570
where they could actually
adopt some of these things

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:36.010
and have it as one
of their capabilities

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.590
that they can share
with the farmers.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.950
AUDIENCE: Do you release
your own measurements data

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:42.760
to the public?

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.700
Or do you think it
would make sense or not?

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.556
STEVE HIPSKIND: Aw,
a great question.

00:46:46.556 --> 00:46:48.180
I'm glad you asked
because that was one

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.470
of the points I meant to make.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.720
NASA and the United
States absolutely

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.680
sort of lead the world in the
fact that any data that we take

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.570
becomes publicly available
to everybody on the planet

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.360
when we take it.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.510
And that's actually
pushing a number

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:13.970
of other space-faring countries
to change their data policies.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:17.800
But yeah, that's one of
the beauties of what we do

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.410
is we make that data
publicly available.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:24.550
And so we actually have a
data system that was set up

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.320
when we started on this program
of Earth Observation System,

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.090
EOS.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.950
And indeed, we actually set up
a data distribution system back

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:36.120
before there was
a World Wide Web.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.030
And so there's some
challenging-- I mean,

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.930
NASA has tried to keep up.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:46.390
But I think what we're doing at
NASA Ames with the NASA Earth

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.570
Exchange and what you guys
are doing with Google Earth

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.860
Engine are exactly
the kind of things

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:57.360
that we need to be pushing
forward in that right now,

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.430
these data sets are in different
archives around the country.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:04.300
And so the typical
thing is for scientists

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.820
to go download that data and
run it on their home computer.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:14.110
And it was interesting in
that NEX and Google Earth

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.510
Engine had a very similar
heritage in that they

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:22.180
both recognize that compute
power has vastly improved.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.160
Storage has become
easier and cheaper,

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.860
but bandwidth hasn't
really kept up.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.420
So really, the idea is
bringing all that data

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.070
next to the analytics
and the models

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.820
so that people have
much more direct access

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.890
and so everybody's not trying
to move big, giant quantities

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:41.640
of data across the network.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.180
But that's facilitated
by the fact

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:49.490
that all of this data that we
create is publicly available.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:51.910
AUDIENCE: You showed the
pictures of the ozone hole

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:55.140
over Antarctica and
it didn't look--

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.360
even though the accord was made
a reasonably long time ago,

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.430
it didn't look like it was
closing significantly by 2000.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.930
It wasn't growing,
I agree with you.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.971
STEVE HIPSKIND: Well, I
don't remember, actually,

00:49:06.971 --> 00:49:07.930
which years I showed.

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:08.721
That was probably--

00:49:08.721 --> 00:49:10.240
AUDIENCE: 2011 was
the latest one.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:10.750
STEVE HIPSKIND: Pardon?

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.380
AUDIENCE: 2011 was the latest.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.255
STEVE HIPSKIND: Yeah.

00:49:12.255 --> 00:49:14.240
Well, and so the
interesting thing about that

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.110
is one of the challenges with
that is that the CFCs-- I mean,

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.930
they were developed
in the 1930s to be

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.940
extremely stable molecules.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.990
And so they have a very long
lifetime in the atmosphere.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:31.380
And so we expected in
the late '80s, early '90s

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.860
when they were looking
at Montreal Protocol

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:36.570
that it would probably
be about mid-century

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:39.570
because these molecules
have about a 50 to 60

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.385
year lifetime in the atmosphere.

00:49:41.385 --> 00:49:43.010
So it would probably
about mid-century.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.680
So what we do see-- I mean,
we monitor this stuff.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.800
And so what we do
see is that there's

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.930
been a tremendous reduction--
well, a reduction in the growth

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.840
rate, and actually, a reduction
in the total amount of chlorine

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.950
getting into the stratosphere.

00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:00.050
But you know, it's got such
a long lag in the system

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.030
that we don't expect
the ozone hole

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:06.860
to completely come
back to pre-1980s

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.635
until some time around 2050.

00:50:08.635 --> 00:50:11.760
So come back and talk
to me then and we'll

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.380
let you know if our
theories are right.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.320
AUDIENCE: So I know you
said that you guys have

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.430
the largest Earth science
group doing research.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.450
Is budget always a concern?

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.930
How do you guys lobby to get
more money or spread education

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.180
about earth science and stuff?

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.679
STEVE HIPSKIND: So
that's the beauty

00:50:28.679 --> 00:50:31.590
of being a civil servant.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:34.260
As NASA, we're an
executive agency.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.550
So we actually work
for the president.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:41.510
And so if we lobby,
we go to jail.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:46.010
So we can only do outreach
and talk about the great work

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:52.950
we do, but we are explicitly
prohibited from lobbying.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:56.490
But as you can imagine, it
is a very political thing.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:00.410
And for those of us that are
very critically dependent--

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:03.570
so we work for the
president, but the Congress

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.090
sets our budget.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.680
And if you follow
the Congress, you

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.090
know that there's
a certain party

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:14.880
in the country that's not that
interested in climate change.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:20.300
And so they actually tried to
cut our budget by about $600

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.880
million this year.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:31.320
Luckily, there's a lot of
political theater that goes on.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.860
But when it comes down to
actually generating the budget,

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.300
I think saner heads prevail.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:41.490
And so our budget looks like
it's going to be fairly stable.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:43.380
So that's one of our
challenges, is just

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.340
trying to make sure that we have
some stability in the budget

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.510
because these missions
are fairly expensive.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:53.530
And so when we get these
big radical shifts from year

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.592
to year, we have
quite a few people

00:51:56.592 --> 00:51:58.050
that are working
on these missions,

00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.410
and it's hard to start and stop.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:07.560
And so for us, it's really
just a matter of recognizing--

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.450
I mean, you can only really
take the pulse of the planet

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.990
if you're making
the measurements.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:17.700
And so the more that
we can get people

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:22.360
to appreciate the importance of
those continuous measurements,

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360
the better.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:29.160
But I mean, our opportunity
is to try to educate people

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.680
as much as possible.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.760
And it's interesting
in that I think-- well,

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.180
and so our budget, so in
the last Decadal Survey

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.880
that the National Research
Council did, for example,

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.090
they gave us a wish
list of a program that

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.280
probably would have taken
at least twice the budget

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.820
that we have now.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:56.590
And so we try to maintain
a stable executable program

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.860
but knowing that we can't
do everything that people

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:00.890
would like us to do.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.050
And then you get
into conversations

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:06.550
about national priorities
and what's more important.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:12.010
But I personally feel
that if we're really

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:15.890
going to try to make progress
in addressing climate change,

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:17.720
it can't be just the
federal government.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.610
It's got to be all of us--
from individual actions,

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.030
but also corporate
actions, which

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:27.300
can be challenging because
of course, corporations

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.220
have different responsibilities
to, say, shareholders.

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.760
And so I mean, we've
entered into a number

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.490
of public/private partnerships.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.010
But just getting
the conversation

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:44.260
going and speaking the same
language can be a challenge.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:49.860
And so I think working toward
those goals is, in my view,

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.390
very important.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:54.760
But I think part of it
is just getting people

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.320
to understand the
challenges that we face

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.530
and what it takes to
understand and address them.

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:01.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, thank you.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.030
STEVE HIPSKIND: OK, thank you.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.430
[APPLAUSE]
