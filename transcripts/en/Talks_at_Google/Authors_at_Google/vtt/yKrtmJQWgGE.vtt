[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.200
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
to Talks at Google

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.610
from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.750
This is a topic near and dear
to my heart, as a cyclist.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.210
So I'm very pleased to
introduce Margaret Guroff, who's

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.080
written a fascinating cultural
history of the bicycle

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200
and its surprisingly
broad impact on life

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.520
in this country, which
we'll speak about today.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.620
Margaret is a magazine
writer, an editor

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.000
with broad experience
in features,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.540
essays, and investigative work.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.160
Her regional and national awards
include the A.D. Emmart Prize

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.210
for Writing in the Humanities.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.870
A long time writing
teacher and public speaker,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.570
Guroff is also the
editor and publisher

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.570
of "Power Moby Dick," an online
adaptation of Herman Melville's

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.460
classic novel.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.070
She attended Wesleyan and
Johns Hopkins Universities

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.560
with degrees in English
and nonfiction writing,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.770
and she teaches nonfiction
writing to grad students

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.300
at Johns Hopkins.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.260
She was an editor at
Baltimore Magazine,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.660
and is currently executive
editor at the AARP magazine.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.711
Welcome, Margaret.

00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:06.599
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.650
MARGARET GUROFF: --much
for that introduction.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380
And thanks to all of
you for being here.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.250
I'm really happy to be
at Google particularly.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.820
This book wouldn't be the book
it is without Google Books.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.240
So if any of you works
for Google Books,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.340
I'd like you to come up later
so I can hug you, and perhaps

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.000
not stop hugging you.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.510
This is my book.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.230
And I was advised to start with
a joke, so I have one for you.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.500
He says, "I'm looking
forward to the time

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.000
when I shall make you one
of the happiest of women."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.249
And she says, "You
are very kind, sir,

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.040
but I do not think my
father would allow me

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490
to accept a bicycle from you."

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.940
So what's going on here?

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.810
This is a young woman
who would rather

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.067
have a bicycle than a fiance.

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:55.650
Well, if you know much about the
history of the United States,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.620
you know that in this period,
there was a major bicycle

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.670
boom going on.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.880
They seemed to be everywhere.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.340
Everyone either
wanted one or had one.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.229
In fact, in 1898, the year after
this appeared in the "Yonkers

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.690
Statesman," of all the national
advertising in the United

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.040
States, 10% was for
bicycles or bicycle parts.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.880
So they were really kind of
inescapable in this period.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.170
And as a result, they were very
influential in this period.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.160
But, if you start looking
at US history for bicycles,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.790
you start to see them everywhere
and discover that they really

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.209
had a big impact on the way
we have lived in the country,

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.000
from their appearance
here at the beginning

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.420
of the 19th century, and
through to the present day,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.550
which is something that
people are not as aware of.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.410
And that's why I
wrote this book.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.335
So what I'd like to do is I'll
read you a chunk of chapter 3.

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:47.460
But first, I'd like to give
you a little slide show

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.980
to catch you up to that part.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.020
So we'll do about 15 minutes of
slides, 15 minutes of reading.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.520
And then, if you
have any questions,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.800
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.690
So this is the first
proto beginning bicycle

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.450
that appeared in this country.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.280
It was invented in 1817 in
Germany, arrived here by 1819.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.780
They started to build them.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.440
It's called the draisine after
the guy who invented them,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.890
Baron von Drais.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.550
Looks a lot like a bicycle,
but there's one crucial thing

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.970
missing, which is the pedals.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.160
So this was more
kind of a glider.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.290
You had to Fred
Flintstone your way

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.790
across the countryside, which
is what that guy is doing over

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.890
there in the corner.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.360
It was made of iron originally.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.090
They could also
make them of wood.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.370
And very expensive because
you had to have them

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.400
made by an artisan for you.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.710
So these were for rich people.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.140
But they were
fascinating to everyone

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.880
because they could go up
to nine miles an hour,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.547
which is as fast
as a horse trots.

00:03:46.547 --> 00:03:48.380
And this is the first
thing that most people

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.380
had seen that could
go as fast as a horse.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.230
So there was a mania
for these in France,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.050
in England, and also
here during this period.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.830
People thought they
might replace the horse.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.290
But in the end, they
were very heavy.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.950
They were fun to go downhill on.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.490
Uphill, not so much.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.320
This is 50 pounds or more.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.740
And another important thing,
particularly in this country,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.350
was that the roads just
couldn't accommodate

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.140
this kind of locomotion.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.529
Most of them were not paved.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.970
So most of them were
rutted and muddy, or dusty,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.240
or they had things
growing up out of them,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.520
or they would go to a
certain point and then stop.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.030
Even the ones that were
paved had cobblestones kind

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.470
of up and down.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.230
Later on, some were made
of wood and they would rot.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.860
At this time, this was really
more of a toy than something

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.820
that people could
really get around on

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.660
or that could replace a horse.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.440
So it had a brief fashion,
and then it sort of went away.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.590
Another thing I wanted to
mention about the 19th century

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.900
that you may know is that
middle class and upper class

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.770
women during this whole
century, and prior to this,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.490
dressed in long dresses.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.210
It was considered indecent
to show your ankles.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.310
It wasn't just a dress.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.330
It was a dress plus underskirts
to make them puff out

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.660
like that-- in this
period, a hoop skirt.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.710
Later on, maybe a bustle.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.380
Even if you weighed only 105 or
110 pounds as a little woman,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.250
you could wear 25 pounds
worth of clothing.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.320
And so, in addition to all
the skirts and underskirts,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.524
they needed a corset, something
to really cinch in their waist,

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:33.190
but not just to make
them look skinnier,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.110
but actually to act as
kind of a scaffolding

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.960
to hang all this
clothing off of.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.830
So when you see a woman
dressed like this,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.530
you know she's also
very constrained

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.290
by some kind of corset that's
helping hold it all up.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.110
Now, with these
long skirts dragging

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.890
in the mud or the horse
manure or whatever

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.980
you had on the
road, it wasn't very

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.470
healthy with this constraining
corset, and people knew that.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.750
Reformers knew that.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.981
And at this period,
in 1851, they

00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:00.480
were talking about something
that made more sense for women.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.380
There was a rational
dress movement.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.440
This is Amelia Bloomer,
a newspaper editor.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.770
She advocated this
kind of a costume,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.080
which is still very modest,
but doesn't drag on the ground,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.050
doesn't have all
this heavy fabric.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.900
This was called a
Bloomer costume.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.590
She and several other feminists
were very strong supporters

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.520
of this costume.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.197
They were widely mocked.

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:22.530
People didn't want to wear this.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.670
Women did not want to wear this.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.050
And even Amelia Bloomer stopped
wearing it after a couple years

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.940
because she couldn't
get anything

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.490
done because people were
pointing at her and laughing.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.990
So women had an option.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.600
They could have adopted
a different way of dress,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.580
but they chose not to.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.580
They didn't want to do
that at this period.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.590
That's background, history,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.120
This is the next
iteration of the bicycle.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.220
It's called a pedal velocipede.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.480
This is from the
US patent in 1866.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.950
You can see there's
a new edition.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.270
It looks a lot like the
draisine, which was also

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.190
called a velocipede,
but now you've

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.260
got pedals on the front axle.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.097
So you can actually churn
and move without your feet

00:07:06.097 --> 00:07:06.930
touching the ground.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.780
This was the new
scientific marvel.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.030
They couldn't figure out.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.530
People would see
this thing coming

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.446
and they couldn't figure
out, how is it going?

00:07:14.446 --> 00:07:17.850
How is this person moving
without touching the ground?

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.700
This was also very heavy.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.860
The top part would
be still iron.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.340
These wheels are made of wood,
so they look like wagon wheels.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.750
That's basically what they were.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.370
This goes a little faster,
racing indoors maybe 12 miles

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.390
an hour.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.730
Another fad erupts in
Europe and also here.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:40.730
By 1869, this is a scene from a
velocipede riding school in New

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.269
York, because think about it.

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:43.560
Nobody knew how to ride a bike.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.740
They didn't exist.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.600
So these schools opened.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.770
People had to learn
how to balance,

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.430
how to pedal on
these heavy things.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.390
And then there was a
huge demand for them.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.950
And there was this expectation
that when the weather got

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.470
warm-- this was a winter scene.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.330
When the weather
got warm this year,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.780
people would be able to take
these out on the open road

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.840
and ride them as if
they were horses.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.520
They would be, for people
who couldn't afford a horse,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.410
an affordable way to get around.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.920
Even though they
were still pricey.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.760
They weren't for working people.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.050
These would cost
like $100 to $150,

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.620
and people would be earning
maybe $12 or $13 a month.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.977
But what happened here is
that they loved these things.

00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:24.060
They learned to ride them.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.851
And then, when the
weather got warm enough,

00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:28.365
they took them out onto
the crappy American roads

00:08:28.365 --> 00:08:30.520
and they couldn't get anywhere.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.429
So within a year
in this country,

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.679
these kind of faded away
as well for the most part.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.253
People rode them somewhat.

00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:39.169
Some people rode them.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.720
But they weren't fashionable.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.930
There was no more mania here.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.490
Now, in Europe, where
the roads were better,

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.500
people continued
to develop these.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.840
And one of the first and
most important developments

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.250
had to do with the
wheels because they

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.100
knew that if you want to go
faster on a bicycle, if you

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.770
make the wheel bigger,
the driving wheel,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.860
you can go farther for
each turn of the pedals.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.060
But, with these
wooden wheels, they

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.990
were so heavy that
you couldn't really

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.820
make them much bigger
because nobody would

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.640
be able to actually crank them.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.780
So what they did
was they started

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.710
using what we still
use today, which

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.130
is wires under tension to make
a lighter weight wheel that you

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.270
can make much bigger.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.501
And these got to be as big as
twice the length of the rider's

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.000
legs.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.900
You would order them
the way you order suits.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.960
This is one of the
first American ones.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.410
Again, they were developed
in Europe in 1870,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.360
came over here bit by bit.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.120
And then, by 1878,
they were being

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.360
manufactured in this country.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.000
And so this now
is a fast machine.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.100
It looks quaint to us.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.980
It looks like you would ride it
as a joke or if you're a clown.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.460
It was supersonic for them.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.907
It was high tech.

00:09:55.907 --> 00:09:57.740
It was the fastest thing
they had ever seen.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.570
These would go 17 miles an hour.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.070
Now you're going
faster than a horse

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.770
because you can go
longer than a horse.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.310
And, because the arch of
this wheel is so gentle,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.500
they actually roll over a
lot of the bumps in the road

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.050
that the smaller
wheel got caught in.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.170
So this is really
the first bicycle

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.270
that was up to America's
horrible roadways.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.700
And this is a scene
from a sporting book.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.620
Now, what you see here,
he's riding on the outdoors,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.540
having a grand old time.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.540
She is riding side saddle.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.900
And you can see she still
has that long skirt.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.060
In the story, she's
looking longingly at him.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.160
Historically, they were
looking longingly at the bike.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.520
So they wanted this.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.930
They wanted to go this
fast, women and older

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.870
people who couldn't
get up on these things.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.650
Because it went fast, so
it was difficult to ride

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.480
for that reason.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.220
Also, it was hard to get up on.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.490
You had to be strong.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.540
You had to be nimble.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.770
You had to run, get it
going, and then kind of

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.970
climb up the back of it.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.860
And then it was a
fixie, basically.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.000
So the pedals are going.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.810
So then you have to kind of
get your feet on the pedal.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.940
It was very difficult.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.100
So for women and
for older people,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.100
the manufacturers developed
these crazy looking tricycles.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.670
These are the big-- what
they call spider wheels,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.250
the wire spoke tension
wheels, three of them.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.930
This is a very heavy machine,
still very expensive.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.140
Costs about one and a
half times a bicycle,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.056
which is now still $100.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.222
And people are earning more,
but not that much more.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.530
They require a smoother road
because you have three tracks

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.890
that you need to get along.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.830
So if you have two smooth
tracks, and the third one hits

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.750
something, you kind of tip over.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.340
They were very heavy, so
you'd get stuck there.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.410
So these are not
a perfect vehicle.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.130
They were better than
nothing for women.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.490
But what the manufacturers
saw was that there was still

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.300
a market for something
that was safer,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.620
that wasn't this towering
thing that could go fast,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.510
and that older people
and women could ride.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.790
And that's when you get this.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.730
So in 1885 in
England, in 1887, this

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.140
was the first American made
called a safety bicycle.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.880
The addition here is the
chain, the bicycle chain

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.290
you can see around the pedals.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.300
And what that allows is
for the driving wheel,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.280
which is now the
rear wheel, to turn

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.700
more than once for every
time you crank the pedals.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.670
So this is also
a racing machine.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.720
But it's sold as a
safety, as something

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.550
that is more safe for people
who don't want to climb up

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.120
on that tall wheel--
which, by the way,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.540
also could really throw
you off because when you're

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.150
on that big wheel
bike, you're sitting

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.810
with your center of gravity
right on top of the bicycle.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.100
And so if you do hit
something on the roadway,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.370
you go plummeting.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.050
And head injuries were a big
problem with that high wheel

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:41.910
style.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.030
For this, you still
have these hard wheels.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:50.760
These would be wood wheels,
the rims, or hard rubber.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.180
And so you go back
to the problem

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.070
of roughness in the road.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.340
So now you have a fast
vehicle that's low enough,

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.810
but it doesn't have
the cushioning.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.230
And that's when they added this,
which is the pneumatic tires.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.800
This is the complete package.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.850
This is an airfield tire to
cushion the bumps in the road.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.520
It's low.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.150
It's fast.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.460
These were invented in
1888 by Dunlop in Ireland.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.990
And they came over here
shortly thereafter.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.550
And so the only
thing that's missing

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.380
to get a woman on this bike
is just the drop frame.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.605
Take that crossbar
and drop it down

00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:25.230
to that she can get
her skirts through.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.880
They wouldn't be these
huge, voluminous skirts.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.740
But she could still wear
an ankle length skirt

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.470
and ride a bicycle.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.680
And some of them wore bloomers.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.330
So this comes back, right?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:43.600
So now, by the mid-1890s, you
have possibly a young woman

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.520
who would rather have a
bicycle than a fiance, right?

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.950
She's got her
dropped frame here.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.950
She's got her
cushioned tires here.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.990
And she's got this bloomer
suit that allows her freedom.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.080
It was still
considered indecent.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.490
It's not that their perceptions,
their aesthetics had changed.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.490
What had changed was
that these young women

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.590
were willing to endure
ridicule at the beginning

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.850
in order to be able to
ride a bicycle because it

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.130
was that important to them.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.050
And what was important was being
able to go where they wanted

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.700
to go because women
in this period

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.220
were very constrained in
where they could properly go.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.590
And if you didn't have a
horse and carriage and driver,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.540
you couldn't really
get very far.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.770
If you wanted to
go out, usually you

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.410
would need to have a chaperone
in order for it to be proper.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.190
But with a bicycle,
you didn't need that.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.760
So this woman is threatening
to the social order, not only

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.730
because she is
indecently displaying

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.690
the shape of her
calf, but because she

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.320
can go where she wants to go.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.340
She's independent.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.240
And that was very threatening.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.400
So, with all that
said, I would like

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.170
to read to you
some from the book.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.120
And we're starting in a
couple years after this, 1896.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:59.250
This is a headline from the July
2nd, 1896 New Haven Register.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.280
"Moralists warned
that skimpy costumes

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.400
and unsupervised travel would
lead to wanton behavior.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.890
'Immodest bicycling by
young women is to be

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.229
deplored,' declared
Charlotte Smith,

00:15:10.229 --> 00:15:11.770
founder of the
Women's Rescue League,

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.830
a group that lobbied Congress
on behalf of fallen women.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.240
'Bicycling by young women
has helped to swell the ranks

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.690
of reckless girls who finally
drift into the army of outcast

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.840
women.' Smith reported
that her tours of brothels

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.060
and interviews with
prostitutes confirmed this.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.480
Physicians, who at the time
shouldered responsibility

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.160
for patients' moral, as
well as physical well-being,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.850
had their own concerns.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.040
One visited New
York's Coney Island

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.680
and saw a 16-year-old
cyclist get drunk

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.340
on wine provided by a beautiful
but nefarious older woman.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.840
'She looked like an innocent
child but was away from home

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.899
influence,' the
doctor reported."

00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:50.190
And this part I'm just going
to paraphrase because it's

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.670
being videotaped,
but doctors were also

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:57.190
concerned that the pressure
from the bicycle seat

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.270
would cause teenagers
to get ideas

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.580
about certain solitary
sexual practices

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.560
that they wouldn't have
thought of otherwise.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.260
And this was considered
to be dangerous

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.860
to their spiritual well-being.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.110
"But the bicycles' peril was
medical as well as moral.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.740
In the late 19th century,
many saw physical energy

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.100
as a finite resource that had
to be carefully parceled out,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.890
not a power to be
renewed through exercise.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.120
The fashionable malaise of
neurasthenia was only one

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.720
of the disorders
thought to be caused

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.830
by a depletion of energies.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.030
Overexertion could also cause
tuberculosis, scoliosis,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.610
hernias, heart disease,
and other maladies,

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.880
doctors believed.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.880
Safely sedentary
middle class women,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.040
who frequently suffered
from varicose veins

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.550
and other consequences
of annual pregnancies,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.130
were prone to fatigue.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.770
One Boston writer called
them 'A sex which is born

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.020
tired,' adding that, 'Society
seems little better than

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.210
a hospital for invalid women.'
Particularly for women in heavy

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.210
dresses and
constraining corsets,

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.520
any activity that raised the
heart rate could seem more

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.250
likely to be the cause of
fainting and listlessness than

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.480
their remedy.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.310
Opponents of the bicycle
latched onto this perception,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.800
arguing that riding would cost
women more effort than they

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.329
could afford.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.190
'The exertion necessary to
riding with speed is productive

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.440
of an excitation of nervous
and physical energy that is

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.000
anything but beneficial,'
Charlotte Smith warned.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.609
'If a halt is not called soon,
75% of the cyclists will be

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:28.160
an army of invalids
within the next 10 years.'

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.560
But even as Smith made
her dire predictions,

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.150
Americans' fear of
cardiovascular exercise

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.530
was beginning to lift.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.500
For decades, health
reformers had trumpeted

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.890
the benefits of fitness.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.870
And during the 1880s,
the United States

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.680
saw a spike in organized
physical activity.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.680
Citizens of America's
growing cities

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.350
tried new sports, such
as baseball and football.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.370
And exercise advocates built
the first public playgrounds

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.590
and pushed for physical activity
for both boys and girls.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.410
Doctors continued to caution
against overexertion.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.450
But they acknowledged
that, in moderation,

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.850
fresh air and exercise tended
to improve patients' health.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.960
The high wheeled
bicycle of the 1880s

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.760
proved the benefits
of regular exercise

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.080
to those who could ride it.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.790
Proponents made
extravagant claims

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.350
for the risky machine's
ability to restore well-being.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.330
'For constipation,
sleeplessness, dyspepsia,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.230
and many other ills which
flesh is heir to, not to speak

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.130
of melancholy, all are curable,
or certainly to be improved,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.340
by the new remedy, bicycle,'
wrote a Texas physician

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.810
in 1883.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.570
'It is always an
excellent prescription

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.230
for the convalescents, and
nearly always for chronic

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.010
invalids.'

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.190
Not everyone could take
the prescription, though.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.320
High wheeled cycling
and rigorous team sports

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.420
were acceptable
only for young men.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.940
The new games deemed
suitable for mixed company,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.090
such as lawn tennis and
golf, were far less taxing,

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.030
and therefore far less likely to
lead to noticeable improvements

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.360
in fitness.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.020
As for working out on your
own, the recommended options

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.670
were either too costly,
like horseback riding,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.330
or too boring, like
indoor calisthenics,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.990
to gain much popularity.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.590
As a result, many more
Americans of the 1880s

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.330
thought they ought to exercise
than actually did it."

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.510
And I wanted to show you--
this was from an 1889 exercise

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.480
manual.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.540
So we're not talking
about CrossFit here.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.570
They weren't
interested in sweating.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.157
"So when the safety
bicycle appeared

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:20.740
at the end of the
decade and Americans

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.610
began riding in large numbers--
an estimated two million

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.460
in 1896 out of a population
of about 70 million-- few

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.750
were certain how such
vigorous physical activity

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.390
would affect them.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.020
Doctors were wary.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.040
Most US physicians believed
that patients' conditions were

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.900
largely based on their habits,
their experiences, the weather,

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.990
and other environmental factors.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.870
Good health was a reflection of
proper balance among the body's

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.770
systems and energy.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.080
'A distracted mind could
curdle the stomach.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.680
A dyspeptic stomach could
agitate the mind,' writes

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.420
the medical historian
Charles Rosenberg.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.387
It was the doctor's job to
know each patient well enough

00:19:57.387 --> 00:19:59.095
to restore balance
when something was out

00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:02.360
of whack, using laxatives,
diuretics, and other purging

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.250
drugs to reboot the system.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.690
'Even contagious diseases could
not be treated in a cookie

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.970
cutter fashion,' argued an
1883 medical journal editorial.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.290
'No two instances of typhoid
fever or of any other disease

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.640
are precisely alike.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.220
No rule of thumb, no recourse
to a formula book will avail

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.000
for proper treatment even of
the typical diseases.' To many

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.750
doctors, advocating a specific
drug to cure a specific disease

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.440
seems the height of quackery.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.730
And, just as there were no
one-size-fits-all medical

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.190
treatments, many physicians
believed there were no

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.460
one-size-fits-all
exercise routines.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.070
While cycling enthusiasts
rhapsodized about the safety

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.830
bicycle's benefits for riders
of both sexes and all ages,

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.700
doctors fretted that
many of their patients

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.620
would be harmed by
the new machines.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.760
Even seeming success
stories were suspect.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.410
In an 1895 paper
on heart disease,

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.000
one doctor reported
that a patient who

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.260
had panted for breath after
climbing one flight of stairs

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.660
was now able to cycle
up hills with ease.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.520
'It would be wrong to conclude
from this that cycling is not

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.480
injurious,' the doctor wrote.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.230
There hadn't been enough time to
observe the bicycle's long term

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.650
effect.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.970
Moreover, as an
unfamiliar activity,

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.480
cycling tended to catch the
blame for pretty much anything

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.200
bad that happened to a
new rider afterward, up to

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.330
and including death.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.380
Logically, acute
injuries were a concern.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.960
Though the safety
bicycle did greatly

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.260
reduce the risk of head wounds,
it didn't obliterate that risk,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.190
particularly among scorchers,
thrill seeking youngsters

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.750
who hunched over
their handlebars

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.750
and pedaled as fast
as they could."

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.610
And I have a picture
of a scorcher for you.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.530
This is the unrestrained
demon of the wheel.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.860
This is from 1893, by the way.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.680
" 'It might seem almost
impossible to fracture a skull

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.820
thick enough to permit
indulgence in such

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.350
practices,' reported of
the Boston Medical Surgical

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.000
Journal, 'but the bicycle
at full speed has been able

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.660
to accomplish it.' Medical
journals also noted the danger

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.310
of road rash and broken bones.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.110
More insidious than
crash injuries,

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.660
though, were new
chronic complaints

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.160
attributed to cycling.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.340
The bent over posture
of the scorcher

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.490
was thought to cause a
permanent hunch called

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:13.840
chiphosis bicyclisterum or,
familiarly, cyclist's stoop.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.680
Repeated stress to the
cardiovascular system-- that

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.250
is, regular workouts-- could
lead to irregular heartbeats

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.530
and poor circulation,
a bicycle heart.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.170
Gripping the
handlebars too tightly

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.040
might cause finger
numbness, or bicycle hand.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.690
And a dusty ride could
trigger cyclist's sore throat.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.210
Practically every
body part seemed

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.180
to have its own
cycle-related malady.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.160
At least one New York doctor
devoted his entire practice

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.640
to treating such ailments.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.930
Of all the physical woes
attributed to the bike,

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.380
though, the one that
most strained credulity

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.970
was the bicycle face."

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.786
So let's just bring this
guy in a little closer.

00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:56.210
"Characterized by wide, wild
eyes, a grim set to the mouth,

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.280
and a migration
of facial features

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.640
toward the center,
the disorder was

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.890
said to result from the
stress of incessant balancing.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.260
A German philosopher claimed
that the condition drained

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.520
'every vestige of intelligence
from the sufferer's appearance

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.950
and rendered children
unrecognizable to their own

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.600
mothers.' The bicycle face hung
on, too, warned a journalist.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.460
'Once fixed upon
the countenance,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.910
it can never be removed.' "

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.900
So let's just get
that off the screen.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.060
This is a magazine from 1896.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.590
"The doctors raising these
alarms were careful to state

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.330
that many of the new
diseases affected

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.260
only cyclists predisposed to
them, which would explain why

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.859
so few of their
fellow physicians

00:23:35.859 --> 00:23:37.400
might have encountered
the disorders.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.820
'Whilst thousands ride immune,
a small percentage will

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.170
suffer,' wrote one doctor.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.650
Another, who blamed
cases of appendicitis,

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.000
inflammatory bowel disease, and
the thyroid condition Graves'

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.480
disease on excessive cycling,
that it didn't matter

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.330
how many people
believed that cycling

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.840
had improved their health.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.190
'It would not affect my argument
in the least if swarms of them

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.620
had been rescued
from the grave.'

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.760
Nevertheless, the
more Americans took

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.310
to cycling, the more tenuous
these claims of danger

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.670
came to seem.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.220
The machine made
physical activity

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.200
both practical and fun.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.590
'The bicycle is inducing
multitudes of people to take

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.630
regular exercise, who have long
been in need of such exercise,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.000
but who could never be induced
to take it by any means

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.890
hitherto devised,' one doctor
wrote in Harper's Weekly

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.840
in 1896.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.890
And all that activity
had an effect.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.020
Riders quickly noticed
improved muscle tone,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.440
increased strength, better
sleep, and brighter moods.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.780
'Women especially transformed
themselves,' wrote the novelist

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.921
Maurice Thompson in 1897.

00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:39.250
'We have already become
accustomed to seeing

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.920
sun browned faces, once
sallow and languid,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.320
whisk past us at every
turn of the street.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.010
The magnetism of vivid health
has overcome conservative

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.260
barriers that were impregnable
to every other force.'

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.800
The empirical evidence
of cycling's health value

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.500
began to overtake conservative
doctors' concerns,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.262
as the rhetoric scholar Sarah
Overbaugh Hallenbeck argues.

00:25:00.262 --> 00:25:02.470
'Though many physicians
continued to raise objections

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.370
to the sport, their voices
were increasingly drowned out

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.870
by those of more
observant and pragmatic

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.720
practitioners.' 'The bicycle
face, elbow, back, shoulders,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.730
neck, eroticism, wrote one
military doctor in 1896,

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:22.190
'I pass as not worthy of
serious consideration.'

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.250
Rather than discourage
bicycle use,

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.250
most physicians came to
cautiously endorse it.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.440
'So long as a cyclist can
breathe with the mouth

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.300
shut,' wrote one
such doctor in 1895,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.600
'he is certainly perfectly
safe.' Some went further,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.270
citing evidence of the bike's
benefits for heart patients,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.020
migraine sufferers, diabetics,
and others with chronic

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.180
conditions.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.860
In Chicago, the demand for
injectable morphine dropped

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.880
as patients with anxiety
or insomnia discovered that

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.510
'a long spin in the fresh air
on a cycle induces sweet sleep

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.230
better than their favorite
drug,' the Bulletin of Pharmacy

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.780
reported.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.550
This shift paralleled
a transformation

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.770
in medical thinking
during the 1890s,

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.750
when American
physicians increasingly

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.910
embraced the scientific method.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.520
Some clinics in
continental Europe

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.730
had adopted this
evidence-based approach

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.500
early in the 19th
century, using statistics

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.630
to determine the
efficacy of treatments,

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.010
and evaluating patients'
conditions according

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.270
to universal norms,
rather than trying

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.140
to divine what was normal
for each individual patient.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.200
In the United States,
however, doctors

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.140
arguing for this approach
were long in the minority.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.290
Only at the very end
of the 19th century

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.540
did a research-based
curriculum take hold

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.190
at US medical schools.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.530
It would be folly to suggest
that the bicycle alone

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.240
caused this transformation.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.260
Many other factors were at play,
such as improved transatlantic

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.630
communication, an influx
of European immigrants,

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.400
including scientists, and
a snowballing of evidence

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.600
for new medical concepts, such
as the germ theory of disease.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.670
But, even if the bike
did not independently

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.970
modernize American medicine,
its unprecedented impact

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.210
on fitness, and the
clash this revealed

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.910
between what doctors said
and what experience showed,

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.230
may well have
accelerated the shift.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.950
Much as the bicycle triggered
changes in women's dress

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.110
that high-minded
advocacy could not,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.630
it bolstered scientists'
then radical argument

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.750
that what is good for
one human body tends

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.110
to be just as good for another.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.056
To the bicycle
faithful of the 1890s,

00:27:18.056 --> 00:27:20.180
this seemed to be just the
beginning of the changes

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.180
that the machine
would bring about.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.750
'The gulf between social
classes would recede under

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.770
the influence of this great
leveler,' one enthusiast wrote

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.510
in The Century magazine.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.760
'It puts the poor man on
the level with the rich,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.690
enabling him to sing the song
of the open road as freely

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.460
as the millionaire, and to
widen his knowledge by visiting

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.090
the regions near to
or far from his home,

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.160
observing how other men live.'

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.830
And while women may not
yet have had full access

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.810
to higher education, or
even the right to vote,

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.670
the unchaperoned,
self-propelled Bloomer Girl

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.620
seemed to be pedaling
in that direction.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.200
'In possession of her bicycle,
the daughter of the 19th

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.980
century feels that the
declaration of her independence

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.030
has been proclaimed,' wrote
one female journalist.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.060
'And in the fullness of time,
all things will be added

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.790
to complete her happiness
and prosperity.'

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.770
The first wave feminist Susan
B. Anthony was born in 1820,

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.220
one year after
the first draisine

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.140
was exhibited in the US.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.800
By the time of the safety
bicycle boom in the 1890s,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.400
she was a snowy-haired eminence
too old to risk riding,

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.770
but she had an
opinion of the sport.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.670
'I'll tell you what I think of
bicycling,' she said in an 1896

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.430
newspaper interview, as she
leaned forward to lay a hand

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.030
on the reporter's arm.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.170
'I think it has done more to
emancipate woman than any one

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.600
thing in the
world.' " Thank you.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.905
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:43.905 --> 00:28:45.530
AUDIENCE: So you're
a cyclist yourself,

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.530
I believe, riding around
Bethesda and Washington DC.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.870
And it's clear that
cyclists are kind

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.610
of not necessarily
representative

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.110
of the population as a whole.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:01.390
You've got kids riding, and
some city people who may not

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.140
be able to afford a car.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.850
But a lot of cyclists are
upper middle class, very white,

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.600
more male than female.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.190
I mean, if you look at
sports cycling, for example.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.729
What's your take on that.

00:29:14.729 --> 00:29:17.020
MARGARET GUROFF: Well, that's
the way it's always been,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.810
pretty much.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.510
In this country,
the bicycle industry

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.730
has been dominated
by older white men.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.990
And what's happening
right now is

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.250
that we have a very
diverse population,

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:37.640
but the bicycle is popular in
cities among prosperous people.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.180
So you have these
whole swathes of kids

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.990
who live in rural
places, or live in exurbs

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.120
where it's really not safe.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.090
There aren't places
for kids to ride bikes.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.140
Or it's not part of
their family's tradition

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.140
if they're immigrants.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.850
And so you've got kind of this
bifurcation of the population,

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:59.400
where people who
love bikes, who they

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.740
may buy a new bike every
year, every five years.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.854
They're very into the sport and
they're getting more into it.

00:30:04.854 --> 00:30:06.270
They're spending
more money on it.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.460
But then, at the other
end, you have the people

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.420
who you would expect
to be growing up

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.080
into the sport are not.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.150
They're doing other things.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.090
It's something that
bicycle manufacturers are

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.629
really puzzling over right now.

00:30:19.629 --> 00:30:21.670
AUDIENCE: You're focusing
on bicycles in America.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.480
What was happening
across the pond?

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.460
Was there similar stories
playing out in Europe,

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.524
or were things different?

00:30:28.524 --> 00:30:30.440
MARGARET GUROFF: It
depends, because this book

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.590
covers 200 years.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:36.110
So there were periods where
things went in parallel,

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.050
like this period that
I'm talking about,

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.890
that things tended to emerge
in England or in France

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.709
and then get heard of over here.

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:45.250
In some cases, there
were things that

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.880
were happening here first
that may have translated back

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.200
over there.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.060
It's a little murky.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:56.090
And these booms tended to happen
on both sides at the same time.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:00.590
So in 1818, 1819, people
were crazy for the draisine

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.800
in France and England.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.800
1869, there was another
velocipede craze

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.090
in both places.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.980
Then here, it kind of
dropped off, kept on there.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.840
But then immediately within
10 years was back here.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.090
And then the 1890s bicycle
boom was in the Western world,

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.660
so in Europe as well as here.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.310
What happened right after
that with the crash,

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.910
people kept riding
bikes in Europe.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.700
And adults kept riding
them for utility,

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.230
even if not because of fashion.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.100
But here, it quickly
became something

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.710
that adults did not do,
and that the industry

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.000
focused on selling to kids.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.900
And that's the main difference
between here and there,

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.740
was that for most
of the 20th century,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.690
riding a bicycle was
not really something

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.540
that an adult would think
of doing, particularly where

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.680
other adults could see them.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.460
So hopefully,
that's changed now.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.480
AUDIENCE: So your
book is primarily

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.710
about sort of the history
of cycling in North America.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.420
I'm kind of curious where
you think things are heading

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.890
and how some of these
historical trends

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.540
might be manifesting
themselves now?

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.510
MARGARET GUROFF: That
is a great question.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.150
There are some
question marks, though.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:16.120
There are some
things that we don't

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.480
know that are going to direct.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.750
I mean, looking at the
history of cycling,

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.800
it's very up and down.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.970
There's very boom and bust.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.630
So just, if you're
reading the patterns,

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.900
you would say, right now,
it's really popular in cities.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.690
And in 10 years,
everyone's going

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.030
to be doing something else.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.400
But then it will come back.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.540
Now, the main question
mark is what's

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.620
going to happen with
self-driving cars,

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.890
like the Google car.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.930
Because there are people
who think that-- I mean,

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.930
these are coming, right?

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.721
And there are people
who think that they're

00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:47.640
going to reduce
private car ownership

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.830
and reduce traffic to the extent
that the roads will become much

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.570
more accommodating to cyclists.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:56.804
And also, since fewer
people own cars,

00:32:56.804 --> 00:32:58.970
there will be more of a
meeting of the minds instead

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.050
of this fight for asphalt.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.200
If things go wrong,
there could be

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.690
a lot of private
self-driving cars

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.262
that are just kind of bumper
caring into each other all day

00:33:08.262 --> 00:33:09.970
waiting for their
owners to get off work.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.950
And if they're poorly programmed
or if they're poorly regulated,

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.230
the roads then become
someplace, again,

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.000
that's very unsafe for cyclists
and people stop doing it.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.580
And that may go city
by city or state

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.300
by state, depending on how
the organizations respond

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.784
to this new technology.

00:33:28.784 --> 00:33:30.200
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.324
MARGARET GUROFF: Thank you.

00:33:31.324 --> 00:33:34.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.710
You.
