00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.050
All right.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.200
So this is going to be
the 30 second version.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.170
If you want more detail, check out the
next video where I'll be spending seven

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.340
or eight minutes really diving into
how I use dev tools to make changes.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.810
The meta tag looks like this, copy and

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.340
paste this line into the head of
your HTML and you are good to go.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.050
In order to make everything
display in a single column,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.370
I needed to make it take
up the full viewport.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.460
The basic idea is that I ran
through the CSS looking for

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.370
any containers with fixed
widths set smaller than 100%.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.820
Then, I simply made them 100%.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.520
Using a relative width of 100% means
that an element is going to take up as

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.950
much space as it can,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.500
which means that if you've got
a container it'll take up the viewport.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.870
Tab targets that's easy just
add some padding to all of

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.167
your a tags I used 1.5em and
after that I tested, and

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:56.530
here it is on mobile and
here it is when the screen gets wider,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.100
notice that everything is
taking up the full viewport.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.660
Now if you want the full story of how
this happened watch the next video.
