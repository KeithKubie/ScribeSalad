00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:03.804
As we go to our next game

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.241
Point of No Return.
Point of No Return.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.581
Life is a journey full
of wondrous milestones,

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.117
like a baby's first steps,
a child's first kiss,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.854
jacking off to the DVD box
of your mom's workout video,

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.190
hearing the garage door open,
and desperately wiping off

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.359
the DVD before she gets back
from the grocery store

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.361
and crying 'cause you don't know
what's happening to your body,

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.529
and then
eventually getting married

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.063
and having a family of your own.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:33.000
So, while universal experiences
like those come

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.468
at different times
for different people,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.471
Thrillist has compiled a list
of things we should stop doing

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.639
at certain ages.

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.141
Like age three,
stop sucking your thumb.

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:44.144
All right.
Age 25, stop working for free.

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:46.680
Age 33, stop crying at work.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.348
But...

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.017
-I'm sure some...
-33?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.220
33. 33's the cutoff.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.355
-They give you a long time...
-Seems pretty far, yeah.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.491
-Yes. -That's a long time
to stop crying.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.160
It's 35 in New Jersey.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.963
I'm sure some
were left off the list,

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.431
so I'd like you to give me
some other things

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.433
you should have gotten over
by a certain age in 60 seconds.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.435
-And begin. Randazzo.
-(bell dings)

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.437
Age 20,
stop marrying Hugh Hefner.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.439
-Points. Hodgman.
-(bell dings)

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.175
Age 49, stop kidding yourself
that you're anything but meat.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.844
-Points. Paul F.
-(bell dings)

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.179

Charles Bukowski.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:21.515
-Points. Paul F. Tompkins.
-(bell dings)

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:25.786
Age 18, stop being dead
for three years. Dogs only.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:26.987
Points.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.189
-(bell dings)
-Randazzo.

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:32.459
Age 27, stop telling everyone
you're an atheist.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:33.794
We (bleep) know.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.129
-All right, points. Paul F.
-(bell dings)

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.398
Age 45, being relevant.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.000
All right, points.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.068
-(bell dings)
-Randazzo.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.736
Age seven, stop wetting the bed.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.339
-Points. Randazzo.
-(bell dings)

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.674
Age 67,
start wetting the bed again.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.277
-Points. Randazzo!
-(bell dings)

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.946
Oh! Age 81,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.950
stop referring to the Irish as
dirty potato (bleep), Grandpa.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:58.552
Points.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.287
-(bell dings)
-Hodgman.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.290
Age 1,037, stop drinking
the blood of orphans

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.825
to replenish
your wretched life force.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:04.925
(buzzer sounds)
