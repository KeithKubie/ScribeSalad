00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.960
George Lucas could never have known that his
space opera would turn into one of the most

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.200
well-known and profitable movie franchises
in history.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.340
If he had, the director might have spent a
bit more time filming the original series

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.680
to make sure some of the more entertaining
mistakes were left on the cutting room floor.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.250
Luckily, that wasn’t the case, which means
fans can spot each and every obvious or hard-to-miss

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.250
error.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.300
Even after all these years, Luke Skywalker’s
big screen adventure still has a few surprises.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.010
Here are Screenrant’s 10 Star Wars Movie
Mistakes You Missed.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.090
Luke’s Ghost

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.870
It’s no secret that some of George Lucas’s
“improvements” on the original film weren’t

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.780
popular with fans, but just as many new mistakes
seemed to slip into new editions.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.580
When Luke’s aunt and uncle wake up to find
him already out searching for R2-D2, there’s

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.220
something off about the shot of the empty
homestead.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.940
What looks like rolling film is actually a
still image, with a ghostly image of Luke

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.390
visible in one of the doorways.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.860
Was Skywalker a Force ghost the entire time,
and fans just never knew?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.940
Creepy.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.540
Wired Lightsabers

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.409
The weapons of the Jedi Knights were more
than cutting edge, but on set, they’re was

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590
actually a clever use of old-fashioned tech.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.960
The swords had three sides covered in reflective
tape, which would rotate to give off a shimmering

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.960
effect.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.900
It worked wonders at the time – except when
Obi-Wan and Darth Vader first face off, and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.100
the white power cord is clearly visible running
from the Jedi’s saber up his sleeve.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.329
Rebel Editing

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:37.439
George Lucas didn’t have every detail of
his story down pat before filming, which meant

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.569
a few scenes had to be edited out or trimmed
down in post-production.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.399
When Luke is reunited with his friend Biggs
before the attack on the Death Star, their

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.249
commanding officer shows up to meet his newest
pilot.

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.600
The man originally made an offhand comment
about knowing Luke’s father, but knowing

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.609
what problems that would cause, Lucas decided
to edit it out, obscuring the cut with an

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.999
unknown person walking in front of the camera.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.030
Unfortunately, R2-D2’s sudden jump in the
background made sure the cut would stand out

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.439
for all time.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.810
Dusty Saber

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.909
The swordfighting choreography improved over
the course of the series, but in the first

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.870
movie, actors Alec Guinness and David Prowse
took their duel as seriously as possible.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.880
Even though they were constantly told to NOT
slam their stunt swords together for fear

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.040
of breaking them, they couldn’t hold back.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.439
They’re supposed to be beams of energy in
the movie, but with every hit, it’s easy

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.959
to see the clouds of dust flying off.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.620
These days, it hopefully just adds to the
tension.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.620
Colorless Droids

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.290
The special effects team basically created
the entire industry with Star Wars, so some

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.980
mistakes can be forgiven.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.320
These days we know that if a character is
dressed in blue, a green backdrop will be

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.200
needed to add in effects.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.640
In the first movie, that fact slipped by.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.260
So with every shot of R2-D2 riding aboard
Luke’s X-Wing, it’s hard to miss his blue

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.450
paint job suddenly turned black, effectively
rendered see-through thanks to the blue screen

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.739
used by the crew.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.430
Luke’s Lips

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.420
George Lucas may add in aliens or boulders
wherever he chooses, but what happens if you

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.170
want to add a line of dialogue that an actor
never spoke?

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.829
That’s the problem with Luke’s arrival
on the planet Dagobah.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.640
When he explains that he’s there to search
for Yoda, his extra line – “if he even

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.230
exists” – wasn’t spoken by actor Mark
Hamill.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.630
The special effects team tried to cheat by
altering the darkness of the actor’s mouth,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.549
but there was just no way to fake it.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.299
Jedi Knights are apparently gifted ventriloquists.

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.519
Tipping Walkers

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.760
No Star Wars fan will forget the adrenaline
rush, or the laughter of seeing a massive

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.790
Imperial Walker brought down with a single
rope in the Battle of Hoth.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.989
But Luke proves he doesn’t need anything
but a lightsaber and a thermal detonator to

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.189
bring one to its knees.

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.269
It’s an impressive stunt, but a little less
fantastic when you notice the stick being

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.290
used to simply push up one of the walker’s
back feet to tip it to one side (Episode V

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.420
33:04 on the back left foot)

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.120
Familiar Asteroid

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.969
Every director knows the value of using old
or unused footage to make a different scene

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.980
pop, and the asteroid field of the Empire
Strikes Back is famous for including everything

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.209
from potatoes to old running shoes.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.280
But one asteroid is a bit more familiar.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.370
Apparently, the effects team decided to re-purpose
a shot of the Millenium Falcon flying through

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.349
the field, applying the view from inside the
ship’s cockpit.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.230
But keep an eye on the asteroid flying in
from the bottom corner (bottom left, as soon

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.130
as Han comes to the cockpit), and you’ll
notice the unmistakable shape of Han Solo’s

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.139
ship flying by.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.989
The effects team managed to blur out details
of the hull, but its barrel roll makes it

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.900
impossible to miss.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.830
What’s My Line?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.950
When the Falcon finds a home in a massive
space worm, a tremor sends Princess Leia into

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.470
the captain’s arms.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.640
It’s hard to know how many times the actors
had to perform the scene, but Harrison Ford

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.320
clearly got bored first.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.500
When Carrie Fisher tells her co-star that
she’s less than excited, Ford silently mouths

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.530
her entire line along with her.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.640
Watch Your Head

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.830
These days it’s rare to see a CG effect
or object actually pop through or on top of

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.120
an actor’s performance, since attention
to detail has never been higher.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.660
But back in the early days, layering one effect
onto another shot was a time-consuming process.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.160
So when Darth Vader’s shuttle was rendered
a little too low on the landing pad of Endor’s

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.780
moon, the mistake was left in.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.450
Audiences now get to enjoy seeing Vader’s
black helmet passing through the nose of his

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.500
ship on every viewing.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.560
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.780
