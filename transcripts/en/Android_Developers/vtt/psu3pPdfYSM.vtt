00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.500
- A strong launch helps set
your app on the path to success.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.133
This video gathers ten tips

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.666
to making your app launch
a great one.

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.400
You need a great app
in order to have a great launch.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.100
Make sure your app measures up

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.800
by testing it against
the Android quality guidelines

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.300
on developers.android.com

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.300
and then review the guidelines
for each form factor

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.300
you're supporting--

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.200
from tablet to TV,
wear, and auto.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.566
Age rating your app provides
users around the world

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.600
with assurance
about its content.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.866
Once you've completed
the questionnaire,

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.766
your app will be age rated.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.266
Local ratings familiar
to local audiences

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.866
will be delivered for
key markets around the globe.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.333
The Play Store listing
is a critical part

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.733
of your app's marketing.

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.533
Impress them with how your app
would look on their device

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:09.166
using icons, screenshots,
graphics, and videos.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.466
Set up store listing experiments
in the developer console

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.700
to test different graphics
and text as soon as you can

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
in order to make data driven
improvements to your listing.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.966
Apps in the user's
local language

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.800
are more likely
to be downloaded.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300
Translate the listing's
descriptive text

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900
and remember to translate
the text in screenshots,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.833
graphics, and video too.

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.400
You can use
the app translation service

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.366
in the developer console.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.666
Many of your potential users

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.600
will be on limited
data connections,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.900
so apps with smaller APKs
will get more downloads.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.666
You can reduce your APK size

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:52.400
by getting rid of unused
library dependencies,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.500
implementing appropriate
animations and code,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.066
providing resources for only the
most popular screen densities.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.966
It's important to test to see
how your app functions

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.800
and fares before you launch,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.600
so test against the most popular
devices in your target markets.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.433
Get your user community to help

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.733
by taking part in beta tests.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:19.066
And sign up for the Cloud Test
Lab in the developer console

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:21.100
to automatically test
your beta app

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.600
on hundreds
of popular physical devices

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.566
and receive detailed analysis
of any issues.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.666
When you launch your new app
or game, you'll create interest

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:34.533
amongst prospective users
and established ones.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.000
Don't waste this.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.300
You might, if they can't get
your app or update

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.233
at the same time
as everyone else.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:42.166
Keep your momentum by launching
on Android,

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:44.700
on all form factors
simultaneously

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.033
with your other platforms,

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.600
or try to let users
with other platforms know

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.133
that support is coming and offer
them a way to get notified.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.766
The press and bloggers are
always looking for good content,

00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:00.800
so let them have it
as early as possible.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.766
Create a list of local
and global contacts.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.533
Go for app and game bloggers,

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.633
but target vertical publications
too.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:09.500
For example,
if you have a travel app,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.400
also include
travel publications.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.933
Create a press pack.

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.166
Include screenshots,
a summary of your app or game,

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:18.466
the pitch for what makes it
awesome or unique,

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:20.566
and something interesting
about your company.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:26.266
Marketing your app is essential
to making it stand out

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:27.300
from the crowd.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.000
Create a plan
to use social media,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.333
video content,

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.900
app install ads,
and more.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.700
Keep interest high
after your launch

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.400
with strong reinforcement.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.133
Consider offers,
incentives,

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:43.166
and reminders
tied to specific events.

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:48.500
Once your app is live,
users will have questions,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.700
find issues,
and look to you for support.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.566
There are several ways
to provide this:

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:55.466
monitor the contact email on
your app's Play Store listing,

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:59.366
create a Google Group to enable
users to post support questions,

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.966
consider using a third-party
customer support product.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.100
Responding will keep
users engaged

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.633
and build customer loyalty.

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:07.633

on launching your app,
