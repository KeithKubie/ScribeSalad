00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.724
- [Voiceover] So in the last video

00:00:01.724 --> 00:00:03.968
we talked about Euler's
formula and then we showed

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:07.109
the expressions for how to
extract a cosine and a sine

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.787
from Euler's formula
and we have a powerful

00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:12.106
set of expressions there for relating

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:13.876
exponentials to sine waves.

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:16.900
So now I want to show you
an example just to preview

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.451
of when we get to the formal AC analyses

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:21.988
how we are gonna exploit
these expressions.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.255
How we are going to
exploit these formulas.

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:25.828
This is a real world signal.

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:27.812
This cosine turn, let's
suppose we build something

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:29.812
that has a cosine to it.

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.173
That can be something like a microphone

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:34.749
that's hearing sounds
that look like sine waves

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.005
and we would model those
sine waves as a cosine wave

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.956
and they come in to
some electronic system.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.551
So let me draw a sketch
of the clever approach

00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:44.301
that we're gonna use.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.829
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.209
here's a circuit I'm imagining.

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:55.192
There's resistors and there's capacitors

00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:57.548
and there's inductors.

00:00:57.548 --> 00:01:01.327
Linear elements and we can have
sources and stuff like that.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.728
So there's something in here

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:06.895
and we have something going
in and something coming out.

00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:10.729
Voltage and current coming out.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.229
Voltage and current coming in.

00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:16.705
So I'm gonna drive my circuit

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:19.385
with some sort of sinusoid.

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:22.606
I'll call that sinusoid,
I'll give it an amplitude

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:25.523
and I'll call it cosine of omega T.

00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:30.670
Omega is the frequency, T
is time, A is the amplitude

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.735
of the signal coming in here.

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:36.765
Now, that signal's gonna
go into this circuit here.

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:38.880
Something's gonna happen
and there's gonna be

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.297
a voltage coming out of here.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:45.180
So we'll get V out over here of some sort

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.347
and it's gonna be some
amplitude and it's gonna be

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:54.210
some sort of a cosine wave of omega T

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:58.045
plus some phase angle, some angle.

00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:02.236
That's our job to discover this.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:05.879
That's the circuit analyzes
problem for AC analyzes.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.331
We put in the AC signal,
we're gonna get out

00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:12.438
another AC signal, this is
a forced response, remember?

00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:14.131
It's gonna look like the input,

00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:16.285
it's gonna be at the same
frequency but its gonna be

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:18.785
at some different phase angle.

00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:21.877
So in order to do this,
there's a fair amount

00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:23.700
of hard trigonometry we have to do.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.647
There's gonna be a lot of
cosines and sines and angles

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.283
and things inside this.

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:30.510
So that's pretty challenging analyses.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.624
Now what we do with Euler's
formula is we turn it

00:02:32.624 --> 00:02:34.630
into exponentials and we already know

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.381
how to solve exponentials.

00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:40.888
So we take the same circuit,
it has the same stuff inside,

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:44.969
as resistors and capacitors,
the same exact circuit.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.055
Let's draw the same exact circuit.

00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:49.055
There, that's identical.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.324
It has the same outputs.

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:54.637
Output port right here.

00:02:54.637 --> 00:02:56.367
And this time what we're
gonna do is we're gonna

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:59.473
basically take this
cosine and we're gonna,

00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:01.128
make up in our head, we're gonna cast this

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:03.298
into an exponential and the way we do that

00:03:03.298 --> 00:03:06.882
is we use that formula,
we use Euler's formula,

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:11.049
and we basically create two
sources, two separate sources

00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:14.903
and their exponential sources.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.986
This gonna be A over two,

00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:18.736
E to the J

00:03:20.804 --> 00:03:21.637
omega T,

00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:26.330
that's this source here
and this source here

00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:28.564
is A over two,

00:03:30.424 --> 00:03:32.507
E to the minus J omega T.

00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:39.361
That's this wave form and
if I add those together

00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:40.194
like that.

00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.722
Now remember, the equation
we just looked at,

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:50.472
Euler's formula says
that Cosine equals that.

00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:55.017
The voltage here is exactly the same

00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:56.273
and all we've done is described

00:03:56.273 --> 00:03:58.322
the same exact cosine wave form

00:03:58.322 --> 00:04:01.322
as these two imaginary exponentials.

00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:05.033
Now I can't actually on my work bench

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:06.235
build one of these things.

00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:08.538
These don't exists in real life

00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:10.188
but they can exists mathematically.

00:04:10.188 --> 00:04:12.940
They can exists in my head
and I know that if I add

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.732
these two voltages together
that I do get a cosine.

00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:18.823
So, in our heads and on paper,

00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:21.315
we can actually draw
circuits with these things.

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:24.758
We can't actually build it
but on paper, we can do it.

00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:26.446
Now that I have two sources,

00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:29.023
I can use the principal of superposition.

00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:30.013
This is another use

00:04:30.013 --> 00:04:34.291
of the very powerful
idea of superposition.

00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:36.862
So using the idea of
superposition, I'm gonna apply

00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:40.592
each of these two inputs one at a time

00:04:40.592 --> 00:04:43.163
and then add the results together.

00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:45.297
Over here, I'm gonna get two outputs.

00:04:45.297 --> 00:04:47.590
I'm gonna get a V out one.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.459
Let's call it a V out
plus, which is what happens

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.122
when I put in this plus
source and I suppress this one

00:04:54.122 --> 00:04:55.922
which means I short it out.

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:59.041
I'm gonna get a V out
plus and how do you solve

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.479
a differential equation when you have

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.388
a exponential going in?

00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:04.531
Well we know this.

00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:06.406
It's gonna be an exponential answer.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.816
It's gonna be some constant

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:10.816
times E to the J omega T

00:05:13.227 --> 00:05:14.560
plus some angle.

00:05:17.022 --> 00:05:20.393
Then I'm gonna solve it
again, I'm gonna add to that.

00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:21.226
V out

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:23.973
minus

00:05:23.973 --> 00:05:26.522
and I do that by suppressing this input

00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.602
and turning this one back
on using superposition

00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.635
and V out for the plus,

00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:34.468
sorry, V out for this source here.

00:05:36.592 --> 00:05:38.741
It's gonna equal some other K.

00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:41.999
Let's call that K plus and K minus.

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.999
E to the minus J omega T

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:46.452
plus V.

00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:51.335
So I'm gonna put in two exponentials.

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.622
I'm sure I'm gonna get
out two exponentials

00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:57.872
and now using Euler's formula
we know how to combine these.

00:05:57.872 --> 00:05:59.595
We can use that same expression

00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:02.534
and we can recover our cosine.

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:05.034
We can recover the real signal

00:06:08.337 --> 00:06:11.600
and this will have some magnitude B.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.566
We don't know the magnitudes yet

00:06:13.566 --> 00:06:16.083
but we know what the
shape of the wave form is

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:20.250
and if we look at this, this
is the same thing as this here

00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:25.131
and we did it by decomposing
our cosine into exponentials,

00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:28.307
putting each exponential through
this and then recombining

00:06:28.307 --> 00:06:31.172
to get cosine and we do all those steps

00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:34.437
because solving differential
equations with exponentials

00:06:34.437 --> 00:06:36.770
is the easiest way to do it.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.251
So just that you know, it's
not twice as much work,

00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.646
what's gonna happen it's gonna turn out

00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:46.904
that this all solution down
here using the negative,

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:49.792
using the negative exponential,
the answer is going to be

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:52.299
exactly the same as the
positive exponentials

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:54.419
except for there's just this conjugate,

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.619
this complex conjugate in here.

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:00.542
So for real signals going
in, the answer goes through

00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:03.385
and its always, these answers are always

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:05.318
complex conjugates of each other

00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:09.221
as long as we start with a real input.

00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:11.526
So that was a review of Euler's equation

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.592
and a little preview,
a little sneak preview

00:07:13.592 --> 00:07:15.557
of how we're gonna do AC Analyzes

00:07:15.557 --> 00:07:18.224
using this really powerful tool.
