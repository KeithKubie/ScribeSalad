00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.280
Hi, it's Halloween. We're the Ri.
So we're exploding pumpkins.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.240
This year for our explosions we are going
to be using this compound - calcium carbide.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.750
It reacts with water, fizzing away producing
lots of gas

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.520
and that gas is acetylene, which you may know
is very flammable.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.200
We send the gas along the tube, filling our
pumpkin with acetylene.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.660
When it's ready, we can light the fuse, ignite
the acetylene,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.480
blowing the face out of our pumpkin.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.059
Calcium carbide is made of calcium ions and
carbide ions.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.040
Carbide ions are two carbons bonded together.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.570
And it's these carbon atoms that are joining
with our hydrogen atoms from the water

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.950
to give us a hydrocarbon, in this case acetylene.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.030
Like other hydrocarbons, like petrol,
it's a really great fuel, burns really well

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.060
and will give us an awesome explosion to power
our pumpkins.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.540
We've been blowing pumpkins up all day, but
not all of them have blown up.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.200
In fact some of our pumpkins only showed a
small amount of combustion.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.750
And our theory is that these particular pumpkins
had so much acetylene inside of them

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.200
that there really wasn't much oxygen for them
to burn with.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.840
Of course we need oxygen to get a good explosion
and without it we're going to get incomplete

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840
combustion.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.170
Another sign of this is the black soot and
smoke

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.220
we can see coming out of this particular pumpkin.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.099
We've been collecting and burning loads of
acetylene at once to get an explosion,

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.049
but in the early 1900s, miners used a more
controlled version of this reaction

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.930
to power their headlamps - carbide lamps.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.180
They would have a rock of calcium carbide
in them

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.500
and a small valve to drip water onto it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.540
slowly and steadily, producing a constant
stream of acetylene

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.020
that they could light to see their way around
the mine.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.579
Thanks for watching. If you've got any ideas
how we

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.909
should explode pumpkins next year, let us
know in the comments.
