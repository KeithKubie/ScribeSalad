1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
It's now people are going be ready and
quick to just second guess anything that

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:06,630
you say. Yeah, that's, that's a fact.

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,590
Until we can read each other's minds
till we could find out for sure that's

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,350
going to change the whole game.
The reason why his mind. Yeah,

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,790
that's definitely gonna eliminate a
lot of street fights. Most of them.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,023
You talk about your,

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,070
your imminent dangerous sensors are
going to be one up 100% if you read

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:27,570
somebody's mind. Yeah. Yeah. I don't
know if I want to do that. I do.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,540
I like him. His secrets, no mall
in. I like having secrets too,

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,470
but I like going all in. I think all in,
I think, I think it's just inevitable.

11
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,960
We were talking about it in the last
podcast about there's something they're

12
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,540
going to be able to shoot into
your neck and what did he say?

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,710
The way you described it sounds like an
injection that will take over sort of,

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,850
well,

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,040
the way it interacts with your brain cells
thread thread itself and your brain's

16
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,790
house.
So literally like having,

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,870
I think we're going to have built in Wifi
Internet systems where we're connected

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,220
to each other's heads. So this what
people request was like a study.

19
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:02,040
They're going to try out on paper or
you can just go to your doctor and say,

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,660
shoot me with the brain shit.

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,540
I think eventually it's going to be
shooting me with the brain shit first.

22
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,040
You got to get it out on a clinical trial,

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,140
going to be able to be heroin addicts
and crack heads. Who Do you get for that?

24
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:17,100
Like who is close to no brain cells
and shit and that's when we try it on.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,240
What was that movie?

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,270
There was a movie where a dude got
shot and they put some chip in his back

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,850
upgrade. Oh Great. Yeah,
and it did that to him.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,720
It turned to be like an access to all
the information. He knew martial arts,

29
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,150
he knew how to move and
everything was happening.

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,470
He was a basically like a super
computer inside of a person that can do

31
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,260
everything. Artificial intelligence
is right down the line.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,140
If they're talking about this shit,
shooting it in your brain,

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,070
we're going to share a network.
We're all going to be on a network.

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,750
It's going to be a lot of white people
joining that effort because black people

35
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,040
don't fuck with needles,
Bro.

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,700
We don't do lessons in our way.
We don't take out bro.

37
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,870
I'm telling you to say that, but how many,
how many athletes are on steroids? Yeah,

38
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,730
but that's a different,
that's a different animal.

39
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,450
I'm talking about the average black dude.
That's what Flynn, Brownsville or, okay.

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,090
Okay. Watch the stuff like that.
Yo, I got this new brain. Shit.

41
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:12,510
We injected through a needle. They go fuck
you up. They don't want hear that shit.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,060
That's hilarious.
And that's probably true.

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,830
I mean how many people
are going to try that?

44
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,760
Like who's going to be the earliest
adopter getting a shot in your neck that

45
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:24,310
lets you read everybody's mind.
Then what are you going to do with it?

46
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,900
It's interesting.
It's going to fuck our job up man,

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,710
because like half of what we do is say
shocking shit that people know is kind of

48
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:34,440
true. But you can't believe you're
saying that people are always like, oh,

49
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,010
not feel winters. Subway Joe
coming up, you've got done.

50
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,970
If you could do that, that'd be the
ultimate fucking joke hater right there.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,870
Oh yeah. Two guys walk in a bar. You
don't got anything other than that?

52
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,580
Nothing. I think I'll have to pass on it.
Keep it bro. Yeah, it's going to be weird.

53
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,050
When would you get it?
Like you wouldn't,

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,570
would you want to be the
first comedian to have it? Oh,

55
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,270
you almost want to be a
fool who doesn't have it.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,780
If you want to be a comedian I to watch
other motherfuckers do it first. Yeah. Oh,

57
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,531
I'll sit in the back.

58
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,320
But the problem is they're going
to fucking take over like finances,

59
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,330
like instantly they're gonna.

60
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,290
As soon as they upload their
brand and they're like,

61
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,460
I'm just gonna get all this money,

62
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,990
I'm going to figure out a way
to get all this fucking money.

63
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,000
And then by the time you
shoot it into your head,

64
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,130
they've already got the system
locked down. We'll see. That's,

65
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,640
you have different level of people that
you hang out with because your level be

66
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,130
like, well how do we get the
money? But my level be like, Yo,

67
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,890
who got this brace yet? How are we
going to get some ass off at his dog?

68
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,460
You can get it. You'll be
more clever. Read abroad, man.

69
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,660
You get all the you all of
it. Yeah. You would know,

70
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,330
but then it wouldn't be fun
like half the fun is not known.

71
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,000
If somebody likes you, right? You
don't know what's going to happen here.

72
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,840
Is this going to work out.
