00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.744
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:07.790
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.734
How are you feeling?

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:10.234
Woo!

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.960
This sweatshirt is made
out of 20 Daydream Views.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.930
No, I'm kidding,
I just bought it.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.737
Let's get started.

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:23.320
My name is Brahim
Elbouchikhi, and I'm

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.570
a product manager on
the platform team,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.910
on the Daydream platform team.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.710
We have two goals for this talk.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.430
The first is to share a
bunch of data and insights

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.640
we have learned from being in
market for the last six months

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.190
we think it's important
that as the VR industry gets

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.250
started, that we share as much
as we can with the broader

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.030
community.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.660
The second goal is to
walk you through how

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.984
we're taking those
insights and that data

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:50.650
and applying it to
the Daydream platform

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.890
itself to make it work better
for developers and for users.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.570
So let's get started.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.130
First is a bunch of updates.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.750
These are recaps you've
heard probably already.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.550
First, we now have eight
Daydream-ready phones.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.400
If you recall, last
year in November

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.270
we launched with support
for the Pixel the Pixel XL.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.340
But our mission has
always been about bringing

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.030
high-quality mobile
VR to everyone.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.050
So we've been hard
at work to bring

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.500
in more devices that
support Daydream.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.660
We're also particularly
excited about the fact

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.470
that the Samsung S8 will also
be Daydream ready in the coming

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.390
weeks.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.980
Also LG's flagship device that
is available later this summer

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.440
will also be Daydream ready.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.300
And finally, our
existing partners Asus

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.760
and Motorola will also be
bringing in more Daydream-ready

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.940
devices to market.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.090
So putting all that together, as
Mike summarized in the morning,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.140
we'll have tens of millions
of Daydream-ready devices

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.650
in market.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.370
Those devices, when paired
with one of the headsets,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.160
allow you to
experience Daydream.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.180
So that's a great
user base for you

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.950
all to target with your content.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.800
The other big news,
obviously, of I/O

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.940
is the introduction of
the standalone VR headset.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.870
Darren is going to
get onstage in a bit

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.600
and tell you a lot more about
the headsets and how they work

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.699
and other things.

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.240
But the one thing
I want to highlight

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.910
is that the standalone
headsets get

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.180
at the same mission of
the smartphones, which

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.740
is bringing high-quality
mobile VR to everyone.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.320
In this case, if you don't
own an Android device,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.040
this may be an option.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.040
Another option is maybe
a different user journey

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.581
where you have a
shared device that's

00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:37.660
available at home that's always
connected to power, and also

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.880
to Wi-Fi.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.669
That way you can
jump into VR anytime.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.210
So Darren will get
into more details,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.170
but we're super excited about
this development, obviously.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.050
Finally, at the end
of the day, users

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.360
purchase these headsets
to experience the content

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.469
that developers create.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.260
And we're excited that
since January, we're

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.500
more than tripled the number
of apps available on Daydream

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.390
to 150.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.390
It's exciting, and we expect
to see an increase in momentum

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.550
over the coming
months as we roll out

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.340
more of the experiences that are
being developed at the moment.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.540
So that's great news.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.790
So we'll share five
insights with you.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.650
These are data-driven
insights that we

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.800
hope you will find useful as
you create your VR content.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.169
First, this is Daydream
Home in its current form.

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.960
Again, Darren will get
onstage and tell you

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.090
about how it will be
changed in the future.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.260
But in the current form, we have
those three panels at the top.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.630
We call them Discovery Windows.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.750
These panels are used to
feature specific content.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.540
These are deep links
to videos, to apps,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.730
and specific
experiences in an app.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.910
We use them to feature
content for users.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.340
So keep that in mind as
I share the data next.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.880
First, 25% of
sessions on Daydream

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.742
begin with no specific intent.

00:03:59.742 --> 00:04:01.200
And if you think
about that, if you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.690
think about your
smartphone, how often do

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.140
you turn on your smartphone
with absolutely no intent?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.200
Not to check time,
not to check email,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.650
not to check
Twitter, not to play

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.180
a game, not to do other things.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.501
And so in smartphones, we've
become very task centric.

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:18.000
There's a specific thing you're
trying to do with the phone,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.740
and you're going to
go there to do that.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.360
This is quite different.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.810
Lots of users coming
with no intent.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.480
The next data point is
that 40% of all sessions

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.170
include at least one click
on a Discovery Window.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.750
Which, benchmarking against
traditional merchandising-type

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.720
experiences, is
actually quite good.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.400
Finally, 35% of all
sessions include

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.070
a visit to Play Store VR.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.680
If you put these three
data points together,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.670
our takeaway is that
on VR, in VR, users

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.510
are in discovery mode.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.220
They're open minded.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.240
They're coming in and
saying, what's awesome in VR?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.470
What can I do today?

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.610
What can I experience
today in Daydream?

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.430
And that's great news because
it creates an opportunity

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.540
for developers to
fill that need,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.790
to create great content
that people love

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.800
and use and purchase.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.710
Which is obviously essential.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.860
I was on Android market in 2011.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.440
And at that time, high-quality
apps got a lot of traffic,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.660
a lot of users, a
lot of attention.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.650
And we see it in a similar
state at this point in VR.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.160
And so the insight we're
trying to share with you today,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.700
as a developer,
this may be the time

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.860
to get involved, start
experimenting, start

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.970
iterating so they can build
the Angry Birds for VR.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.560
Angry Birds standing in
for the breakout hit.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.080
So if you remember in 2009
when Angry Birds came out,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.240
it was one of the first titles
where everything came together

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.190
just perfectly.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.610
The game mechanic used
a screen a unique way.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.350
The characters
were really great,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.766
the branding, the
monetization model worked.

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:08.390
Everything worked
really well, but that

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.970
wasn't an overnight success.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.800
It took a lot of iteration.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.080
It took a lot of work
to actually get there.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.190
And so we firmly believe
that developers on Daydream

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.620
today are converging
on that breakout hit.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.850
Learning, iterating,
and getting closer

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.520
to creating this breakout hit.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.360
So if you've been as a
developer thinking about VR,

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.700
considering whether to
get involved or not,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.680
I would urge you to look
closer and consider actually

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.420
doing that.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.420
So next, I'm going to show
you a video from a title that

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.980
just became
available on Daydream

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.820
called Lola and the Giant.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.450
It's built by Climax Studios.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.340
And what's awesome with
this title is, one,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.160
the environment
is super awesome.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.082
It's really
immersive, it's great.

00:06:54.082 --> 00:06:55.290
And there are two characters.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.240
There's a giant who
you actually can

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.220
take the perspective of
the giant in the game,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.430
and you can have
different skill sets,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.600
and it's literally like a giant.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.640
And then you can also be
a third-person follower

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.600
along with Lola as she conquers
all sorts of challenges

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.550
and does all sorts of fun stuff.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.210
Interestingly also, there is
a companion experience where

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.220
outside of VR--

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.720
there you go, the
video is playing--

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.980
where outside of VR, a user
can also interact in the game.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.890
It means you can have this
asymmetric game experience

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.650
where one person is in
2D, the other is in VR,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.680
and they're able to
collaborate together.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.050
We think that's
really fun, and we

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.130
think this is a title that's
getting at that breakout hit.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.280
We feel it's a title that's
trying different things,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.625
innovating in the space,
and really getting

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:46.420
at something awesome.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.690
So if you haven't tried
it, it just came out.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.540
It's super awesome.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.880
Please do.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.820
Now, let's talk
about monetization.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.620
That's obviously a big part
of this, a big part of helping

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.499
you earn a living on Daydream.

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.040
And so a couple of
data points I want

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.430
to share with you is
that on Daydream, we've

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.460
seen three times as
many buyers as you

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.500
would on traditional
mobile, on Google Play.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.530
And those buyers are
spending 32% more

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.090
than they would on
traditional mobile.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.710
This is good news, right?

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.650
Because creating VR
content is expensive.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.730
It's hard.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.550
It takes a lot of time.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.630
And the fact that users
are responding well,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.364
they're willing to
purchase the content,

00:08:33.364 --> 00:08:34.780
and also they're
actually spending

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.110
more on it, that's really
good news for our developer

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.100
community and for our platform.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.800
However, we talk
to our users a lot.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.570
We do a lot of user studies.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.130
We talk with them a lot.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.650
And in almost every
single one, we've

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.770
heard feedback that if we had
a way, if users had a way,

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.632
to try and experience
before buying it,

00:08:56.632 --> 00:08:58.840
that would help them make
that purchase decision more

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.150
frequently.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.040
And so the insight here is
actually more often ask, most

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.540
for request, if you have an
experience on Daydream today,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.940
if it is premium, i.e., like
you've got to pay upfront,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.010
consider ways to actually
introduce a trial to it.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.840
It is not easy.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.870
There is no single
way to do this, right?

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.075
It depends by title,
it depends by user,

00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:28.480
it depends by developing
your goals for your title,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.540
so it's not easy.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.660
But we believe that
this isn't something

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.350
that's going to go away.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.180
The need for trying an
experience is fundamental to VR

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.670
because it's an
immersive technology.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.790
I've got to be in it to
actually know what it's about.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.740
There are also
physiological differences

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.080
that make it so one title
that's comfortable for one user

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.570
may not be as comfortable
for someone else.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.650
So they need just makes sense.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.540
We're doing our best
to figure this out.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.400
And as soon as we
do, we'll, as usual,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.170
communicate our findings.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.980
But as developers,
iterating and experimenting

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.280
in this direction.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.960
How do you get your
users to experiment

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.090
and try your content
first is actually

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.520
going to be key
to, again, get into

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.580
that successful monetization,
successful breakout hit.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.460
Now let's talk about
usage patterns.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.690
What we've seen on
Daydream is that users

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.250
are spending on average about
40 minutes a week in VR.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.510
What's unique is that this is
spent in a couple of sessions

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.190
only, in the evenings at
home, or on the weekends.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.530
And if today you are a
developer of a 2D game or app,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.890
it's quite different from
what you're seeing, right?

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.480
What you're seeing
today is a lot

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.170
of interactions, a lot
of micro sessions of 30

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.920
seconds to a minute
to a couple of minutes

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.750
maybe where you are
getting users coming back.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.480
They are either collecting
energy or points or something,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.570
and then going back out again.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.280
That's different in VR.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.340
And so the way we've been
kind of summarizing this now

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.770
for a while is that as
you build content for VR,

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.470
think of a sit-down meal
experience, not a snack.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.050
It's not something that people
are doing throughout the day.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.180
Its fewer, longer sessions.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.720
Next, I want to show you a video
from the Gorillaz latest album.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.350
This was created
in collaboration

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.017
with Google Spotlight Stories.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.850
And was awesome about
this-- you're actually

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.770
in a train track.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.541
It's moving super fast, you feel
literally like you're there,

00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:31.540
and you can look around.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.750
There are different characters,
the Gorillaz behind you,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.670
and you're actually
listening to the music.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.230
And there's also a
tablet showing you

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.860
what would probably look like
a traditional music video.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.040
And what's awesome about
this medium of VR video

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.400
is that not only are you
listening to the artist's

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.380
creation as a song.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.540
You're also experiencing
the environment

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.840
they wanted you to be in
when you listen to it.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.114
It just works really well.

00:11:57.114 --> 00:11:58.780
If you haven't tried
this, it's actually

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.540
got 3 million views in 48 hours,
making it the biggest debut

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.570
of a VR video on YouTube ever.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.460
It was super awesome, give
it a try if you haven't yet.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.260
And so the takeaway here,
and the fact, actually,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.130
is that nearly 50% of
all time in Daydream

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.350
is spent in video experiences.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.280
This is split
across flat content.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.200
This is traditional
2D content that's

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.040
projected in a personal
cinema, as we like to call it,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.560
from Netflix, Hulu, Play Movies,
HBO, and also immersive 360 VR

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.060
video that's created by our
partners, our Baobab, and WeVR,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.670
and NextVR, and
Within, and many others

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.760
who have created
truly awesome videos.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.680
A lot of them are
documentaries that

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.710
allows you to really be
immersed in the story

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.090
and feel probably, to be
honest, as much about how

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.650
that person, that documentary,
feel as ever before in media.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.320
So the insight here is
that video is really

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.190
a core use case of mobile VR.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.370
It is a core use case.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.370
And so as a developer,
as a creator,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.819
think about ways to use it
to augment your experience,

00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:16.360
to create an experience
that's great.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.390
So for example, as we
talked about trials, maybe

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.670
VR video is a way
to offer that trial.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.110
And finally, I want to share
another data point with you

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.000
about quality.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.370
This chart shows a
correlation between time

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.070
in an app and the app's rating.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.590
Of course, it's a
positive correlation.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.770
The significance is
actually quite high.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.730
But what's important here is
we purposely chose time in app,

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.100
not installs, which is
how you traditionally

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.182
look at operations.

00:13:49.182 --> 00:13:51.640
And you say if I have a higher
rating, I get more installs,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.140
and that's great.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.170
But here, we wanted to
show engagement in use,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.040
and the impact of having
a great quality app.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.760
Now, keep in mind that Daydream
has a fairly stringent quality

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.200
review process.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.180
So these apps aren't
like, crashing,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.487
or have low frames per
second, or other things.

00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:12.070
The difference here
is actually almost

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.660
thinking from good to great,
not so much kind of very poor.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.480
And the differences being the
immersiveness of the content,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.460
the depth of the
content, the environment

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.870
and the beauty of it.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.320
And so as you build
content for VR,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.390
think about quality,
but not only

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.490
in terms of technical quality.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.250
Also in the depth
of the experience,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.280
and just how awesome it is.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.500
So to summarize, now
is the time for you

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.550
as a developer to jump in and
potentially create VR's Angry

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.890
Birds.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.800
It will take time, and those
developers creating today

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.910
are iterating and
approaching that milestone.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:59.010
Trials are fundamental parts
of VR content creation,

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.080
and they will help unlock the
full potential of monetization.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.130
So you need to think
about those from day one.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.050
In terms of content
duration and length,

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.960
think about a sit-down
meal experience.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.240
Think about how
you could use video

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.350
to augment your experience.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.740
And finally, quality in VR goes
beyond the technical aspects

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.870
and into depth of
the content, and just

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.477
how immersive the experience is.

00:15:24.477 --> 00:15:25.060
So that's all.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.020
I'm going to turn
over to Darren now,

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.660
who will show you how we're
taking these insights and more

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.700
and improving the
Daydream experience

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.590
for you and for our users.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.640
Thank you.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.348
DARREN DELAYE: All
right, thanks, Brahim.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.660
Hi, everyone.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.700
I'm Darren Delaye, and I lead
the user experience design

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.580
team for the Daydream platform.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.190
And today, I get to tell you
more about some of the design

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.640
work my team has been doing,
how we think about designing

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.275
the experience for our
standalone VR headsets,

00:15:56.275 --> 00:15:57.900
and some of the
improvements that we're

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.784
making for Daydream platform 2.0
Euphrates, which is the release

00:16:02.784 --> 00:16:03.450
later this year.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.550
This week, we've announced
Daydream standalone headsets

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.670
with WorldSense positional
tracking, an all-new form

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.580
factor for VR.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.470
And I'm going to break
this down into some pieces.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.150
First, let's talk
about what it means

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.740
to have a standalone headset.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.310
A standalone headset
purpose built for VR

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.440
brings a new level
of convenience

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.630
to how you access VR.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.450
When it's on your counter
or your coffee table

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.290
and you can pick it up and in
just a few seconds be in VR,

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.050
I think you'll find that
you and the other members

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.880
of your household will end up
going into VR a lot more often.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.510
Lowering the friction to go
into VR makes a big difference.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.840
From a developer
perspective, you

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.260
use the same exact
developer tools and SDKs

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.259
as you do for smartphone VR.

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:02.800
And in most cases,
you'll create apps

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.210
that run on both smartphone
VR and standalone VR headsets.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.099
Existing Daydream apps
like these are all

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.710
compatible with the
standalone headsets.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.569
And for interacting
with VR apps,

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.089
you'll still be using the
Daydream motion controller

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:17.619
to point and swing and play.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:24.460
Now, since there
isn't a phone mode,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.140
setup and settings are all
done from inside the headset.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.320
These will be some of
the very first VR systems

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.200
where there isn't a phone or a
PC as the primary setup device.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.200
And what I want to mention
here is that the same

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.450
goes for app developers.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.050
There are some great examples
of what we call hybrid 2D and 3D

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.910
apps for Daydream.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.021
For example, the app named
Within has a great phone

00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:55.270
mode where you can look at
a preview of all the videos

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.350
they've released.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.420
And if you want to check
one out, click on it

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.580
and hop into VR.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.420
So just keep in mind that
since your standalone headset

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.880
users will only
have VR, you need

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.790
to make sure that important
required features like account

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.880
sign in or settings are
accessible from your game

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.840
engine VR mode.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.730
All right, now let's talk about
WorldSense positional tracking.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.370
We get full six degrees
of freedom tracking,

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.810
or 6DoF tracking, that works
with no external wires,

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.550
sensors, or setup.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.080
It just works.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.440
It's based on technology
from the Tango team

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.199
that tracks objects in real time
as they move about in 3D space.

00:18:40.199 --> 00:18:41.740
So instead of just
being able to know

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.779
the orientation of the
headset, where you're looking,

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:47.320
now we're going to be able to
track the movement of your head

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.428
as well in any direction.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.640
Now, these WorldSense
headsets are

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.430
optimized for seated and
standing virtual reality.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.510
It allows you to naturally
move, lean, shift

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.800
your weight and body
position however you want.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.370
Positional tracking creates
a much more immersive VR

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.690
experience.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.210
Everything feels more real.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.170
And in turn, that makes the
experience more comfortable.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.830
The realism comes in large part
from your natural perception

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.660
of all the tiny
movements that your head

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.060
is making all the
time that create

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.900
parallax between foreground
and background elements.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.000
The same thing happens
in the real world

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.749
when you perceive the
world all day, every day.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.450
Here's a quick example of
a dodge ball game demo.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.784
You can duck and
dodge out of the way.

00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:46.950
I lean out of the way every
time I watch this video.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.061
[LAUGHING]

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:48.960
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: Sorry.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.800
DARREN DELAYE: If
you want to create

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.121
an experience that requires
ducking and dodging

00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:52.995
and leaning, you can.

00:19:52.995 --> 00:19:54.940
You can target our
WorldSense headsets.

00:20:00.227 --> 00:20:02.310
Now, we do want to make
sure that people stay safe

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.620
in their physical space.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.020
Most people don't
have a lot of space.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.536
And even if you clear
an area in your room,

00:20:09.536 --> 00:20:11.910
we want to help people avoid
bumping into their furniture

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.340
and their walls.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.410
We have a basic
safety system in place

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.860
that encourages people to
stay roughly in one spot

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.680
and not walk around,
not wander too far

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.470
from where they set as the
center of their experience.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.050
Remember, this is
mobile VR, so you

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.810
can start your experience
anywhere in the room,

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.251
or really anywhere.

00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:36.000
And we have a sensor
that actually detects

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.810
when you put the headset
on and where you are,

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.610
which lets us set that is
the default starting position

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.470
with the VR world
centered around you.

00:20:50.487 --> 00:20:52.570
Now I'm going to give you
a couple of quick things

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.944
to think about if
you're creating

00:20:53.944 --> 00:20:56.480
apps and games for our
Daydream WorldSense headsets.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.440
Here's one thing that
works really well.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.990
The scenes with
relatively small items

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.230
that are pretty close up
when you move back and forth

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.840
from side to side, although
you don't want anything

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.760
closer than about half a meter
from your face for too long.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.457
If you think about something
like a board game on a table,

00:21:18.457 --> 00:21:21.040
or a game where you feel really
big because all the characters

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.694
are really small,
those are going

00:21:22.694 --> 00:21:24.610
to feel really good when
you shift your weight

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.910
and get a large amount of
parallax from small movements.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.240
For example, you'll be able
to see around one character

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.700
to see the character behind.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.340
In this example from
the game Mekorama,

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.220
there's the user
peeking from side

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.720
to side to plan out how they're
going to solve the puzzle.

00:21:46.024 --> 00:21:47.690
But here's an example
where you may have

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.321
to design around the parallax.

00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:52.070
In this pointer-based
interface, something

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.650
that we use frequently
in Daydream,

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.900
when the user hovers
their cursor over an item,

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.879
we usually bring it towards them
a bit, and it looks like this.

00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:01.670
You're highlighting
the item in upper left.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.990
So here's what it might look
like if this UI is pretty

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.120
close up to the user, and
they've moved or leaned

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.224
over to the right.

00:22:11.224 --> 00:22:12.640
It's not pointing
at them anymore.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.880
They're kind of looking
at it from a side angle.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.476
And you might decide that
this isn't what you want.

00:22:17.476 --> 00:22:19.350
There are lots of ways
to design around this.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.110
You might decide that
you want to turn the UI.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.150
But one that I want
to mention quickly

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.830
is you can make everything
look roughly the same

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.560
and move the UI farther
back from the user.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.380
And you'll have to scale
up the cards and the text

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.650
to compensate to make
it still legible.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.150
And if you move the
UI farther away,

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.358
then when the user makes
that same amount of movement

00:22:41.358 --> 00:22:43.410
over to the right, they're
going to see a smaller

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.902
amount of parallax,
and it's going

00:22:44.902 --> 00:22:47.110
to look more similar to how
it does from straight on.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.430
So if you want to learn more
about how my team specifies

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.240
designs like this, how we
create legible and usable UIs,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.430
we have a great talk
tomorrow about designing

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.070
screen interfaces for VR that
I think you should check out.

00:23:08.175 --> 00:23:09.550
Now, if you want
your users to be

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.700
able to move over
greater distances in VR,

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.160
our favorite method is to
have people teleport from spot

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160
to spot.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.690
And this is a pattern that a lot
of apps have adopted already.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.740
This is what we've found most
effective in all types of VR,

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.550
from smartphone VR to
positionally tracked systems.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.520
In fact, we've noticed that
once you give people the ability

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.310
to teleport, they
actually stop their urge

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.000
to walk around, and just
teleport all around.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.860
And they start
intuitively using it,

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.320
and they end up staying
safer and not needing

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.300
as big of a physical space.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.015
So we're big fans of
teleporting around in VR.

00:23:47.015 --> 00:23:49.390
And we're releasing a new set
of sample code as something

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.170
that we call Daydream
Elements, which

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.330
has an implementation
of teleporting that you

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.680
can use to get you started.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.560
This recording is from the
Daydream Elements sample app.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.220
Now we're going to switch
over and talk about features

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.280
in the Daydream 2.0
Euphrates release that's

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.140
coming out later this year.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.140
These are features coming to
all headsets, both smartphone VR

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.190
and standalone VR.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.710
Here's a preview of our
updated Daydream Home.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.210
We've had users
tell us the Daydream

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.370
Home is simple and
approachable, and we

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.507
plan to keep it that way.

00:24:30.507 --> 00:24:31.590
We'll swipe through these.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.940
So the changes we've
made are mostly related

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.816
to the Discovery Windows
that you see in the middle.

00:24:40.816 --> 00:24:42.440
Now there are more
of them, and they're

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.810
organized into collections.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.970
Some collections
are for new users

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.910
with the all-time best content
that nobody should miss.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.490
Other collections
are for people who

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.350
are watching this
space frequently

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.510
for newly released
content and new releases.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.790
And other collections
are on a trend or a theme

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.672
that people are gravitating
to when they come to Daydream.

00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:07.130
All these Discovery
Windows feature

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.230
all kinds of content,
apps and games,

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.650
as well as individual
experiences in videos.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.840
They're actually under
the hood Android Intents

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.650
that we deep link to.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.170
So if you're
creating an app that

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.240
has individual experiences,
make sure to plan

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.120
for those incoming links.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.400
Our goal was Daydream
Home is that people

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.220
will come to VR frequently,
and they'll never run out

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.690
of new things to experience.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.820
The next feature is what we
call the system dashboard.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.820
The motivation for this
is that sometimes you're

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.800
in the middle of
a VR experience,

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.450
and you wonder if
there's something

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:44.890
that needs your attention.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.260
Or you just need
to check the time.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.440
We want to enable these things
without a jarring interruption

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.840
to your experience.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.900
So when the user presses
the System button,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.490
the system dashboard
will pop up.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.900
And when they press the
System button again,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.733
it will disappear and
return them right back

00:26:02.733 --> 00:26:05.190
into what they were doing.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.252
Users can check on status
like time and battery life,

00:26:08.252 --> 00:26:09.960
they can activate
system features like Do

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.240
Not Disturb Mode
or Casting, which

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.330
I'll talk more
about in a moment,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.090
or they can quickly launch the
next step they want to open.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.110
They also check
their notifications,

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:23.070
which can give them peace
of mind about whether they

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.300
have more time to stay in VR.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.170
In Daydream 1.0,
there were a couple

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.410
of scenarios when you may have
had to take your phone out

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:39.490
of the headset and complete
a task in phone mode

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.690
before you could continue.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:45.080
That would be like if
YouTube, in this example,

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.370
needed to have access
to the microphone,

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.140
and needed to ask for
permission so that you

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.520
could do a voice search.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.790
Or if you needed to update your
credit card expiration date

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.250
to make a purchase of a game.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.389
Well, we're bringing
those experiences into VR

00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:01.930
so that you can complete these
required tasks quickly and get

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.822
back to what you want to do.

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:05.530
If you think about
it, this was something

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.930
that we had to do for
our standalone headsets.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.370
And it's a nice improvement
for smartphone VR as well.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.460
Stepping back, I think that
one of our most important roles

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.620
here at Daydream is
to try to make sure

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.530
that VR fits into your
life, not just something

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.080
that you do by yourself.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.510
And so my favorite feature
that we're announcing today

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.310
is Casting.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.250
I bet many of you here have
given VR demos to your friends,

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.740
and it's great to see
their reactions to new VR

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.630
experiences.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:39.990
But it's not so great if
they get a little bit stuck,

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.470
or they ask you
what to click on,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.870
but you can't see
what's happening.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.330
Or sometimes there will
be one person in VR

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.180
and other people just
waiting their turn.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.670
So with Casting, we
can bridge the gap.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:55.060
You can share the experience
with a whole group.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.700
And here's our animation
of how it works.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.250
In the system dashboard, you
choose the cast receiver,

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:04.750
and it starts playing
on your TV right away.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.420
And casts work across apps.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.650
So you can start a session
and pass the headset

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.670
to multiple people,
check out multiple apps,

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.960
with the cast running
the whole time.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.420
We think this is going to make
mobile VR that much more fun

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.253
in your living room.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.730
For developers, if you
want to get a little fancy,

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.770
there are some interesting
gameplay mechanics

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.400
that you could consider
implementing using Casting.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.710
In this example, prototypers
from our Daydream Labs team

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.454
have created essentially
acting out a puppet show

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.870
where the person
in the headset is

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.240
giving a tour of the spaceship.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.062
And the people
watching on the TV

00:28:48.062 --> 00:28:49.270
have a fixed camera position.

00:28:52.477 --> 00:28:54.310
You have to have enough
performance overhead

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.101
available for your app
to be able to render

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.130
this extra camera.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:58.554
So it's a little
bit challenging.

00:28:58.554 --> 00:29:00.220
But there are really
interesting things.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.720
Like, for example,
you could be playing

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.910
a guessing game, a party
game, where there's something

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.993
that the person in the
headset is supposed to know

00:29:05.993 --> 00:29:07.630
but not the people in the room.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.963
Or the opposite, that there
is something that the people

00:29:09.963 --> 00:29:12.600
in the room should see that
the person in the headset

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.371
shouldn't.

00:29:16.202 --> 00:29:18.160
And for times where you're
not in the same room

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.170
as your friends,
we're also announcing

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.110
support for VR Captures,
both screenshots

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.050
and video recordings, which
will save your device.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.940
And you can sync
with Google Photos

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.580
and share them however you want.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.610
We use our smartphone cameras
in the real world every day,

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.920
and this is the start of
being able to record and share

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.480
the best things that you
encounter in VR as well.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.220
So find out more at
developers.google.com/vr,

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.250
which we've added one of my
favorite new tools for Daydream

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.290
developers, which
is instant preview,

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.770
which makes iterating in
Unity and Unreal much faster

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.860
by letting you play a
live preview directly onto

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.394
your Daydream View.

00:29:59.394 --> 00:30:01.060
And here are the
upcoming Daydream talks

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.680
that I encourage you to attend.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.400
Three more today, and one
tomorrow from our design team.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.638
So thank you very much.

00:30:09.638 --> 00:30:13.096
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:13.096 --> 00:30:17.620
