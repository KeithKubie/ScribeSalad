00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
So now we know how to find the right bucket. Let us look at how to define the add procedure.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.010
So we are going first to find add. We will make hashtable add that takes a hashtable, a word,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.930
and a value. And, first of all to find a simple version of that that says we are going to add the new entry

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.420
to the bucket even if it already exist. So, we will find the right bucket and we will add the new entry

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.770
at that time. So you will go to the final procedure. We will call it hashtable add, takes three amphlets,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.530
a hashtable, a key which is the word, and a value, and it adds that key to the hashtable,

00:00:32.530 --> 99:59:59.000
making sure to put in the correct bucket with the associated value that was passed in as the third.
