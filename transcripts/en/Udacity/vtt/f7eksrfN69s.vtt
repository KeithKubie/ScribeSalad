00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What is equilibrium? Well, let's think about it as a state of balance.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And that balance I mean well, balance forces.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Before we get too deep into a definition, let's talk about some examples.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For example, let's consider a ball in a well.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If I release this ball from right here, well we all know what's going to happen.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's going to roll back and forth and eventually it's going to settle in one spot.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
A place where it settles somewhere near here is its equilibrium.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If you disturb the ball from its equilibrium, say by shifting it a bit to the right,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
well now it's on a hill and we could do some force decomposition,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and we would see that there's actually a force pointing down the hill.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's going to tend to restore this object back to its equilibrium.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And this is such an important concept given its own sentence here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If I'm being specific, I should change the title to stable equilibrium.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This idea that when disturbed the object would try to return to equilibrium

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that's the characteristic of what's known as stable.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There is also semi-stable and unstable equilibrium, but we're not going to talk about those today

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
because this is the sort of equilibrium that gives you the simple harmonic motion

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we need for our chronometer.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There's lots of other systems that have this exact same property.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
For example, if you have a mass hanging from a spring

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Its default state just hanging in equilibrium, but if I pull the mass down,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the spring will exert a force back upwards which tends to restore it to equilibrium.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Likewise with a pendulum or a mass swinging from a rod, its default state, its equilibrium is vertical.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If we displace it from vertical, there will be some component of force

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in this case gravity, which tends to restore it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There is one more key point for simple harmonic motion.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The criteria that must be fulfilled if we're going to get isochronous periodicity that we want,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and this one I want you to complete for me.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So, you could look at this for example as I move this ball further and further up the hill

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
further from equilibrium, does the force tending to push it back increase, decrease, or stay the same?

00:01:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here.
