00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.490
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.810
Today we're learning more
about Baker versus Carr.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.880
A landmark supreme court
case decided in 1962.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.700
Baker versus Carr grappled with

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.730
an incredibly important issue.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.610
Whether one person's vote is
equal to another person's vote.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.090
That seems pretty straight
forward to us now,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.130
but as we'll learn in this video,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.540
before Baker versus Carr,
it wasn't always the case.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.900
To learn more, I talked with two experts.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.680
Theodore Olson is a partner at
the law firm of Gibson Dunn,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.640
and served as solicitor
general of the United States

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.200
from 2001 to 2004.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.940
Charles is the Edward Ellen
Schwarzman professor of law

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.490
and the founding director
of the Duke Law Center

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.720
on law, race, and politics.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.960
Mr. Olson, could you kind
of set the stage for us.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.510
What was the overall historical
and political context

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.240
that led up to the issues
of Baker versus Carr.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.190
- [Olson] Well, it is a very,
very important decision.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.880
Earl Warrent who was
chief justice at the time

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.790
the case was decided later said
that it was one of the most

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.470
important decisions of his
tenure as chief justice.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.660
Prior to the decision
in Baker versus Carr,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.053
and a couple of subsequent decisions,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
legislatures throughout
the country were organized

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.070
in a way based upon geography
and other considerations

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.100
rather than population.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.240
We take the phrase one person,
one vote for granted now.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.130
But prior to that time,
rural counties particularly,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.952
all over the United States,
dominated state legislators

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:45.853
and individuals in cities, particularly,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.710
might be electing one
representative when a rural county

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.890
or a rural geographical area, much smaller

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.030
in terms of population, would also have

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.410
the same amount of votes.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.550
So there was a disproportionate weight

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.490
to smaller communities
based upon population,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.910
which had very significant
political consequences with

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.800
respect to allocation of money
and resources and the like.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.800
- [Charles] So in the US
we draw lines as a way of

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.560
aggregating voters
together so that way we can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.150
elect people to various
representative bodies.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.210
So the process of doing
so, drawing the lines,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.870
is called, depending on when
it's done, reapportionment

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.140
or redistricting or districting.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.220
So we draw lines through districts

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.910
for the purposes of representation.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.130
And that has been the practice
in the US for basically

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.560
time immemorial, but the way

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.201
of districting for the
purpose of representation.

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:58.201
Well, many states, especially
in the late 19th century

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.610
to early 20th century, refused.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.580
They drew the lines, in
the case of Tennessee,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.070
they drew the line in 1901.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.830
That was the last time they reapportioned

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.130
where they counted the number of voters

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.640
in the state and then they
decided how many voters

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.710
were going to be in each
particular district.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.940
So a lot of time has passed
from 1901 to when the case

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.630
was decided in 1961, and many people moved

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.890
from the rural areas to the urban areas,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.555
or from the rural areas to the suburbs,

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:33.590
and the districts were just not equal.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.330
There weren't the same number of voters

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.240
in each particular district.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.770
- [Kim] So this case took
place originally in Tennessee

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.930
and was brought by a
man named Charles Baker.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.200
So who was Charles Baker
and why did he object

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.180
to how districting was done in Tennessee?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.310
- [Olson] Well he was among
a group of citizens in a way,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.180
like many other supreme court cases,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.840
it's an accident that his name is the one

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.700
by which we remember the case.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.370
So he came together,
along with some lawyers

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.950
and other citizens in this Tennessee area,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.880
and brought the case because
of they listed the participants

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.830
as plaintiffs alphabetically,
Mr. Baker was the first one

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.030
on the list and he became the plaintiff.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.520
There were a group of
citizens in Tennessee,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.740
he was on the board of
judicial body in Tennessee,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.193
but he was among several
citizens who objected

00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:36.090
to the way the state
legislature was apportioned.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.540
- [Instructor] Suppose
that we have a class term.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.730
I'd say we have an AP history
class and we're deciding

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.190
I want to take the class out to dinner

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.540
and we're making two decisions,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.630
a seafood place or a steak place.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.140
Let's suppose that we have
10 people in the class

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.380
and we have three districts, all right.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.490
So we're gonna make it when
the basis of the decision

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.050
of those three districts.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.787
Okay, so we've got one
district of two people

00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:03.170
who like seafood, another
district of two others

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.000
who like seafood, and a district

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.550
of six people who like steak, all right.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.446
But we're gonna decide
on the basis of the votes

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:13.730
of each of the districts and
the outcome, the majority

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.240
of the votes in the district
will decide the outcome.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.920
So remember the first
district had two people

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.140
and both of those people like seafood.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.520
Our second district also had two people,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.920
and both of those like seafood.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.830
And our third district had six people,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.560
and those six like steak.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.670
Now, on the basis of the
decision of the district, right,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.010
so each district counts for one vote,

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.290
seafood wins two to one, all right.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.673
But, if you look at the
total number of people

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:45.300
and the total preferences,
there are actually six people

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.860
who like steak and four
people who like seafood.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.610
So really, the decision
should be in favor of steak

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.590
as the majority of the
people or the voters

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.660
in that classroom preferred
steak over seafood.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.290
But we can rejigger that
outcome by just dividing

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.600
the people into districts
and dividing them

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.136
into unequal districts, and then saying

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:10.390
each district gets one vote.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.060
Well, for all intents and purposes,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.100
this is exactly what Tennessee had done.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.580
They basically divided
the state into districts

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.390
so that way, and elect
representatives from that district.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.900
But some districts only
had let's say 100 people,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.410
and others had 1,000
people, and some had 400,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.870
some had 10,000, I'm
making up the numbers here,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.335
but just to give you an example

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:35.090
of what the disparities were like.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.840
But each counted essentially as one.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.320
Each district had one vote,
even though they weren't

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.490
equal in the number of people
that were in the district.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.040
When a student comes to me
and says, well, wait a minute,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.870
there are many more
people who prefer steak,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.900
it's a majority.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.920
I'm not going to change the
system because the system

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.740
reflects my preferences and it was

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.040
the same thing in Tennessee.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.050
The state legislature did
not have the incentive

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.590
to change the system because if they did

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.940
they would lose their seats.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.020
- [Kim] So it's pretty quirky.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.400
This is of course, the
supreme court is turning to

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.110
the Constitution for its interpretation.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.810
So what does the Constitution say

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.680
about apportioning representatives?

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.280
Does it make any mention of how

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.120
districts are supposed the be drawn?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.270
- [Olson] It does not.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.600
It's very interesting
that our Constitution,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.600
as everyone knows, gives
two senators for each state

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.830
and then apportions the
house of representatives

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.700
by district, which is
required to be redetermined

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.410
every 10 years after the census.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.200
But, prior to Baker versus Carr,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.830
there was very little
regard to the fact that

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.060
some districts were more
populous than other districts,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.060
which meant that an individual
voter in a populous district,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.100
who had the same amount,
had a vote, that was diluted

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.950
in a sense that he shared that vote,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.680
or that weight of his vote
with many more persons.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.920
And this was rampant all
over the United States.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.430
In California, Los Angeles County had,

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.710
which was 40 percent of the population

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.370
of the state of California,
had one representative

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.480
because it was a county and
it had lots of people in it.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.530
And then there were three smaller counties

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.620
who had very, very few
people, maybe had 10 or 15,000

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.488
people in the county, and they
each had one vote as well.

00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:39.417
- [Kim] So Charles Baker
takes this case to the courts,

00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:40.290
and then what happens?

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.730
How does this case make
its way through the courts?

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.170
- [Charles] Well, the
one thing to think about,

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.810
the reason why Baker versus
Carr is such an important case,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.880
we have to remember
that the federal courts

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.130
and particulars through the
United States Supreme Court

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.720
had said in a case called
Colegrove versus Green,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.640
look, we, the federal courts,
are not going to involve

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.870
ourselves in any of these
redistricting type cases.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.850
We don't wanna have
anything to do with them.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.310
We don't believe we have
the power to hear them,

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.620
so in '46, the court said
we don't have the power

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.270
to hear these cases and
no matter what happens,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.690
those are cases that belong
to the political process.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.340
Those are not cases that
belong in the federal courts.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.380
And large part, an important
part because we don't think

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.810
the constitution has anything
to say about those cases.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.840
- [Olson] So when it got
to the supreme court again

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.360
in Baker versus Carr, the question was

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.940
whether the court would
reverse that earlier decision

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.770
and decide this is something
that we, as a court,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.480
can deal with as opposed to something

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.160
that must remain in the political realm.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.990
And the case was argued twice,

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.990
in April of 1961 and
again in October of 1961.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.030
The court set it for rearguement
because the first time

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.720
it was argued, one of the
justices was undecided

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.800
and they were divided four to four

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.780
and they decided to set
it for reargument again.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.200
And when the case was then decided after

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.410
the second argument, the
court ruled six to two.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.450
One of the justices
became disabled at the end

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.980
of the deliberation, so it was
only eight rather than nine.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.040
But they decided six to two
the narrow, relatively narrow

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.040
question, not one person one
vote, but the narrow question

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.010
is this something that the Constitution

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.880
gives us permission to decide.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.880
And reciting the 14th
amendment to the Constitution

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.140
which contains the well known due process

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.010
and equal protection clause,
the court and Baker versus Carr

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.000
decided we can look at the
Constitution to discern from

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.085
the equal protection clause that there is,

00:11:02.085 --> 00:11:04.340
and due process clause, but mostly

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.480
the equal protection clause,
there is a basis for us

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.480
to decide that it might
violate an individuals

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.150
constitutional right to
equal protection of the laws.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.746
If they're placed in a political
situation where their vote

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:22.670
counts less than someone else's vote.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.730
- [Charles] And so that's
the way that the court

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.887
got around that question.

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:29.930
And the technical legal
term is to say that

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.550
these cases are justiciable,
which means that the courts

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.410
can hear them, that the
federal courts have the power

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.210
to decide these types of cases.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.900
Now, the court did not
decide the second question in

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.890
Baker versus Carr, which is okay.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.510
Suppose that it's true, right,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.060
which if the court says
it's so, it is now true,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.250
that federal courts do
have the power to make

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.790
those decisions, how do we
determine what is the standard

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.020
that we're going to use
to determine whether

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.180
the constitution is violated?

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.460
And that question the
court put off to the side.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.580
The court said something
to the effect that look,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.930
we know that there are
standards, they are available.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.670
What we're deciding now
is that we have the power

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.680
because the equal
protection clause, in fact,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.730
means that the state
can't draw lines that are

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.210
so malapportioned that they undermine

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.580
the equality of voters.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.773
- [Kim] Baker versus
Carr says that the courts

00:12:23.773 --> 00:12:27.170
then can rule on redistricting.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:32.170
Did this bring in a flood of
cases about redistricting?

00:12:33.441 --> 00:12:34.730
- [Olson] It did.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.530
Once the court decided
that this was fair game,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.830
that this was appropriate
for courts to consider

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:47.830
whether or not disparities
in voting power as a result

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.840
of packing people into different districts

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.590
in different ways constituted a violation

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.960
of the Constitution, then
in a relatively short term

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.960
by supreme court standards
in 1963 and 1964 and other

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.320
decisions that all came about
before the end of the '60's.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.140
The court pronounced in case
after case that one person,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.470
one vote did indeed have to,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.770
was required by the Constitution.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.770
So, Baker versus Carr
opened the door for a stream

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.780
of decisions from the
supreme court that put

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.650
into our constitutional fabric the concept

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.210
of one person one vote.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.750
Which changed probably more than anything,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.520
the structure of our political government

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.258
in the United States.

00:13:39.258 --> 00:13:41.020
- [Kim] Do you think that
our election system today

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.780
conforms to this standard
of one person one vote?

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.390
- [Olson] Well, we probably haven't solved

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.740
all of the problems, but
compared to where we were

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.730
in 1961 before Baker versus Carr,

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.310
we've really crossed that rubicon.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.990
Most districts are relatively equal.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.800
There is a census every 10
years so that we can count

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.883
the number of persons in districts.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.520
There's still cases that come along,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.220
there are cases involving
the allocation of persons

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:16.220
by race and whether there
are systems in place

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.370
that discriminate on the basis of race.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.890
- [Charles] Some states
have passed laws requiring

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.380
voters to present photo
identification when the voter goes

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.360
to vote at the polling place.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.360
And one objection to the photo
ID is that it's a violation

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.540
of the equal protection clause.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.970
It's a violation of the idea
of of equality that voters

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.210
are not being treated
equally via 71 and other

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.740
because some voters have
voter ID's and others

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.170
have a hard time getting
them for whatever reason.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.530
And there are some, there might be

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.670
racial disproportionate
effects, might be class effects,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.120
there might be gender effects.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.870
So this raises a violation of
the equal protection clause

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.840
and these are the types of
arguments that are now available

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.690
to someone challenging the
problem of inequality in voting

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.220
pose after Baker v. Carr
that were not available

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.100
before that Baker versus Carr.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.680
And to fully answer your
question, some people might be say

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.600
look, we don't fully
have one person one vote

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.010
because we have a lot of laws
that treat voters unequally.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.010
- [Olson] If the political
party A, controls both houses

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.870
of a legislature in a
particular state and the person

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:36.910
who's in the governors
mansion, then those lines can

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.970
be drawn to favor that political party.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.430
So that you might have situations
where a political party

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.780
maybe only has 40 percent
of the registered voters

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.740
in a particular state, but
maybe 55 percent of the

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.020
elected representatives.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.163
That's called political gerrymandering.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.035
And those issues have
come before the court.

00:16:00.035 --> 00:16:03.375
- [Charles] We still haven't
achieved the type of equality

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:07.720
that was promised by
the Baker line of cases.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.380
- [Kim] So we've learned
that in Baker versus Carr

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.680
the supreme court ruled that redistricting

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.030
was a justiciable issue, or something

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.980
that the federal courts could decide

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.830
because ensuring that
votes have equal weight

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.570
is important to ensuring equal
protection under the law.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.720
The standard of one person,
one vote opened the flood gate

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.200
for cases about equality of
representation in districting

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.570
which are still being litigated
at the supreme court today.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.660
