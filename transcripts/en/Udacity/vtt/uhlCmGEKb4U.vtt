00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.130
Hey, I'm Jarrod and
I'm a course developer for

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.010
the iOS team here at Udacity.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.780
&gt;&gt; And I'm Brynn, an Android coach and

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.039
a developer of the Android
interviewing course.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.100
&gt;&gt; In just a moment you'll be
watching a mock interview for

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.610
a mobile development job.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.144
&gt;&gt; This will give you an opportunity to
watch the rules of both an interviewer

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:16.175
and an interviewee.

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:17.584
&gt;&gt; Now,
when it comes to an interview for

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.910
a mobile development job there are some
things that you want to keep in mind.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.910
Generally speaking, most mobile
development teams are pretty small.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.210
Sometimes it might even
be just one person.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.970
So you'll want to prepare for
all aspects about development.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.039
That includes designing user interfaces,
researching APIs,

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.460
implementing and testing,
debugging, the whole gamut.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.930
&gt;&gt; But don't let that be a deterrent
Interviewers like to see your code.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.430
So if you haven't already it's a great
idea to have your projects available and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.030
get help or
somewhere that can be easily accessed.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.814
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:49.237
And you should be prepared to answer
questions about your code like, how did

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:52.790
you architect this project or what
was the biggest technical challenge?

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.350
Remember, each question the interviewer
asked is an opportunity to let

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.070
your experiences shine.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.750
&gt;&gt; Now, without further ado,
let's hear from our interviewer and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.110
see what they're looking for
in a candidate.
