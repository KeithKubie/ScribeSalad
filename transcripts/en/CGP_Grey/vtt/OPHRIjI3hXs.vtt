00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.540
Vatican City: capitol of the Catholic Church,
home to the pope, owner of impressive collections

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.030
of art and history all contained within the
borders of the world's smallest country: conveniently

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.240
circumnavigateable on foot in only 40 minutes.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.980
Just how did the world end up with this tiny
nation?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.079
The short answer is: because Mussolini and
the long answer is fiendishly complicated

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.199
so here's a simplified medium version:

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.669
The popes used to rule a country called the
Papal States that covered much of modern day

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.669
Italy.

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.960
It was during this 1,000+ year reign that
the Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.199
the largest church in the world -- and also
built a wall around the base of a hill known

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.449
as Vatican upon which St. Peter's Stood.

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.320
But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought
Rome would be an awesome capital for their

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.830
country and so conquered the Papal States.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.829
His nation destroyed the Pope hid behind the
walls of Vatican and conflictingly refused

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.950
to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed,
while simultaneously complaining about being

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.100
a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy -- which
according to him didn't exist.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.960
Rather than risk religious civil war by getting
rid of the pope the Kingdom of Italy decided

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.729
to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give
up -- but religion is nothing if not obstinate

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.440
-- and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 popes and sixty years
later nothing had changed.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.970
Which brings us to Benito Mussolini the then
prime minister of Italy who was tired of listing

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.120
to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics
about his self-imposed imprisonment so Mussolini

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.000
thought he could score some political points
by striking a deal which looked like this:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.550
1) Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.550
and…

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.380
2) Italy gave the Pope a bunch of apology
money

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.380
In return

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.530
1) The Pope acknowledged that Italy existed
and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.530
and…

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.840
2) The Pope promised to remain neutral in
politics and wars.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.210
On the off chance that, you know, Mussolini
thought this might be a thing.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.190
The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican
City was born.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.880
And today the tiny nation on a hill has all
the things you'd expect of a country: its

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.800
own government that makes its own laws that
are enforced by its own police, who put people

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.280
who break them in its own jail.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
It also has its own bank and prints its own
stamps and issues its own license plates,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.910
though only its citizens can drive within
its borders presumably because of terrible,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.820
terrible parking -- and as the true mark of
any self-respecting nation: it has its own

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.800
top-level domain: .VA

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.430
But, despite all these national trappings
Vatican City is not really like any other

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.430
country.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.190
Hold on to your fancy hat, because it's about
to get weird:

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.060
To understand the Vatican: there are two people
and two things that you need to know about:

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.600
the famous pope, the incredibly confusing
Holy See, The Country of Vatican City and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.410
along with that the almost completely unknown
King of Vatican City.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.530
But first the Pope: who gets a throne to sit
upon and from which he acts as the Bishop

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.530
for all the Catholics in Rome.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.170
Actually all Bishops in the Catholic Church
get their own thrones but because the Bishop

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.010
of Rome is also the Pope his thrown is special
and has it's own special name: The Holy See.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.860
Every time a Pope dies or retires there is
a sort of game of thrones to see which of

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.610
the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy
See.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.540
So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.610
As such the name The Holy See not only refers
to the throne but also all the rules that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.920
make the Catholic Church the Catholic Church.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.000
When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned
deal, technically he gave the land of Vatican

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.890
City to The Holy See -- which, believe it
or not, is a legal corporate person in international

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.890
law.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.880
Basically every time you hear the words The
Holy See think Catholic Church, Inc of which

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.450
the Pope is the CEO.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.740
Now back to the King.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.220
The King of Vatican City has absolute, unchecked
power within the country's borders and his

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.620
presence makes Vatican City one of only six
remanning absolute monarchies in the world,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.010
including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
and Swaziland.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.690
The King's absolute power is why Vatican City
can't join the European Union because only

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.060
democracies are allowed.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.820
Through Vatican City does, strictly speaking,
have a legislative brach of government -- staffed

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.130
by cardinals, appointed by the pope -- the
King of Vatican City can overrule their decisions

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.130
and at any time for any reason.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.060
So why do you never hear about the King of
Vatican City?

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.780
Because though King and Pope are two different
roles, they just happen to be occupied by

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.660
the same person at the same time -- which
has the funny consequence that, because the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.650
Pope is elected and the King is all-powerful
but they're the same guy it makes Vatican

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.930
City the world's only elected, non-hereditary
absolute monarchy.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.120
It's this dual-role that makes untangling
Vatican City so difficult because the Pope,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.300
depending on the situation either acts as
The King of the country of Vatican City or

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.030
the Pope of the Holy See.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.030
Got it?

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.030
No?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.030
OK, here's an analogy:

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.770
Imagine if a powerful international company,
say Grey Industries, had a CEO who convinced

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.439
the United States to give one of its islands
to the Company which then made the island

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:22.780
into a new country -- Greytropolis -- with
an absolute monarchy as its government and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.849
the law that the King of Greytropolis is,
by definition, the CEO of Grey Industries.

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.100
It's pretty obvious at that point that the
CEO should move his corporate headquarters

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.569
to the new nation -- so that the laws of the
country can benefit the company and the company's

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.900
global reach can benefit the country.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.610
As for the man in the middle sometimes it's
good to the the CEO and sometimes it's good

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.930
to be the king.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.879
That is essentially Vatican City.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.550
But if you're still confused, don't worry
even other countries can't keep it straight.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.770
For example the United Nations has The Holy
See the corporation as a member but not Vatican

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.569
City the actual country.

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.569
And The Holy See gives passports to Vatican
City citizens that other countries accept

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.180
even though those passports come from a company,
not a country.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.910
And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they
are perhaps the strangest consequence of the

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.740
Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.789
While other countries mint new citizens with
the ever popular process of human reproduction

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.650
Vatican City does not.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.089
No one in Vatican City is born a citizen -- and
that's not just because, within a rounding

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.240
error, there are no female Vaticans.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.870
The only way to become a citizen is for the
King of Vatican City to appoint you as one.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.490
And the King only appoints you a citizen if
you work for the Pope -- who is also the King.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.860
And because the King is all-powerful your
citizenship is at his whim.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.630
If you quit your job for the Pope, the King
-- who is also the pope -- will revoke your

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.630
citizenship.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.120
These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't
have a real permanent population to speak

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.389
of: there are only about 500 full citizens
-- which is fewer people that live in single

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.409
skyscrapers in many countries -- and all these
citizens work for The Holy See as either Cardinals

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.479
or Diplomats or the Pope's bodyguards or other
Catholic-related jobs.

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.750
So it's best to think of Vatican City as a
kind of Sovereign Corporate Headquarters that

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.330
grants temporary citizenship to its managers
rather than a real city-state like Singapore:

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
which has a self-reproducing population of
citizens engaged in a variety of economic

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.349
activities both of which Vatican City lacks.

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.159
But in the end, the reason the world cares
about Vatican City is not because of the citizens

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.469
within its walls but because of the billion
members of its church outside those walls.
