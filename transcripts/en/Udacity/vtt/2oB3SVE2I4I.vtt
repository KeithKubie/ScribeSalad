00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.500
Here's an exercise intended to help
you solidify your understanding

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.990
of the relationship between
the original clause and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.550
the set of three clauses that
the transformation produces.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.180
I want you to extend
the truths table below so

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.730
that it satisfies
the given 3CNF formula.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.600
This one is the image of this clause

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.550
under the transformation
that we've discussed.
