00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:04.800
But the DMCA does allow some exclusions.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.220
So, there are exclusions for
research and educational purposes.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.645
So, if you're doing research in sort of
understanding how strong, secure some

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:18.830
anti-piracy techniques are, hopefully
you're not doing anything illegal.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.290
Similarly, as I said,
libraries can make some

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.050
limited number of copies and
that's not viewed as illegal either.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.920
So that's one of the exclusions.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.379
However, I should say that,
one of the criticisms people have for

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.812
these laws is that they're
kind of vague and broad.

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:40.982
And people sort of have different
interpretations of those depending on

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:41.812
who they are.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:45.892
So although we sort of say there
are exclusions, of course,

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:50.854
how far those exclusions go, there
have been disagreements about that.

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:57.610
So RIAA, which is the Recording
Industry Association of America,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.910
they'll actually file lawsuits
against P2P sharing music.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.270
So these are on one side, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation or EFF,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270
sort of what is about a too
broad a scope of these laws and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.610
potential abuse of the laws themselves
