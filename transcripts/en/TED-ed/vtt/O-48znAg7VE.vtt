00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:17.835
Our Earth is a collection of puzzle pieces that make up the universe.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:19.399
In the vast darkness of space,

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:21.647
the universe is lit by stars,

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:23.528
which could one day become a supernova

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:25.910
and create all the puzzle pieces that we know today

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.625
as the elements.

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.056
All elements were formed and released

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:31.377
into space by exploding stars.

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:33.191
For centuries, humans have tried to discover

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:34.844
what makes up the world around them.

00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:37.354
Little did they know that all the pieces they needed

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:39.195
were right under their noses.

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:40.920
The discovery of these pieces revolutionized

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.708
our understanding of the world

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.101
and allowed for the creation of what might be

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:45.748
the greatest gift to science:

00:00:45.748 --> 00:00:47.652
the periodic table.

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:49.961
So, where are these elements,

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:52.160
and how do we find a means to order them?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.811
Well, believe it or not,

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:55.364
ancient civilizations were very much aware

00:00:55.364 --> 00:00:57.427
of many elements around them,

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:00.593
but they did not identify them as the pieces of our universe.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.555
Elements like gold, silver, and copper

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.496
were easily spotted by ancient cultures,

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:07.928
and were used for multiple purposes like jewelry and tools.

00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:10.413
Why were these elements spotted so easily?

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:12.020
Think of the periodic table as a puzzle.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.285
The corner pieces are edges of a puzzle,

00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:16.410
are generally the easiest to find and place

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.561
because they stand out with their smooth edges,

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:21.301
and clearly don't interlock with other puzzle pieces.

00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:25.765
Like puzzle pieces, elements can be choosy on who they interact with.

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:27.336
Some like to react with other elements,

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:29.066
while others do not.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.360
The elements that do not interact with other elements are easy to pin-point,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.603
while the ones who like to interact with others are difficult to find.

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:39.286
Gold, silver, and copper are some of the choosier elements

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:41.295
so we can find them easier.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:43.680
So let's fast forward to the late 1600's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.075
where Hennig Brand, a German alchemist,

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:47.951
was busy working in his laboratory.

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:49.913
Like many other alchemists of his time,

00:01:49.913 --> 00:01:52.621
Brand was trying to extract gold from the human body.

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.804
Brand hit upon what he thought was the most obvious answer to his problem:

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:58.355
urine.

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:01.546
Urine is gold in coloration and could perhaps have gold in it.

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:04.517
So, Brand collected as much urine as he possibly could,

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:06.429
much of it being his own,

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.372
then he decided to boil it down in hopes of obtaining gold.

00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:12.432
So Brand boiled his, well, urine,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.716
down until he collected a paste

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.483
and heated the paste to a very high temperature.

00:02:16.483 --> 00:02:17.542
Eventually smoke appeared

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.351
and the material burned brightly and violently.

00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.878
Brand had unknowingly isolated phosphorous from his urine.

00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:26.285
It was the first time anyone had discovered an element,

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:28.853
but he didn't really understand what he had done.

00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:32.098
At the time of Brand, the concept of element had not been discovered.

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:34.663
Instead ancient Greek principles of objects being composed of

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:35.504
earth,

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:36.273
water,

00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:36.688
air,

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:37.452
and fire

00:02:37.452 --> 00:02:39.130
were predominant.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.556
It wasn't until the work of Antoine Lavoisier,

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:43.509
who is now known as the father of chemistry,

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.683
that science defined what an element was.

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:48.576
Lavoisier defined an element as a substance

00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:52.328
that cannot be broken down by existing chemical means.

00:02:52.328 --> 00:02:54.886
Lavoisier created a list of the known elements of his time

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:57.455
and tried to put the elements in some sort of order

00:02:57.455 --> 00:02:58.846
in which they could be classified,

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:01.005
such as gases or metals.

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.538
He was the first one to try to put the puzzle together.

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:05.023
This was just the beginning of a means

00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:07.703
to organize the known elements of his time.

00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:10.828
Many other chemists then came along to make the puzzle clearer.

00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:13.214
One of them, John Dalton, weighed the elements

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:15.311
and arranged the puzzle by weight.

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.909
German chemist Wolfgang DÃ¶bereiner later combined elements

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.044
to see how they reacted with one another.

00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:24.739
What he found was that certain elements shared similar properties and reactions.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.498
For example, when pure lithium, sodium, and potassium

00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:30.326
are exposed to water,

00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:31.446
they will react violently

00:03:31.446 --> 00:03:34.408
and skid across the surface of the water with sparks.

00:03:34.408 --> 00:03:36.167
The scientists then realized that these similiarities

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:37.809
are no coincidence:

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:41.160
elements belong to families that share similar properties.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.052
But the chemist who finally put the puzzle together is Dmitri Mendeleev.

00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:47.643
He created cards of each known element and tried to order them

00:03:47.643 --> 00:03:50.577
based on atomic weight and their known properties.

00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:53.289
The story is that he stayed up 3 days and 3 nights,

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.084
and he finally fell into a deep sleep

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:57.791
and he dreamed about a table to order the elements.

00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.302
Mendeleev was not only able to create the periodic table,

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:03.927
but he was able to predict elements that were not yet discovered.

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:07.049
The puzzle of the periodic table of the elements was solved.
