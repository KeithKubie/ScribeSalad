00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:01.968
Tomlinson: One thing
I found useful was reading

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.601
through the SDK documentation
thoroughly,

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.934
as well as doing the sample
applications provided,

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:09.434
such as Hello World
and Notepad tutorial.

00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:10.667
They are really helpful.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.033
There can be
a lot of information

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.200
which is overwhelm--

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.033
overwhelming
to first-time developers,

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.300
so reading
through the SDK documentation,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.701
even though you have
an understanding,

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:20.534
can be very helpful.

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:21.667
I'd also like to point out

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:22.968
the Apps
for Android project.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:25.100
Source code
is being provided by Google

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.601
to help
first-time developers

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.801
overcome any hurdles
they may encounter

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.767
while trying to develop
for Android,

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:32.567
as well as having
some cool games on there.
