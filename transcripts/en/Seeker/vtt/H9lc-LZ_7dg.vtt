00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.090
You know what they say about people with big
feet… they’ve got biggggg brains.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.260
Because they’re human.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.340
Because humans have big brains.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.690
That’s what this episode is about.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.880
Perverts.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210
Hey there brainy buddies, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.560
If you compare the brain of a human to that
of a chimp, one of our closest genetic relatives,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.920
you’d see a pretty notable difference.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.100
The human brain is three times larger than
the chimp’s.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.369
By bodyweight, humans pretty much have some
of the biggest brains, pound for pound.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.640
To be fair, the award for largest brain in
comparison to weight goes to the ant, whose

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.100
brain makes up about 15% of its mass.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.670
But having a larger brain doesn’t necessarily
make a human or animal smarter.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.829
Researchers have long discounted the theory
that human brains are so big solely because

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:48.989
we’re so smart.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.590
We have a video about that, so check it out.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.690
I know I’ve met people who are dumber than
my fish Lenny, despite the brain differential.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.609
What’s more, having a big brain may seem
to be a disadvantage, at first glance.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.639
Although in humans, the brains make up 2%
of our mass, they use a whopping 20% of our

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:01.729
blood and oxygen.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.580
That’s more than twice the amount compared
to other primates.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.940
That’s pretty interesting, because besides
having much larger brains, humans are also

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.130
much weaker.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.300
An according to at least one study, those
two things may be related.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.840
The study in Brain Behavior and Evolution
suggests humans developed larger brains at

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.620
the expense of muscle mass: they call it the
"energy trade-off hypothesis."

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.370
Researchers looked at changes in genes that
transport glucose, an important energy source,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.420
and found that in comparison to chimps, orangutans,
and macaques, human genes tend to emphasize

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.430
providing energy to the brain over the muscles.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.210
But that still doesn’t explain why we evolved
bigger brains to begin with.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.410
The answer to that might have the most to
do… with our homies.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.200
Yup, friendships, social relationships, and
other complex interactions may just hold the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.970
key to our big-old brains.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.060
It’s known as the “social brain hypothesis”,
and it suggests that non-neural intensive

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.020
tasks, like sleeping, eating, or breathing,
are not really related to brain size.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.830
Even problem solving is not wholly responsible
for an increase.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.960
But thinking about people -- keeping track
of who is doing what to whom and why and how

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.099
we fit into those relationships -- that takes
a ridiculous amount of processing power.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.150
And guess what, for humans, being good at
interpersonal relationships is one of the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.569
best ways to get someone interested in you
and eventually propagate the continued existence

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.569
of the species.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.680
That’s right -- sex.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.959
And in fact, this social brain hypothesis
kind of makes sense.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.849
In an analytical study of skull fossils, researchers
from the University of Missouri compared a

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.760
huge number of potential brain-size factors,
including climate levels, the number of parasites

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.249
around, population density and more, and they
found a strong correlation for that last factor.

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.279
The more densely compact a population, the
more likely they’d have bigger brains.

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.749
So, in the end…

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.130
maybe our evolution is based on social prowess
over having big muscles.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.579
Which is a pretty nice thing to hear when
you’re a funny guy who only weighs a buck

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.579
fifty.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.579
Ladies, get at me.

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.579
I got it where it counts.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.379
Our brains have been through a lot of changes.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.260
Even texting changes our brain.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:20.889
And I’ll let Trace tell 
you about that in this video.

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.769
What would you rather have - big muscles or
a big brain?

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.659
Let us know…
