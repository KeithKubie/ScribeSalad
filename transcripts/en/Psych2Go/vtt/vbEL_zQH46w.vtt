00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
Many psychologists associate high functioning depression with persistent depressive disorder,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
which is a prolonged state of depression.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.440
Those with high functioning depression may not feel as helpless as those with clinical depression,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.860
but their depression does affect, tremendously, their quality of life.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.220
It minimizes their interest in everything, including social events with friends and family.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.420
High functioning depressives will go to school or work and socialize when necessary,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.700
but once they're done with their responsibilities, they'll withdraw themselves.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.040
Here's 7 signs you may have high functioning depression.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440
Number one: you're concerned with time.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.480
Although you're achieving your goals and completing all your tasks, you feel like you're wasting your time.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.720
Even if you find a new hobby or job, it still feels like a fool's errand,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.500
and you wonder if all the time you're investing into such activities are worth it.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.040
Number 2: you constantly criticize yourself.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.360
Because you feel like you're not achieving much, you criticize yourself.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.420
Your expectations are too high so you push yourself to the limit, affecting your state of mind.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.320
Number 3: You overthink.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.580
It doesn't matter if a situation is big or small, you'll find yourself overthinking it and eventually breaking down.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.960
Number 4: you feel misunderstood.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.820
Since most high functioning depressives can maintain a job, a house, and their responsibilities,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.540
people underestimate how much anguish they're going through,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.700
minimizing their feelings simply because they don't act like the typical depressed person.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.520
Number 5: you feel saddened.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.060
It's normal to feel sad from time to time, but if you're sad or numb most of the time

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.820
even while participating in fun activities, you may be suffering from high functioning depression.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.860
Number 6: you have unhealthy coping strategies.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.480
Since you overwork yourself, you may lean towards drugs or alcohol to deal with stressful situations.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.100
Many high functioning depressives turn to self-destructive habits to clear their minds.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.500
Number 7: you have excessive pastimes.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.960
Along with any unhealthy coping habits you have, you may also find yourself constantly gaming

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.800
or binge-watching tv series, among other things.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.120
Although these activities seem normal, the problem is you're actually using them to escape reality.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.420
High functioning depression is difficult to notice because those who suffer from it are still able to continue with their responsibilities.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.920
Since they don't act like the typical depressive person, they believe that they're truly okay,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.460
but in reality it's not okay to live life feeling numb, sad, and constantly criticizing yourself.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.800
If you do have high functioning depression, try to find the root of it. Only by doing so can you truly live happily.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.960
