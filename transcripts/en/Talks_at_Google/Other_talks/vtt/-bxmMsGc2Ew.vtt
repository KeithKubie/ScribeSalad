00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:03.810
TAL AKABAS: I'm here to
introduce Meg Akabas.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.690
Meg is a certified parenting
educator and the author

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.950
of "52 Weeks of
Parenting Wisdom:

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.726
Effective Strategies for Raising
Happy and Responsible Kids."

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:14.100
She'll talk about
the book today.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.920
And each chapter of the book
provides a salient piece

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.110
of advice on specific
topics concerning parents,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.970
such as respect, self-control,
cooperation, sibling relations,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.040
sleep habits, and more.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.940
Unlike other parenting
books, it mercifully

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.260
lets parents concentrate on
making a single change that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.550
is attainable and effective
without being overwhelmed

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.900
and distracted with
too much information.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.840
She serves as the steering
committee for the New York

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.650
State Parenting
Education Partnership,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.220
and was recently nominated to
serve on the National Parenting

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.950
Education Network Council.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.460
Meg has served as the
president of the board of two

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.100
schools of Manhattan and
has more than 18 years

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.420
of leadership experience in
nursery and elementary schools,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.570
and she's the mother
of four children.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.610
And if you haven't already
guessed, that includes myself.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.351
Here's Meg.

00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.351
MEG AKABAS: Thanks, Tal.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.990
So can everybody hear me?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.630
That's actually
the first time I've

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240
had one of my kids introduce me.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.300
It was kind of a treat.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.000
I might have to take
him on tour with me.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.500
So thank you all
for coming today.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.830
I'm delighted to see you
here, mostly because it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.080
means that you care
about parenting.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.060
And I believe that
parenting is something

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.320
that every parent should work,
on even the best parents.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.040
I think we can all
be better parents.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.760
And there are really
few things in this world

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.087
that are more important.

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:35.920
I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.210
I came to write this book, "52
Weeks of Parenting Wisdom."

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.140
I'll tell you about two
of the core tenets that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.690
run throughout the book, and
then I'll talk about a couple

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.440
of the strategies, and
then I'll have time

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.750
for some of your questions,
because I know some of you

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.250
probably have parenting
issues you want to ask about.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.990
That's always the fun part.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.110
I came to the field
of parenting education

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.630
about eight years ago.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.200
Before that, I was a
management consultant

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.917
for nonprofit arts
organizations.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:02.500
I have an MBA.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.850
I also have a Master's in music.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.330
And I did work in strategic
planning and marketing

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.170
and development for
nonprofit organizations.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.330
At the same time that I began
to work right out of business

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.060
school, I also started a family.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.040
And for New York standards,
I started very young.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.860
I started to have my
kids in my early 20s,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.170
because I knew I wanted
to have a big family.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.340
Tal is my second of four.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.220
So I really had two
things, I think,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.740
that were going for
me to start with.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.550
And one was that I had
very good role models

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.480
as parents-- both my parents
and my husband's parents.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.640
And second, I fell into
mothering pretty naturally.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.010
It was something I felt
pretty comfortable with,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.890
that I enjoyed, and I thought
I was well-suited for.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.550
Despite those really
positive and important points

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.670
that I had going for
me, I often felt--

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.274
during those first
few months and years,

00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:01.690
trying to figure out what I
was doing as a mother-- really

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.410
overwhelmed, and very confused,
and not very sure of myself.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.190
So when my instincts
worked, they worked.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.550
And when they didn't, I
wasn't sure what to do.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.640
And for someone who
is type A, as I am,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.266
a planner, feeling out of
control and overwhelmed

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:19.390
didn't feels so good to me.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.081
And I felt like
parenting was something

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:22.580
that I should
approach as I approach

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.560
other things in my life--
that it was something

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.900
I wanted to work on
and be really good at.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.420
So I began to research and read
and study child development

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.190
and go to workshops,
and also my husband

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.560
and I discussed child-rearing
pretty much on a nightly basis,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.690
and became more well-informed
about what strategies worked,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.700
what was effective, and what we
knew about child development.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.960
And the more that I
learned, the more I

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.124
found that I became much more
confident in my parenting,

00:03:52.124 --> 00:03:54.290
and that the decisions that
I made and the parenting

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.360
strategies I used
really became effective.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.020
And when my kids got
to be by middle school

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.500
age or late
elementary school age,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.270
it just got much easier because
I had put in so much time early

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.060
on trying to find
the right strategies

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.370
and to be effective
in my parenting.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.230
So when my peers were all
having their children,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.670
I already had several.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.140
And people began to
ask me for advice.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.410
I also was, as Tal said,
president of two school boards.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.700
And people naturally
came to me as a mentor.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.080
And pretty soon my kids
were also saying to me,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.430
you know, Mom, you should
write a book about parenting.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.710
So I began to think about this.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.380
And because I believed
so passionately

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.880
that parenting was important--
and that it's much easier when

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.430
you learn about it and you
work at it; in the end,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.440
it will be easier
for you-- that I

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.070
decided to move into this
profession of parenting

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.050
education, which is
actually a profession.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.290
And I became a certified
parenting educator

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.640
by pulling in some pieces from
my background and education

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.380
that we're missing that
I needed, and began

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.070
to work with parents both in
workshops and individually

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.950
one-on-one.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.090
And what I found
working with parents

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.870
is that they, too, were
overwhelmed, for the most part.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.440
That they were well-intentioned
and they love their kids

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.210
and they wanted to
do what was best,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.840
but that they would just sort
of throw up their hands and say,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.570
there's just so
much to worry about,

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.300
so much to keep track of.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.080
We're always putting
out the latest fire.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.790
And when I worked with
parents one-on-one

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.310
and gave them one thing to
work on for a week or two weeks

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.600
until I saw them or
talked with them next,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.150
they were much more likely to
be successful in implementing

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.700
what we had talked about.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.726
And that made sense.

00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:40.100
Like anything else
we do in life,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.370
it's hard to be good at
something immediately or all

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.870
at once.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.800
And to really get your skills
together at the same time,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.530
you layer things one at a time.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.762
So when I began to
write this book,

00:05:51.762 --> 00:05:53.720
I decided to take the
approach of really making

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.530
short chapters, each about
one salient parenting point,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.720
and that parents would digest
that one piece at a time

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.750
and to see parenting
as a journey,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.470
as something
proactively that you

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.370
approach throughout your life.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.880
Because you're
really never done.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.887
I mean, I've been
parenting for 27 years,

00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:13.470
and I'm still working
on my parenting.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.020
So it's a long haul.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.960
But it's something they really
do see building skills on top

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.020
of each other and you
see the rewards of that.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.570
So that's how I came to write
the book "52 Weeks of Parenting

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.470
Wisdom."

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.630
And there are two overriding
principles or tenets

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.800
that I believe
about parenting that

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.590
really flow throughout the book.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.320
And the first is that how we
parent matters-- that it really

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.860
does make a difference
what you do.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.110
And I know that there
are a lot of naysayers

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.387
who say that your children
are born a certain way

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:49.220
and there's very little
you can do about it.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.390
So, don't worry so much.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.780
Just let it go and see
what happens and everything

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.210
will turn out fine.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.310
And actually how we
parent really does matter.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.400
And I'm actually part of
an experiment going on,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.100
a research study that's going
on at Columbia University

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.310
that I started with my
oldest son when he was born.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.760
I was asked to be
in a study that

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.090
is looking at communication
between infants and mothers

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.800
and how that
communication keeps going

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.940
throughout the life of a child
and into their adulthood.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.720
So it was a continuing
study, and they're

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.330
looking at-- I'm in
the control group.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.730
But they're looking at
how trauma or depression

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.750
or other things that
might affect the parent

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.180
affect their parenting
skills and what effect that

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.800
has later on in life.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.200
So I know this, from
the core of my being,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.230
that how we parent
really matters.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.100
And it's why I do the work I do.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.900
The second principle that
runs throughout the book

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.000
is an idea of
approaching parenting

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.570
with the point of
parenting with intention.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.950
So by parenting
with intention, I

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.141
mean the opposite of
responding to the latest

00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:00.640
crisis or the latest problem,
that we don't need to do that,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.060
because, of course, we do.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.500
But to go into
parenting with an idea

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.340
in mind of what you
want the outcome to be.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.070
So what do you
want for your kids?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.070
And when I ask people that
question, they'll say,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.820
I want my kids to
be happy, or I want

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.340
them to grow up to
be successful adults.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.330
Some people say I just don't
want my kids to be messed up.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.290
I hope I just get
them to that point.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.530
And those are all
fine and good goals,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.340
but they're not very specific.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.929
And so when I ask
people to think

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.809
about what they want
for their children,

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.860
I ask them to think
about what kind of person

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.809
do you want your child
to grow up to be?

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.460
And what traits do you
want to instill in them?

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.000
Not what you want
them to achieve,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.520
because achievement goals
we really have very little

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.630
control over.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.530
We do know that
genetically everybody's

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.930
born with a certain personality.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.660
They are born with
certain strengths

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.760
and certain challenges.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.300
And, yes.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.550
As parents, there's very
little we can do about that.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.930
And we work with those
strengths and challenges

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.239
to the best of our
ability, but those things

00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:07.030
are things that our
children are born with.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.020
So what we can really
have influence over

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.530
is the kind of person they turn
out to be, how they behave,

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.610
and how they interact
in the world.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.310
So I encourage parents--
and I did this myself,

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.590
with my husband-- to think
about what traits do you really

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.820
want your children to have?

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.970
And it may not be the same
for everybody in this room,

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.670
and that's fine.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.630
But it's really something that
you should have in your mind--

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.970
and if you have a parenting
partner, in their mind--

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.140
because then all of the
strategies and the tools

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.800
that you use to parent
your children can be seen

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.310
through that lens of does
this serve my end goal?

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.780
You can ask the filter question.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.940
Does bribing my child
at this moment--

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.440
is that going to
teach my child what

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.773
I want to teach them in the end?

00:09:50.773 --> 00:09:52.570
That kind of question.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.490
So for my husband and
I, we had three traits

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.120
that we worked to
instill in our children.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.130
And, in no particular
order, the first one

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.930
was respect-- that we
wanted to raise children

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.780
who respected other people,
had consideration for others,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.140
had consideration for
ideas other than theirs,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.810
who had consideration and
respect for education,

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.190
and had a respectful demeanor
in dealing with others.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.520
Secondly, we wanted to raise
children who were sensitive,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.960
who were empathetic, who would
be able to read other people's

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.210
feelings and then act
appropriately on those feelings

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.650
and have a demeanor of
kindness about them.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.700
And thirdly-- and this
is going to be one thing

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.560
that I talk about.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.960
I'm going to pick out a
few chapters of the book

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.543
to talk about.

00:10:38.543 --> 00:10:40.870
But the third thing,
then-- I'm going

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.870
to be more specific
about this later--

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.450
is we wanted to have children
who had self-control,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:51.092
self-discipline, could
live a life of moderation.

00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:52.800
There's lots of
different words for this.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.470
But in psychology or the
child development field,

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.400
we call it executive function.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.870
And it means having a
well-developed prefrontal

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.740
cortex part of your brain,
which helps you to inhibit

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:14.842
urges that will help you to
live a life of moderation.

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:17.050
And I'll talk about why
that's important in a minute.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.922
So those were three things
that we wanted for our children

00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:21.630
that we tried to
instill in our children,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.910
and that framed all of
the parenting decisions

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.970
that we made.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.030
And I encourage parents
to think about the traits

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.280
that you want, in the long
run, to see your children have,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.010
and then use that to guide you.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.190
So I'm going to talk about three
different chapters in the book.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.790
I just pulled them
out-- not randomly,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.370
but they're not in
any particular order.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.000
The first one is from
Week 23, and the chapter

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.780
is called "Who's in Charge?"

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.105
So I often hear
parents use the phrase,

00:11:57.105 --> 00:12:02.540
"my child won't let
me blank." my son

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.870
won't wear anything but
the latest Nike sneakers

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.670
or my child won't let
me come on field trips

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.329
as a parent chaperone,
or my daughter won't

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.870
have her birthday
party anywhere else

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.630
but where Sally had
her birthday party.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.670
But you can hear how those
words, "my child well let me,"

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.260
that phrase, in front
of anything else,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.130
is really a reversal
of authority.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.200
So you may have heard also of
three styles of parenting--

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.120
the permissive style of
parenting, where there are

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.990
few rules or, if
there are rules,

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.040
they're not enforced well.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.790
There's the authoritarian
style of parenting,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.770
where there are very strict
rules that are enforced harshly

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.480
with punishment and no
explanation of those rules.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.740
And then there's authoritative.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.810
So authoritarian is the
military-type style,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.880
and then authoritative
is sort of

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.380
halfway in between--
it's in the middle

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.220
between permissive
and authoritarian.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.850
And authoritative
parenting is when

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.060
there are clear rules, where
there are clear consequences.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.000
There's an understanding by
the child of why the rule is

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.470
in place and there's also
a lot of positive feedback.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.360
So going back to this idea
of "my child won't let me."

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.630
When we hear ourselves saying
that or using that phrase,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.390
we've fallen into the
permissive style of parenting.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.820
And, by the way, there
is a fourth style

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.730
of parenting called
uninvolved parenting,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.146
but I'm assuming none of you
are that because you're here.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.810
So I won't even talk about that.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.640
But why it's not a
good thing to fall

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.440
in to that permissive
type of parenting

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.020
is that children have a
huge need for security.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.715
Other than their basic
needs of food and clothing

00:13:49.715 --> 00:13:53.390
and shelter and our love, is
one of their biggest needs.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:57.760
And being in charge is actually
really scary for children.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.500
Even though at the moment
they may be convincing you

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.620
that they want to be in charge,
it's not healthy for them,

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.300
and it's very scary for them.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.300
And often it can lead to anger.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.602
So when you see
children who are angry,

00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:12.310
who seem to have a
lot of anger problems,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.790
it's often because
they had been parented

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.940
in a very permissive style.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.398
And they really
just wanted someone

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:21.130
to tell them right and wrong
and where the boundaries were.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.310
Parents do not need
to get permission

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.480
from their children
for decisions

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.920
that parents should
be making themselves.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.550
And it's not good for children,
because they look to us

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.160
to provide that
structure and guidelines.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.660
I do believe in--
and I believe this

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:42.330
very strongly-- in respecting
children's ideas and opinions.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.040
But it's really
important to not let

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.080
a child's request and
opinion about something

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.070
override your good
judgment or your values.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.960
So what happens when you
give in to a child who's

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.950
in charge of you is that
you not only give in

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.970
to the child's demands and maybe
forgo you're good judgment,

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.364
but you also miss an
opportunity to teach a lesson.

00:15:08.364 --> 00:15:09.780
And that goes back
to the lesson I

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.190
was talking about what
traits you want to instill.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.960
Here are some ways we let
our children be in charge.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.100
We let them give us orders.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.250
We let them negotiate us out
of our rules or decisions.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.090
We let them manipulate
us, like, oh, I'll

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.510
promise I'll only
do it this once.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.480
They use the other example
of the other parent--

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.100
but Daddy lets me do this,
or Mommy lets me do this.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.670
Or sometimes they use other
families or other children

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.940
to sway you.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.440
Jenny's parents let her stay
until 11:00, or whatever it is.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.090
Or they might use comments
like, all my friends do it.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.200
Everyone has one.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.087
So it's important
that you listen

00:15:48.087 --> 00:15:50.670
to your children's opinions or
their ideas about these things,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.180
but not to be swayed by
what other families do

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.239
or what your child
says other children do.

00:15:57.239 --> 00:15:58.280
You can say, that's fine.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.660
That's what their family
does, but we do it this way.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.360
So if you feel like you've
given up some parental control

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.670
in that area, I encourage you to
take a week and focus on that.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.380
Remember that kids
are really inclined

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.209
to test parental authority,
and that being in charge,

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:18.750
in the long run,
it's scary for them,

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.520
and they're much
happier in the long run

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.780
if you give them that comfort
and security of sticking

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.530
to your guns.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.450
Is this ringing true for
anybody here, this idea

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.520
of "my child won't let me"?

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.022
So the second point I'd like to
talk about is in Chapter Three.

00:16:37.022 --> 00:16:38.980
I put this one right near
the front of the book

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:45.194
because I feel like it's such
a prevalent thing right now--

00:16:45.194 --> 00:16:46.610
and maybe it has
been for a while.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.130
But the name of this
chapter is "Don't

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.586
Ask When you Mean to Tell."

00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:53.960
This is a very
common occurrence.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.310
I'm not sure why it's
become so common.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.050
But we, as parents, have
fallen into the trap

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.790
of asking our children to do
things that we want them to do

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.359
or that they need to do, that
they don't have a choice about.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.680
So instead of saying
something like,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.020
it's time to put on
your coat, we say,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.050
Jane, can you put
on your coat now?

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.990
Or, put on your coat, OK, Jane?

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.990
And when we say it with a
question, a question mark

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.480
or an OK at the end, that's
what our child hears.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.210
They hear that
they have a choice.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.610
And that does include
tacking on the word "OK."

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.460
Maybe we do that in the effort
of being polite or nice,

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.120
wanting our children to like us.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.520
But what it does is it
confuses our children.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.310
We need to let them know
what's required and what isn't.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.884
So conversely of that,
it's important to also

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:47.300
not to tell your child to do
something if you don't really

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.790
mean and you're not
going to follow through.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.400
So you give an
instruction-- stop

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.190
bouncing that ball in the house.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.610
And the child continues
to do it and then

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.010
you get distracted by
something else-- the phone

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.280
or talking to someone else--
and they continue to do it.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.680
And then you need
to make dinner.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.620
It's, you know, it
really doesn't matter.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.390
I'm just going to let
them bounce the ball.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.890
It's easier.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.410
They'll stop in a little while.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.430
And your child continues
until they're done with it,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.930
and now what have they learned?

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.471
They've learned that
your words don't

00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:15.850
have weight, that what you
said you didn't really mean.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.700
And so that's exactly it.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.360
Our children need to know
that our words have weight

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.820
and that they can
trust what we say.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.730
So when I hear parents
say-- and I hear this a lot.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.030
When I hear parents say, "my
children never listen to me."

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.610
What that tells
me is it's usually

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.950
because the children have
learned that their words don't

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.910
have true meaning,
and they've gotten

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.420
used to tuning their parents
out because often there's

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.470
no consequence if they
tune their parent out.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.370
So my advice-- and
I give some steps

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.360
for following this in the
book, in that chapter--

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.270
is to first be really
clear in your mind

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.510
before something comes out your
mouth about whether the child

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.060
has a choice.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.140
I actually heard parents say
to a child who is running out

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.350
in a street in New York City.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.520
Their child was about to run off
the curb, and she said, Jason,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.370
can you not run off the
curb into the street?

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.490
And when we fall into
the habit of doing that,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.050
if you listen to yourself,
it's important to know

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.910
whether you're using
a question or not.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.010
And so if you, in your
mind, know for certain

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.940
that you're going to want
you child to do something,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.640
then say, it's time
to do this, or we're

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.810
going to do this now,
or please do this.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.085
But don't have your voice
go up like a question.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.910
And so that can really
shift things around.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.540
And that, in conjunction,
with using consequences

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.850
and following through if the
child doesn't do what you've

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.917
asked them to do will
really make a difference.

00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:47.750
And you can find that
your child will really

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.050
start to listen to
what you say, and you

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.980
won't be saying "my child never
listens to me" because they

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.670
know that your words have weight
and that you follow through

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.961
and that you mean what you say.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.430
So thirdly, I'd to talk
about a chapter called

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.690
"Everything in Moderation."

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.690
And this goes back to
that trait that I told you

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.910
that was very important for
my husband and I. We felt

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.460
like this was
something we wanted

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.170
to instill in our children.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.980
So we know that babies
are born without an ounce

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.030
of self-control.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.780
Kids start as infants with the
notion of grabbing anything

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.130
they want and when they
want and what they want.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.730
This is a really
natural urge, and it's

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.760
developed from aeons of
evolution in all animals.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.160
And it shows up in
the everyday thinking

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.890
and natural inclinations
of all kids.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.300
Kids only slowly start
to shed this notion

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.920
of self-entitlement.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.760
However, babies can begin to
develop self-soothing withing

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.470
the first year-- the
beginnings of self-control.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.290
And it's our job to
continue to develop

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.370
that self-control
and those skills.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.470
So in today's world,
what's the downside

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.976
of lacking self-control?

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:03.350
Some of you have probably
heard of the famous marshmallow

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.630
study, which was done here,
at Stanford University,

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.910
in the 1960s.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.202
The people who conducted the
study-- the person's name

00:21:13.202 --> 00:21:14.000
was Walter Mischel.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.960
It began in the late 1960s.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.940
What he did was he
took 200 children

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.610
and individually put them
in a room with a marshmallow

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:27.114
on a plate and told them that if
they didn't eat the marshmallow

00:21:27.114 --> 00:21:29.530
for a certain length of time,
or something like five or 10

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.590
minutes, that they could get
two marshmallows instead.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.600
And what happened was
that some of the children

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.330
ate the marshmallow
immediately, couldn't resist,

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.050
and some children did
not eat the marshmallow

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.790
and were able to wait.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.210
And the children who didn't
eat the marshmallow often

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.919
had some sort of strategy.

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:51.210
Some of them closed their eyes.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.540
Some of them sang songs.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.960
Some of them did a little dance.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.390
Some kids turned around.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.300
You see them doing this-- really
using all sorts of strategies

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.750
that they can to not
eat the marshmallow.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.069
But they had some way of
controlling their urge.

00:22:06.069 --> 00:22:08.110
And what the study found
was that 10 years later,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.940
the youngsters who showed
restraint as four-year-olds

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.740
were doing better in school,
had superior relationships

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.500
with their peers, and managed
stress much more successfully

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.040
than those who were unable
to exercise restraint.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.380
And they have continued.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.838
I think they're still following
these subjects, who are now

00:22:24.838 --> 00:22:26.604
in their 50s, and
it has been shown

00:22:26.604 --> 00:22:28.270
that the effects have
been long-lasting.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.850
Even more recent research
shows that self-control

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:39.124
is more strongly associated
with success in school than IQ.

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.540
And other studies show that
self-control not only produces

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.490
better behaved, better adjusted,
and morally-oriented kids,

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.386
but it also produces people
who are just happier overall.

00:22:48.386 --> 00:22:50.510
So that part of the brain
that I was talking about,

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.530
the prefrontal cortex,
which is a work in progress,

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.300
is not develop really
fully until the 20s.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.650
So we might be inclined
to think there's not

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.650
much we can do about it.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.680
But really, you set the
stage for that self-control

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.080
and learning those skills
when they're young.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.700
And there's a real
opportunity when

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.115
they're young to have
influence over that.

00:23:09.115 --> 00:23:13.580
So where does self-control
show up in our behavior?

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.980
It shows up in the way we
control our words-- not

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.720
always saying
what's on our mind.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.250
It shows up in controlling
physical actions.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:27.220
It shows up in showing patience,
appreciation for what one has,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.990
eating properly,
being able to cope

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.650
with not getting
everything one wants.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.770
This is a big one for
kids-- learning that.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.930
Conserving resources, being
able to resist temptations,

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:42.330
making the best of what
one has and not whining.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.950
I'm sure no one has kids
who whine here, right?

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.140
Taking turns,
appreciating what one has.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.590
And here's something
really important.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.750
When your kids become tweens and
teens, having some self-control

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.590
and some strategies
for inhibiting urges

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.080
really helps them
in not succumbing

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.630
to the bad influences of others.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.180
So here are five
things you can do

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.006
to help your child
develop self-control.

00:24:11.006 --> 00:24:12.630
First and foremost--
and this is really

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.980
the most important-- is
to model it yourself.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.439
And that goes with almost
all behaviors, is modeling.

00:24:18.439 --> 00:24:20.980
Keeping an appropriate volume,
choosing your words carefully,

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.909
showing patience,
conserving materials,

00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:25.450
and a really important
one is showing

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.480
how you deal with
stress and frustration.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.760
So you're about to leave
the house in the morning.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.340
I know what it's like.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.370
It's chaotic in the morning.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.494
And you're trying to leave.

00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:35.600
You can't find your keys
and you start to get tense.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.220
Your voice starts to rise.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.470
And what you can do is to
model for your children--

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.830
Mommy's really upset right now.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.640
I'm going to take a deep breath,
and I'm going to count to 10.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.884
Let's count together.

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:47.550
And when I feel more
relaxed, then we'll

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.530
be able to look for my
keys together and solve

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.570
this problem.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.280
And when you model that
kind of self-control,

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.110
your kids really pick up on it.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.030
Secondly, you can create
real scenarios for your kids

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.480
to start to exercise a
little bit of self-control,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.090
and that's waiting, sharing,
cooperating, giving feedback

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.190
to each other.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.870
One of the examples
that I love to use

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.020
and I used a lot
with my children

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.530
was I used to cook
with my children a lot,

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.540
bake with them a lot,
when they were a little.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.110
And there's so
many opportunities

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.180
for having to wait or
measure something or take

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.820
turns with another child.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.610
So let's say you
have two children

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.564
and they're at the
table, and they both

00:25:21.564 --> 00:25:22.480
want to do the mixing.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.500
But there's only one
spoon to mix with.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.932
So one child is mixing.

00:25:25.932 --> 00:25:28.140
And you give the other child
the strategy of waiting.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.210
Maybe you sing a verse of "Old
McDonald" while you're waiting,

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.543
or maybe you count if the
child's learning how to count.

00:25:32.543 --> 00:25:34.212
But you give them a
strategy for waiting

00:25:34.212 --> 00:25:35.920
for that limited amount
of time, and then

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.600
they see that it's their
turn, and then you reverse it

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.016
and the other child
gets a chance.

00:25:39.016 --> 00:25:42.760
It's a perfect opportunity to
teach self-control and sharing,

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.000
and you can use that
kind of strategy.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.350
The caveat for that about
teaching self-control-- and I

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.690
want to be really
clear about this.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.210
It's very important
that these strategies

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.150
be used in an
age-appropriate manner.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:02.380
So parents tend to overestimate
their children's ability

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.495
to wait and do nothing
for long periods of time.

00:26:05.495 --> 00:26:07.370
And actually, a lot of
children's misbehavior

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:08.760
is just out of boredom.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.240
So you want to
make sure that you

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.980
don't have a two-year-old
sit there and be expected

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.060
to wait quietly and do
nothing for 15 minutes.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.960
It's just not going to happen.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.890
But you can give them
strategies for waiting

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.090
for short periods of time
or not interrupting you

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.090
immediately-- that
kind of thing.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.890
Also, I'm not
talking about babies.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.690
I'm not talking
about newborns here.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.680
Newborns need to have their
needs met immediately in order

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.190
to feel secure and to
develop that secure bond

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.120
with their parent.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.094
So breastfeeding on demand and
holding and cuddling your child

00:26:39.094 --> 00:26:40.510
and responding to
them immediately

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.910
is really important.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:47.780
And so I'm not talking about
keeping a newborn waiting.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.810
A third way we teach our
children self-control

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.440
is to find examples in real life
of people exhibiting control--

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.815
reading books
about self-control,

00:26:53.815 --> 00:26:55.640
like "Lilly's Plastic Purse."

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.060
Dr. Seuss has lots of
great books about it.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.110
A fourth way is to do community
service with your children.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.480
It really helps them to
appreciate what they have.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.730
And there are lots of great
community service projects

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.630
you can do with young children.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.090
You can have them make
cards for elderly people.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.890
You can work to help
clean up a playground.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.930
And you can change those kind
of community service projects

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.580
as they get older to be
more appropriate for the age

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.410
that they're at, but
showing your children

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.930
what it's like to
do for someone else

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.830
or someone who doesn't have
as much as they have or needs

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.250
something gives them a greater
feeling of appreciation

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.610
for what they have.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.880
And finally, I really think it's
important to teach your child

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.720
the difference between
needing and wanting.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.149
So you hear your child "I
need this." "I need this."

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:49.440
It's really important to
clarify to them the difference

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.773
between things that they need
and things that they want,

00:27:51.773 --> 00:27:54.330
and not that things that they
want are invalid to want,

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.980
but that they understand
the difference.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.190
So I'm going to read
a little something

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.210
that my daughter wrote.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.090
My daughter is my
third child, and this

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.370
is something she wrote I
think when she was maybe

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.930
in sixth grade or something.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.450
This is from Shoshanna.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.650
"There was an American
Girl doll named Josephina."

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.750
Everybody here knows
about American Girl dolls?

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.650
If you have a child that's old
enough, or if you have a girl.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.377
They're really
expensive and you get

00:28:25.377 --> 00:28:27.835
into a whole thing with American
Girl dolls if you buy one.

00:28:27.835 --> 00:28:30.610
"But there was an American
Girl doll named Josephina

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.810
that I really wanted
for Hanukkah the year

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.872
that I was about to turn seven.

00:28:34.872 --> 00:28:37.080
It wasn't just one of the
interests that come and go.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.910
I was really in
love with this doll.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.690
I kept telling Mom I needed
her-- I needed Josephina.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.330
And this is always
launch Mom or Dad

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.140
into a speech about
what needing really was.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.360
But I kept insisting
that I needed her,

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.210
and because I couldn't learn
to say that I wanted her,

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.450
I didn't get her for
Hanukkah that year.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.940
I was horrified.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.570
I tried to show appreciation
for the gifts that I got anyway,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.635
and life went on.

00:29:04.635 --> 00:29:09.830
And then once I realized that
life went on, I told my mom.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:10.779
I said, you know what?

00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:11.320
Life went on.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.170
I didn't get Josephina.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.280
I guess I didn't need her.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.500
And Josephina was my
seventh birthday present."

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.870
So you can see that there's
opportunities to teach children

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.720
the difference, and that it
will make an impact on them.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.490
And I think it's one
of the greatest gifts

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.530
that we can give
to our children.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.472
So before I get
to questions, I'll

00:29:38.472 --> 00:29:40.180
tell one more stories
about self-control,

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.460
and then I'll finish up here.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.870
This was with my
youngest son, Lev.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.720
And he was in
preschool at the time.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.292
And he was very
mathematically-oriented,

00:29:50.292 --> 00:29:52.000
and he knew how to
count pretty early on.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.250
And we used to play this game.

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.130
It was a Thomas the
Tank Engine game,

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.114
and it had different
sized puzzle pieces

00:29:57.114 --> 00:29:59.530
with different numbers on them,
and the bigger the number,

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.404
the bigger the piece.

00:30:00.404 --> 00:30:03.630
And you were trying to put the
sized pieces in the right place

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.230
in your puzzle and
finish your train.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.800
If you finished your train
and completed your train first

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.190
you won the game.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.815
So there was one piece that was
the number five, the largest

00:30:12.815 --> 00:30:14.440
number, and that was
the biggest piece.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.555
And if you got the
number five, you

00:30:15.555 --> 00:30:17.360
were probably going
to win the game.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.640
So he had his friend Rachel
over for a play date,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.280
and they were playing this game.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.630
And right off the bat,
she spins number five.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.310
And Lev looks up at me
with this look of horror.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.020
He knows this is not good.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.064
And I just sort of
smiled at him and sort of

00:30:34.064 --> 00:30:36.230
nodded, because we had
talked about this-- that when

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.688
he played games
with other children

00:30:37.688 --> 00:30:39.270
that you need to
play by the rules.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.490
And he knew.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.320
And tears are starting
to well up in his eyes.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.220
He's about to be
overcome by the fact

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.200
that he's not going to
get the number five.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.120
And I see him sort of
take a deep breath.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.827
And he took the number five
and he handed it to Rachel,

00:30:54.827 --> 00:30:55.910
and then he took his turn.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.700
And then he looked up at me and
he said, I got myself together.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:06.050
So it is something that you can
teach in age-appropriate ways.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:09.630
So just to conclude, I've talked
about three of the chapters

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.900
in the book.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.370
There are many,
many other topics.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.470
In fact, there are 52.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.760
They deal with picky
eating, sleep, separation,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.750
extracurricular activities,
sibling relationships,

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.370
which is a really big topic.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.000
And each chapter covers just
one topic to think about.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.600
And I encourage
parents to really

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.510
self-reflect with some questions
at the end of the chapter

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.550
and then to look at
that checklist of things

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.660
at the very end of chapter
that will give them

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.410
things to think about
throughout the week,

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.170
or however long it
takes for that strategy

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.180
to become a habit.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.250
I'd like to summarize
by saying that parenting

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.570
is one of the most
challenging and important jobs

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.560
that we have.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.380
We're taught how to write.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.422
We're taught how to read.

00:31:52.422 --> 00:31:54.255
But most people aren't
taught how to parent,

00:31:54.255 --> 00:31:55.950
and we're expected
to know how to do it.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.570
But good parenting
isn't all instinct.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.912
Some of it's instinct,
yes, but not all of it.

00:32:00.912 --> 00:32:03.370
And part of being a good parent
is learning about parenting

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.940
and working at it.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.240
It is possible to raise kids
who are respectful and kind

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.370
and engaged members
of the community.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:11.980
I've done it.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.140
In fact, I think my kids
are my best advertisement.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.410
And I want to leave
with those two ideas

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.920
that I said originally,
which are running

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.400
throughout the book, and that
is that how you parent really

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.630
does matter.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.092
And see yourself on a
journey, a parenting journey.

00:32:28.092 --> 00:32:30.550
It's a journey of hard work,
but it's also a journey of joy

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.270
as you see the results.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.370
And secondly, this idea of
parenting with intention.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.900
I encourage you to think
about what kind of person

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.410
you want your child to be, and
then to parents accordingly

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.220
and make decisions
based on that.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.760
Trust me, the hard work
that you put in now

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.250
will pay off in the end, and
it will pay off big time.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.520
Thank you so much.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.810
I'm happy to take questions.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.850
AUDIENCE: I have
two-and-a-half-year-old twins,

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.666
one of whom has much better
language skills than the other.

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:01.040
And I'm curious
if you could talk

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.670
a little bit about
the transition

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.610
from teaching lessons
through showing,

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.670
or just modeling behavior, to
having the advantage of being

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:13.690
able to tell and explain.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.710
So just to talk a little bit
about age-appropriate teaching,

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.222
particularly, selfishly,
for me at the--

00:33:20.222 --> 00:33:21.680
MEG AKABAS: How
old are they again?

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.110
AUDIENCE: Two and a half.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.690
MEG AKABAS: Two and a half.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.210
Right.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.790
So, yeah.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.620
A lot of it is modeling
at the beginning,

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.547
but also you can
start with stories.

00:33:28.547 --> 00:33:30.880
That's the best place to
start, really, with young kids.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.470
So start to tell stories
with the dolls or the animals

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.080
or whatever, your characters,
or even just vocal

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.040
stories about situations
that sort of impart

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.810
the lessons that
you want to teach.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.770
Because lecturing and explaining
the big moral of consequences

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.610
of things isn't going
to really go with

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.080
a two-and-a-half-year-old.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.770
But there are a lot
of opportunities

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.780
to work into stories and
books that you choose,

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.250
finding things that teach those
lessons you want to learn.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.750
So I would really
encourage being

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.430
creative with storytelling.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.290
It's the perfect way
to teach lessons.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.010
Yes.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.930
AUDIENCE: So I have two
girls, eight and 11.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:10.480
And my challenge with
my older daughter

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.980
is starting-- I think she's
in those preteen years

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.210
where she's started
to push boundaries.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:18.920
And I can be the best and the
worst mother in the same day.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.820
And, of course, there are
other people's parents

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.920
who let them do things.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.350
And we try our best to say
that we are responsible for you

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.391
as parents, and not them.

00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:28.280
And they will do what's
best with their kids.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.649
But that doesn't always kind of
seem to strike the right chord.

00:34:32.649 --> 00:34:34.190
Are there any ways
that I can kind of

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.360
help her realize that the
decisions we take that

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.770
may not seem like the most
probably popular decisions,

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.340
but they're kind of good
for her in the long term?

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.710
MEG AKABAS: And do you
explain the reasons

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.070
behind it, what values
you're trying to impart?

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.699
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.667
For the simple reason--
let me give an example.

00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:56.833
Both my kids are in the
habit of saying when they're

00:34:56.833 --> 00:34:59.310
hungry that "I'm
starving." and some of it

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.960
really is to upset
me, because I don't

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.840
think they know
what starving is.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.810
So I kind of vent.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.370
I was really upset,
and I actually

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.930
showed them YouTube videos
of what starving means

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:15.170
and how kids do starve
and what it actually is.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.590
And of course the result was
that they started crying,

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.423
and they told me that,
why would I show them

00:35:19.423 --> 00:35:21.860
such horrible things
and it was so mean.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.460
But I wanted them to understand
that they could tell me

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.420
that, Mom, I'm hungry.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.160
But don't use the term
starving because it's actually

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.490
a problem [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.330
And I think they understood
it for all of one week,

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.263
and then it was kind of
back to the same old,

00:35:34.263 --> 00:35:35.513
you know, I'm really starving.

00:35:35.513 --> 00:35:36.888
Can you give me
something to eat?

00:35:36.888 --> 00:35:37.645
I can't wait.

00:35:37.645 --> 00:35:38.700
I can't wait.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.810
And just kind of, you
know-- the sustenance

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.450
doesn't seem to be there.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:49.070
MEG AKABAS: So part of some
of the strategies that run

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.730
in the book are about
belief follows behavior.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.260
And some of it is
just about doing.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.290
Like, they may not
understand it now,

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:59.650
or they may have understood
it briefly but they forget it.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:04.770
But if you do something enough,
you begin to believe it.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.650
So if you require your
children to say to you,

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.924
"I'm hungry right now; I
want something to eat,"

00:36:09.924 --> 00:36:12.590
instead of "I'm starving" before
you give them something to eat,

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.220
they will start to learn
that they need to just say

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.380
I'm hungry or I'd really
like something to eat.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.520
So they'll start to
have that behavior.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.180
And when you have a
behavior over time,

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.080
you start to believe it.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.100
And then maybe
eventually they'll

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.516
start to really
understand deeply,

00:36:23.516 --> 00:36:26.910
or you'll come across people
who really are starving again.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.980
But part of it is just
having them do it.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.084
So you want to
have consequences.

00:36:32.084 --> 00:36:34.000
I mean, they're teenagers,
and the consequence

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.840
for them coming in and saying
"I'm starving" is you say,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.005
I don't respond to that.

00:36:39.005 --> 00:36:40.880
Is there something that
you wanted to ask me?

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.220
Is there something that's
real that you want to tell me?

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.910
And they'll say, you know, I'd
really like something to eat.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:46.410
Oh.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.670
You want something to eat.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.169
Sure.

00:36:48.169 --> 00:36:49.810
I'm happy to get you
something to eat.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.910
And that works with
whining, by the way-- when

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:56.211
children whine and they
come to you, "I'm hungry."

00:36:56.211 --> 00:36:57.960
Well, when you respond
to that with, sure,

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.710
what do you want to eat?

00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:59.835
What are you teaching them?

00:36:59.835 --> 00:37:01.090
You're teaching them to whine.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.820
And if you say to them,
I didn't hear a question.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.580
Is there a question
you wanted to ask me?

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.390
I'm hungry.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.849
That doesn't sound
like a question.

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:09.431
If there's something
you want from me,

00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:10.730
I'm here when you want it.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:11.840
I'd like something to eat.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.090
Oh, you want something to eat.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.006
We have plenty to eat.

00:37:14.006 --> 00:37:15.575
What would you like?

00:37:15.575 --> 00:37:16.950
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.434
I have two boys and two girls.

00:37:18.434 --> 00:37:19.850
And what I'm finding
is, the boys,

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.600
they get along pretty well with
each other, and girls also.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.970
But they fight like crazy,
the boys between the girls.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:25.600
MEG AKABAS: You mean the boys
and the girls fight each other.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.250
AUDIENCE: And so
I'm wondering if you

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.420
could talk about some
strategies for that.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.420
MEG AKABAS: That's a
really good question.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.660
Sibling relationship is
one of my favorite topics.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.760
I happen to have four
children who adore each other

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.719
and treat each other with
such respect and kindness.

00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:40.010
It is the great joy of my life.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:42.500
So I have three boys and a girl.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.380
And I have a couple
of strategies.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.290
The main one I
would say for you--

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.415
which has to do with you
saying that they get along

00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:52.130
with each other in pairs,
but not with each other--

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.769
is to find some things that they
can cooperate on all together,

00:37:54.769 --> 00:37:56.810
something positive that
they can all do together.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.397
And that could be a
production of a-- I

00:37:58.397 --> 00:37:59.563
don't know how old they are.

00:37:59.563 --> 00:38:01.289
But it could be
getting a show together

00:38:01.289 --> 00:38:03.080
to present when they
go to Grandma's house.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.540
Or it could be a
community service project

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.960
that they're doing together.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.940
Get them to cooperate
positively on something

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.980
that they enjoy doing or
that they can enjoy doing,

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.290
and that will get them
working in tandem.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.080
They'll get to see that they
enjoy each other's company.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.542
The other thing-- and
I give some strategies

00:38:23.542 --> 00:38:24.500
about that in the book.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.930
Because it has something to
do with ages, and sometimes

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.894
it's one child teaching
a child another thing

00:38:29.894 --> 00:38:31.560
or having a hobby
that they do together.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.462
But try to pair them up in
ways where they're not always

00:38:34.462 --> 00:38:36.170
paired up the two
girls and the two boys.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:37.959
So one of the
girls, you might be

00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:40.500
able to find an interests that
they have with one of the boys

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.666
that they could do together.

00:38:41.666 --> 00:38:44.084
Tal did scuba diving
training with my daughter,

00:38:44.084 --> 00:38:45.750
and that was something
that they learned

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.708
how to do together that
they still do together.

00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:50.680
So trying to find something
that they can cooperate on

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.079
across the sexes
there, I would say.

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:55.870
For parents who have
children who just say,

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.129
you know, my kids are
really competitive

00:38:59.129 --> 00:39:00.420
and have trouble getting along.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.840
One of the best anecdotes
for sibling rivalry

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.960
is individual attention.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.460
But that's not to
solve your problem

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.420
in terms of children getting
along with each other

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.461
that you want them to do.

00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:12.690
But in terms of
competition, that's

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.470
a big strategy-- is
to make sure you're

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:18.690
carving out individual time
with each parent for each child,

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.870
either on a daily basis, small,
or on a weekly basis, a little

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.470
larger, or on a monthly
basis, a full day

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.080
alone with that parent.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.970
Individual attention is key
to help sibling rivalry.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.461
That was a really good question.

00:39:32.461 --> 00:39:32.960
Thanks.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.501
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:36.060
I have a 20-month-old.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.295
And actually just this weekend,
we took her to-- well, it

00:39:39.295 --> 00:39:41.460
as Mother's Day
weekend, so we went

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.080
to a pretty nice restaurant.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.720
And I had a little
debate with my husband.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.090
I thought it was OK
for her to walk around

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.950
in an area that's kind of quiet
in the restaurant, like closer

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.415
to the bathroom area.

00:39:55.415 --> 00:39:56.996
Because she's one
and a half, and she

00:39:56.996 --> 00:40:00.320
had to sit there for like,
two, close to three hours.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.350
And that's really tough.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:07.600
But then my husband did not my
baby to walk around by herself.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.390
Like, he wanted to hold
her hands at all time

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.810
while he was walking.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.310
But then I felt like
that's too much constraint

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.680
on a one-and-a-half-year-old,
essentially.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.770
I'm wondering what
are your thoughts?

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.830
But then his idea
was it's not safe

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.800
for her to walk in a restaurant.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.430
And she doesn't know
that this area's safe

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.540
versus a normal
crowded restaurant.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.780
So he wanted to have an
idea that if it's indoor,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:35.840
you hold hands with us.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.284
If it's outdoor, then it's
OK to walk by yourself.

00:40:39.284 --> 00:40:40.950
I'm just curious what
are your thoughts?

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.270
MEG AKABAS: Right,
and then sometimes

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.070
outdoor is not OK to be
walking without hands.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.210
It depends on the situation.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.790
It's hard for me to say in
that particular situation.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:47.960
I don't know how the
restaurant was situated,

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.084
where the kitchen was, were
there dangerous things,

00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:51.139
were there other people.

00:40:51.139 --> 00:40:52.930
So I'm going to speak
in general about when

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.550
you have a disagreement
with your spouse,

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.990
because this is
a big topic also.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:01.750
I see some people smiling.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.650
The first thing is--
and I don't know

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.200
how relevant this was in
this particular situation--

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.860
is to try not to undermine
each other, to try not to have

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.680
that disagreement in
front of your child.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.670
So go with one parent
and stick with it,

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:15.450
and then you can
talk about it later

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:16.824
and try to figure
out what you're

00:41:16.824 --> 00:41:19.820
going to do in future situations
when something like this

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.320
comes up.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.320
So now you have this
opportunity to talk about it.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.903
And, in general,
what I say if there's

00:41:23.903 --> 00:41:26.620
a real conflict between
doing one thing or the other,

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.610
to choose the one that has
the least danger of going bad,

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.580
of being detrimental to
the child or the child's

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.610
development.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.870
So in this case, he's
worried about safety.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.620
I don't know how
unsafe that was.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.730
But that's probably
a valid concern.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.900
And it seems like that
would be the choice

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.390
to go with, because
it's the least

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.640
risk of doing something wrong.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.970
Like being over-safe,
not so bad.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.360
Being unsafe, bad.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.160
So you could decide
ahead of time

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.951
that when you're in
situations where you're

00:41:56.951 --> 00:41:59.350
undecided about whether she
needs to be holding someone's

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.580
hand or not, that you're going
to err on the side of safety.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.080
And that would be something you
would have to compromise on.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.621
And maybe you'll be
able to work over

00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:09.377
time discussing with him
outside of the earshot of her

00:42:09.377 --> 00:42:11.710
whether she's able to develop
a little more independence

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.427
in situations like that.

00:42:13.427 --> 00:42:15.760
The other thing I would say
is if you're in restaurants,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.490
it's really important to
bring activities for the kids

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:18.420
to do at the table.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.420
And I know that's hard
with a baby or a toddler.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.760
They want to move around.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.140
But bringing lots
of books, bringing

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.290
lots of just something--
little toys to play with,

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:29.280
characters you can tell stories.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.930
So many parents
complain about kids

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.100
misbehaving in restaurants.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.330
It's really hard for a kid
to sit with nothing to do.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.440
Kids just don't sit and talk.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.800
That's just not
something they do,

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.340
even if they are
at the age to talk.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.100
It's not an activity for them.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.850
So bring things for them
to keep them occupied,

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.681
either with each
other or by themselves

00:42:44.681 --> 00:42:46.680
or one parent reads while
the other parent talks

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.340
to the other person
that you're with so

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:52.680
that you don't really have an
issue with a child misbehaving.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.810
But if you want to
let her roam around

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.400
and you feel like you're
in disagreement about how

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.680
much control to
have over that, I

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.170
would always err on
the side of the parent

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:07.245
with the least detrimental
effect of going wrong.

00:43:07.245 --> 00:43:08.620
I'll give you an
example of this.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.250
My husband and I
had a disagreement

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.860
about whether-- we have
a rule in our family--

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.611
no physical force.

00:43:14.611 --> 00:43:16.568
The only sort of physical
touching that goes on

00:43:16.568 --> 00:43:17.710
is affectionate touching.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.340
That includes elbowing,
tickling, nudging, nothing.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.654
There's only kind touching in
our house, affection, hugs.

00:43:25.654 --> 00:43:27.820
My husband wanted to play
sword fights with the kids

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.870
when they were young,
because that's what he did.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.637
And we don't have any
weapons in our house, either.

00:43:32.637 --> 00:43:34.470
And so he wanted to do
the rolled up swords.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.040
And so we had a thing
about whether or not

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.610
sword fights were OK.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.484
And we just couldn't
agree on it.

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:42.150
My husband's a pretty
nonviolent person,

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.000
but he really thought
this was a great idea.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.950
And I just thought
it was always going

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.800
to lead to someone
being unhappy.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.710
So we had a big talk
about it, and we

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.430
decided that the decision
that would have the least

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.634
risk of having a
detrimental effect

00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:55.800
was not having sword fights.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.770
Like, that's OK-- kids
don't have sword fights.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.550
And we invented some
other game with nets

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:03.150
and stuffed animals that was
really fun that the kids liked.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.490
And that was how we
resolved that issue.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.540
AUDIENCE: What are your
thoughts on screen time?

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.160
Google has YouTube,
which is quite popular.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.350
So we have a 19-month-old.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.560
So we really don't put
him in front of television

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.400
that much-- sometimes
on and off on YouTube.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.954
But generally, it's an
ongoing trend, right?

00:44:21.954 --> 00:44:22.870
You see it a lot more.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:23.160
MEG AKABAS: Yeah.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.243
It's a really big problem.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.180
And, believe me, I'm not
anti-technology or screen time

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:34.150
for kids at all, but
under the age of two,

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.240
it's been shown to really
not be a good thing.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.300
Kids really only learn
and need to learn

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.530
about the world around them
and to develop emotionally well

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.819
by interacting with
a real, live person.

00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:50.360
And the more time they spend in
front of the screen, the less

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.680
time they're doing that.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:57.250
So the Pediatric Association
advises no screen time

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.050
under the age of two, and
then in small increments.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.223
You could have a half an hour
a day of watching Sesame Street

00:45:03.223 --> 00:45:09.590
or using some educational video.

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:16.625
And just be really careful
to keep your guidelines.

00:45:16.625 --> 00:45:17.750
Make a decision about them.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:18.160
Say, OK.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.570
I think an hour
feels about right.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.400
They're at this age.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.275
It feels about right.

00:45:21.275 --> 00:45:22.420
And then stick to it.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:27.509
And then also to be very
good about interacting

00:45:27.509 --> 00:45:29.050
with them sometimes
during that time.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.383
Sometimes it's a good activity
to have them do something

00:45:31.383 --> 00:45:33.930
alone, but it's
also an opportunity

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.270
to do something with them--
so watching something

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.280
together or playing a
video game together.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.370
Make it part of the
interaction as they get older

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.375
so that it's not
they're isolated

00:45:42.375 --> 00:45:46.321
with a screen with no
interaction in the family.

00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:48.195
AUDIENCE: What if it's
puzzles on the tablet?

00:45:48.195 --> 00:45:48.903
MEG AKABAS: Yeah.

00:45:48.903 --> 00:45:49.810
I mean, that's great.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.790
And my kids played a lot
of educational-- back

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:54.560
in the day it was
just computer games.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.310
That's all we had.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.435
We didn't have video games.

00:45:56.435 --> 00:45:59.770
But computer games,
educational puzzles

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:01.420
that they do
individually-- it's great.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:05.110
But just have it be a
certain amount of time.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.710
And you could have the rule
that it's only on weekends,

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.300
or on school days, it's only a
half an hour as they get older.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.050
And constantly be developing
that depending on their age,

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.360
and then just be very
consistent with it.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.680
But under the age of two,
it's really not recommended.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.220
There's certain
very limited amounts

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.605
of times where it's helpful
to have a child be engaged

00:46:27.605 --> 00:46:29.355
with something else
for a moment while you

00:46:29.355 --> 00:46:31.210
do something important
that's short.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:32.480
That's OK.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.150
But otherwise, making it a
habit and part of their daily

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:37.215
activities, not so good.

00:46:37.215 --> 00:46:39.090
AUDIENCE: On an earlier
one of your responses

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.509
related to kids whining--

00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:43.550
MEG AKABAS: Kids whining.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.010
Yes.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:48.191
AUDIENCE: I think for an older
kid, like seven, 10-year-old,

00:46:48.191 --> 00:46:49.690
it's a little easier
to communicate.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.935
At least they understand
what you're saying.

00:46:51.935 --> 00:46:53.810
My daughter's about two
and a half right now.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.880
How do you deal with
kids [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.290
at that age, their whining?

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.180
When they want something,
instead of-- they

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.411
just whine about it.

00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:03.660
How do you actually deal
with it so that they actually

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.234
are properly communicating
what they are looking for?

00:47:06.234 --> 00:47:08.150
MEG AKABAS: So, it's
really the same strategy.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:11.890
I know this may
seem like, harsh.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:14.160
But actually, if you
don't give in to whining,

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.690
they won't do it anymore.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.400
And that goes at age seven and
it goes at age two and a half.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.880
So my kids stopped
whining very early on.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.245
And people would say,
your kids never whine.

00:47:23.245 --> 00:47:24.870
Your four-year-old,
five-year-old, they

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:25.170
don't whine.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.753
They ask for things
when they want it.

00:47:26.753 --> 00:47:28.594
And it's because I
never responded to it.

00:47:28.594 --> 00:47:30.010
And when I say
never responded, it

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.590
doesn't mean I
just, blank stare.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:35.470
They didn't get
what they wanted.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.540
And a two-and-a-half-year-old
is able to say,

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.030
please may I have some water?

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.480
Or please can I have a snack?

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.790
That's not an
unrealistic expectation

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.040
for a two-and-a-half-year-old.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.414
Happier They just
may have gotten

00:47:45.414 --> 00:47:48.050
in the habit of
whining and knowing

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.325
that they get what they
want when they whine.

00:47:50.325 --> 00:47:55.940
So being consistent whenever
you hear that tone of voice.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.190
And even if they ask, "I
want a glass of water."

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:01.007
You say, if you want
a glass of water,

00:48:01.007 --> 00:48:03.090
I need you to stay it in
a voice that's respectful

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.380
and ask in a nice way.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.020
That's a whiny voice.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.270
And you can model it for them.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.080
Please say, can I
have a glass of water?

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.740
And they'll say, no, I can't.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:11.856
I'm too tired.

00:48:11.856 --> 00:48:13.112
[WHINING]

00:48:13.112 --> 00:48:14.570
It's like, well,
when you're ready,

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.480
I'm ready to give you a glass
of water when you ask nicely.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.062
And if they really
want it, they'll do it.

00:48:20.062 --> 00:48:21.520
And it doesn't take
that many times

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.050
when they'll realize that
that whining has no effect.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:25.300
But you have to be consistent.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.160
But two and a half is
not too early to start.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.496
And you'll be so happy
you did, because then you

00:48:28.496 --> 00:48:29.350
don't have whiners.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:30.865
It's really nice.

00:48:30.865 --> 00:48:32.865
AUDIENCE: Earlier you
talked about teaching kids

00:48:32.865 --> 00:48:35.620
to wait and have self-control.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:39.990
My son is 14 months.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:44.630
And you say and we understand
at early ages, it's not--

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.630
MEG AKABAS: Age-appropriate
to wait a long tong.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:50.330
AUDIENCE: And they need
immediate help for their needs.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:53.530
So what's the appropriate
timeline for little kids

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.502
to start being taught this?

00:48:55.502 --> 00:48:57.960
MEG AKABAS: So it depends on
what you're asking them to do.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.490
I mean, a 14-month-old can
have some self-soothing skills.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.240
They can learn how to
entertain themselves

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.840
for short periods of time.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.280
And when they start
to speak, kids

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.530
can learn to ask for things
with please and thank you.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.730
I mean, that's not unrealistic.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:14.370
So it depends on
exactly what you're

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.760
talking about in terms
of having self-control.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.310
But they can have some
self-control-- learning,

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.137
for example, not to throw
their cup on the floor

00:49:22.137 --> 00:49:23.220
when they're done with it.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:29.141
You know how toddlers will do
that off of the high chair.

00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:29.640
Thank you.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.765
I haven't used a high chair
in so long I don't even

00:49:31.765 --> 00:49:32.953
remember the name of it.

00:49:32.953 --> 00:49:34.953
So, for example, a child
who, you give them food

00:49:34.953 --> 00:49:36.220
and they start playing with
it and they're throwing it.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.250
And you keep telling them
to stop and they don't.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.920
They can learn not to do that
anymore, because you say,

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.450
you know what?

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.500
You throw that off
again, and I'm not

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:41.900
going to give you any more.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.108
And then you stick with that.

00:49:43.108 --> 00:49:45.280
They'll learn to
control that urge

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.101
to throw the food off the table.

00:49:47.101 --> 00:49:49.350
So it depends on what it is
that you're talking about.

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:50.320
So I can't give you
a particular age,

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.580
but you can start,
certainly, at 14 months,

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:55.270
with certain very
small-- you know,

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.520
I'm going to give you the toy.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.380
You give it back to me.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.713
We're not going to throw things.

00:49:58.713 --> 00:50:02.340
So, for example, a child who
throws blocks at 14 months.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.090
And maybe they're
hurting someone else

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:05.220
by throwing the blocks.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.240
And you tell them not to
throw it and they do it again,

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.700
then the consequences--
the block gets take away.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.470
That is a child learning
self-control at that age,

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.290
that there is a
consequence for something

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.300
and that they can't just throw
anything they want to throw.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.470
So you can be teaching
lessons of self-control,

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.302
but you have to
try to understand--

00:50:23.302 --> 00:50:25.260
and maybe that's through
reading, and depending

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.885
on what the skill is
that you're trying

00:50:26.885 --> 00:50:28.740
to teach-- about when
it is age-appropriate.

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.040
But I can't say
there's one age where

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.915
you start teaching
self-control, because it's

00:50:31.915 --> 00:50:33.760
sort of a progressive
thing that goes on.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.505
And you have to have some
idea of what's realistic.

00:50:36.505 --> 00:50:38.380
And I think you can have
some sense of that--

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.879
whether it's something that's
realistic for your child to do

00:50:40.879 --> 00:50:43.060
or not, and then
you make a decision

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.150
and then you
implement the strategy

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:47.790
and do it consistently.

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:49.857
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you--

00:50:49.857 --> 00:50:52.440
this is with regard to what you
were saying about transferring

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.466
authority and not letting--

00:50:54.466 --> 00:50:55.590
MEG AKABAS: About not what?

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.620
AUDIENCE: Not letting
your child be in charge.

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.070
MEG AKABAS: Not letting your
child be in charge-- right.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:50:59.855
Who's in charge?

00:50:59.855 --> 00:51:02.230
AUDIENCE: Telling the child
rather than asking questions.

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:03.688
So I was wondering
if you find this

00:51:03.688 --> 00:51:08.280
useful in terms of a certain
age-0- let's say below puberty.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.030
And I'm asking this
question because there

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:14.409
was another presentation here by
psychologist Daniel Siegel, who

00:51:14.409 --> 00:51:14.950
was talking--

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:16.910
MEG AKABAS: Daniel Siegel
is one of my mentors.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:17.836
I love him.

00:51:17.836 --> 00:51:20.210
AUDIENCE: So he was talking
about puberty and adolescence

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.880
in particular, like being
a very important period

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.440
in the formation
of a child's brain.

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.760
And that this is the time
when actually children

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.280
are most creative.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.250
So a useful strategy is actually
to step back a little bit

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.162
and give them some
room to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:36.162 --> 00:51:36.995
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:36.995 --> 00:51:37.661
MEG AKABAS: Yes.

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.770
What he's asking is,
when I said about who's

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:43.545
in charge-- and this
author Daniel Siegel, who's

00:51:43.545 --> 00:51:47.510
a very well-noted
child psychologist,

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.490
talks about letting
your child have some

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.340
say and to develop
their creativity

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.611
and have some independence.

00:51:52.611 --> 00:51:53.110
Yes.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:53.610
Absolutely.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.360
And, in fact, I have
a chapter in the book

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.680
called "Choices, Choices."

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.390
It's just as important to give
your child choices about things

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:03.450
and to give them lots
of room for creativity

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:04.580
and to make decisions.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.110
The important
thing is to be very

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:07.620
clear in your mind
about what things

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.110
they should have choices about.

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.800
And the choices
about things that

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.487
cross the line against
your better judgment

00:52:15.487 --> 00:52:17.320
or against your family
values are not things

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.080
that they should have choices
about, or behaviors, whenever

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.020
you want to instill in them--
you need to make those choices.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.760
And there are lots of things you
can give your children choices

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.000
about.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.990
And as they get older, you can
talk to them about it and say,

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.531
you know, I want to find a way
for you to be able to do this,

00:52:31.531 --> 00:52:32.940
but we have these rules.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:37.230
Let's talk about what might
be an appropriate boundary,

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.060
or what might be an appropriate
solution to this problem.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.000
So I totally agree
with him that children

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.880
should have a lot of
say in many things,

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.640
and it's a bad thing
to stifle that.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.580
But you have to be clear about
which things are the things

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.720
that they should-- so
if your child wants

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.421
to stay out until 1 o'clock in
an unsafe area or go to a party

00:52:55.421 --> 00:52:56.920
where it's unsupervised
or something

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.920
and that's against your
better judgment, that's not

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.460
an instance where
it's good for a child

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.720
to kind of figure
out things themselves

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.760
and for you to step back.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.051
If you really feel that's
against your better judgment,

00:53:05.051 --> 00:53:06.550
then it's important to stick.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.010
And it's not good for the
child to be in charge, still.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:10.385
TAL AKABAS: But
what do you think

00:53:10.385 --> 00:53:13.130
about changing the parenting
style from authoritative, what

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:18.050
you were saying, to permissive,
let's say, after age 12 or 14,

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.252
when they get into adolescence?

00:53:20.252 --> 00:53:20.960
MEG AKABAS: Yeah.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.520
I think that when you're
talking about permissive,

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.114
you're talking about
having some rules

00:53:25.114 --> 00:53:26.280
and not really keeping them.

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.100
And so that's not really
what he's talking about.

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.360
I don't think he's talking
about being permissive.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.350
I think he's talking
about having fewer things

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.620
that you have guidelines about,
fewer rules, because it's not

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:41.160
as necessary, but that
you keep the boundaries

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.265
with those rules.

00:53:42.265 --> 00:53:44.640
So that's what I would say to
that-- that it's not really

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.690
a change in
parenting style, it's

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:49.920
a change in how you implement
the authoritative style,

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.615
that you're going to
be less restrictive.

00:53:53.615 --> 00:53:55.740
There are certain things
that you're just not going

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.640
to have rules about
because you trust

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.430
your child's judgment
at that point.

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.140
And you find that
if you're pretty

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:05.480
consistent in the younger
years that your child will

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.730
get to know.

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.340
They will start to
have good judgment.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.400
I had very few rules with
my kids as teenagers.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.397
They didn't have a curfew.

00:54:12.397 --> 00:54:13.980
There were very few
rules. [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.490
because they were
self-regulating.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.990
They, by then, knew how
to make good choices.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:21.600
So I don't believe that you have
to have rules, rules, rules,

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.810
rules all the time.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:26.562
And if your kids
have really learned

00:54:26.562 --> 00:54:28.020
how to take in a
lot of what you've

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.436
been trying to teach them, you
won't need that many rules,

00:54:30.436 --> 00:54:31.680
actually.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.625
Does that make sense?

00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:33.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:33.756
Thank you.

00:54:33.756 --> 00:54:34.880
MEG AKABAS: You're welcome.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.425
Thank you so much for coming.

00:54:38.425 --> 00:54:40.941
I'm going to show you-- so my
book, "52 Weeks of Parenting

00:54:40.941 --> 00:54:41.440
Wisdom.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.815
I'll show you what
it looks like.

00:54:42.815 --> 00:54:44.210
It's available on Amazon.

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:45.930
I'm also on Facebook,

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:49.220
to follow me to
get some parenting

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.790
tips and some
research that I post.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.710
And I answer
questions online, too.

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:59.950
I'm under parenting-solutions,
parenting solutions.

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:01.767

questions afterward

00:55:01.767 --> 00:55:04.350
and want to come talk to me up
here, I'm happy to talk to you.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:07.646
Thank you so much for
coming, and have a good day.
