00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.060
GARANCE DORE: OK, yeah.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.340
ANJALI KUMAR: Because I'm
basically fluent.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.220
GARANCE DORE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.880
ANJALI KUMAR: I brought
you lunch.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.840
I brought us lunch.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.470
GARANCE DORE: OK.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.915
ANJALI KUMAR: I got
myself a sandwich.

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:30.320
And I got you some water.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.770
GARANCE DORE: That's exactly
what I need right now.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.220
Thank you.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.380
You know Fashion Week is
around the corner.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.030
ANJALI KUMAR: I know.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.370
I got lemon, too.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.160
GARANCE DORE: Oh my
god, even better.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.770
Two calories?

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.070
Oh my god.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.430
ANJALI KUMAR: The whole
lemon has 12.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.210
So I figured this much,
maybe one and a half?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.660
You've been writing this
beloved fashion and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.190
illustration blog since 2006.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.000
GARANCE DORE: Yes.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.100
ANJALI KUMAR: Can tell us
a little bit about the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.580
evolution, and how you started,
and the evolution to

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.980
what it is now?

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.530
GARANCE DORE: Of course.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.350
The serious way?

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.430
ANJALI KUMAR: Sure,
however you roll.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.060
GARANCE DORE: The blog started
because I was an illustrator.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.200
I was like you.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.299
I was at my office, all
day at my desk.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.550
What a life.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.455
ANJALI KUMAR: Pardon
my French.

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:10.585
GARANCE DORE: Yes,
pardon my French.

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:10.870
Sucks.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.090
ANJALI KUMAR: Who is the most
active commenter on your blog?

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.350
Do you have like one guy that's
always like, great

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.340
picture, nice legs?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.070
GARANCE DORE: There is people
who comment every day.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.300
I can't describe it.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.040
Like, there is so many.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.920
I receive emails.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.770
People name their
kids Garance.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.630
ANJALI KUMAR: Do you think
they know where you live?

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.880
GARANCE DORE: If they look at
the blog, like very, if they

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.690
want to know where I
live, it's not that

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.920
difficult to find.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.400
You can get so many information
on people.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.860
ANJALI KUMAR: How do they do
that, all that information

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.440
that's available?

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.650
GARANCE DORE: Right.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.130
ANJALI KUMAR: Such a problem.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.920
So "Pardon My French" is
your newest endeavor.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.390
Do you know what pardon my
French means in English?

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.186
GARANCE DORE: Yes, of course.

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.575
ANJALI KUMAR: What
does it mean?

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:59.120
GARANCE DORE: It means,
if I say merde, I can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.770
say pardon my French.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.550
It means--

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.500
ANJALI KUMAR: So do you walk
around just like, [BLEEP]

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.290
this [BLEEP], pardon
my French?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.709
I mean, this fashion [BLEEP]

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.030
[BLEEP]

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.700
and I [BLEEP].

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.560
And I hate this [BLEEP].

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.110
GARANCE DORE: Yeah.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.030
ANJALI KUMAR: Stuff like that?

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.220
That's what you guys
go around saying?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.100
You're like, oh, pardon
my French.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.240
GARANCE DORE: Exactly.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.440
So I try to not swear too
much on the videos.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.706
ANJALI KUMAR: Did I
just offend you?

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:24.350
GARANCE DORE: Well
then that's good.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.110
It's your video.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.320
We can have fun.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.440
[BLEEP]

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.910
you.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.530
ANJALI KUMAR: [BLEEP]

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.140
you.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.050
GARANCE DORE: [BLEEP]

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.780
ANJALI KUMAR: So I want to
switch directions a little

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.660
bit, and talk about
signature style.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.580
Like the Anna Wintour,
she's got the bob.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.060
GARANCE DORE: Right.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.620
ANJALI KUMAR: Like there's
people who have that one

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.990
defining characteristic.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.250
So I've been working
on something.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.410
And I'm hoping you
can help me.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.730
Just tell me what you think.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.060
And maybe help me brand it.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.530
So can I just show you?

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.110
So just give me a minute, and
I'll just be right back.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.000
OK, so this is what
I'm thinking.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.900
Can you see me?

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.630
GARANCE DORE: That's why
I say don't try to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.580
have a signature style.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.400
If it comes to you, it does.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.500
Just let it happen.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.230
ANJALI KUMAR: This
hat came to me.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.010
It spoke to me in the store.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.390
GARANCE DORE: Do you really
want a signature style?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.620
Do you want to be
Clint Eastwood?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.880
Do you want to be
Anna Wintour?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.130
ANJALI KUMAR: Who doesn't?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.330
I feel like it gives me
a little ethnic flare.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.640
GARANCE DORE: It gives
you some edge.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.050
Yeah.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.040
ANJALI KUMAR: Don't you think?

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.450
Stripes, and they go in,
so they're slimming.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.750
GARANCE DORE: No it's really--

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.970
ANJALI KUMAR: Slimming.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.750
GARANCE DORE: You look
like a parachute.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.110
It's not very slimming.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.560
ANJALI KUMAR: Like
a parachute?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.460
GARANCE DORE: You know,
when the, you know?

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.040
You're totally YOLO.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.000
ANJALI KUMAR: What
does that mean?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.370
GARANCE DORE: Like you
only live once.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.130
Let's do everything.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.060
ANJALI KUMAR: YOLO?

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.620
GARANCE DORE: You
don't know that?

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.207
ANJALI KUMAR: I never
heard that before.

00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:37.041
No.

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:37.775
GARANCE DORE: Oh, come on.

00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:39.430
ANJALI KUMAR: That's
not a thing.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.040
I work at Google.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.030
It's not a thing.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.510
I don't know.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.210
I'm getting old, though.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.870
So it might be a thing.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.690
GARANCE DORE: Yes.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.410
It's a big thing.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.790
ANJALI KUMAR: It's a thing?

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.070
GARANCE DORE: Yeah, and
you're totally that.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.035
ANJALI KUMAR: Wait, so what
are you going to call my

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:49.155
signature style with
the poncho?

00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:50.540
Skydiving chic.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.590
GARANCE DORE: Right, exactly.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.290
Para chic.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.460
ANJALI KUMAR: Para chic.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.440
YOLO para chic.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.230
GARANCE DORE: Yeah.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.490
I like that.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.120
ANJALI KUMAR: If you people
steal this [BLEEP].

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.000
I'm suing.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.390
GARANCE DORE: And [BLEEP]

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.930
your [BLEEP].

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.938
ANJALI KUMAR: I have a segment
idea for your show, for

00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:08.834
"Pardon my French."

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:09.282
GARANCE DORE: Oh yeah?

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:12.420
ANJALI KUMAR: It's all
about para chic.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.240
GARANCE DORE: Yeah.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.800
ANJALI KUMAR: We can totally do
this interview in French,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.029
because I took it in
seventh grade.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.560
So I'm basically fluent.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.300
GARANCE DORE: Yes, OK.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.940
We can do that.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.980
ANJALI KUMAR: So let me
just ask you a few

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.970
questions in French.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.810
GARANCE DORE: OK.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.060
ANJALI KUMAR: [SPEAKING FRENCH]?

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.340
GARANCE DORE: It doesn't
mean anything.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.870
ANJALI KUMAR: I need my money
back from seventh grade.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.120
OK.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.370
[SPEAKING FRENCH]?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.040
GARANCE DORE: [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.970
ANJALI KUMAR: You
heard it here--

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.458
pigeons.

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:45.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:46.246
ANJALI KUMAR: It's all
about pigeons.

00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:46.700
GARANCE DORE: [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.400
ANJALI KUMAR: The pigeons?

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.310
GARANCE DORE: Uh huh.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.730
ANJALI KUMAR: It's all
about pigeons.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.980
GARANCE DORE: Exactly.

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:56.300
ANJALI KUMAR: I'm
still hungry.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.550
GARANCE DORE: I'm stuffed.
