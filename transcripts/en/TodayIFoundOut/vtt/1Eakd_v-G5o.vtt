00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.050
The American Civil War ended almost a century
and a half ago (April 9th, 1865) with the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.359
surrender of the Confederate forces at the
Appomattox Court House in Northern Virginia.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.859
About 54 years ago, in December 1959, the
last reported surviving veteran of the Civil

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.280
War, Walter Washington Williams, passed away
in Houston, Texas at the reported age of 117.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.899
President Dwight Eisenhower declared it a
national day of mourning and gave him an honorary

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:43.899
rank.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.399
Congress recognized his passing on the floor.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.500
Reporters, writers, and well-wishers all came
to Houston to pay respects to the man who

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.490
was America’s last direct living link to
the war that divided the United States for

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.490
a time.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.350
Of course, this all may have been a lie.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.130
According to the official history, Walter
Williams was born 1842 in Itawamba County,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.780
Mississippi and served under General John
Bell Hood beginning in 1864.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.990
He was a forgemaster, meaning he was in charge
of finding food and figuring out how to go

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.810
about transporting it.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.409
After the war, in 1870, he moved to Texas
where he settled on a 20 acre farm in Eaton

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.049
(East Texas – about 100 miles from Austin).

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.520
That’s where he remained, mostly unknown,
until the late 1940s immediately following

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.380
World War II, when reporters and historians
began to seek out these last remaining survivors

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.130
of the Civil War.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.689
Williams became a local celebrity.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.390
He was invited to fancy dinners, given special
awards, and called by honorary titles like

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.389
“Trooper Williams”, “Honorable Colonel”,
and even “Five Star General Walter Washington

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:43.389
Williams.”

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:46.179
When interviewed by the Dallas Morning News
about how he had managed to live to such an

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.030
old age, Walter responded:
“I never et much.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.859
I get up for breakfast, turn around for dinner,
and go to bed for supper.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.429
When I was riding up the Chisholm Trail the
range cooks sort of held it against me because

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:57.799
I was a light-eating man.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.679
I’ve always drunk lots of coffee, chewed
plenty of tobacco, and haven’t tried to

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.619
avoid any of this good Texas weather.”

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.920
On September 4, 1959, months before Williams’
death and as his hometown of Houston geared

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.290
up for Mr. Williams’ 117th birthday party,
a reporter for Scripps-Howard by the name

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.550
of Lowell Bridwell wrote a damaging exposé
potentially debunking the “Walter Washington

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.550
Williams myth.”

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.601
In it, he called Williams “an enfeebled
old man” who was a “Confederate veteran

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:28.110
only in his memory-clouded mind.”

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.081
Bidwell had done some digging and found not
“a single scrap” of evidence that Williams

00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:38.310
even served in the military, much less being
the very old age of 117, like he claimed.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.560
According to the 1860 census, Williams was
listed as five years old, meaning he was born

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.260
in 1854 and would have been only nine years
old in 1864, seemingly too young to have fought

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.570
in the Civil War.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.140
Moreover, according to Bridwell’s reporting,
the National Archives does not list a Walter

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.390
W., a Walter G., or even a Walter L. Williams
from Texas or Mississippi as ever having served

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.990
in the Confederate Army.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.610
Newspapers across the country picked up on
the Bridwell story and began printing their

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.880
own stories with headlines like this one from
the The Daytona Beach Journal, “Walter Williams:

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.930
Last Civil War Veteran or Hazy Memory?”

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.640
Defenders of Walter claimed that records from
that time had a reputation for being spotty.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.250
During the last year of the war, with the
Confederate army losing and in sad shape,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.570
they didn’t keep particularly meticulous
records of who was serving within their ranks

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.230
and even the records that did exist often
had errors, such as incorrect birth dates.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.820
In addition, an archive in Jackson, Mississippi
lists a “Walter W. Williams” as a Private

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.800
in Company O, 5th Mississippi Cavalry.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.431
Despite the controversy, when Walter Williams
Washington passed away in December 1959, he

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:46.310
was hailed across the nation as the last surviving
veteran of the Civil War.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.590
He was laid to rest at Mount Pleasant Church
cemetery in Robertson County (near Eaton),

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.590
Texas.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.130
His grave is now marked by an interpretive
sign, placed there by the Texas Civil War

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.040
Centennial Commission in 1963.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.100
On the sign, it reads:
“Reputed to have been the last surviving

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.960
soldier of the Civil War…he had lived very
quietly until in extreme old age he gained

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.050
fame as one of the very few remaining veterans.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.490
After the nation lost all other men who had
fought in the Civil War, he was given honorary

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.959
rank of General by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.169
When Gen. Williams died in Houston at home
of a daughter, President Eisenhower proclaimed

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.699
a period of national mourning.”

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.600
So was Williams really the last?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.229
It’s somewhat unclear, though most historians
today think probably not for the aforementioned

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.229
reasons.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.690
If he wasn’t the last, that honor goes to
Albert Woolson, who passed away three years

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.920
before Williams in 1956 and is considered
within the academic community to be the last

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.570
authenticated survivor of the Civil War.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.680
Woolson was a Union drummer boy from Minnesota
who enlisted in 1864 after his father passed

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.690
away from a severe leg wound while also fighting
for the Union.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.090
Bonus Facts:
• Lowell Bridwell, the reporter for Scripps-Howard

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.160
who wrote the expose on Walter Washington
Williams, had a very interesting career.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.700
While he was a reporter, he drew the ire of
J. Edgar Hoover, who suspected him of being

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.700
a communist.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.330
Bridwell’s brother worked for the FBI at
the time and was given the assignment to spy

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.630
on his brother.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.080
When he refused, he was forced to quit the
FBI.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.889
Lowell went on to work in the Department of
Commerce and then in the Department of Transportation

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.810
during the Kennedy administration.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.830
He eventually rose through the ranks and became
the director of the Federal Highway Administration

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.010
during the Johnson administration, directing
during a time of immense highway growth in

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.800
the United States.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.860
• Walter Williams was married twice, the
second time for over 65 years.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.800
Because of this, he had a very large family,
rumored to have had over 200 descendants when

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.340
he died.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.250
• General John Bell Hood, the man Williams
reportedly served under, was known as a very

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.310
aggressive and reckless General.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.900
Some historians think his massive frontal
assault at the Battle of Franklin was such

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.740
a big disaster for the Confederate army that
it lost the war for them.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.810
During the Battle of Gettysburg, Hood (not
yet a General) was so severely wounded that

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:11.900
his left arm became useless for the rest of
this life.
