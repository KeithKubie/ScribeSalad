00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Voiceover] Let's get
some practice rewriting

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.825
and simplifying radical expressions.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.072
So in this first exercise,
and these are all from

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.140
Khan Academy.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.550
It says simplify the expression
by removing all factors

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.081
that are perfect squares
from inside the radicals,

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:15.564
and combine the terms.

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:19.558
If the expression cannot be
simplified, enter it as given.

00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:21.601
All right, let's see what we can do here.

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.387
So, we have negative 40 (laughs),

00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:27.104
the negative square
root of 40 I should say.

00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:29.495
Let me write a little bit
bigger so you can see that.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:33.118
So the negative square root of 40

00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:36.856
plus the square root of 90.

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:39.429
So let's see, what
perfect squares are in 40?

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:40.659
So, what immediately jumps out at me

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.489
is that this, it's divisible by four

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.045
and four is a perfect square.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.043
So this is the negative square root of

00:00:47.043 --> 00:00:50.593
four times 10, plus

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:53.356
the square root of, well
what jumps out at me

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:54.675
is that this is divisible by nine.

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:59.133
Nine is a perfect
square, so nine times 10.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.161
And if we look at the 10s
here, 10 does not have

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.753
any perfect squares in it anymore.

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:05.588
If you wanted to do a
full factorization of 10,

00:01:05.588 --> 00:01:09.672
a full prime factorization, it would be

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:10.733
two times five.

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.739
So there's no perfect squares in 10.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.667
And so we can work it out from here.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.775
This is the same thing
as the negative of the

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:20.560
square root of four times
the square root of 10,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.998
plus the square root of nine,

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:24.832
times the square root of 10.

00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:26.334
And when I say square
root, I'm really saying

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:28.403
principal root, the positive square root.

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:31.259
So it's the negative of the
positive square root of four,

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.045
so that is, so let me do
this is in another color.

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:35.762
so it can be clear.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.418
So, this right here is two.

00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:41.405
This right here is three.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.690
So it's going to be equal to

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.049
negative two

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.580
square roots of 10 plus

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.552
three square roots of 10.

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:54.199
So if I have negative two of something

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.916
and I add three of that
same something to it,

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.355
that's going to be what?

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:02.790
Well that's going to be
one square root of 10.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.112
Now this last step
doesn't make full sense.

00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:07.550
Actually, let me slow
it down a little bit.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.542
I could rewrite it this way.

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:13.633
I could write it as
three square roots of 10

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.187
minus two square roots of 10.

00:02:16.187 --> 00:02:17.534
That might jump out at
you a little bit clear.

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:19.438
If I have three of something
and I were to take away

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.295
two of that something, and that case it's

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:23.362
squares of 10s, well, I'm
going to be left with just

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:24.662
one of that something.

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:26.891
I'm just gonna be left
with one square root of 10.

00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:30.699
Which we could just write
as the square root of 10.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.498
Another way to think about it is,

00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:37.764
we could factor out a
square root of 10 here.

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:39.676
So you undistribute it,

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:41.892
do the distributive property in reverse.

00:02:41.892 --> 00:02:43.564
That would be the square root of 10

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:47.053
times three minus two,

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:48.765
which is of course, this is just one.

00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:50.460
So you're just left with
the square root of 10.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.152
So all of this simplifies
to square root of 10.

00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:56.311
Let's do a few more of these.

00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:59.314
So this says, simplify
the expression by removing

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:01.048
all factors that are
perfect squares from inside

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:02.441
the radicals, and combine the terms.

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:06.163
So essentially the same idea.

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:09.291
All right, let's see what we can do.

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:10.707
So, this is interesting.

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:14.561
We have a square root of 1/2.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.605
So can I, well actually,

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:18.276
what could be interesting
is since if I have

00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:20.064
a square root of something
times the square root

00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:21.597
of something else.

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:24.731
So the square root of 180 times

00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:26.914
the square root of 1/2,

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.607
this is the same thing as the square root

00:03:29.607 --> 00:03:33.874
of 180 times 1/2.

00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:35.714
And this just comes straight
out of our exponent properties.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:38.152
It might look a little bit
more familiar if I wrote it as

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:43.152
180 to the 1/2 power,
times 1/2 to the 1/2 power,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.974
is going to be equal to 180 times 1/2

00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:50.806
to the 1/2 power, taking the square root,

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:53.476
the principal root is the same
thing as raising something

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:55.450
to the 1/2 power.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.329
And so this is the square
root of 80 times 1/2

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.207
which is going to be
the square root of 90,

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:05.736
which is equal to the square root of nine

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:09.358
times 10, and we just
simplified square root of 90

00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:11.936
in the last problem, that's
equal to the square root

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:15.697
of nine times the square root
of, principle root of 10,

00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:19.714
which is equal to three
times the square root of 10.

00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:23.824
Three times the square root of 10.

00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:25.379
All right, let's keep going.

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:26.772
So I have one more of these examples,

00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:28.142
and like always, pause the video

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:29.698
and see if you can work
through these on your own

00:04:29.698 --> 00:04:32.391
before I work it out with you.

00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:34.458
Simplify the expression
by removing all factors

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:35.456
that are perfect square,
okay, these are just

00:04:35.456 --> 00:04:38.034
same directions that we've
seen the last few times.

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:39.195
And so let's see.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:42.376
If I wanted to do, if I
wanted to simplify this,

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:47.043
this is equal to the square root of,

00:04:47.043 --> 00:04:50.363
well, 64 times two is 128,

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:52.128
and 64 is a perfect square,
so I'm gonna write it as

00:04:52.128 --> 00:04:55.796
64 times two, over

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.886
27 is nine times three.

00:04:57.886 --> 00:04:59.767
Nine is a perfect square.

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.671
So this is going to be the same thing.

00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:03.528
And there's a couple of ways
that we can think about it.

00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:06.454
We could say this is the same thing as

00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:09.612
the square root of 64 times two,

00:05:09.612 --> 00:05:13.257
over the square root of nine times three,

00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:16.229
which is the same thing
as the square root of 64

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.713
times the square root of two,

00:05:18.713 --> 00:05:21.871
over square root of nine
times the square root

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:25.772
of three, which is
equal to, this is eight,

00:05:25.772 --> 00:05:29.835
this is three, so it would be
eight times the square root

00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:34.200
of two, over three times
the square root of three.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.710
That's one way to say it.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.590
Or we could even view the
square root of two over

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.284
the square root of three
as a square root of 2/3.

00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:43.674
So we could say this is eight over three

00:05:43.674 --> 00:05:48.248
times the square root of 2/3.

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:51.220
So these are all possible ways of trying

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.427
to tackle this.

00:05:52.427 --> 00:05:54.053
So we could just write it, let's see.

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:56.319
Have we removed all factors
that are perfect squares?

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.037
Yes, from inside the radicals

00:05:58.037 --> 00:05:59.361
and we've combined terms.

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.288
We weren't doing any
adding or subtracting here,

00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:03.865
so it's really just
removing the perfect squares

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:06.141
from inside the radicals
and I think we've done that.

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.322
So we could say this is
going to be 8/3 times

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:11.597
the square root of 2/3.

00:06:11.597 --> 00:06:13.223
And there's other ways
that you could express this

00:06:13.223 --> 00:06:16.020
that would be equivalent but hopefully

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.089
this makes some sense.
