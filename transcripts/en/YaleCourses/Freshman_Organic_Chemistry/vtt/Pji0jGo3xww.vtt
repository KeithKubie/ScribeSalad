1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.820
We're talking about facts,
ideas,

2
00:00:03.821 --> 00:00:07.060
and words in relation to Stereo Chemistry.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.100
And the words have to be generalized that in the way we communicate things,

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.710
uh,
to include models,
uh,
things like this.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.070
<v 1>Alright.
And let me turn that microphone off right here.
I'll</v>

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.030
do it.
Uh,

7
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.540
got to remember how to turn it off.

8
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.823
Okay,

9
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.443
there we go.

10
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.290
<v 0>Can you,
there we go.
Okay.
So models,</v>

11
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.690
but also what you can draw on a piece of paper that will convey stereo chemical

12
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:56.860
structure to people.

13
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.840
So the standard we use in drawing is wedges.

14
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.960
Demean their coming out at you in the direction that they expand.

15
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:07.510
And Day does mean they're going back into the board.

16
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.820
Although all you draw is damages.

17
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.720
It's not immediately obvious which end is going back if it's a dash,

18
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.000
right?
But if one end has nothing on it,
it's clear,
right?

19
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.100
That it's going back from the carbon that's shown.

20
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.600
So you have to use your stereo chemical intuition sometimes to interpret that.

21
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:29.480
Although if you draw a wedge,
it's clear which way it's coming.
And,
uh,

22
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.970
sometimes people draw wedges with dots meeting,
they're going back in.

23
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.560
But there are many ways that people make mistakes in dryness,

24
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.060
so it needs a little practice.

25
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:44.710
That one's okay and clearly corresponds to a tetrahedron with hundred nine

26
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:49.450
degree bond angles shown like this.
Right?
The blue ones coming out at you?

27
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:54.130
The black,
the yellow one's going back green and red up and down.
Okay,

28
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:58.330
so that drawing is fine.
What's wrong with this drawing?

29
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.380
<v 1>Yeah,
sure.
What?</v>

30
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.730
I can't hear it.
I still can't hear.

31
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.450
<v 0>What are the bond bangles?
How about between the solid lines?</v>

32
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.070
109 and a half degrees
between the solid lines.

33
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.900
Just not the wedges.
Oh,

34
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.740
on 880 how about the other angles?

35
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.350
90 bright.
This is a play.
This is a square plain drawn that way.

36
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.190
The day she has to go the other way and it's,
and the,

37
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.160
the lines that are in the plane of the board or the piece of paper have to be at

38
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:48.480
109 degrees.
Okay,
so that,
forget that one.

39
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.490
I assure you that we will get these on on exams because we always have in the

40
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:58.230
past.
But this is warning.
Okay.
So that one's playing or forget that.

41
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.310
How about one there?

42
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:05.110
I've got the wedges drawn the right way.
Everything else,
right?

43
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.380
No,
the solid lines in the plane are 180 degrees.
That one's bad.

44
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:13.570
Obviously not many people draw it that way.

45
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.500
Okay.
Oh,
there's one that looks pretty good.

46
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.823
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.330
<v 0>Everybody agree?
Any complaints?</v>

48
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.680
Lucas?
What's the complaint?
Pardon me.
Ah,

49
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.290
the angles between the lines,
the SA,

50
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.330
the normal lines on the wedge are all less than than 90 degrees.

51
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.460
Well,
one of them is bigger than 90 degrees.
The ones at the top,

52
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:49.930
but the one to the bottom is less than 90 degrees if the normal line is in the

53
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.700
plane of the screen.
All right.
That's an acute angle,

54
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.650
right?
So the one on the top left is the one you want to go for.

55
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.950
Okay.
Now how about this?

56
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.920
Yeah,
those look good.
See any problems?

57
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.500
Okay.
And what do you say?
It looks fine to you.

58
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.760
Tell me what the angle is here between this bond

59
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.430
and this one.
Where would this bond point?

60
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:32.700
If it were 90 degrees from this one,
which is in the plane of the board,

61
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.130
would point straight out now that if at 90 degrees it would be coming straight

62
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:38.851
out from that point.

63
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:42.600
How about there is this angle greater than or less than 90 degrees?

64
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.520
Here's the one.
Here's the one that said,
here's the carbon.

65
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:54.870
Here's the one that's in the plane of the board,
right?
It's going like,
like that.

66
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.150
Here's the one that's 90 degrees,
right?
Suppose I bend it up like this,

67
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.270
which is what the wedge shows.
Now,
what's the angle?

68
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.880
The cute,
right?
So these are not right,
right?

69
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.290
The same is true at the bottom,

70
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.700
but this structure is okay because by convention it doesn't mean to show the

71
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:20.490
exact angle.

72
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.080
It just means to show that it's going relatively out,

73
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.990
right?
But it wouldn't be the,
the solid,
these three lines here,
this one,

74
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.800
this one,
this one.
The ones that are not wedges and not die,

75
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:36.600
she just could not be in the plane of the board.

76
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.570
They'd be 120 degree angles or something like that.

77
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.240
They couldn't be a 109 right?

78
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.260
But in order to draw this in a finite amount of time,

79
00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:50.640
when you're writing on paper,
people understand what you mean in this case.

80
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.080
But if you draw that one,

81
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:57.000
which means it's playing or people will be very much offended,
right?
Okay.

82
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.830
This again,
at a certain level is lore.
You have to find,

83
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.180
be criticized before you find out where you're making mistakes,
okay?

84
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.961
But anyhow,

85
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.590
it's important to be sensitive about the fact that carbon is tetrahedral.

86
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.120
Now,
uh,
these things are hard to do in three dimensions.

87
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.150
And the Fischer projection was invented for that purpose in 1891.

88
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.480
And the reason for its invention was,
was,
uh,
was interesting.

89
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.520
He wrote with the help of freed lenders,
convenient rubber models.

90
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.530
One can construct molecules of right handed tartaric acid,
lefthanded,

91
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:38.531
tartaric acid and inactive tartaric acid and lay them in the plane of the paper

92
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.270
so that the four carbon atoms are in a straight line and the attached hydrogens

93
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.420
and hydroxyls lie above the plane of the paper.

94
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.350
Now here's the idea that freed lenders,

95
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:55.730
models use rubber tubing to connect these things,
right?

96
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.200
So drawing this in in two dimensions and making clear what you mean in three is

97
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.034
not easy,

98
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.030
but he says what you're going to do is take the four carbons that are in a
chain.

99
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.120
This is tartaric acid right here is to a carbon with an o h carbon with an o h

100
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.540
and the carbon with o two on it,
right?

101
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.930
So what he wants to do is to lay it all four carbons in the plane of the paper,

102
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.820
which you can't do,
right?
But if the bonds are made of rubber,

103
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.890
then you can bend the bonds,

104
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.150
<v 1>right?
Okay.</v>

105
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.240
<v 0>And then you can make them all four in the plan to the paper,</v>

106
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.110
<v 1>right?
But</v>

107
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.210
<v 0>what you have to understand is that in this convention,</v>

108
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.770
you draw the four carbons vertical in a line,
not horizontal.

109
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.090
And then you understand that the bonds between them are severely bent,

110
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.820
right?
So the,

111
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.690
the curious thing is that when you draw a Fischer projection,

112
00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:00.620
as is most convenient for sugars,
discuss pops.
Pardon me?
Uh,

113
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.800
we're discussing the configuration of sugars,
the bond,

114
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.970
the four bonds for this carbon are understood that these two,

115
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.120
the horizontal ones come out toward you as if they were wedges and the other two

116
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:15.980
from this carbon go back into the board.

117
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:17.850
<v 1>Okay,</v>

118
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.080
<v 0>this is his paper.</v>

119
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:23.130
Where are you originally proposed it nowadays you wouldn't use dots here,

120
00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:26.790
which help make it clear that it's going back.
You just draw lines,

121
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:31.791
but understand that vertical lines mean they're going back into the board and

122
00:08:32.401 --> 00:08:35.790
horizontal lines mean they're coming out at you.
Okay,

123
00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:39.870
so that's the Fisher convention that he invented in 1891.

124
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.550
So this is a,

125
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.580
so this bond here is a very funny bond because in bonding from this carbon and

126
00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:49.860
this carbon,
it's going back into the board from this carbon,

127
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:55.070
but also back into the board from that carbon because it's been okay.

128
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.130
And it was because free blender made his models with rubber tubing that it

129
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:03.240
occurred to Fisher that you could do this and then all you have to do is draw

130
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:03.961
straight lines.

131
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:08.130
You don't have to do wedges and so on and just put things in the right place.

132
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.020
So here he could draw right handed tartaric acid,
lefthanded,

133
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:14.970
tartaric acid and inactive,

134
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.420
or Miso as we call it now tartaric acid.

135
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.440
So the attached hydrogens and hydroxyls lie above the plane of the paper,

136
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.341
right?

137
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:30.900
And the other carbons vertical bonds go back in from both of the atoms that they

138
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:35.350
attach.
Okay?
So that they're the wedges.

139
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.080
And if you rotate that 90 degrees,

140
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.170
it would look like that very highly distorted.

141
00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:44.380
But you can do it with rubber and steel and be clear about what the

142
00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:48.190
configuration is on ambiguous.
Okay?

143
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.750
They go back from both carbons and it was because you had rubber models that you

144
00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:53.584
could do that.

145
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.113
<v 1>Okay?</v>

146
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.511
<v 0>Okay.</v>

147
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:02.511
So here are those models and notice that you can rotate in plane by a 180

148
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:06.690
degrees and it means the same thing.

149
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.990
So if I have this and it's bent like this and I rotate it like that 180 degrees,

150
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:14.970
it's obviously means the same thing,
right?

151
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:20.100
I can rotate a Fischer projection by 180 degrees and it's still the same model,

152
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.770
but I can't rotate it by,

153
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.930
I can't rotate it by 180 degrees or by by 90 degrees this way.

154
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.773
<v 1>Why not?</v>

155
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.890
<v 0>If I wrote,
write it this way,
it won't mean the same thing.
Why not</v>

156
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.343
<v 1>shy?</v>

157
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:40.481
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

158
00:10:40.481 --> 00:10:44.260
The horizontal bonds are going back in and the vertical ones are coming out at

159
00:10:44.261 --> 00:10:47.260
you.
You've reflected it in a mirror,
each carbon,

160
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.410
so you can rotate it 180 degrees,

161
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.200
but you can't rotate it 90 degrees.

162
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.140
<v 0>Uh,
so there,
we'll rotate that 180 degrees.
That's still fine.</v>

164
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.450
And in fact,
what do you notice about it other than the fact that the,
the,

165
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.370
the symbols are written backwards.

166
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:14.510
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

167
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.600
<v 0>it's the same thing.
It was above,
right?</v>

168
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:20.210
So rotated at 180 degrees doesn't change it.

169
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:21.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

170
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.810
<v 0>How about the next one?
If you rotate it 180 degrees,</v>

171
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.980
<v 1>same as above.
Yep.</v>

172
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.720
<v 0>How about the last one?</v>

173
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.713
<v 1>Right.</v>

174
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.310
<v 0>That one is now the mirror image.</v>

175
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.340
If you slide it up like that,

176
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.660
you can see that there would be a mirror there.
Everybody with me?

177
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.950
So that molecule is its own mirror image.
Yeah.

178
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.920
Whereas the first two and memory,

179
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.640
you can draw the mirror any direction and always get the same mirror and same

180
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.250
mirror image x,
y,
Y,
Z,
z.

181
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:05.860
They all give the same mirror image just differently oriented.

182
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.600
Another way to draw the mirror,

183
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.990
one that's easier is to draw it right through the middle of the molecule

184
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:15.460
horizontally.
Then the top path is the mirror image of the bottom right.

185
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:18.940
So it's obviously not a chiral molecule.

186
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.080
It's super imposable on its mirror image.
Whereas the,

187
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.740
and that one's called Misa,
uh,
the name.

188
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.470
Then that was called Mezzo tartaric acid.

189
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:33.040
And the name was generalized to mean any molecule,

190
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.940
which is its own mirror image is me Zo.
Okay.

191
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.490
And notice that these,
these terms,
name relationships,

192
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.270
they don't name it,
absolute molecule,

193
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.240
these stereo chemical terms,
the ones like this,

194
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:52.060
what's the relationship between those two?

195
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.490
Are they identical

196
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:01.020
or are they just playing different or are they different than the special way

197
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:03.310
that they're mirror images of one another.

198
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.490
The two on the two on the top left.

199
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.990
All right.
Can you rotate them and make them be on top of one another?
No.

200
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.620
If you rotate them,
they become the same thing they were originally,
right.

201
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.520
That's what we already did.
Are they mirror images of one another,

202
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.050
right?
There's a vertical mirror between them.
Right?

203
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.470
So those are non superimposable mirror images and the name given to things like

204
00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:38.060
that.
Is Ian Anti Omer.
So the one on the left,
the top left,

205
00:13:38.061 --> 00:13:41.920
is that eating a anti Imr of the one that's in the middle?
Caitlin,

206
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:42.763
what's the question?

207
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:49.663
<v 1>Yes.</v>

208
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.480
<v 0>Oh no,
but that's,</v>

209
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.460
but all that means is the grouping c double bond o Ooh.

210
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.310
That doesn't have any arrangement in space when it's just written with letters

211
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:01.930
that way.
Okay.

212
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.550
That was just because I wanted to make strictly the rotation.
Right.

213
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.270
It's where the bonds point that makes a difference.
Okay.

214
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.750
Now how about the relationship between the middle and the right?

215
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.640
Are Those uh,
identical?
Are they super imposable

216
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.060
Elizabeth,
what do you think?
No,
you can't move.

217
00:14:26.061 --> 00:14:28.910
Those are rotate them any way and make them on top of one another.

218
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
Are they mirror images?
So what are they?

219
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.170
They're just playing different.
Their Daya Steria Mers.

220
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.460
So the one in the middle is the ENA,
a tumor of the one on the left.

221
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.880
But the Daya Steria Burr of the one on the right.

222
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.530
So you don't say it's a Daya a stereo or it's an anti tumor.

223
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.510
You say it's a dye,
a stereotype of and the ne Ne Tumor of that.

224
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.060
Right.
So these name relationships.

225
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

226
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.670
<v 0>Okay.
How about those two?
The first than the last.</v>

227
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.870
What's the really proper relationship there?
Maria?

228
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.930
Right.
Dies there.
Amer good.
So we got the idea.
Okay.

229
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:16.610
Now how many,
uh,
I saw him isomers do you have,

230
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:21.611
obviously we have one chiral center you have right handed and left handed if

231
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:24.200
they're four different things on it.
So there are two isomers.

232
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.950
But suppose you have several chiral centers.
That's not so obvious.

233
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:30.020
Then how many of you have a,

234
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:33.890
so if you have n Stereo Magenic centers as they're called.

235
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.340
And each could be right or left.

236
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.140
Then you'd imagine the number of permutations would be two to the Nth,
right,

237
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:48.230
that that would be expected.
But that's not true because of miso compounds.

238
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:53.231
And we'll illustrate that with a quote from van Hoff's brochure in 1877 where he

239
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:58.760
said,
next we consider a symmetrical formula where carbon,

240
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:01.610
the first carbon has one,
two,
three.
The next one has two fours,

241
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:05.030
and the last one has one,
two,
three different substituents.

242
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.610
And also the one where the two in the middle are different,

243
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.890
four and five on the middle carbon as is easily conceived from the foregoing

244
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.840
discussion,

245
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:20.120
they lead to only three isomers because you have this possibility of Mezzo.

246
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:25.280
Okay.
That we just were talking about,
although this is with three centers,

247
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:28.190
possibly in the second one.
Now,

248
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.710
buyer and Fisher were a buyer.

249
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.160
Student of calculator was the,

250
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.540
was the teacher of Fisher and they got together on a,

251
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.630
at a resort on the shore of the Mediterranean,
uh,
the in,

252
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.543
in Italy.

253
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:52.370
And we're trying to figure out this particular question of how many isomers you

254
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.390
have here.
And they had red van Hoff's things,

255
00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:56.480
so they knew that were supposed to be three isomers.

256
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.810
So they were sitting at breakfast and they had bread rolls and they had

257
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.300
toothpicks.
So they started making models of these,

258
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:04.160
I'm trying to count how many isomers,

259
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.720
but they ran out of bread rolls presumably and couldn't answer the questions.

260
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:13.580
They were completely flummoxed by trying to understand what van Hoff was saying.

261
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:19.210
So they gave up on using bread rolls and that is what prompted Fisher to go back

262
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:23.220
and figure out how to make Fischer projections.
Okay,

263
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.740
now let's look at that particular case using Fischer projections.

264
00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:32.570
So we have these three carbons that might have four different things on them.

265
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:37.571
The one in the middle is a little bit tough to decide because the ones on as to

266
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:42.020
whether it has four different things,
obviously it has h o h and a carbon,

267
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.860
but those carbons that are attached are identical.

268
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.630
Constitutionally.
They have the same nature and sequence of bonds,

269
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:52.740
things attached to them,

270
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.680
but they might or might not be the same from the point of view of

271
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:59.160
stereochemistry.
So it's not so obvious how this is gonna work out,

272
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.880
but it turns out that it's really easy if you use Fisher projections,

273
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.750
and we'll try it here.
So here are the five carbons in a row,

274
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.900
the top and the bottom on being coh is,

275
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.680
and you have the three carbons in the middle,

276
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.000
each of which has an h and an o h on it.
But they could be either way.

277
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.170
So at first glance it looks like two to the third right,

278
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:22.470
or eight possible isomers.
So let's check them out.

279
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:25.890
Instead of using bread rolls using Fischer projections.

280
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:30.450
So we'll draw eight Fisher projections and try to be systematic and draw all the

281
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:33.420
possibilities and then count them.
Okay,

282
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:38.280
so first we'll take the bottom a carbon and we'll put in the top row,

283
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:43.110
all the ohs to the right and in the bottom row,
all the ohs to the left.

284
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.130
And then we'll do the analogous thing with the second row,

285
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.700
except we'll make the first two to the right,
the next two to the left,

286
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:54.300
the next two to the right,
the next two to the left.
Okay.
And finally,

287
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:55.860
what are we going to do on the top row?

288
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.720
Can you see how we're going to,
so that we get all eight,
we'll go right,
left,

289
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:07.140
right,
left,
right,
left,
right,
left,
okay.
And now we've got all the possibilities.

290
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.540
So now we have to go through them one by one and see if they're unique or how

291
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:17.280
they are related to the others.
If they're related or they die.
Hysteria.
Mers,

292
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.030
are they enantiomers are they identical?
And we're going to use Fisher,

293
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.980
these Fisher projections to do it.
Okay,
so we've got the first one.
Okay.

294
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.910
And now we look at the second one and compare it to the first one.

295
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.490
Is it the same?
No.
Uh,
is,

296
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:40.320
are they a super imposable?
No,

297
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:43.620
that would make them the same.
Are they uh,

298
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.690
are they mirror images now?
So two is different,

299
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.430
right?
Their dietary IBMers.
Okay.
Now how about the next one?
Three.

300
00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.670
Is it like any of the previous ones or the mirror image of any of the previous

301
00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:04.780
ones?
No.
Three is unique.
Okay.

302
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:09.370
Now how about for,
does it look like any of the preceding ones?

303
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.773
<v 1>Wilson?</v>

304
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.010
<v 0>Ah,
you can rotate it 180 degrees,
which you can allow.
Right.</v>

305
00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:21.310
That'll keep the bonds pointed back in the convention.
Right.

306
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.780
And it'll look like too.
So,
so that one actually is too.

307
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.220
So we'll blank it out.
Now.
How about the first one in the bottom row here?

308
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.060
Does it look like one?
No,

309
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.020
this isn't like three.
No,
it's look like too.

310
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.400
Uh,
that's not so easy.
Right?

311
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.660
But it's not super imposable.
If you rotated 180 degrees,

312
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.710
right about the access into the screen,
it still doesn't look like too,

313
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.450
right.
So it's different for,
how about the next one,

314
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.000
Virginia?
You got an idea?
Does the,
does,

315
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.400
does this one here look like any of the previous ones?
If we rotate it

316
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.793
can't hear.

317
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.300
<v 1>Uh Huh.</v>

318
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:29.000
<v 0>It's like three.
If we rotate it 180 degrees,
it's like three.
So forget that one.</v>

319
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.220
How about the next one?
Does it look like anybody?
We've already seen

320
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.373
<v 1>four,</v>

321
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.580
<v 0>right?
If you rotated 180 degrees,
it's four.
Okay.</v>

322
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.600
And the last one?

323
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.453
<v 1>Pardon me?</v>

324
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.430
<v 0>Like what do you say?
It's one if you rotated 180 degrees.</v>

325
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.933
<v 1>Okay,</v>

326
00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.580
<v 0>so we've got these four that are different now.
What are the relationships?
Okay,</v>

327
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.530
are any of the Mezzo,

328
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:09.090
do any of them have mirror planes so that their own,

329
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.950
they're their own mirror image.

330
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.633
<v 1>Angela</v>

331
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.340
<v 0>one has a mirror image.
At the top is the mirror image of the bottom.</v>

332
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.770
There's the mirror.
Any others?
Three.

333
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:25.220
Hey,

334
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:30.220
this but not to or for anything else that you want to note about two and four.

335
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.650
Sophie,
they're mirror images of one another.

336
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:46.603
Okay.

337
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.670
So what we have are to Misa isomers there diastema members of one another,

338
00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.980
right?
And a pair of enantiomers.

339
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.920
Each of those enantiomers is the enantiomers of one another.

340
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.810
And the dietary them,
or of either of the previous ones?
One and three.
Okay.

341
00:23:02.811 --> 00:23:06.500
So with Fisher projections,
he could easily settle this,
this question,

342
00:23:06.501 --> 00:23:11.501
and that became very important in the chemistry of sugars were Fisher was deeply

343
00:23:11.751 --> 00:23:15.590
involved as we'll see you next semester.
Okay.

344
00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:18.270
Now here's Hallah Condron B,
which is,

345
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.580
which comes from a marine sponge as it says here.
Okay?

346
00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.780
Now you don't get very much of this out of a sponge,
right?

347
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.550
But it was found that it was useful in an anticancer therapy.

348
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:37.030
So the hope was you could make it right and then see if it will work as a good

349
00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:42.770
drug.
So it was found that you don't need the whole molecule.

350
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.730
If you cut it apart to have only this we've seen here,

351
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:52.190
then that part is just as good a medically as the whole molecule.

352
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:56.900
So that simplifies the synthesis problem quite a bit,
but it still nontrivial.

353
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.170
So there's the active fragment of how La Condron,

354
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:05.150
B and s ar means structure,
activity,
relationship.
They'd take off this,

355
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:06.050
take off that,

356
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:10.190
trim it here and so on and change one thing to another thing and see if you,

357
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.060
if you can get better activity than you get from just this thing itself.

358
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.320
And especially looking at the changes that would make it easier to synthesize.

359
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.470
Okay.
So they found out that this one,

360
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:24.460
which is called e seven three eight nine,

361
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:29.510
that model is about as easy as you can get to synthesize and still have really

362
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:31.400
good activity,

363
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:37.030
but it's not easy to synthesize and you have the question that you have to get

364
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:42.050
the right diet.
Astarria Merck as the other dietary mers are different.
Now,

365
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.810
how big a problem is that going to be?
Well,

366
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:47.930
it depends on how many stereo genic centers there are.

367
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:52.610
How many carbons can have generate two isomers right by being right or left

368
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:53.444
handed.

369
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:58.450
So let's start up here at the left and I'll go along this chain like that.

370
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.340
And you stop me when we get to a carbon that's,
that's a chiral.

371
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.050
That's stereo.
Genic okay,

372
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.530
so I'll start here at the top left and I'm going across.

373
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.140
Stop me when I get to one.
Well,

374
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.470
you didn't tell me that one looks at while you say,
oh,

375
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:16.880
that is only three things on it.

376
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:26.330
<v 0>You have to have four different things to be stereo genic does anybody think</v>

378
00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:27.710
that one is stereo?
Agentic

379
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.020
<v 1>Jan,
you
can't hear.</v>

380
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.090
<v 0>Oh,
it doesn't show the hydrogen,
the hydrogens aren't being shown.</v>

381
00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:43.170
So there are in fact four different things on that third,
third atom.
Nitrogen,

382
00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:46.410
carbon.
The second carbon.
Is there a agentic.
Okay,

383
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.830
so there's one.
Now let's keep going.
How about here?

384
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:55.580
<v 1>That one?
No,
that one is two hydrogens.
How about this one?</v>

385
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.400
That's stereo.
Janet,
how about this one?
Yeah.
How about this one?

386
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.130
Hey,
how about this one?
Okay.
How about this one?

387
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.700
This one.
This one.

388
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.370
<v 0>Ah,
that's got four bonds already know hydrogens there.</v>

389
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:20.390
<v 1>Okay.
That one's not there.
Here and there.</v>

390
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.000
There,
there,
there,
there?
Yeah.

391
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:29.000
That's got four there.
Yep.

392
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.200
There.
Yup.

393
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.230
For different things.
Because you have to count the hydrogen here.

394
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.460
Yup.
The hydrogen also that in the and shows the hydrogen.

395
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.850
All right here?
Yeah.

396
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.960
Here.
Here.
No.
Here.

397
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.400
<v 0>Well,
you say there are two oxygens,
right?
Are they the same?
No.</v>

398
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:05.550
They're attached to different things,
right?
So that one too.

399
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.790
<v 1>Okay.
Here?
No.
No.
Here.</v>

400
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:18.310
How many things?
So Yup.
Right?
That one.
The next one.

401
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.890
This one?
Yes or no?
Here?
No.
Here.

402
00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.930
Yes.
Here.
Speak Up.

403
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.440
And there's one more carbon here?
No.
Okay,

404
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.720
<v 0>well done.
There are 19 stereo Magenic centers.</v>

405
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.940
That means there are two to the 19th possible isomers.
Will any of them be Misa?

406
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:58.350
So are you going to get any mirror images within this molecule?

407
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.430
No,
it's completely unsymmetric right?
It's not like tartaric acid.

408
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.080
So they're going to be something like something greater than half a million

409
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.920
configurational isomers so it's not just a question of putting the right groups

410
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:15.300
in the right place to get constitution.
You have to put them stereo chemically.

411
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:18.480
Correct.
Right.
To get one out of a million.

412
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.590
Right.
So this is a problem,

413
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.040
but they figured out how to do it.
And this,

414
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.900
I just got this this morning off the web.
Uh,
pardon me.
It's a,

415
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.010
it'll say so at the top,

416
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:36.300
but this is the current report on clinical testing of this.
So testing in humans.

417
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.380
Some of them are in,
like if you look at the top one,
it's in phase three.

418
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:45.420
In phase one,
they test for toxicity with humans and obviously it's toxic.

419
00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:49.080
You can't use it as a drug.
The next one they test does it work.

420
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.730
And the third they test whether it's better than current things for doing it and

421
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.860
what the proper dose should be and so on.

422
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.810
So this is in phase three trials and they're recruiting people to web,

423
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:04.230
sorry,
I've got the brush,
the ramen there recruiting subjects for it.

424
00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:06.540
They already have 1100 people in it.

425
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.750
It started in June,
2006 and this was updated in uh,

426
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.130
last May and it's to,

427
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.890
doesn't have a completion date given there.

428
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.670
This one has a completion date of March,
2010,
but in fact,

429
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.020
this is the objective to see what the quality of life is.
Tumor response rate,

430
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.550
duration of response,
how many survived?
One,
two and three years in this,

431
00:29:29.551 --> 00:29:34.551
I have breast cancer test and it's being compared with another drug as it says

432
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:37.810
there.
Uh,
so here.
So here's the,
uh,

433
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.950
what they're comparing the two different things.
Some people do this,

434
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:44.230
some people do this.
So the drug,

435
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.640
this drug is injected 1.4 milligrams per square meter,

436
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:52.390
ivy infusion over two to five minutes on days one and eight,

437
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.080
every 21 days.
And it's being compared with this drug,

438
00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.220
which has two and a half grams per square meter per day administered orally,

439
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:03.340
twice daily,
and two equal doses,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Okay.

440
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:05.860
So that's the test that's under,
that's being undergone now.

441
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.150
And the estimated primary completion date is September,
2011.

442
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:14.620
It's been going since June,
2006.
So it's still going to be five years,
right?

443
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:18.850
That they're doing this test with 1100 people.
So these are really,

444
00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:23.770
really expensive things.
And you notice it says it's being,
uh,
uh,

445
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.500
maybe it was on a previous slide that it's being funded by,

446
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.520
by industry because they hope that it'll work and then there'll be able to

447
00:30:30.521 --> 00:30:34.990
recoup their costs and make a profit on the basis of selling the drug
afterwards.

448
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:40.480
Okay.
That if you go to this,
uh,
uh,
uh,
NIH website,

449
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:42.040
clinical trials.gov,

450
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:47.310
you find that they have 64,268 trials in 158 country a country's going as of

451
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:51.820
today.
So these are very,
very long,

452
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:54.640
expensive things to try to get a drug that will work.

453
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.260
But making that stuff was really something.
But if they get a hit,

454
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.450
then the company is on easy street for awhile,
at least like Lipitor.

455
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.490
So here's the Lipitor pill,

456
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.820
which is the world's best selling drug in 2004 it's sold almost $11 billion,

457
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.640
right?
And it's so,

458
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:20.641
but it raised a $10 billion problem in stereo chemical notation that I'll show

459
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:23.554
to you here.

460
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.720
So this is a news report from 2005 date line New York,

461
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.880
Pfizer Inc won a significant victory on Wednesday when a British judge upheld a

462
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:38.650
key patent country covering it's blockbuster cholesterol,
drug,

463
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:40.210
Lipitor,
and the United Kingdom.

464
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.800
But the medications still faces a similar yet more important case in the United

465
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.540
States.
And that was decided in 2006 in the same way in the u s Court of Appeals.

466
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:50.771
Okay.

467
00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:55.771
So judge Nicholas Pumphrey in in the high court in London upheld the patent

468
00:31:55.841 --> 00:31:59.080
covering a tour of a staton lip,
a tours active ingredient,

469
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:01.630
but ruled that another patent was invalid.

470
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.800
Indian pharmaceutical company ran Baxi laboratories limited.

471
00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:10.600
A generic chemical company had challenged both patents and was joined by

472
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:11.470
Britain's Arrow.

473
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:15.250
Generics limited against the second patent that was ruled invalid.

474
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:20.830
Pfizer said the decision upholding the exclusivity of the patent covering a tour

475
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:23.320
of a Staton until November,

476
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.320
2011 was an important victory for scientists and perhaps also for stockholders

477
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.630
and executives of Pfizer.
Okay.

478
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.860
Now what is patented?
Here's the patent that was under discussion.
The,

479
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.190
this is the US version.
There was also a version.
Okay,

480
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:44.900
so let's patent number 4,681,893 from 1987.

481
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:50.570
Okay,
so the,
the,
the important part of a patent is the claims at the end.

482
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:52.250
What's the be protected?
And it said,

483
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:56.090
I claim a compound of structural Formula One.

484
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.010
So this compound,

485
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.203
<v 1>okay.</v>

486
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.660
<v 0>And notice that it has,
uh,
codes in here.</v>

487
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:10.661
Like x can be any of those groups linking the right and the left are one can be

488
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:15.140
any of those groups are too in our three can be any of these groups

489
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.540
still going are four can be any of these groups or it can be a hydroxy instead

490
00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:27.490
of being this kind of Esther,
which is called a lactone at forms a ring,

491
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.410
it could be the acid that you'd get from that by hydrolyzing it or assault of

492
00:33:32.411 --> 00:33:36.310
that acid.
Okay.
So all those things are covered in that patent.

493
00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.920
How many molecules are covered in the patent.

494
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.580
If you made all the permutations of those groups,

495
00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.610
you'd find that it's greater than the number of protons,

496
00:33:45.611 --> 00:33:48.190
neutrons and electrons in the solar system.

497
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.000
So it's obviously impossible to make all the molecules.

498
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:56.350
You'd need quite a few solar systems to have enough particles to do it with.

499
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.980
Okay.
But the patent is supposed to protect that.

500
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:04.960
Okay.
Now,
uh,
so here we sh what's,

501
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:09.580
but what is patented and what was being discussed was not what those groups are.

502
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.560
That wasn't in con in contention.
It's known that Lipitor is this stuff,

503
00:34:14.561 --> 00:34:18.820
the calcium,
salt.
And it has those particular our groups on it.

504
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.020
But that wasn't in question.
The fact that it covered so many compounds.

505
00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:28.350
What was in question was what the Stereo chemistry is because Lipitor the drug

506
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.500
is a single lien antitumor

507
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:33.960
<v 1>right now,</v>

508
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.870
<v 0>not it's mirror image and not a mixture.
Not Harassing me.
Okay.</v>

509
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.660
But the question is did this patent cover the single Lien Angie Mar,

510
00:34:43.661 --> 00:34:47.980
which is what the picture shows,
although it doesn't show it very well,

511
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:52.790
why not?
If you were drawing this structure on the top right,

512
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:56.850
would you draw it that way?
How about that carbon?

513
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.370
Does it show its tetrahedron?

514
00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:04.510
Well it certainly doesn't show 190 degree angles,

515
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.290
but it's at this day should be up here,

516
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.860
right to be even close.
How about that carbon?

517
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:17.050
That's even worse if you are trying to really show the angle cause that one's

518
00:35:17.051 --> 00:35:18.280
180 degrees,

519
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.880
but at least it's unambiguous about about that versus it's mirror image even

520
00:35:24.071 --> 00:35:28.210
though it's not very good.
Right.
It's not ambiguous.

521
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:29.640
So the,
the,

522
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:34.650
the structure drawn in the patent was a singly Nan tumor and it turned out to be

523
00:35:34.691 --> 00:35:37.890
the one that is Lipitor.
Okay.

524
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.430
But the text of the patent didn't,

525
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:46.710
didn't do anything it never resolved at and made it into one in antitumor.
Right.

526
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.190
It just,
it just talked about it generically and what it was,

527
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.670
what would be making is the Rasamayi not the single antivirus.

528
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.710
So does the patent cover Lipitor or doesn't,
was was the question for the judge.

529
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.870
Okay.
So this is his opinion.
He said the six three,
three patent,
they uh,

530
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.750
when they talk about patents,
they just talk a lot.
The last three digits,

531
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:07.650
not the big number.

532
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:13.490
It is absolutely clear from context throughout that Formula One is being used to

533
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:18.210
denote a Rasamayi.
So what they talked about,
what they prepared,

534
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:22.830
tested and so on was both he enantiomers.
Okay.
In my judgment,

535
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:27.831
every time the skilled person sees Formula One or formula 10,

536
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.680
now skilled person has a very special meaning.

537
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:36.480
It means someone who is skilled in the art that knows about pharmaceutical

538
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:39.180
chemistry and so on,
knows what these compounds are,

539
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:44.181
how to make them and that kind of thing but is not creative because what you can

540
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:46.770
patent his original creation.

541
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.600
So the skilled person knows everything but can't figure anything out if you see

542
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:54.360
what I mean.
Can't devise anything new.
Okay.

543
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:56.610
So the skilled person sees these formulas,

544
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:01.920
he will see them with eyes that tell him that in that Rasamayi which is

545
00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:03.210
described in the text,

546
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:07.950
there is a single lien antitumor that is the effective compound.

547
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.230
So even though what's described as both the person that's,

548
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.200
that isn't very swift but,
but is knowledgeable,

549
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.490
knows that within that one there'll be two mirror images and one of them will do

550
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:21.930
the trick and not the other one.

551
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:27.140
So you don't have to be creative to know that and he will know that he can

552
00:37:27.571 --> 00:37:31.800
resolve the Ras summate using conventional techniques.

553
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.450
He doesn't have to invent something new in order to get from that mixture.

554
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:41.490
The one that will be the active one.
Okay.
So that's not creative.

555
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:43.763
Okay.

556
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:48.270
When one comes to claim one which echoes the purpose of the invention with its

557
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:52.440
conventional reference to pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
He will,

558
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:57.180
in my judgment,
continue to see the forum in this light.
So the salts,

559
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:02.020
same deal,
right?
In my view,
the claim covers the Ras,

560
00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:04.470
a mate and the individually and antivirus.

561
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:08.250
So the person without any creativity knows that yes,

562
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:09.840
the patent described the Rasamayi,

563
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.560
but there'll be one in there that I can get and that'll be the useful drug and

564
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:17.120
it doesn't take anything great to get there.
We'll talk about that soon.

565
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:21.240
How you would do that,
why it's why it's well known.
Okay,

566
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.830
so this is good news for Pfizer,
right?
Their patent holds that.

567
00:38:25.831 --> 00:38:30.360
They put out a press release saying this is a victory for science.
Okay?

568
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:35.630
But it's in a sense of pyrrhic victory because they had a later patent on the

569
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.930
single lien anti tumor,

570
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:43.723
<v 1>right?</v>

571
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.280
<v 0>And now that patent is invalid because if the first patent covers it,</v>

572
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:51.220
you can't just,
every three years come up and say,
I patent this again.

573
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:52.150
I patent this again,

574
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:56.200
I patent this again and keep getting another 15 years of exclusivity.

575
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.160
Right?
So once they were covered by the first patent,

576
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.530
the second patent isn't invalid.

577
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.350
Why do they care if they're already covered by the first patent?

578
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.460
Isn't that good news,

579
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.713
<v 1>Dana?</v>

580
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:16.700
<v 0>Ah,
they're going to run out.
So this means that three years earlier,</v>

581
00:39:16.701 --> 00:39:21.701
their patents is going to run out right at four or $5 billion a year.

582
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:27.320
That makes it adds up.
Okay,
now,

583
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:28.340
so drug,

584
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.520
so there conventions for how you name things including Stereo Chemistry.

585
00:39:34.131 --> 00:39:36.640
In fact,
there was a stamp issued in a,

586
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:41.660
in Switzerland in 1992 commemorating the 100th year of the Geneva Convention

587
00:39:42.471 --> 00:39:43.910
where chemists got together.

588
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.880
Once they knew stuff about how things were connected,

589
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.690
then they had to agree on how to describe it on what the nomenclature and the

590
00:39:50.691 --> 00:39:51.920
notation should be.

591
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.150
So the International Union of Pure and applied chemistry continues this and you

592
00:39:56.151 --> 00:39:59.960
can go to these websites and learn about what the rules are for notation.

593
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.850
So the four.

594
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:06.140
So they had to devise rules for what you want to do when you make a name for a

595
00:40:06.141 --> 00:40:10.760
compound.
So what,
what this may be the first thing you want to do,

596
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:17.250
<v 1>Nate.
What?
No,
not yet.</v>

597
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.520
<v 0>Well,
let's see.
Let's try somebody else.
Andrew,</v>

598
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.310
<v 1>not known.
Kate.</v>

599
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.833
Okay.

600
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.580
<v 0>Hey,
what's,
what was the,
what was the first role being,</v>

601
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.953
<v 1>well,</v>

602
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.800
<v 0>no,
I didn't mean to you anyhow.</v>

603
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.360
So what's the first rule about names?

604
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.720
<v 1>Oh,
John,
not you.</v>

605
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.710
Other Kate.

606
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.910
<v 0>Ah,
they should be unique.
There should only be one person,
one,</v>

607
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.520
one compound that has that name that you shouldn't say.

608
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.780
Take this and they take the wrong John or the wrong Kate or the wrong Andrew.

609
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.700
Right?
So the very first thing should,
well,
it shouldn't,
it should be Kate.

610
00:41:22.701 --> 00:41:23.990
You were right.
The first,

611
00:41:23.991 --> 00:41:26.840
it has to be clearly descriptive of what the compound is.

612
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.120
And so it has to tell composition,
constitution configuration and con formation.

613
00:41:32.121 --> 00:41:33.500
Maybe if you care,

614
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:38.420
I he stereo chemistry and it can be like this e seven three,

615
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:40.190
eight,
nine was the name of that compound.

616
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:43.790
Forget trying to name it systematically according to rules.
Right?

617
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.330
He is for Asi,
the name of the pharmaceutical company,

618
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:50.840
and this is their 7389th compound.
Right?

619
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:55.040
But at least everybody knows what that means.
Right?
If you are,

620
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:57.770
you can look it up.
But this is what we were just talking about.

621
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:02.060
It has to be unambiguous,
right?
One name must mean one structure,

622
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:05.090
not some other structure as well.
Okay.

623
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:10.180
So unfortunately amid doesn't fit that bill because it means the anti and have

624
00:42:10.731 --> 00:42:14.600
an a mean.
But it also means that functional group we're talking about,

625
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.140
so same name,
you have to figure out from context which one you're talking about.

626
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:23.000
It also has to be unique.
One structure is one name.

627
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:26.780
So everybody will have the same name for the compound,
right?

628
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:31.810
Is that which is more important that it'd be unambiguous or that it be unique?

629
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.320
Like you could have two names for the same compound,

630
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:43.790
like Bromo butane and beautiful bromide,

631
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.290
right?
And if you put a number in,
you would know which,

632
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.350
which were the bromine was okay.

633
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.490
Or Bromo Ethane and ethyl bromide.

634
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.840
Two different names.
Right?
So it's not you.
The names aren't unique,

635
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.940
right,
but they're unambiguous.
You know what compound you're talking about.

636
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:10.330
Why would you care whether you have on whether you have just one agreed on name

637
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:14.150
by the people who get together in the International Union of pure and applied

638
00:43:14.151 --> 00:43:17.510
chemistry.
Why would you care what's wrong with having two names?

639
00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:24.150
Anybody see any disadvantage to having different names for the same compound?

640
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:32.640
Sam?
I could called Sam to,
yeah,

641
00:43:32.641 --> 00:43:33.474
go ahead.

642
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.160
Not if everybody knows what you're talking about.

643
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.360
<v 1>Shy has a lot of names that</v>

644
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.080
I'm actually here to get to a point where someone doesn't know.

645
00:43:48.081 --> 00:43:50.900
You can say that you're going to say a name and they're not going to know group

646
00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.230
<v 0>or if you have to look it up,</v>

647
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.050
you have to choose the right name to look it up.

648
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.640
So this was more important when you didn't have computers to do the work for
you.

649
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.170
When you had to look in an index and get and be looking for the right name that

650
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:10.100
everyone agreed and the person who made up the index entered it there.
Nowadays,

651
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:13.090
you can draw a structure often on the screen,
right in the,

652
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.910
and the computer will figure out what the official name is and then look it up.

653
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:18.960
But anyhow,
that's that,
that,

654
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.400
so it's not as important that it be unique is that it'd be unambiguous.

655
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:23.720
But if you're looking things up,

656
00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:27.320
it's very nice if you know that everybody will have named it a certain way.

657
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:32.700
So you can also index things according to their composition or using computer

658
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:36.840
graphics as we say.
And if possible,
the name should be manageable,

659
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.560
right?
It should be possible to write it fairly quickly.

660
00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:45.150
It should be easy to figure out short if possible and pronounceable if possible

661
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.130
so that you can talk about it.

662
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.820
Now let's look at a systematic constitutional nomenclature for this sort of

663
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:56.640
intermediate,
really complex compound compared to these others we've looked at.

664
00:44:56.641 --> 00:45:00.360
It's not much.
Okay.
So the first thing you do,

665
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:04.770
these people decided when you get together is decide what the main chain of

666
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:09.771
carbons is cause that will provide the root with a Greek designation that says,

667
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.480
uh,
what the number of things in.

668
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:17.481
So we have to find a carbon chain and we'll find the longest carbon chain.

669
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.350
We could take this one

670
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.690
or we could take that one.
Which one is longer?

671
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.920
One.
It could be an octane or it could be a no name.

672
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:35.090
Which one should we choose?
Well,
if we could,

673
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.870
we could have decided to take the shortest one,
but that's sort of silly.

674
00:45:38.871 --> 00:45:43.340
There'd be a zillion shortest ones or the short ones,
right?
Or even shortest.

675
00:45:43.341 --> 00:45:47.480
The shortest is one carbon,
I guess,
but there's only one longest one.
Right?

676
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.613
Wrong.

677
00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.600
Because there's also that one same length.

678
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.560
So now we have to decide when we,
when we're going to take the longest,

679
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:09.020
how are we going to choose if there are two of them?
Well,

680
00:46:09.021 --> 00:46:13.610
what you choose by is the number of substituents.
Okay.

681
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.040
Because that one has one,
two,
three,
four,

682
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:20.180
five substituents and this one has four substituents,

683
00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.170
which will you choose the one with four or the one with five?

684
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:28.820
You have to make the rule up
five or four.

685
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:31.723
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:36.280
<v 0>Well,
somebody said for why
Sophie,</v>

687
00:46:36.281 --> 00:46:40.420
you said for there'd be less naming to do.
Aha,

688
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:41.291
but,

689
00:46:41.291 --> 00:46:46.291
but in fact they chose the most substituents and you'll see why shortly.

690
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.730
Okay,
so you choose the most substituents.
So you choose the one on the top,

691
00:46:51.731 --> 00:46:55.420
not the one in the middle.
Now why Sophie's not happy with this,

692
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:56.890
but you'll see soon.

693
00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.960
Now you have to number the carbon atoms to say where the substituents are.

694
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:07.060
Now we could start from either end,
right?
If we start one,
we could go one,
two,

695
00:47:07.061 --> 00:47:10.390
three with green and continue,
or one,
two,
three with red from the other end.

696
00:47:10.391 --> 00:47:14.050
And continue.
Now how are we going to decide which way to go,

697
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.293
<v 1>Kevin?</v>

698
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:31.120
<v 0>Okay,
there are two ways to do it.
You could make it so the overall,</v>

699
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.760
some of the numbers you're going to get,

700
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.490
because you'll get different numbers according to which can just start from,

701
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.640
you could sum them all up and see which one gives the lowest som and choose that

702
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:43.930
one or the highest psalm you could do.

703
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:49.830
Or You could see which one gives the f the lowest number at the first number.

704
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.950
So this,
if you chose the red,
you'd have to chloro.

705
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:59.170
If you chose the green,
you'd have three Bromo.
Right.

706
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.420
And the other numbers would all be higher.
Which one do you want to do?
Use the,

707
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.360
the lowest.

708
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:08.860
Some of all the numbers or the lowest number at the first difference.

709
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.900
Lucas.
Why?
So you can actually build it as you go instead of just saying,

710
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:14.921
yeah,

711
00:48:14.921 --> 00:48:17.380
so you don't have to do all the work and going through the whole thing and they

712
00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:19.870
added them all up and so on.
You just go to you,
you've got a difference.

713
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:23.860
And when you get a difference,
that's it.
That's much quicker.
Okay.

714
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.390
So we'll go to the first difference,

715
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.570
lowest number at the first difference and now we have to say,

716
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.440
now we know we have the chain and it's numbers and now we say where are the

717
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:33.850
various substituents are.

718
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.080
But first we have to name the substituents.

719
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:42.950
Now in the top you can see we have methyl Bromo,

720
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.280
methyl ethyl and chloro.

721
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:47.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

722
00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:51.050
<v 0>Now had we followed Sophie,
right?</v>

723
00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.110
We would have to name that one.
And that's not as easy to name.

724
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.030
So the fewer substituents that you have,
the harder they are to name.

725
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.940
Because they get more complicated,
right?

726
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.790
So that's why you choose to have the most substituents.

727
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.780
So there'll be the easiest to name,
you have to do more,
but it's easier.

728
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.180
That particular one is called one chloro Ethel.

729
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.310
But why have to main complicated things if you've been named simple things.
Okay,

730
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.300
so you choose the most substituents in order to get simpler names,

731
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:27.190
then you alphabetize them.
You don't put them on by order or their number,

732
00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:31.960
you alphabetize the names of the groups and you and you count.

733
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.880
So that compound is seven Bromo be his first two,

734
00:49:36.881 --> 00:49:40.990
Claro,
Si three Ethel,
six,

735
00:49:40.991 --> 00:49:44.050
seven die methyl,
no name.

736
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.450
Now you might say die methyl should be alphabetized by d,

737
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:53.830
Not by em.
But that's not the way it's done.
It's done by the group name.

738
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.360
And then the,
the,
the,
uh,
the prefix that tells the,
the,
uh,

739
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:03.250
number doesn't enter in to the,
to the alphabetizing usually,

740
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:08.170
although some people do it the other way.
Okay?

741
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.850
So,
uh,
so that's the question about the deed.
Okay.

742
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.880
Now if you go to this website,
you can get help with nomenclature.

743
00:50:15.881 --> 00:50:17.680
Here's a compound that it goes through.

744
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.510
And the minute you look at this and see the name at the bottom,

745
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:26.260
the compound name,
four or five dy chloro to,
for chloro,
two hydroxy mouth,

746
00:50:26.261 --> 00:50:30.590
all five oxo Hexcel cyclohexane one carboxylic acid,

747
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:35.690
you'd say,
wow,
and aren't you glad there are computers that can do this for you?

748
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.150
But you can go through it,
uh,
uh,

749
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.270
and figure out why they did it that way.
But,
but,

750
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:48.590
you know,
that's sort of a parlor game.
It's not fundamental chemistry.

751
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:50.390
Okay.

752
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:55.370
But there's some very useful non systematic names for simple groups.

753
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.000
Iso,
butane,
ISO,
Pentane,
neo pentane.

754
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:03.440
So you can have an ISO butyl group or an ISO Pendle group or a neopentyl group.

755
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.390
Ice approachable secondary,
butyl tertiary,
butyl neopentyl.

756
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:12.140
So these names you just have to learn,
right?
They're not systematic.

757
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:13.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

758
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:18.250
<v 0>Uh,
and there's a nomenclature w drill available on the course website,</v>

759
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:22.090
so it's good to know these so we can talk to one another.
But in principle,

760
00:51:22.091 --> 00:51:25.150
the systematic name is the way to go.
Okay.
That's it.

761
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:27.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

762
00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.750
<v 0>But we haven't gotten to stereochemistry yet.
That'll be tomorrow or Monday.</v>

763
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
