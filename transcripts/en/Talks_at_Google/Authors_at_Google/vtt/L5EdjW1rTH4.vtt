00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:03.250
MALE SPEAKER: So
welcome everyone.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.550
Welcome to this Google
Talk Authors Talk.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.790
We're joined by Michael Horn.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm going to do a little
bit of introduction.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.030
Michael Horn is the co-founder
of the Clay Christensen

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.685
Institute and author
of a couple of books

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.060
and a bunch of publications
that we're going to get into,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.680
but the first book that
Michael and I met around

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.020
was "Disrupting Class."

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.978
I don't know if you've
had a chance to read it,

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:30.080
I recommend it.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.540
Him and Clay wrote a book about
what the future of learning

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.050
looks like and how technology
was going disrupt education,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.970
and when did that book--

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.850
MICHAEL HORN: 2008.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.641
MALE SPEAKER: 2008.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.950
So I read that book,
and that's what,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.140
for me, caused me to get more
interested in how technology

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.700
can impact at least K-12.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.070
At that time we were working
with a lot of universities.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.980
And so I want to
talk a little bit

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.059
about that book and the
impact that book had,

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.100
but I also want to get
into the second book which

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.895
you wrote called "Blended."

00:00:58.895 --> 00:00:59.603
I have this here.

00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:01.315
This is not a
present for you, this

00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:02.710
is actually a present for me.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.640
I just did a keynote at
that Education Elements

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.025
down in San Jose and they handed
me a present, which was nice,

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:11.900
and so I grabbed the
present put it in my bag

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.150
and I came back to the office.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.030
And I'm like, oh, I
wonder what this is,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.170
and so I will open
it up for you.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.150
I wonder what this
present could possibly be.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.860
Oh, look.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.544
It's "Blended" by Michael Horn.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.710
MICHAEL HORN: It was nice
to them to give it to you.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890
MALE SPEAKER: It was nice
of them to give to me,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.000
and what's interesting is
I've actually opened it up

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.016
to the first page and one
of the reviewers is me.

00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:38.890
MICHAEL HORN: Is you.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.949
MALE SPEAKER: I all ready read
the book and gave them a quote.

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:43.490
So anyways, I thought
that was funny.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.700
So we have books in
the back for sale.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.490
There's a couple up here that
we can give away as well,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.692
but I wanted to get started
with this idea of thinking

00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:54.650
about blended learning.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.012
You hear that terminology a lot.

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:58.220
There's a lot of terminology
that gets tossed around,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.110
so one, I want you to
introduce yourself,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.440
talk a little bit more
about your background,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.898
and then we'll get into some
questions that I have for you.

00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:04.740
MICHAEL HORN: Sure.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.240
First of all, thanks
for hosting me.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.479
I appreciate it, and
thanks for all coming out.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.800
So when we were writing
Disrupting Class starting

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.130
in 2006 after I graduated
from Harvard Business School

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.090
and was one of Clay's students,
and he literally snapped me

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.590
up and was like
we're going to write

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.160
a book using our
theories to solve

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.460
the problems in education.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.910
I was like, that sounds cool,
and so I dove in and started

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.510
working on it with him, and the
book took two years to write.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.280
And about midway
through, in 2007 May,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.821
actually, we decided to start
up the Clayton Christensen

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:39.320
Institute.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.660
It was originally called
[? Innocite ?] Institute,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.750
as a think tank, nonprofit,
nonpartisan think tank

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.975
where we would be
able to just continue

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.460
to do research around these
really difficult problems

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.714
facing society.

00:02:51.714 --> 00:02:54.130
We also have a health care
practice in some other emerging

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.720
research areas as a place just
to continue the conversation,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.980
do research, and then
really effect change itself.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.210
What Clay did not want was to
write an interesting book that

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.716
would gather dust
on people shelves

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:07.090
and would not
create real change.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.630
We really wanted to be out there
helping make change happen,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.534
so I now run the education
practice at the Clayton

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:14.450
Christensen Institute.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.164
We have a team of just about 10
people-- a mix of researchers

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:19.830
and some others.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.390
A lot of people, like myself,
who are on the road quite a bit

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.750
talking with educators,
talking with policymakers,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.660
really taking the
research that we've

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.120
been doing using these theories
of disruptive innovation

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.560
into how we can create a
student-centered education

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.830
system, move away from
our factory model,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.200
allow every child to realize
his or her fullest potential,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.590
how we can actually move forward
together to make that happen.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.910
And so I think we've been in
a dialogue with the education

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.250
community over the
last eight, nine years

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.110
really about how we
move that forward.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.943
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:56.866
And things have progressed quite
a lot since the first time you

00:03:56.866 --> 00:04:00.512
and I met at Harvard
in 2007, 2008.

00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:02.970
MICHAEL HORN: I think Disrupting
Class was just coming out,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.490
and it was sort of we had this
crazy prediction in the book

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.090
that by 2019 50%
of all high school

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.900
courses would be offered
online in some way or fashion.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.460
Most of which would
be in schools,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.649
and everyone was like,
well, that's kind of crazy,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.870
and it doesn't feel
so crazy anymore.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.690
I mean, I think we're
well on the way.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.290
Teachers are flipping
their classrooms

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.680
all over the country.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.760
We're seeing interesting
station-rotation models

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.680
in lots of classrooms.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.630
We're seeing schools use online
learning to connect students

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.070
to teachers that don't
live in the same zip code

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.500
for schools that don't have
access to foreign language

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.700
teachers or advanced
classes, and that's

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.430
a really exciting thing.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.680
MALE SPEAKER: So let's
start with some definitions.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.020
MICHAEL HORN: OK.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.960
MALE SPEAKER: So you
have an audience here,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.774
some that get what
we're talking about,

00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:49.690
some that don't know
what we're talking about.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.130
So Disrupting Class
led to this book,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.870
which is a little more
specific, I would.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.161
It's a little more this is
how you do it kind of thing.

00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:58.355
So what is blended learning?

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:00.480
MICHAEL HORN: Let me just
give a little background.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.720
What happened around 2009, 2010
was you had a couple schools

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.220
around the country
that people said,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.520
we're doing "blended
learning," and they

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.110
would go to
education conferences

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.760
that Jamie and I
would often be at,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.810
and they would get up on a panel
and start yelling at each other

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.027
that I'm blended
learning and you're not.

00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:20.610
And it was about the stupidest
conversation you could possibly

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.430
imagine happening.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.870
So what we did at
that time was we

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.980
looked at about 100 schools
the people said yeah,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.200
this feels like some blended
learning is going on,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.965
talked over 100 educators and
came up with this definition.

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.590
And so I'll give you
the technical one,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.930
but then I'll simplify.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.990
The technical one
has three parts.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.280
It's any time a students
in a formal education

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.810
program in which they're
learning online at least

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.330
part of the time where they
have some element of control

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.230
over the time, the
place, the path,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.960
and/or the pace of
learning, so the student

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.779
starts to be empowered
in this experience.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.320
The second part is it's got to
be at least in part in a brick

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.040
and mortar location away from
home with supervision, so

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.790
schools, teachers.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.340
And then the third part
is that the experiences

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.920
that a student enjoys they
have to be connected somehow

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.030
within a given
subject or discipline,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.270
so what you do
offline has to connect

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.910
to the online experience.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.644
So in other words, when I
was in school and teachers

00:06:21.644 --> 00:06:24.060
wanted to kick me out because
I was just being distracting

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.851
or I had already mastered
something in math

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.030
and they'd say "go do Oregon
Trail," not blended learning.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.000
Right?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.690
The deer and the
buffalo or whatever

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.110
that I killed in
Oregon Trail had

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.130
nothing to do with
what I was learning

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.880
in the classroom
with the teacher,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.710
so those experiences
have to be connected.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.070
So the real thing is just to say
online learning blending itself

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.520
into our schools with teachers.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.621
Students get some sort of
control over their learning,

00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.120
and those experiences
are connected.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.510
MALE SPEAKER: So where
are we on that path?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.661
Like where are things today when
it comes to blended learning?

00:06:58.661 --> 00:07:00.910
MICHAEL HORN: So blended
learning I think is exploding

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.520
way more than the quote unquote,
"ed-reform conversation"

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.260
actually popularly acknowledges.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.450
By some estimates, 75%
of school districts

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.030
are doing some form of blended
learning across the country

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.019
right now.

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:15.310
And we're seeing really
interesting whole-school models

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.490
use blended learning to
literally reinvent what they do

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.770
and what the teaching and
learning experience looks

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.052
like for students and teachers
in really positive ways.

00:07:24.052 --> 00:07:26.260
If we're being honest, a
lot of that blended learning

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.386
is not stuff that we should
get excited about also.

00:07:28.386 --> 00:07:30.301
MALE SPEAKER: So talk a
little bit about that.

00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:31.800
What does that mean?

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.260
MICHAEL HORN: I think actually
the original definition

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.300
that people wanted for blended
learning was the best of online

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.820
learning with the best of
brick and mortar schools,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.810
and that's great.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.500
That's what I hope
happens, but if we're

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.920
being honest a lot of
things that you see out

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.800
there that could
be called nothing

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.630
except blended learning are not
places we would want to send

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.250
our kids to necessarily.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.890
They may be just sort of Night
of The Living Dead experiences

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.431
where students are clicking away
at multiple choice questions

00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:58.411
on a computer, a
teacher is there,

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.410
but they're filing their
nails because they feel

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.480
like they've been replaced.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.771
This isn't a good experience,
and if we're being honest

00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:05.580
there's a fair amount
of that going on.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.690
And so my sense of where
we are in this pathway

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.470
is blended learning is happening
whether we like it or not.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.460
The exciting thing
about it is the ability

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.330
to personalize an education for
every student's distinct needs

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.940
so that they can
find their passion

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.170
and realize their
potential, but we

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.600
have to really be pushing
people in that quality piece

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.480
now, and educating people
about the possibilities

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.560
that it delivers
for the first time

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.289
in human history for
every single child,

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.720
but we're not there yet.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.210
MALE SPEAKER: So
talk about the role

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.990
of technology in this world.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.350
Where were we, what do you
see, and what's needed?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.100
So the magic
question-- where do you

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.025
see technology's role in this
blended learning environment?

00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:50.650
MICHAEL HORN: Maybe
it's useful to talk

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.270
about this as a trajectory, but
where I think online learning

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.440
and technology first
started in this environment

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.425
was really whole
class experiences that

00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:00.800
were delivered
online where you'd

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.940
write an entire curriculum
for a particular course

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.330
and students would jump
on and have a teacher

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.350
sort of facilitating
and tutoring

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.330
alongside that experience, but
really the course curriculum

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.580
was all in this package
content from one vendor.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.130
Where I think we've
started to evolve to

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.650
is that teachers in
schools are actually

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.230
using a variety of content
in learning experiences

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.120
from online from a
variety of sources

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.630
to custom configure
that learning experience

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.210
for students.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.930
And so you might see a classroom
in Los Angeles, California

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.666
at a school serving kindergarten
through fifth grade students

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:39.540
where students are
rotating through a variety

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.410
of experiences, one of which
is that online learning.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.060
Some kids will be
working on a program

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.040
like ST Math learning math
through a visual way of playing

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.020
a game.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.620
Other students will
be doing DreamBox

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.020
learning-- very different way.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.436
And still, other
students might be

00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:55.680
on Khan Academy
learning math depending

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.540
on their particular
point in their learning

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.157
and what they're
trying to work on.

00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:01.990
And I think the big
challenge that we're now

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.897
facing right now for teachers
on the ground is great,

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.230
there's all these options,
there's a lot of free content

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.330
out there on the web that I
can use and so forth and then

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.651
connect my students with
different learning experiences,

00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:16.650
and all these things are
spitting of data for me

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.441
that I can figure out
where my students are

00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:20.800
and help them navigate
different pathways.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.400
Holy cow.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.020
How do I get these software
programs to really talk

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.700
to each other in a
way that's meaningful

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.210
so I can do something
actionable for students.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.020
And I think that's where we are
right now where there haven't

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.160
really been platforms
that have emerged yet

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.660
that have helped make sense
of this very fragmented world

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.560
that's emerging.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.610
MALE SPEAKER: So
you're at Google.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.450
We have various tools.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.350
From an education perspective we
have Google Apps for education,

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.014
we have Classroom, we have
all these different things.

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:53.805
MICHAEL HORN: And happy
birthday Classroom.

00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:54.330
Right?

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:54.820
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.740
A couple of days ago.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.622
So what has the impact
from your perspective,

00:10:58.622 --> 00:11:00.580
working with those schools,
what have you seen,

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.020
how have you seen our tools
been used in education?

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.311
MICHAEL HORN: I think you're
seeing Google's impact all

00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.900
over the place right now in
education in a couple ways.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.461
One, so in some of
the environments

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.460
that are not blended
learning by our definition,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.120
but you're still starting people
experiment with technology.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.910
You're seeing Google Apps be
used sort of as that entry

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.400
level what can we start to do
with technology, what can we

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.460
start to pull in, what
can we start to create?

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.312
And so very clearly disrupting
a lot of the software makers

00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:32.520
that were there before in
a lot of these productivity

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.849
tools and Google
Apps coming in there.

00:11:34.849 --> 00:11:37.390
What I think then happens once
you move to a blended learning

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.420
environment is you
start to say, how can we

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.670
use time very differently?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.440
So we may want students
engaging in direct instruction

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.194
in a particular
software program,

00:11:46.194 --> 00:11:47.610
but now we can
start to use Google

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.640
Apps for the project
based learning,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.780
coordinate whole
aspects of learning

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.420
in some pretty exciting ways.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.880
I think you're seeing
teachers use those pathways

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.010
through a variety of Google
Apps in pretty neat ways,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.280
and I don't know many schools
that don't use Google Apps when

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.400
they get into blended learning.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.040
The other part that I
think is really exciting

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.300
that we talk about a fair amount
is the Chromebook world, which

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.260
from my perspective,
Chromebooks make the most

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.860
sense for the majority
of schools getting

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.610
into this blended learning
game because they're not just

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.897
consumption devices, they
are also creation devices,

00:12:24.897 --> 00:12:26.480
and I think that's
what separates them

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.660
from a lot of the
tablets that have

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.880
gotten dumped on the market.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.500
And then the price point I
think is extremely attractive,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.786
and then the way you can
manage them from the cloud

00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:37.160
is something that
I think schools

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.090
have found extraordinarily
useful in terms

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.260
of managing devices
that otherwise get

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.990
into problems in other places.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.314
One other quick thing-- I
think your team in particular

00:12:49.314 --> 00:12:51.480
has done a good job of one
other thing, which is not

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.360
to go into schools
and say, "all right,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.350
here are you Chromebooks.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.470
Go have fun."

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.080
You've actually
helped people think

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.780
through what's the design
process that you want

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.320
to go through, what are you
actually trying to solve,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.270
and then how can our
technology-- huge range of it,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.150
right-- be marshalled to
help you solve these problems

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.750
for teachers and students.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.530
And from my perspective, that's
what every school and district

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.600
ought to be doing is a
much more grounds up,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.480
what are we trying
to do together,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.310
and then technology
and service of that

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.950
rather than just
layer on technology.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.490
MALE SPEAKER: So by the
way, in a couple minutes

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.160
I'm going to ask you
guys for question,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.380
so think of your questions.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.470
We want to make sure that we
ask Michael some questions.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.250
The one question I have for
your around blended learning

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.570
is where does it usually start.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.412
Does it start in kindergarten?

00:13:42.412 --> 00:13:43.620
Does it start in third grade?

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.185
Where do you see the peak of
blended learning take off?

00:13:46.185 --> 00:13:50.060
MICHAEL HORN: It's a great
question-- all over the place.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.570
And I think for a lot
of district schools

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.140
it started in high
school, particularly

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.600
in these areas of
non-consumption,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.510
in our language, where the
alternative is nothing at all.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.520
And I don't think people
realize this-- 50%

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.830
of our high schools in this
country don't offer calculus.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.864
37% of our high schools
do not offer physics.

00:14:10.864 --> 00:14:12.280
If you're in the
state of Georgia,

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.190
there's 440 high
schools roughly--

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.560
there are 88 certified physics
teachers in the entire state.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.150
OK?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.230
So we can talk
about stem problems

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.905
or whatever else all
we want, like we've

00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:23.030
got to get real about that.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.560
So high schools literally
need to use online learning

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.560
in their schools
to connect students

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.840
to highly qualified teachers and
create very different learning

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.020
experiences from
that which has come

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.950
before-- really important
part where a lot of this

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.970
has started.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.680
I think in elementary school
you're seeing it much more

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.890
in core classes--
math and reading,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.140
and in terms of what
grade level it's literally

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.290
all over the map.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.030
You have great
examples all over.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.650
I think the one thing you'd say
is if you're in kindergarten

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.380
I don't want my kid on the
screen for three hours a day.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.436
I'm comfortable
with 20, 30 minutes,

00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:01.810
and then if you're
in fifth grade

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.518
you could do a little
bit more than that.

00:15:03.518 --> 00:15:07.330
So it's a continuum, it does not
look the same in any one place.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.850
MALE SPEAKER: By the way, we
both have little, tiny babies.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.060
Yours are seven,
eight months old.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.540
Mine is eight months
old, about the same time.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.940
Right now technology is
about eating it, right?

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.480
I posted a picture
of my seven-month-old

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:27.180
using YouTube for YouTube
for kids by eating it.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.050
MICHAEL HORN: So I have twins,
so my problems are times two,

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.390
I suppose, but one of them
was on the bed the other day

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.170
and trying to
literally crawl-- she

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.385
was crawling over me
to get at my phone.

00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:41.010
MALE SPEAKER: They
have a screen thing.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:41.700
MICHAEL HORN: They
have a screen thing

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.820
and literally all
she wanted to do

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.700
was like go on a suicide
mission off the bed

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.810
to try to get to this phone,
and it was like, oh my God.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.000
MALE SPEAKER: It's like a
squirrel thing from "Up."

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.420
MICHAEL HORN: Yes, exactly.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:53.920
Squirrel.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.590
MALE SPEAKER: So you didn't
even mention computer science

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.622
and the fact that
most states don't even

00:16:01.622 --> 00:16:04.080
offer computer science, and
how do we do computer science--

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.580
MICHAEL HORN: Huge
area, and I think

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.790
that's why you're seeing
an explosion of companies

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:12.880
and tools and nonprofits
around coding,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.880
and there's been huge
campaigns around that.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.560
Really synergistic way to
introduce blended learning

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.300
into a community.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.000
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.625
So a lot of what you're talking
about is here, based in the US.

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:24.910
Do you work with school
districts across the world?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.080
And you mentioned the shortage
of classes and teachers

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.760
who teach specific classes.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.640
You think about a
country like India

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.130
where they are short 1.4
million teachers, right?

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.590
Whatever number you want to
use, but it's more than five.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.189
So what does blended
learning look

00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:42.730
like on the
international scale, what

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.080
are you seeing in that space?

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.410
MICHAEL HORN: I think the
models are looking and will

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.826
look very different
from what they

00:16:47.826 --> 00:16:49.990
look like in the US for
a variety of reasons.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.770
I think mobile will be a
much bigger deal as you

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.240
go into emerging countries.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.100
I also think the
disruptive innovations will

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.730
be much bigger that they
create, and the reason

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.400
I say that is if you think
about disruptive innovation

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.230
theory-- I'm making
an assumption everyone

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.666
has some idea that
here-- but it starts

00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:07.040
in these areas of
non-consumption

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.369
where the alternative
is truly nothing at all.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:13.510
In the United States we have
full consumption of schooling.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.900
Basically everyone has
a schooling option.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.839
You have non-consumption
of classes.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.950
In some of these emerging
markets in developing countries

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.300
you don't have schools, or
you don't have schools that

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.690
are real options in any event.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.400
Teachers don't show
up or they're too far

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.600
for girls and boys to travel.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.430
So the opportunity to
bring these things and very

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.410
new solutions into
communities themselves I think

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.960
is an unbelievable
opportunity for innovation

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.174
and it has obviously a
whole set of barriers, but--

00:17:42.174 --> 00:17:44.090
MALE SPEAKER: What are
some of those barriers?

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.880
MICHAEL HORN: Well, obviously
infrastructure and access

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.750
is one.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.830
I think helping the communities
know how to use it is another,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.610
and thinking about it not from
a US-centric point of view.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.660
I think we have a
certain attitude that it

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.320
has to be sort of
a tablet or laptop

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.290
or to be quote
unquote, "good enough."

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.280
In these places
like an SMS program

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.480
that helps feed the
teacher ideas for projects

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.180
to do as students could be
the right learning modality

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.970
in any given day.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.390
I think we have to reset
our expectations on that.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.770
I spent a fair amount of
time in Vietnam looking

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.860
at this last year, and if
you look at the rural areas

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.740
there's actually
lots of cellphones,

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.860
but creating relevant
curriculum for those contexts

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.580
you can't just
take our curriculum

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.580
and like port it into a
different place and say,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.640
there we've solved it.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.220
So there's a whole bunch
of cultural, language,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.460
and circumstantial, like
actually making it relevant.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.880
I'll give a very
concrete example.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.880
In the North of Vietnam there's
a lot of tribal communities

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.520
that are cut off from the rest
of the Vietnamese language

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.040
and culture and so forth.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.440
Vietnam basically
makes them attend

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.210
the nationalized
schools, if you will,

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.050
that teach curriculum
that's totally

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.880
irrelevant for their
lives and so forth.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.310
If they can learn
English though they

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.700
can get ahead big time in the
tourism worlds and so forth.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.600
So basically all
these kids drop out

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.910
of these government run
schools by the first grade.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.460
Don't attend, tend to
live in these very small--

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.860
they laugh at us if you
and I were to walk in,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:24.000
because we don't
fit in their houses.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.080
But super useful if they can get
access to English in a way that

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.430
makes sense for their
context and teaches them

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.670
things that help explain in
their environment to people

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.380
like me coming through.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.340
People haven't
grappled with that.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.040
MALE SPEAKER: So I want to
turn it over to the audience,

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.456
but before I do that and as
they think about the questions

00:19:41.456 --> 00:19:43.600
that they want to ask,
the question I want to ask

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.500
is around professional
development.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.750
What does professional
development look

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.452
like in a blended
learning environment,

00:19:49.452 --> 00:19:51.660
what are we doing right,
what are we not doing right?

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.530
MICHAEL HORN: Well,
let's start with this,

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.510
which is the role of
the teacher dramatically

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.690
changes in these blended
learning environments.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.810
And so the first thing
to say right is teachers

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.540
are absolutely critical still,
but they look different.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.380
They're not delivering a
lecture or a lesson plan

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.080
to a class of 30
students who they're

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.740
assuming are all on the
same place and same learning

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.400
pathway.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.794
That doesn't make any
sense, because now they're

00:20:16.794 --> 00:20:18.210
all progressing
in different ways,

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.340
working on different projects,
and so a teacher is serving

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.196
as a tutor, a mentor,
a designer of projects,

00:20:25.196 --> 00:20:26.820
and assessors or
evaluator of learning.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.230
Very different sets of things,
maybe even a non-academic coach

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.340
In many cases dealing with
all the emotional and health

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.520
problems that come up in
the way and block people

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.530
from learning all the
time that we don't tend

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.710
to talk about in this country.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.430
It's a very different
role, and so

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.250
if you talk to a
blended learning teacher

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.630
you say how much of
your teacher preparation

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.980
program or professional
development trained you

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.740
for what you're doing now, and
they'll typically say something

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.480
like I don't know, 5% of
what I learned trained me

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.010
for 95% of my job, and
95% of what I learned

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.840
is maybe relevant
for 5% of my job.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.280
So that's really difficult
that we're putting teachers

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.750
in these circumstances.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.350
The good news, I think, is
that teachers are smart people

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.530
and they over time start
to figure these things out.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.780
The bad news is like, why
do we put them through that,

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.580
and can't we do a better
job supporting them?

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.010
And so my sense is that,
a, the preparation programs

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.250
will have to change
dramatically.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.230
Tom Arnett on our team is
doing a lot of research,

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.570
he's actually speaking about
it at the EdElements Summit

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.555
today on how do we moved to
new preparation programs.

00:21:32.555 --> 00:21:34.430
And then I think the
professional development

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.422
should be much more personalized
for different teacher needs,

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.630
just as we would personalize
professional development

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.380
for students, and much
more just in time.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.130
So rather than some guy
like me writes a book,

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.855
shows up at a school district
three, four times a year

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:50.230
and does professional
development

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.855
that's only tangentially related
to what the teachers are doing

00:21:52.855 --> 00:21:56.050
in the classroom that they
get access to just in time

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.079
professional development
every single day

00:21:58.079 --> 00:21:59.620
with whatever
challenges that they're

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.040
facing that are very tailored
to what they're doing.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.210
I think Summit Public
Schools in the Bay Area

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.006
probably is the closest to
getting this right today

00:22:07.006 --> 00:22:08.380
with the professional
development

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.379
that they do for teachers
in a very personalized

00:22:10.379 --> 00:22:11.900
way on their platform.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.650
MALE SPEAKER: So the
last thing, because I

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.440
have 100 questions for you,
but you and I have talked

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.650
about this idea around
making sure that none of us

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.080
are contributing to making
old education or bad education

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.310
faster and more efficient.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.680
What do you see happening
in that space, what could

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.320
we all do better in that space?

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.430
MICHAEL HORN: I'm worried.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:39.100
I think if we hit 50% 2019 and
we've replicated the factory

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.370
model online.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:43.690
What's today?

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.300
May 7.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.910
You were born in the
year the lamb, therefore

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.539
we're all doing
double-digit addition,

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:51.580
like we've really failed.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.400
And I think there's
a big risk of that,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.560
so I think a couple
things we have to do.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.740
One is really talk about
the why of this movement,

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.280
and then talk about what
it can unleash, and make

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.767
it accessible to--
I think sometimes we

00:23:05.767 --> 00:23:08.350
do ourselves a disservice when
we show the summits of the High

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.549
Tech Highs, because it
feels like so out of grasp.

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:13.840
I think we have to make it
a little bit more accessible

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.430
for the parental and teacher
communities around the country.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.200
The second thing I think we need
to do is think about policy,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.330
and the environment
into which we're

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.240
making these transformations,
and maybe kick it

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.532
to you for your story
about the architecture.

00:23:31.532 --> 00:23:32.490
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.580
We were talking before
the talk today--

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.210
the idea that when you look at
a building, beautiful architect

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.410
of a building, you
look at the building

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.460
and you don't say I wonder
what kind of wrench they used.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.087
Right?

00:23:47.087 --> 00:23:48.420
Or what kind of drill they used.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.530
You talk about the actual
outcome of that building,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.040
and so our students are
that architect, the outcome.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.790
MICHAEL HORN: Yeah,
and I think the policy

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.510
is concerned about the tools.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.150
Policy mandates the
number of minutes

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.480
you have to sit in seats.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.362
It actually literally
funds schools

00:24:02.362 --> 00:24:04.570
based on the number of
minutes students are in seats,

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.700
so if you step back
from it for a moment

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.780
you say we've been
measuring the wrong end

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:15.460
of the student for 100
years, but we continue do so.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.120
Restrictions around
class size even,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.190
what classes look like, a lot
of the facility restrictions.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.800
We could imagine a much
different education system.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.070
A lot of the teacher-eval
policies coming on right

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.760
now are counterproductive.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.320
They're very
consumed with inputs.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.650
We need to be
looking at not just

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.140
student outcomes at a
point in time on a test,

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.060
but actually the growth
of students over time

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.830
at an individual level.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.540
I think the other thing that
we do unfairly right now is--

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.832
and I'm a big believer
in the intentions

00:24:50.832 --> 00:24:52.290
behind the
accountability movement,

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.860
and the power of standards
if we do it right-- but right

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.790
now if students
are in fifth grade

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.999
and they come in at a
second grade reading level,

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.290
we test them at the end of
year with a fifth grade test

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.705
and say they're now reading
at a fourth grade level.

00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.530
A teacher doesn't get
any credit for that.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.970
We don't get we don't see that.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.250
That's ridiculous.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.460
Like that teacher just
made two years of progress

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.182
with that student,
that's amazing.

00:25:15.182 --> 00:25:16.140
We don't focus on that.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.760
We don't talk about
that, and so we

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.010
need to do a much better
job of thinking about what

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.190
does assessment mean.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.830
What are the rich
kinds of assessments

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.590
we actually want to
see, and how do we

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.034
evaluate those in a
fair and equitable way.

00:25:30.034 --> 00:25:31.450
MALE SPEAKER: I
got a mic up here.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.450
I want to turn it over
to whoever has questions.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.205
Of course you guys
have questions.

00:25:35.205 --> 00:25:36.580
We'll start up
here in front row,

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.600
and as they are asking
questions the last question

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.280
I'm going to ask you is what
can we, Google, do, and so

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.980
just think about that
question and I'll

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.300
ask you before we wrap up.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.212
AUDIENCE: So I work on a product
here at Google Course Builder,

00:25:51.212 --> 00:25:52.920
and one of the things
that we worry about

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.310
is content delivery to
the other five billion,

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.240
and that mostly looks like small
devices, cell phones or maybe

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.480
tablets.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.172
How do you do content delivery
on a small device effectively?

00:26:07.172 --> 00:26:09.130
MICHAEL HORN: And this
goes to the conversation

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.710
we were having about not
applying the US standards

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.810
of what we think
good content has

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.440
to be is I think we have to
take a very different mindset

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.970
and understand how they're
getting content today,

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.720
or not getting content, and then
what is a good enough state,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.110
and then what sets it
on a trajectory that

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.540
starts to improve.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.272
And I think that's
tough sometimes

00:26:31.272 --> 00:26:33.355
when we're talking about
improving social sectors,

00:26:33.355 --> 00:26:36.019
as like something that's
not perfect but good enough,

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:38.310
but that's the coin in the
realm with disruption, which

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.780
is like when the Google
search engine started

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.470
it doesn't do all that it did
now, but it was good enough.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.030
It was good enough
to get it started

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:50.200
and change the way we view
information and content,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.834
and so I think getting a
good enough perspective is

00:26:52.834 --> 00:26:53.500
the first thing.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.990
The second thing I
think-- this is probably

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.930
somewhat controversial, but
I think in Silicon Valley

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.120
is way too bullish
right now on video.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.700
Video is useful in certain
learning circumstances,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.290
but it's actually for many
tasks a very inefficient way

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.000
of learning.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.746
Ironic, as I'm
being videoed, and I

00:27:14.746 --> 00:27:16.120
think we need to
think about what

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.680
are short chunks of information
that cause people to interact

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.349
a lot in these modalities
that actually create

00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:25.890
lots of opportunities
for interaction

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.650
to build motivation,
and you actually

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:32.080
learn through your interaction
and the explanation afterwards,

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.310
not necessarily the content
that was delivered at you,

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.590
because that makes you a
much more active learner.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.110
So--

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.980
MICHAEL HORN: Yeah, video push.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.500
Yeah, exactly,
where we think that

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.630
a 10 minute video is the best
way to consume and understand

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.820
content.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.520
I actually think the learning
sciences disagree strongly

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.930
that, and there are certain
contexts where video

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.696
is extraordinarily
useful at illuminating

00:27:58.696 --> 00:28:01.070
a certain thing that can only
be understood through video

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.880
or being transported there,
but actually short tech space

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.660
things that cause you to
respond and talk about things

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.680
and be an active
learner, which are well

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.100
suited to some of these
small devices I think

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.932
can actually be a much more
powerful medium in many cases.

00:28:17.932 --> 00:28:20.140
MALE SPEAKER: You and I have
often talked about this,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.556
and you mentioned
at the beginning

00:28:21.556 --> 00:28:23.980
of the answer of good enough.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.650
I think the biggest problem in
education from my perspective

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.705
is this idea that there's some
magic model out there that you

00:28:30.705 --> 00:28:34.380
have to find, and that
you just have to do that.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.490
The title my keynote is
Iteration and Innovation.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.310
Like how do we create a culture
of iteration and innovation

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.690
that there is no school,
it's a constant change.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.880
MICHAEL HORN: So "Blended" is
basically a design guide for--

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.890
MALE SPEAKER: By the way, this
is a "How To" book, right?

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.140
MICHAEL HORN: Yeah, I mean
it really is a field guide,

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.050
but it doesn't say
this is the answer.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.465
It actually gives a process
for you to create a constantly

00:29:00.465 --> 00:29:04.910
a iterating,
improving innovation,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.350
and I think the real messages
is like, you know what,

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.800
even if you nailed it
for today circumstance,

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.610
in 10 years from now societies
going to change some more

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.720
and we need to keep evolving
and innovating with that.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.360
So how do you do
that, and I think

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.050
we need to stop
thinking of school

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.415
as like a finished product
that OK, that's it,

00:29:24.415 --> 00:29:25.630
let's all do that.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.549
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:27.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.690
So you mentioned that we
need a platform to emerge

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.510
to kind of pull some
of the student data

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.056
together in order for blended
learning to really take off.

00:29:34.056 --> 00:29:35.430
How do you balance
that with what

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:40.100
feels like a tightening in
student data privacy laws?

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.980
MICHAEL HORN: Great question,
and the million dollar

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.572
one that Julia
Freeland on my team

00:29:46.572 --> 00:29:48.780
is starting to think about,
but I haven't done enough

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.930
thought on.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.490
I think that we do need to
create a different narrative

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.430
around why data
matters in education,

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.620
because it's been a very
defensive conversation

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.500
at this point.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.010
We've just been
talking about of course

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.140
data shouldn't be used to sell
products to kids and stuff

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.010
like that.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.360
Rather than making the case
for like why you as a parent

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.920
you actually want your teacher
and student having access

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.060
to data, and not just
like their data, right?

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.570
Because it's an incredibly
empowering thing when

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.800
you as a student-- let's talk
about that for a moment--

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.660
can say like, I
didn't get that right,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.820
and I can do something
about it to improve myself.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.300
That's a deeply
motivating thing.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.790
We haven't done a good
job of articulating

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.990
that in a way that actually is
a positive case that it make

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.780
sense and people can rally
around, so I think actually

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.800
the biggest thing is play
some offense on this issue

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.430
and start to show
scenarios about why parents

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.420
and teachers would want
this, and what it can do

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.420
for learning, as opposed
to well yeah, of course

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.122
we don't mean that in
sort of a defensive crouch

00:30:57.122 --> 00:30:57.830
where we've been.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.600
MALE SPEAKER: And the
irony is that we accept,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.340
the parents accept-- and I'm a
parent, but I accept the data

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.580
or we accept the data that's
the assessment-based data that's

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.827
six months old or a
year old, but we're not

00:31:09.827 --> 00:31:11.660
looking at the
performance-based data, which

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.657
is the critical stuff.

00:31:12.657 --> 00:31:13.990
That's the stuff that we really.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.073
MICHAEL HORN: And I think
this whole opt-out world

00:31:16.073 --> 00:31:17.970
right now that's
happening, we need

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.690
to be carving a
consensus of assessment

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.100
can be a much more seamless
light touch thing that

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.910
is happening constantly in
the background, and even

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:28.157
objective ways.

00:31:28.157 --> 00:31:29.990
And yeah, it can be a
lighter footprint that

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:33.120
is truly individually
focused and helping inform

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.810
and gives us an accountability
picture, transparency,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.270
but is really about
the learning itself

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.680
and people can get behind that.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.250
The assessments aren't
there today for that,

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.160
but helping parents
understand we're on a road

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:57.190
to that and not to neglect kids
in low-income circumstances

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.150
who might not have the
same sort of advantages

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.930
where and why
we're on a journey.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.430
But I also think it would help
to articulate it as a journey

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:06.960
and not say that the
assessments we have

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.310
today we should be happy about.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.476
AUDIENCE: I just want to add to
that, because this is actually

00:32:13.476 --> 00:32:14.600
what I've been looking for.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.808
And people always think the
Department of Ed has tons

00:32:16.808 --> 00:32:18.010
of money, we don't.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.890
And I think Google
may be in a place

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.355
to really help with this is.

00:32:21.355 --> 00:32:22.979
I've been talking to
a number of people

00:32:22.979 --> 00:32:25.574
about trying to figure out
some kind of short infographic

00:32:25.574 --> 00:32:27.240
or something that
actually leads parents

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.790
like really clear articulating
this is good use of data.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:33.240
It's almost like the
old video of like how

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.324
a bill becomes-- you know
like "It's Only a Bill?"

00:32:35.324 --> 00:32:36.281
MICHAEL HORN: Mr. Bill.

00:32:36.281 --> 00:32:38.890
AUDIENCE: You go through and
it's sort of like literally

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.854
where the data goes, like
this is a good place,

00:32:40.854 --> 00:32:42.770
this is an OK place, you
can protect this data

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.810
even though you're using the
data to make the back end look.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.570
And I really do think
some clear definitions

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.670
and literally some
visualization of what

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.979
that looks like would help
the whole conversation

00:32:52.979 --> 00:32:54.020
work a little bit better.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.853
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:32:54.853 --> 00:32:57.550
But also to Michael's
point about like creating

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.130
some language around
what we're doing,

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.440
we do it in sports, right?

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.950
We have performance
based data in sports.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.620
A baseball player comes up to
bat, he bats 276 on Thursdays.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.450
When it's raining he bats 234.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:10.950
Right?

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:13.400
We have that level
of performance data.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.444
He doesn't take a test
at the end of the season

00:33:16.444 --> 00:33:18.610
to find out how much he
knows about baseball, right?

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.570
So it's a different philosophy.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.670
We need to get better--

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.840
MICHAEL HORN: We need
to give better scenarios

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.050
to help people shoot for that
also in terms of the developer

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:34.600
community, or people who
are building off the Google

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.040
platforms that you all have.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.390
Inspiring I think is
what we need to do.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.050
But I agree with
what you said, and I

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:47.594
think just the quick
add-on is-- and I'm

00:33:47.594 --> 00:33:49.260
blanking on what I
was going to say now,

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:56.630
but just helping districts
adopt in a responsible way

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.000
would also be really useful.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.550
And I think if a
place like Google

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:04.900
could rally some of the
other hardware-makers

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.120
to this game and others, like
sort of like a pledge of we

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.820
will have this sort of
behavior as we come in.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.400
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
we signed a pledge.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.608
MICHAEL HORN: You have, yeah.

00:34:12.608 --> 00:34:15.810
But I mean literally making that
known among districts of like,

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:20.130
I won't work with
you Mr. PC, unless I

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.510
know you've committed to this.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.659
And maybe not just around
data, quite frankly,

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.070
but I won't sell you
one-to-one laptops

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.650
unless I've seen
some sort of design

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.790
that you've gone through
about why you would use them.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.610
MALE SPEAKER: Now you're
pushing your luck.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.386
MICHAEL HORN: But you're the
only game that I can push it.

00:34:34.386 --> 00:34:35.969
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions and I'm

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:37.330
going to make them
sound like one so Jamie

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.219
doesn't yell at me.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.350
MALE SPEAKER: No, you
can ask two questions.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:39.850
That's fine.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.400
You're Tracy.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.500
AUDIENCE: OK, but they're
both around sort of philosophy

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.159
of the future of education.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:52.480
I think fundamentally we
all who work on education

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.230
feel strongly about
personalized learning.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.220
Clearly that's a
huge place where

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.469
technology can be an enabler.

00:34:58.469 --> 00:34:59.260
It's very exciting.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.710
It makes a ton of sense.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.660
We also talked a lot about
project-based learning as a way

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.950
that kids will
interact more with what

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.500
they're being presented with.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.670
So I'm curious on two things.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.490
I'd love your thoughts
on like best practices

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:14.760
around personalized learning.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.210
What do you think of
things like AltSchool--

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.460
some of the folks who are
trying to solve that problem

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.970
from a technology perspective.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:26.150
And then do you feel like a
focus on project-based learning

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.790
is warranted, or is
there some other future

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.800
that you imagine that
sort of around the curve

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.380
that maybe we're not seeing
that's the next big thing or is

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.570
there a more generalized
way to think about it?

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.050
MICHAEL HORN: So I'm
really glad, first of all,

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.820
that you separated those
two terms, because I think

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.850
a lot of people they
hear student-centered or

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.175
personalized and automatically
say that's 100% project based,

00:35:47.175 --> 00:35:48.800
and I don't think
that's actually true.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.300
Right?

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.230
You don't learn to shoot
free throws in basketball

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.690
in the game, you actually
have to practice them

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.620
and it's not always
the most exciting.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.190
But you also play the game
to understand the context

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.440
and build motivation
and apply, right?

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.540
So there are give and
takes I think in education,

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:10.490
and we've had this unbelievably
broken dialogue between "isms."

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:13.780
You're either core knowledge
versus project-based learning,

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.580
and it's like well,
hold on, I think

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.380
there's actually value
in both and what's

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.740
the right mix of things.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.170
And it turns out you do
need knowledge to know

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.510
what to Google in learning,
and so that still is important,

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.700
but so it too is applying it.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.520
So the way I think about
blended learning is it offers us

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.930
the opportunity to
change the use of time

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.880
so that we can break these
things that have been

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.060
false dichotomies,
but I think has

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.040
been very difficult like
in the time-based way

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.600
we view schools to
actually do both.

00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:50.030
There's some great
project-based learning schools

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.830
that are out there, but
there's some really bad ones

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.860
where kids are doing
superficial things

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.500
and they don't really understand
fundamentals underneath it,

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.664
and so this is really the
opportunity to split that.

00:37:01.664 --> 00:37:03.580
So I'll answer that
question more directly now

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.460
with just that preface, because
if you look at Summit Public

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.240
Schools they are one that I
think is getting the mix right.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.200
On personalized
learning, really excited

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.340
about a number of the
potentials coming around.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.030
I think there's a bit of
a split in the field right

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.060
now around adaptive learning
engines versus a more

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.650
playlist approach to the world.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.880
It's not clear to me what
is going to win there.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.910
I actually think
there's value in both,

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.840
and I think the adaptive
learning is a way more complex

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:39.580
problem than most people believe
it is because yes, you're

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.080
getting way more
data from students,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.660
but they're also
sending a lot of signals

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.451
based on what they ate
that morning that is

00:37:44.451 --> 00:37:47.450
very difficult to account for.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.010
So I think super
interesting place,

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.080
really interested in what
Newton is doing, really

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.209
interested in what
AltSchool is doing,

00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:56.750
really interested in what Khan
Academy is doing in that world

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.240
as well, so lots of
interesting experiments.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.930
Really interested
also simultaneously

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.624
on the playlist approach,
like Summit Public Schools

00:38:03.624 --> 00:38:05.540
is doing with their
personalized learning plan

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.164
where there's 10 different
ways to learn a given standard

00:38:09.164 --> 00:38:11.080
and actually students
get to navigate and make

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.280
those choices.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.850
And again, I think adaptability
versus assignability or choice

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:18.060
will end up being a false
dichotomy in the future as

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:18.559
well.

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:23.330
I think there will be a mix
where just like Google helps

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.730
nudge me, it doesn't
actually make decisions

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.470
for me as I'm doing things.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.540
I think there will be something
with a trade-off and younger

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.360
students you may give more
help making those decisions

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.930
and do gradual
release as they get

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.040
older so they become lifelong
learners and really owners

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.330
of that learning experience.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:43.810
In terms of AltSchool
specifically,

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.680
for those that don't know
just raised $100 million,

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:54.026
I went to college with Max,
so I know him reasonably well.

00:38:54.026 --> 00:38:56.400
I'm really interest to see
what actually comes out of it.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.110
I think at minimum it'll be a
really exciting school network

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.480
itself that helps
to disrupt a lot

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.290
of independent or private
schools around the country.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.920
I think this micro-school
network is very exciting

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.320
that's emerging.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.206
I think we might in
the future sort of

00:39:12.206 --> 00:39:15.630
see the Airbnb schooling
that allows for pop-ups

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.550
and allows for very
different communities

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.580
to form depending on
the day or what subject

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.080
you're learning in the future.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:29.190
I'm skeptical of taking a
platform developed very deeply

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.080
in a particular school setting
with a very particular model,

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.267
and then just thinking, oh we'll
just give that to a district

00:39:35.267 --> 00:39:36.850
and it will work and
it will save them

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:39.680
30% because they don't need
this administrative overhead

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.660
or something like that.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.756
I'm very skeptical of that,
because it's interdependent,

00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:45.380
and I think that's
important right now.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.050
We're not ready
for modular stage,

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.350
but I don't think it'll
just pour it over.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.270
Project-based learning-- I think
it's a deeper understanding

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:57.430
of what projects can be and how
they interact with knowledge

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.795
and things like that will
come down the pipeline,

00:39:59.795 --> 00:40:01.280
if that make sense.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.880
And I also think if we can
start to actually tie them

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.850
into real world problems
increasingly that's maybe

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.650
the next frontier where we
start to bring employers

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:12.610
and experts in social capital
into these communities in very

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.180
different ways from the ways
we've done traditionally.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.024
I think Google
can be a big part.

00:40:17.024 --> 00:40:18.690
AUDIENCE: I wonder
if it's almost better

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.700
to think about intrinsic
versus extrinsic motivation

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.230
as what you're trying to create
out of that system, as opposed

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.942
to actually having
it be project-based.

00:40:27.942 --> 00:40:29.400
MICHAEL HORN: I
think that's right.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.660
I mean, it creates an excitement
and desire to know more,

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.780
and also I didn't
know what engineering

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.080
was until I was like
a junior in college,

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.150
so a much better sense of
what real jobs and careers are

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.262
out there.

00:40:43.262 --> 00:40:44.720
MALE SPEAKER: We
started with start

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.670
the conversation by trying to
find blended learning, we can

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.890
do the same thing with
personal learning,

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.694
whether it's personal,
personalised, individualised or

00:40:53.694 --> 00:40:56.110
project-based learning and
what project-based learning is.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.910
I often get push-back
from students.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.870
I was speaking at ASU
with Dr. Crow in a class

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:02.370
and one of the
student says, I don't

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.786
want to do
project-based learning,

00:41:03.786 --> 00:41:06.620
because when I did project-based
learning when I was in school

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.580
I was the one who
did all the work.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.630
And I'm like, you
didn't do project-based.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.650
You did one paper
that was split up

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.404
by five people that could
have been done by one person.

00:41:16.404 --> 00:41:17.820
That's not
project-based learning.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.236
So a lot of it has to do with
the definitions that we use.

00:41:20.236 --> 00:41:21.869
MICHAEL HORN: I agree with that.

00:41:21.869 --> 00:41:22.660
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.510
Oh, we've got lots of questions.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.200
I want to make sure
I get them all in.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.910
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.840
about as we think
about the achievement

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.400
gap, the role of technology
and helping to close it

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.562
or potentially the risk that
it actually could worsen it,

00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:37.020
because we talked
about the ability

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.770
to improve education
outcomes overall,

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:41.061
but with the worst schools--

00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:42.810
MICHAEL HORN: Yeah,
totally good question.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.518
So I think the first
thing to acknowledge

00:41:44.518 --> 00:41:48.180
is that higher income kids are
already going to get access

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.880
to these tools, and so
it's incumbent upon schools

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.650
to do these things
for low income,

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.900
because otherwise that
achievement gap will really

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.370
widen.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.600
I think the other thing
personalized learning does

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.890
is a lot of students
fall further and further

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.370
behind because lessons
continue to move

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.780
and you actually have a deep
fundamental misconception

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.780
or misunderstanding
much earlier.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.180
And if you can actually
change that, so go back

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.260
in their learning if you will,
and change that, it actually

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.550
unlocks a much faster
trajectory then

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.590
we give credit to
low income students

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:24.430
typically for being able to
do, which you can give that

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.930
any set of names, but I think
of it as education malpractice

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.429
often.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.045
So I think the small
evidence we have actually is

00:42:35.045 --> 00:42:38.240
that unleashing this actually
causes these people we thought

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.410
of as slow learners or
low on the achievement gap

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.010
or whatever to actually soar
much faster than we thought

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:45.910
was possible.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.260
I do think it will
create gaps, because it

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.090
will allow the high-flyers to
go much further and faster.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.735
I think the hope is
that income is not

00:42:53.735 --> 00:42:57.590
the predictor of those
gaps, and that it's

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.755
based on other factors.

00:42:58.755 --> 00:43:00.630
MALE SPEAKER: And the
number haven't changed,

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:05.220
so if you make more
than $75,000 a year

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.030
there's a 95% chance you
have internet access at home

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.300
and the technology at home.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.030
If you make less
than $30,00 it's

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.450
like 45% of whatever
that number is

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.510
so you know that that
gap is already there,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.597
and it is possible
to make that worse.

00:43:17.597 --> 00:43:19.180
Rich school districts
have technology,

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.704
poor school districts don't.

00:43:20.704 --> 00:43:21.620
That's just the facts.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.220
MICHAEL HORN: And we
also know that how

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.800
students in those areas today
use this technology is not

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.820
actually often positive,
because they don't have

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.431
a community, teachers, parents
around them helping guide them

00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:35.930
in a productive way
on that journey,

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.471
so there's plenty
of studies the just

00:43:37.471 --> 00:43:39.680
show the introduction
of technology--

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.780
doesn't do anything.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:46.300
So we have to be very deliberate
about designing coherent models

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.869
for the circumstances.

00:43:47.869 --> 00:43:48.660
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.868
AUDIENCE: You talked a little
bit about over reliance

00:43:50.868 --> 00:43:52.987
on video, which kind
of made me think

00:43:52.987 --> 00:43:55.070
do you think overall in
the blended learning space

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.736
that we're not
leveraging enough of what

00:43:56.736 --> 00:43:59.240
we know about behavioral
and educational psychology?

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.410
Do you know, are there
any examples of programs

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.410
you think are doing
that particularly well,

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.530
or are there gaps
in the research

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:07.530
that you think we're
not drawing upon enough?

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:08.280
MICHAEL HORN: Yes.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.820
We are totally
ignoring that field.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.860
The developers,
like if you haven't

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.342
heard of Richard
Mayer and his work

00:44:15.342 --> 00:44:17.050
on e-learning and the
science instruction

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:21.010
like you are just starting
behind the eight ball.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:24.200
Not to say that there won't be
exceptions to that research.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.950
I think a lot of
education research

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:28.470
is pretty deeply flawed
because it looks at the average

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:32.360
as opposed to be
anomalies and comes up

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.930
with a circumstance-based
theory,

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.530
but there's a lot
of good research

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.530
that can boost you
up dramatically

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.490
to start with, and then
explore anomalies from there.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:45.390
And I think most people are
totally ignoring what we know.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:49.800
There are a few good
providers out there based

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.010
on different facets of it.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.650
I think ST Math
does it pretty well.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.762
But there's a huge
gap in that right now.

00:44:56.762 --> 00:44:58.220
MALE SPEAKER: And
not just that, we

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.910
have 40 years of
research and evidence

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:03.300
about like what really good
learning can look like,

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.177
and I think technology can
help us actually implement

00:45:06.177 --> 00:45:06.760
a lot of that.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.527
We have just been ignoring
it, or the positive way

00:45:09.527 --> 00:45:11.110
of saying it is that
technology hasn't

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.240
been ready to use to implement.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.799
I'm the glass half-full
guy, he's the empty glass.

00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:16.840
MICHAEL HORN: Just there.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.760
AUDIENCE: Back to your
question about data and sharing

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.990
that daily, how can you avoid
the stress that that can cause

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.240
on a family, especially
like at a high school level

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.260
when you're seeing daily grade
reports and daily progress

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.160
reports and the
stress of the parents

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.660
coming down on the students
for that, and in some ways

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.110
it seems like there's too
much information that is not

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.380
being dealt with between
student and teacher

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.700
before it's dealt with
between student and family.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.610
MICHAEL HORN: Yeah,
so I'm not sure

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:50.800
the connection to parents
that should be made there.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.430
I think that's probably another
design choice that should

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:55.950
be made within the schools.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.820
I more meant with
in terms of what

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.930
it can do for teachers
to more effectively work

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.760
with students and students to
be more effectively motivated.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.340
One thing we also know from
the research that people ignore

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:10.010
is that data is not necessarily
a motivating force in learning,

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.300
so let me explain.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.010
If you give a student data
and they have no ability

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.990
to do anything with
that data, it just

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:21.970
says you got a
70%, that is deeply

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.280
demotivating to learning.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.410
If it says, you
haven't mastered this,

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.110
and this is the particular area,
now go back and work again,

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.200
so what we call a
competency-based or

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.010
mastery-based learning
system then data

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:38.280
is deeply motivating as you
can do something with it.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.450
And so that's the type of
data and the type of system

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:44.450
that we actually need to use
it in to empower learners

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:48.990
to understand where they
are going in their learning,

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.010
and so that they can
constantly be using it

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:52.700
to improve with their teachers.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.680
How that works with
parents, I think

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.700
that's a community by community
decision that make sense,

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.660
but it also changes.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.400
It's sort of like think of
it as a, b, or try again.

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:09.640
We're going to eliminate letter
grades as we know if we really

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.906
get this right,
because we really

00:47:11.906 --> 00:47:14.030
ought to be mastering
something before you move on.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:17.390
Sal Khan gives the great analogy
like you wouldn't be like,

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:20.155
we're building a house,
well, I got 80% of it right,

00:47:20.155 --> 00:47:23.882
so let's move on to
the second floor now.

00:47:23.882 --> 00:47:25.340
But that's how we
do it in schools,

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:30.511
and those gaps create huge
problems later in learning.

00:47:30.511 --> 00:47:32.260
MALE SPEAKER: You don't
even need a house.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.050
In our own work world,
if some one on a team

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:38.480
hands one of us the
strategy and we're like,

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.840
oh, this is about a C
plus, next assignment.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.260
No, you iterate.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.280
You change it.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.490
AUDIENCE: So I think in
education over the last 50,

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:53.140
60 years the publishers have
really been the big players,

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.070
and as they're
grappling with this move

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:59.970
I think you see the pitfall
oftentimes of a textbook just

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:00.930
being digitized.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:01.930
MICHAEL HORN: Yes.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.570
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious if you were

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:05.700
to jump in as the
CEO of a Pearson

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.340
or an H&amp;H or McGraw
Hill, where would you

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.180
take that digital content
strategy as a whole?

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.425
MICHAEL HORN: Oh, God.

00:48:12.425 --> 00:48:14.800
MALE SPEAKER: Why couldn't
you ask that like an hour ago?

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.716
MICHAEL HORN: Talk about
jobs I wouldn't want.

00:48:16.716 --> 00:48:17.260
OK.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.260
So I think the lessons
of destruction are clear.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:24.259
When you want to be the
one to disrupt yourself,

00:48:24.259 --> 00:48:26.300
you can't do it within
your current organization.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.320
You have to set up an
autonomous organization that has

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.470
the freedom to rethink
everything and can ask

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.640
the parent for things, but
cannot be commanded to do

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.430
things by the parent,
and so if I were them,

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.530
I would set up truly autonomous
business models that could say

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.724
yes, we want to draw
upon your rich resources,

00:48:43.724 --> 00:48:46.140
but we're not going to be told
how we're going to use them

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.780
or deploy them and we are
going to have very different

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:54.050
processes and priorities
inside to do this.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.430
And that's how I
would approach it.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:59.970
I also think our policymakers
would do us a great service

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.320
if they stopped talking
about digital textbooks,

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.740
because that's not what
we're trying to do here.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.155
MALE SPEAKER: So speaking
of digital textbooks

00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:10.780
I want you to think
about that question

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.510
I was going to ask you, I
also want to plug your book.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.510
If you are like my kid who
cannot read a digital book,

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:20.010
he actually likes the hardcover
books there's hardcover books

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:20.780
back there.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.990
You can get it on Amazon, Google
Play, and other places as well.

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.510
So last question for
you before we wrap up.

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.964
What can we do to help?

00:49:29.964 --> 00:49:32.380
MICHAEL HORN: So I think Google
can do a number of things.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.820
I think one, the continued
improvement of the Chromebook

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:40.010
platform at a price that
schools can embrace.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.840
Huge, because it
takes the equipment

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.569
question off the table and
hopefully shifts the question

00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:45.610
to the learning question.

00:49:48.204 --> 00:49:49.620
And I've always
felt that with you

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.300
is that you ask the
learning question first

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.737
is the other really big thing.

00:49:54.737 --> 00:49:56.570
And I know you said the
pledge won't happen,

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.842
but I think the more we
can get a conversation

00:49:59.842 --> 00:50:01.300
around the learning
questions we're

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.470
trying to solve first,
really important.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:08.220
And then a lot of the apps
and the suite of tools

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.390
that you can bring to bear,
regardless of platform

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.620
quite frankly, but
showing again those things

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.760
in service of the learning
goals just tremendous,

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.740
but really make it about
the learning in each

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.950
and every case.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:26.340
The other thing I'd love to see
Google do is think about you

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.840
guys have thought a lot
about the learning registry

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.110
and tagging open education
resources and things like that.

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.660
I'd love to see more thought
about how assessments play

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.010
into that, because
that's what will truly

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:42.610
make learning content be useful
and come to life in a much more

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:43.470
rich way.

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:47.880
And I don't think we're
seeing enough innovation

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.430
in that space.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.090
MALE SPEAKER:
Well, help me thank

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.785
Michael for showing up today.

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.180
Thank you very much.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.130
Thank you guys for coming.
