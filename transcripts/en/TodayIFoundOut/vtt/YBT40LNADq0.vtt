00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:14.190
The history books (and Hollywood) often describe
the famous lawman, Wyatt Earp, as many things:

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.770
brave, courageous, moral, law-abiding, and
honorable.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.869
In the story of the “Gunfight at the OK
Corral,” Earp is often portrayed as the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380
hero, the good guy we all should be rooting
for.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.909
In truth, Wyatt Earp was a much more complicated
individual who, among other things, was arrested

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:35.140
several times in his life for various offenses,
involved in a few major scandals (sometimes

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.260
on the “bad guy” side), and otherwise
seemed to be an individual who balanced precariously

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.829
on that line between a life as a criminal
and a life as a lawman.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.940
Wyatt Earp was born on March 19, 1848 in Monmouth
in western Illinois.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.399
The town had only been established seventeen
years prior and was still very much a frontier

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.399
town.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.460
Records are a bit scattered , but it seems
the Earps had settled there prior to Wyatt’s

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.879
birth and did what we now call “squatting”
on someone else’s land.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.340
In 1865, the Earp family made one of their
many relocations, this time to Southern California,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.710
but the 17 year old Wyatt did not join them.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.950
He instead wandered across the west working
as a freight handler and grading track for

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.600
the Union Pacific Railroad.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.030
He also got a reputation for gambling, boxing,
drinking, and engaging with the “ladies

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.030
of the night.”

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.299
A few years later, he caught up with his family,
who were now in Lamar, Missouri.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.450
There he met a hotel-keeper’s daughter,
Urilla Southerland, and quickly got married

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.790
in 1870.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.189
She became pregnant, but passed away from
typhus less than a year into their marriage.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.450
Wyatt once again hit the road, joining two
of his brothers in Peoria, Illinois.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.610
This is when the legend of Wyatt Earp began
taking shape, but not always in a good way.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.049
His older brother Virgil was a bartender and
worked in several brothels.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.189
He hired Wyatt to be a bouncer, protector,
and possibly, a pimp.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.259
City records were found indicating that at
a certain point Wyatt’s listed address was

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.039
also the address for a well-known brothel.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.450
The evidence seems to point to Wyatt ultimately
running his own brothel, which was illegal,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.230
and was a type of activity that often found
him being placed behind bars.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.849
Beyond arrests for activities associated with
prostitution, Wyatt was arrested around this

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.440
time with two others, Edward Kennedy and John
Shown, for stealing two horses in 1871, valued

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.069
at about $100 each (about $1900 each today).

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.099
For whatever her testimony is worth, the wife
of John Shown, Anna, claimed Kennedy and Wyatt

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.620
threatened to kill her husband if he didn’t
help them.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.400
Whether true or not, Wyatt ultimately avoided
the hand of the law by breaking himself out

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.780
of jail (going through the roof) and fleeing
town before the trial.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.550
Around this period of his life, he also found
himself getting sued twice.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.269
In one of the instances, while collecting
license fees that helped fund local schools

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.129
in Barton County, he was accused of not turning
in the money he collected and was subsequently

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.170
sued by Barton County for this discrepancy.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.660
In another less than reputable incident, as
outlined in the Peoria Journal Star, Wyatt

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.800
accused a prostitute named Minnie Randell
of turning him into the authorities.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.550
A little later, she was working at another
brothel when she died suddenly from (apparently)

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.000
ingesting morphine.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.569
Given Wyatt’s reputation, some have speculated
that perhaps she was poisoned, but this is

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.720
just pure speculation proposed by certain
biographers; there is no direct evidence of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.069
it, contrary to what you may have read elsewhere.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.360
Randell may well have simply been one of many
prostitutes who died of a self inflicted drug

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.480
overdose.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.610
By the mid-1870s, Wyatt again started wandering.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.080
He tried his hand at buffalo hunting, but
that didn’t stick.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.670
His other brother, James, opened a brothel
in Kansas and invited Wyatt to join him.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.590
He did and soon, like his father and uncles
before him, Wyatt became a “protector of

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.569
the law” as marshal and deputy of places
like Dodge City and Wichita.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.360
In Wichita, he was fired from his position
and in turn arrested after getting in a fistfight

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.670
with the former marshal, Bill Smith, over
accusations that Wyatt had abused his position

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.320
to the benefit of his brothers.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.810
In the end, the city council was divided on
the issue, and considered rehiring Wyatt,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.220
but he skipped town to join his brother, James,
in Dodge City where James had opened- you

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.920
guessed it- a brothel.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.459
In Dodge City, Wyatt also once got in trouble
with the law after back handing a prostitute

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.450
who’d had less than complimentary things
to say about Wyatt.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.520
He was fined $1 for the incident, while the
prostitute, Frankie Bell, got a night in jail

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.900
and a $20 fine for her trouble.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.720
In his later years, Earp liked to tell a story
of another confrontation while deputy of Dodge

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.250
City that showed off his heroism, one that
predated Tombstone.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.820
But like many of these tales, separating fact
from fiction is nearly impossible.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.470
According to the Ford County Historical Society,
“the most feared man in the west” Clay

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.400
Allison arrived in town in the summer of 1878
itching to avenge his friend’s death.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.810
It is not clear who actually had killed his
friend, but Allison blamed the law enforcement

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.520
of Dodge City, notably Wyatt Earp.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.840
This, perhaps, wasn’t an unfair accusation.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.770
Earp and his men had a reputation, deserved
or not, for using their guns more often than

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.590
their mouths to deal with conflict.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.320
The Globe (the area newspaper) often accused
the police of using too much force.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.360
Either way, in 1896, Earp told a story of
Allison approaching him and Earp standing

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.440
his ground:

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.230
“So,’ said Allison truculently, ‘you’re
the man that killed my friend Hoyt.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.160
‘Yes, I guess I’m the man you’re looking
for,’ said I.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.310
His right hand was stealing round to his pistol
pocket, but I made no move.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.840
Only I watched him narrowly.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.220
With my own right hand I had a firm grip on
my six-shooter, and with my left I was ready

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.340
to grab Allison’s gun the moment he jerked
it out.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.020
He studied the situation in all its bearings
for the space of a second or two.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.900
I saw the change in his face.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.780
‘I guess I’ll go round the corner,’
he said abruptly.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.160
‘I guess you’d better,’ I replied.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.350
And he went.”

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.970
The Ford County Historical Society disputes
this rendition.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.630
They claim Allison called out Earp and Earp
never appeared, nor any of the police officers,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.040
and that it was private citizens who asked
Allison to leave the town.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.870
Earp, supposedly, was too busy gambling.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.250
The only such meeting between Earp and Allison
that occurred, again according to Ford County

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.600
historians, was at an underground gambling
card game called faro.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.400
It seems that Allison did threaten Earp there,
but Earp ignored him.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.960
As for the legendary ‘Gunfight at the OK
Corral’ in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881, once

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.430
again Earp’s heroism in the matter is highly
contentious.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.680
Tombstone was not nearly as dangerous, violent,
or lawless as it is often made out to be in

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
films.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.850
It was full of wealth at this point due to
the mining of silver.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.190
With riches, comes the spoils — like the
booming business of brothels, which is what

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.660
attracted Wyatt and his brothers to the area.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.710
Soon, Virgil Earp was marshal and Wyatt was
his deputy.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.060
Doc Holiday, Wyatt’s good pal and personal
card shark who once saved Watt’s life, came

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.900
along to make money off of wealthy silver
miners.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.240
The “cowboys” who came in and out of town
had a habit of getting drunk and unruly, and

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.660
soon this led to a bit of a feud between themselves
and the Earps and Holliday.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.840
This all came to a head one fateful morning
when Ike Clanton (apparently) took to the

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.330
streets and challenged Holiday and the Earps
to a gunfight.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.410
And so came the Earps, as well as several
cowboys.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.090
Less than a minute later, three men lay dead
and several more wounded.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.660
No one knows for sure who shot first or exactly
what happened.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.570
Eye witness accounts are conflicting, as are
the accounts by the Earps and Holliday and

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.660
the cowboys.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.910
In some accounts, the cowboys kept their hands
raised and guns in their holsters when confronted,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.840
at which point the Earps opened fire.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.370
In others, it was the cowboys who acted aggressively
and refused to disarm despite town ordinance.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.320
Ike Clanton himself, who claimed to have been
unarmed in the gun fight and who had fled

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.090
after it started, filed murder charges against
the Earps and Holliday, but the charges were

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.020
dismissed due to lack of evidence.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.720
wyatt_earp_in_cartoonAfter being cleared of
murder charges and the messy fights that ensued

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.770
between the Earps and the cowboys after, Wyatt
skipped town in April of 1882 and moved further

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.470
west to California where he made his living
in “horse racing, gambling, and refereeing

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.160
professional boxing matches.”

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:17.270
Most notably, in 1896, Wyatt refereed a nationally
publicized heavyweight title bout, Bob Fitzsimmons

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.280
vs. Tom Sharkey.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.030
Besides controversially bringing a gun into
the ring, Wyatt was also accused of fixing

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.030
the fight.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.240
Fitzsimmons was heavily favored in the match
and, indeed, dominated it.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.950
In the eighth round, however, Wyatt claimed
Fitzsimmons delivered a blow below the belt,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.020
directly after dealing an uppercut under the
heart of Sharkey.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.800
The uppercut was seen by spectators, while
the below the belt hit was not.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.380
Whatever the case, Sharkey ended up on the
ground, and claimed he was hit below the belt.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.550
Wyatt declared Sharkey the winner, and the
boos from the crowd reigned down.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.060
After calling the match in favor of the fighter
who had clearly lost, newspapers across the

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:00.370
nation had a field day, as you can see from
the picture to the right published in the

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.260
New York Herald in December of 1896.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.991
It should be noted, though, that in the court
battle and investigation that followed, it

00:09:07.991 --> 00:09:12.570
was discovered that Sharkey did have injuries
consistent with taking a blow below the belt

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.540
as Wyatt and Sharky had claimed.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.400
However, there was evidence of a conspiracy
among the promoters of the fight to fix the

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.760
outcome, but whether Wyatt was involved isn’t
clear.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.220
Eight years later, Dr. B.Brookes Lee claimed,

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.850
I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had been
fouled.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.850
How?

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.620
Well, that is something I do not care to reveal,
but I will assert that it was done—that

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.620
is enough.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.370
There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled
to the decision and did not foul Sharkey.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.130
I got $1,000 for my part in the affair.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.620
The court’s decision on the matter was that
it had no jurisdiction over prize fighting.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.200
Because this did not clear Wyatt, and it was
discovered he was deeply in debt, at least

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.541
$2,121 (about $59,000 today) besides debts
from his wife’s gambling addiction, this

00:09:56.541 --> 00:10:01.560
resulted in the public firmly believing he
had helped fix the fight.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.110
This became the thing he was most well-known
for, even more than the “O.K. Corral”

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.920
controversy, for the rest of his life.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.810
There was even a somewhat common expression
published in newspapers for the next few decades

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.120
of “pulling an Earp” or “Earping the
job” when referring to referee’s who were

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.450
thought to be purposefully calling matches
less than accurately.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.210
In 1901, he moved to Southern California.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.440
Ten years later, he had another run-in with
the law, being arrested for fixing a faro

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.370
game in an attempt to fleece J.Y. Peterson
of all his money.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.380
He got out of that one because the fix was
discovered before money actually changed hands.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.170
Instead, he was simply charged with vagrancy.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.070
Later in Southern California, he became friends
with a young actor by the name of Marion Morrison,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.500
or more famously, John Wayne.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.830
From there, he became a fixture on silent
Western sets, telling stories of his younger

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.830
years.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.960
His motivations in this, and the extremely
exaggerated and whitewashed accounts, are

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.110
one of the many subjects of debate about his
life.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.460
For instance, efforts were made to make it
appear in the media that he never drank, despite

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.910
all evidence to the contrary.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.031
There was also an attempt to hide his relationship
with his former common-law wife, prostitute

00:11:07.031 --> 00:11:08.070
Mattie Blaylock.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.200
At the end of their relationship, Blaylock
had traveled to Colton, California with members

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.440
of Wyatt’s family where Wyatt was to later
join her.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.650
He never did.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.490
Shortly thereafter, in 1888, she killed herself.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.400
Wyatt had left her for Josephine Marcus, who
was formerly the common-law wife of Johnny

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400
Behan.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.610
It was claimed by the Welsh family, who were
very close to Wyatt, that it was not Wyatt

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.560
who wanted things exaggerated or whitewashed,
but Josephine.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.640
Grace Spolidora, Wyatt’s good friend Charlie
Welsh’s daughter, claimed that when watching

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.010
the interviews with Wyatt as a teen, it was
Josephine who “would always interfere whenever

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.460
Wyatt would talk with Stuart Lake.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.010
She always interfered!

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.280
She wanted him to look like a church-going
saint and blow things up.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.520
Wyatt didn’t want that at all!”

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.280
Perhaps in support of this, after Wyatt’s
death, Josephine did go to great lengths to

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.090
continue cleaning up Wyatt’s image.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.430
However, it should be noted that the Welsh
family were not at all fond of Josephine,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:04.400
who had a major gambling addiction that often
negatively impacted Wyatt and herself.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.050
At one point in Alaska, her gambling problem
became such an issue that Wyatt had the saloons

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.010
around town, including his own, cut her off.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.680
She then gambled on the boats traveling to
and from the port.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.160
So, as with much of Wyatt’s life, the truth
in this matter is difficult to discern.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.440
As for Josephine, she stated about the controversy
surrounding Wyatt’s life, “The falsehoods

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.600
that were printed in some of the newspapers
about him and the unjust accusations against

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.840
him hurt Wyatt more deeply than anything that
ever happened to him during my life with him,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.310
with the exception of his mother’s death
and that of his father and brother, Warren.”

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.940
Perhaps further giving credence to the fact
that it was not Wyatt who cared to promote

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:47.110
himself, one San Francisco newspaper reporter
in 1924 claimed that getting any information

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.370
out of Wyatt Earp about his life was “like
pulling teeth.”

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.570
John Clum, one time mayor of Tombstone, also
claimed that, “during [Wyatt’s] last illness

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.590
he told me that for many years he had hoped
the public would weary of the narratives—distorted

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.970
with fantastic and fictitious embellishments—that
were published from time to time concerning

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.850
him, and that his last years might be passed
in undisturbed obscurity.”

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.180
Whatever the case, ultimately the aforementioned
Stuart Lake published the, at the time, definitive

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:18.160
biography on Wyatt Earp, Wyatt Earp: Frontier
Marshal, that gave rise to most of the legends

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.640
about him that have endured to today, painting
him as the ultra-moral lawman who helped clean

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.640
up the West.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.000
In truth, Lake only managed to get eight interviews
with Wyatt before he died, and Wyatt supposedly

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.500
was just as closed mouthed about his life
during those interviews as the San Francisco

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.610
reporter had said.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:39.170
It has also been noted that Wyatt frequently
gave conflicting accounts of certain events,

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.900
such as once claiming to a reporter in Denver
in 1896 that he did not kill Johnny Ringo,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.730
and then later in an interview in 1918 telling
Forrestine Hooker he did.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.839
Needless to say, even with the eight interviews
Wyatt gave to Lake, whether intentional or

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:59.670
not, there is a reason that Lake’s biography
on Wyatt Earp today is considered, “an imaginative

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:04.170
hoax, a fabrication mixed with just enough
fact to give it credibility.”

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:09.029
In the end, Wyatt Earp was most definitely
not the whitewashed gun-slinging superhero

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:11.140
he is so often depicted as today.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.240
He also wasn’t nearly the villain some biographers
make him out to be.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.130
Perhaps historian John Boessenecker said it
best when he stated that Wyatt Earp was an

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.430
“enigmatic figure…

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:26.020
He always lived on the outer fringe of respectable
society, and his closest companions were gamblers

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.360
and sporting men…

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.740
Wyatt never set down roots in any one place;
when the money stopped coming in or his problems

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.010
became too great, he would pull up stakes
and move on to the next boomtown…

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.520
For his entire life was a gamble, an effort
to make money without working hard for it,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.580
to succeed quickly without ever settling in
for the long haul.”

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.779
Wyatt Earp died on January 29, 1929 at the
age of 80 in his Los Angeles home.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:54.750
To this day, the “Wyatt Earp the squeaky
clean western hero” myth still lives.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:15:04.530
While it may not be true, it makes one heck
of a story.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:11.250
The 1993 film, Tombstone, is a particularly
entertaining rendition.
