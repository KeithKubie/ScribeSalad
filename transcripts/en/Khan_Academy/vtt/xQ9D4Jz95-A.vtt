00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.880
- [Voiceover] So let's think a little bit about the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.130
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.360
And this right over here, this is

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.540
a picture of James Clerk Maxwell.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.140
And I really like this picture, it's with his

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.430
wife Katherine Maxwell and I guess this is their dog.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.800
And James Maxwell, he is a titan of physics

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.550
famous for Maxwell's equations.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.550
He also did some of the foundational work

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.030
on color photography and he was involved in

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.720
thinking about, "Well, what's the distribution

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.520
of speeds of air particles

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.020
of idealized gas particles?"

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.420
And this gentleman over here, this is Ludwig Boltzmann.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.960
And he's considered the father or one

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.880
of the founding fathers of statistical mechanics.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.360
And together, through the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.480
they didn't collaborate, but they

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.530
independently came to the same distribution.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.490
They were able to describe, "Well, what's the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.737
distribution of the speeds of air particles?"

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:52.290
So let's back up a little bit or let's just

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.100
do a little bit of a thought experiment.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.900
So let's say that I have a container here.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240
Let's say that I have a container here.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.880
And let's say it has air.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.720
And air is actually made up mostly of nitrogen.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.349
Let's just say it just has only nitrogen in it

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.778
just to simplify things.

00:01:06.778 --> 00:01:10.844
So let me just draw some nitrogen molecules in there.

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:13.558
And let's say that I have a thermometer.

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:15.590
I put a thermometer in there.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.936
And the thermometer

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.810
reads a temperature of 300 Kelvin.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.320
What does this temperature of 300 Kelvin mean?

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.510
Well, in our everyday life, we have

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.730
kind of a visceral sense of temperature.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.200
Hey, I don't wanna touch something that's hot.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.630
It's going to burn me.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.650
Or that cold thing, it's gonna make me shiver.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.080
And that's how our brain

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.300
processes this thing called temperature.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.760
But what's actually going on at a molecular scale?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.630
Well, temperature, one way to think

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.420
about temperature, this would be a very

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.530
accurate way to think about temperature

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.750
is that tempera-

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.140
I'm spelling it wrong.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.480
Temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.919
of the molecules in that system.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:03.900
So let me write it this way.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.636
Temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy.

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:09.850
Average

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.110
kinetic

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.740
energy

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.720
in the system.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.600
I'll just write average kinetic energy.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.952
So let's make that a little bit more concrete.

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:25.810
So let's say that I have two containers.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.297
So it's one container.

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:28.364
Whoops.

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:31.480
And two containers right over here.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.240
And let's say they have the same

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.060
number of molecules of nitrogen gas

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.440
And I'm just gonna draw 10 here.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.830
This obviously is not realistic

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.350
you'd have many, many more molecules.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.350
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:02:45.648 --> 00:02:50.640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.760
And let's say we know that the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.210
temperature here is 300 Kelvin.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.940
So the temperature of this system is 300 Kelvin.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.500
And the temperature of this system is 200 Kelvin.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.900
So if I wanted to visualize what these molecules are doing

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.450
they're all moving around, they're bumping

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.200
they don't all move together in unison.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.810
The average kinetic energy of the molecules

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.010
in this system is going to be higher.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.440
And so maybe you have

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.965
this molecule is moving in that direction.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.830
So that's its velocity.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.610
This one has this velocity.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.770
This one's going there.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.800
This one might not be moving much at all.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.100
This one might be going really fast that way.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.340
This one might be going super fast that way.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.040
This is doing that.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.416
This is doing that.

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:35.130
This is doing that.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.200
So if you were to now compare it to this system

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.750
this system, you could still have a molecule

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.800
that is going really fast.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.060
Maybe this molecule is going faster

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.800
than any of the molecules over here.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.840
But on average, the molecules here

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.730
have a lower kinetic energy.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.780
So this one maybe is doing this.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.750
I'm going to see if I can draw...

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.520
On average, they're going to have a lower kinetic energy.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.110
That doesn't mean all of these molecules

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.110
are necessarily slower than all of these molecules

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.160
or have lower kinetic energy than all of these molecules.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.901
But on average they're going to have less kinetic energy.

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:08.930
And we can actually draw a distribution.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.600
And this distribution, that is

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.382
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:15.110
So if we...

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.350
Let me draw a little coordinate plane here.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.850
So let me draw a coordinate plane.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.160
So, if on this axis, I were to put speed.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.140
If I were to put speed.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.532
And on this axis, I would put number of molecules.

00:04:33.532 --> 00:04:38.340
Number of molecules.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.931
Right over here.

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.310
For this system, the system that is at 300 Kelvin

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.092
the distribution might look like this.

00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:47.831
So it might look

00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:48.910
the distribution...

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.340
Let me do this in a new color.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.120
So, the distribution

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.840
this is gonna be all of the molecules.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.330
The distribution might look like this.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.890
Might look like this.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.920
And this would actually be the Maxwell-Boltzmann

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.172
distribution for this system

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:07.928
For system, let's call this system A.

00:05:07.928 --> 00:05:10.428
System A, right over here.

00:05:10.428 --> 00:05:14.710
And this system, that has a lower temperature

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.238
which means it also has a lower kinetic energy.

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:19.676
The distribution of its particles...

00:05:19.676 --> 00:05:22.615
So the most likely, the most probable...

00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:24.710
You're going to have the highest number of molecules

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.900
at a slower speed.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.330
Let's say you're gonna have it at this speed

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.603
right over here.

00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:33.600
So its distribution might look something like this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.010
So it might look something like that.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.980
Now why is this one...

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.310
It might make sense to you that

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.020
okay, the most probable

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.500
the speed at which I have the most molecules

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.460
I get that that's going to be lower than the speed

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.310
at which I have the most molecules in system A

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.280
because I have, because on average

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.050
these things have less kinetic energy.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.235
They're going to have less speed.

00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:00.184
But why is this peak higher?

00:06:00.184 --> 00:06:01.550
Well, you gotta remember we're talking about

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.080
the same number of molecules.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.350
So if we have the same number of molecules that means

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.910
that the areas under these curves need to be the same.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.900
So if this one is narrower, it's going to be taller.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.760
And if I were gonna, if I were to somehow

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.380
raise the temperature of this system even more.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.780
Let's say I create a third system or I get this

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.020
or let's say I were to heat it up to 400 Kelvin.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.120
Well then my distribution would look

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.470
something like this.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.940
So this is if I heated it up.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.800
Heated up.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.620
And so this is all the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.800
I'm not giving you the more involved, hairy equation for it

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.128
but really the idea of what it is.

00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:43.530
It's a pretty neat idea.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.010
And actually when you actually think about the actual

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.690
speeds of some of these particles, even the air around you

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.060
I'm gonna say, "Oh, it looks pretty stationary to me."

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.700
But it turns out in the air around you is mostly nitrogen.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.000
That the most probable speed of

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.410
if you picked a random nitrogen

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.618
molecule around you right now.

00:07:02.618 --> 00:07:04.340
So the most probable speed.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.160
I'm gonna write this down

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.039
'cause this is pretty mindblowing.

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.780
Most probable speed at room temperature.

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:15.780
Probable speed

00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:20.154
of N2 at room temperature.

00:07:20.154 --> 00:07:23.960
Room temperature.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.400
So let's say this that this was the Maxwell-Boltzmann

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.960
distribution for nitrogen at room temperature.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.620
Let's say that that's, let's say we make

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.450
we call room temperature 300 Kelvin.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.870
This most probable speed right over here

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.030
the one where we have the most molecules

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.400
the one where we're gonna have the most

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.070
molecules at that speed.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.990
In fact, guess what that is going to be before I tell you

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.635
'cause it's actually mind boggling.

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.930
Well, it turns out that it is approximately

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.690
400, 400 and actually at 300 Kelvin

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.846
it's gonna be 422 meters per second.

00:07:57.846 --> 00:08:00.510
422 meters per second.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.220
Imagine something traveling 422 meters in a second.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.700
And if you're used to thinking in terms of miles per hour

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.860
this is approximately 944

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.730
miles per hour.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.927
So right now, around you

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.850
you have, actually

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.340
the most probable, the highest number

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.300
of the nitrogen molecules around you

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.900
are traveling at roughly this speed

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.280
and they're bumping into you.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.860
That's actually what's giving you air pressure.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.480
And not just that speed, there are actually ones

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.190
that are travelling even faster than that.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.570
Even faster than 422 meters per second.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.210
Even faster.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.730
There's particles around you traveling faster

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.210
than a thousand miles per hour

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.980
and they are bumping into your body as we speak.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.650
And you might say, "Well, why doesn't that hurt?"

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.040
Well, that gives you a sense of how small the mass

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.870
of a nitrogen molecule is, that it can

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.640
bump into you at a thousand miles per hour

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640
and you really don't feel it.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.554
It feels just like the ambient air pressure.

00:08:55.554 --> 00:08:57.030
Now, when you first look at this, you're like

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.300
wait, 422 meters per second?

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.510
That's faster than the speed of sound.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.770
The speed of sound is around 340 meters per second.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.000
Well, how can this be?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.860
Well, just think about it.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.220
Sound is transmitted through the air

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.970
through collisions of particles.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.420
So the particles themselves have to be moving

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.300
or at least some of them, have to be moving

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.780
faster than the speed of sound.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.960
So, not all of the things around you

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.910
are moving this fast and they're

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.810
moving in all different directions.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.298
Some of them might not be moving much at all.

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:26.520
But some of them are moving quite incredibly fast.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.800
So, I don't know, I find that a little bit mindblowing.
