&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:16.630
[ Music ]

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.170
&gt;&gt; My name is Chhatra
Bahadur Khatri.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.590
I work in rural education
in [inaudible], Nepal.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.990
I'm involved in [inaudible]
Nepal since last two years.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.310
I work as a program director.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.340
I oversee all the programs
offered in Nepal.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.640
[inaudible], Nepal has been
working in Nepal since 1991

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.280
as a non-profit organization,
and [inaudible] Nepal started

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.380
as community libraries to improve
the literacy of the peoples

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.040
and to change the language of the
community people in the Nepal.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.540
So, it is useful to all community
peoples naturally are reading

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.580
and writing, and we believe

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.830
that community library is not only
the house of books, but it is the,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.780
it is the starting point
of the special things

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.330
in community development.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.750
So, we also do some programs and
training sources to the community,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.540 position:56%
and that is some sort of
[inaudible] are using the libraries.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.030
And some programs we
established after the setting

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.820
up the community library.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.480
Once the library is established,
we provide a need basis trainings

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.790
and some programs, and we give
the training to the women.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.770
We focus for them, a literacy
program, a literacy program

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.130
and education program because
education is the basic things

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.180
and fundamental thing to
do within the community,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.120
and we focus the literacy programs.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.020 position:56%
Similarly, we focus for the women
development programs, women involved

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.690
in the programs because it's still
[inaudible] and 43% of the women

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.350
in the Nepal are illiterate
until now.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.710
And as the social norms,
their community women

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.410
and builders [phonetic] are not
encouraged to read and write,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.550
and they, even they are not
allowed to go out, outside.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.050
So, we focus for women
involvement also.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.520
And another thing is that
we focus for the [inaudible]

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.250
because icity [phonetic] is
generally is across working teams,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.330
and we also provide icity
[inaudible] the community people

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.660
for providing the email,
Internet, and some basic training

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.860
of the community free of cost.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.500
These are the main program

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.850
and a very important this
practice we are doing is

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.940
that practical answer programs,
practical answer programs helps

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.710
to communities access to
the information, knowledge,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.930
and the technology, and they get
to answer what they are feeling.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.760
We provide the response
of the other voices.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.330
These are the main programs.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.530
We have raised to 1.9
people suffered in Nepals

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.190
through 56 community libraries,
and we have produced 124 villages

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.810 position:56%
of Nepal, and we have at least to 29
districts out of the 75 districts,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.860 position:56%
and this where programs are library,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.970
community library programs
are designed

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.190
to solve whole the
community, and we give service

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.440
to all levels of the peoples.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.920 position:56%
Besides that, we have also some
focus programs to women empowerment,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.550
as I already mentioned, and
children and marginalized people.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.310
People are, we will be
behind some in some villages,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.930
the people are not in [inaudible].

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.730
So, we also progress for
the marginalized people.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.250
This literacy program
and [inaudible] program,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.060
as well as the factory [phonetic]
lesson program has a help

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.330
to be their community library, very
important, and people are coming

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.710
to need our, need support to come
to libraries to read and write.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.220
They come for and learn something,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.310
and they come for to get some
answer of their [inaudible].

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.100
So, the credibility of their
community life has been increased,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.410
and the people are more
committed to visiting the library

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.470
because of these programs, and we
want to see a well-informed society

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.190
in Nepal, and there are
more than 4000 villages

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.490
about to have literacy,
a few villages.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.210
So, we want to make
a library one place,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.490
one community library in Nepal.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.080
That is our vision.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.840
But we want to position
that, the [inaudible],

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.610
because community library is
a, that is [inaudible] access

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.320
for developments and
centers for their knowledge,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.430
and it is one of the starting point
of their community development.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.920
So, we want to build more community
libraries as fast as possible,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.380
and then we also want to establish
the sustaining enterprises

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.990
to sustain the community libraries

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.450
because it cannot be
sustained without, themselves.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.980
So, we have also a project

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.260
that we establish sustaining
enterprises together

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.230
with the community library.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.460
And this way we want to establish
community library in the future,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.950
and we also want to
expand our ICDs [inaudible]

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.080
in the community libraries,
and we also want

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.550
to expand all the practically
[inaudible] lines of programs.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.510
That's why we need
the community library,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.180
build the community library
using the very effective way,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.440
and we also are thinking that
what would be the innovative idea

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.950
to inform the local people
to our city in the future.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.220 position:56%
We are always looking for that also.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.880

of the Library of Congress.
