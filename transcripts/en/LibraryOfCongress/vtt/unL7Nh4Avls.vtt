&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: I'm
Betsy Peterson, the director

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.410
of the American Folk Life Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.850
And on behalf of all the
staff, I want to welcome you

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.150
to the latest presentation

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.170
in our ongoing Benjamin
K. Botkin lecture series.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.500
Just a word about
the lecture series.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.750
The Botkin series allows
us at the Folk Life Center

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.960
to highlight the latest
scholarship and the work

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.720
that leading scholars in
the disciplines of folklore,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.060
ethnomusicology, oral
history, cultural heritage

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.460
and other related fields.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.770
We are also showcasing
our collections.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.010
And these lectures do
some dual work for us.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.800
Most importantly they
are an important facet

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.870
of our acquisitions.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.330
All of the lectures in the
Botkin series are taped

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.900
and will become part of
the permanent collections.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.220
But in addition, all

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.440
of the lectures here
are also video recorded

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.800
and will later be
posted as webcasts

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.460
on the library's website
enabling people around the world

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.850
to sort of listen in on these
wonderful lectures but also

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.690
to be available beyond
this moment in time.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.180
So with all of that said, if
you do have any cell phones on,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.400
please turn them off now.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.680
It would be greatly appreciated.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.530
And today we have a
very special treat.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.470
I have the honor of introducing
an internationally-renowned

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.610
folklorist Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.260
who is the distinguished
professor emerita

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.580
of performance studies
at New York University

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.870
and also has served
recently as chief curator

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.730
of the Core Exhibition at the
recently opened POLIN Museum

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.670
of the History of
Polish Jews in Warsaw.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.820
Barbara or BKG as we all know
her has had an extraordinary

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.890
career as I think most everyone
of us in this room knows.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.770
And in the interest of
time, I'll try and be brief,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.050
but it's a longer than usual
introduction for a good reason.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.760
Originally from Toronto, BKG
received her PhD in folklore

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.980
from Indiana University and
began a multi-faceted career

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.490
in both academic and
public sector work.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.740
In addition to teaching
performance studies at NYU

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.990
since 1981, she has held faculty
appointments at the University

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.770
of Texas, Columbia University

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.540
and the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.640
Known for her interdisciplinary
contributions,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.910
her scholarly variance of
interest range far and wide

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.920
from Jewish culture to urban
culture, popular mass culture,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.420
performance studies and tourism,
to ethnology and museums,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.880
folk art and always food.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.910
We all love food.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.530
She served as the president of
the American Folklore Society

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.390
from 1991-92 and was
the society's delegate

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.320
to the American Council
of Learner Societies.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.410
She has served on innumerable
boards, advisory boards,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.380
committees, editorial
boards including those

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.460
for the Getty Institute
for the History of Art

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.690
and the Humanities, the
Smithsonian Institution,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.940
CIC Humanities Center,
the Association

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.510
for Museum History -- I knew
I was going to mess this up.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.890
The Schlesinger Library
on the History of Women,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.870
the Association for Jewish
Studies, executive council,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.340
the American Center
for [inaudible],

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.190
and the Social Science
Research Council.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.910
In 2017 she received an honorary
doctorate from the University

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.670
of Haifa and was elected

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.100
to the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.550
In 2015 she received the
Officer's Cross of the Order

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.670
of Merit of the Republic
of Poland

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.990
from President Komorowski.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.490
And she also received
an honorary doctorate

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.820
from the Jewish Theological
Seminary of America,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.330
the Marshal Star of Award
for her contribution

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.780
to the social scientific
study of Jewry.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.180
And in 2008 she was
honored with the Foundation

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.410
for Jewish Culture's lifetime
achievement award as well

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.360
as the Mlotek Prize for
Yiddish and Yiddish Culture,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.610
and was selected
for the [inaudible]

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.980
which celebrates leadership,
creativity and [inaudible].

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.600
I think you get the idea here.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.680
Lastly, Barbara's publications

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.240
and media contributions have
also ranged far and wide

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.780
and are equally significant.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.560
Just a few highlights of
some of her publications.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.930
Destination Culture:
Tourism, Museums and Heritage.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.810
The Art of Being
Jewish in Modern Times.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.340
Museum Frictions:
Public Culture Interested

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.380
in Global Transformations.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.660
And Image it Before My
Eyes: Photographic History

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.580
of Jewish Life in
Poland 1864-1939.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.370
Recently she also produced a
book They Called Me Mayer July:

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.760
Painted Memories
of Jewish Childhood

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.800
in Poland before the Holocaust.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.370
A lovely book which she
coauthored with her father,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.800
the artist Mayer Kirshenblatt.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.520
I won't go into the
films and all.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.020
In addition to this whole
range of teaching, advising

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.580
and publishing, Barbara also
has a longstanding interest

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.110
in museums and exhibitions.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.830
She has served and is currently
serving as a consultant

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.390
and advisor for New
York's museums, exhibitions

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.530
and cultural festivals.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.120
Among them, the Jewish
Museum in Berlin,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.350
the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.440
and the Smithsonian here in DC.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.730
The Yeshiva University
Museum and the Jewish Museum

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.540
in New York, the Skirball
Museum in Los Angeles,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.920
the Jewish Museum in
Indiana, the Jewish Museum

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.390
and Arts Center in Moscow.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.500
In 2006, after years of
consulting for the New Museum

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.300
of the History of
Polish Jews in Warsaw,

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.880
she agreed to lead the team
developing the core exhibition,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.690
an enormous multimedia
narrative experience dedicated

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.290
to the 1,000-year history of
the Jewish community in Poland.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.980
And it is that project
that the POLIN Museum,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.690
that will be the focus
of Barbara's talk today.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.410
So I think I've just taken
ten minutes of your time.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.000
But please give a warm
welcome to BKG for her talk,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.670
A Folklorist's Tale:
Stories of Tangible Culture,

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.050
Intangible Culture and
the Positives of Culture.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.850
Welcome.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:20.010
[ Applause ]

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.310
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.610
Thank you very, very much
for that lovely introduction.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.310
I found it intimidating.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.880
But really very, very beautiful.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.750
And this is an extraordinary
opportunity.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.980
I want to begin by thanking
Nancy Gross for the invitation

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.430
to come and to speak, and
for attention to every detail

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.200
to really make this
opportunity a very special one

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.330
and a very memorable one for me.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.300
And I take the title of the
talk A Folklorist's Tale:

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.550
Stories of Tangible
Culture, Intangible Culture

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.390
and the Positives of Culture
-- I take it very seriously.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.570
And so what I'd like to do is
to really answer the question,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.110
how is it that the organizers
of this Museum of the History

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.270
of Polish Jews, how
is it that they hired

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.520
of all people a folklorist
to lead the development

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.450
of a permanent exhibition

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.560
about the 1,000-year
history of Polish Jews?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.360
And I pose that to
you as a question

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.460
because when I was asked
to lead the development

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.270
of this permanent exhibition,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.270
one of our most wonderful
donors looked at me

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.210
and said, "What's your field?"

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.880
And I said, "Well,
you know, folklore,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.510
anthropology, ethnography."

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.390
"Oh," he said, "I know what
this exhibition will be.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.320
Teepees and feathers."

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.100
And I was mortified.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.530
I was beyond myself.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.260
And it will be Fiddler
on the Roof.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.550
It will be Ofstettle and it will
be everything that he hates.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.660
So fortunately of course,
it didn't turn out that way.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.870
However, what I want to
do today is to reflect

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.800
on what someone trained as a
folklorist could possibly bring

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.330
to a multimedia narrative
exhibition

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.510
of a 1,000-year history
of Polish Jews,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.780
and why when a folklorist comes

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.120
to such a project it
will look the way it does

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.250
and very different from if this
exhibition had been created

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.510
strictly by not only historians

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.790
but historians trained
at Warsaw University.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.780
Because honestly that probably
would have been the option.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.400
So this is my starting point.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.130
This is POLIN Museum of
the History of Polish Jews.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.060
We opened the building in 2013.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.540
We had the grand
opening in 2014,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.290
and it faces the Monument
to the Ghetto Heroes.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.100
So I want to try to
answer the question --

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.530
well, I'm going to
answer the question

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.830
from two points of view.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.130
One is a personal point of view

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.250
and the other is a
professional point of view.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.380
But from a personal point of
view, I want to start by saying

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.970
that I am the child
of Polish Jews.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.010
That may parents who were
born and raised in Poland,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.370
my father -- this is his
passport and this was issued

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.150
to him when he left Poland
to come to Canada in 1934.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.260
And he was born in Opatow
in south central Poland.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.840
My mother in Brest Letofsk.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.300
He came to Canada
when he was 17.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.250
She was probably about 14
when she came to Canada.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.540
And I was raised in a Jewish
immigrant neighborhood.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.710
And you get a little
bit of an idea --

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.840
I should confess that in the
last few months we've been

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.200
moving from our home
of 44 years.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.810
And you can imagine
the accumulation.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.410
And the only good news
about all of that was

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.670
that in excavating 44 years of
accumulation I actually came

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.970
across old photographs.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.450
And this is kind of my
way of signaling growing

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.200
up in a Jewish immigrant
neighborhood and surrounded

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.500
by Yiddish speakers

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.910
and especially right
after the Holocaust.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.040
I'm born in 1942 during the war.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.230
And I have very vivid
recollections of DP's,

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.650
displaced persons, that is
to say Holocaust survivors,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.590
arriving and playing with
the kids on the street.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.140
So I grew up in a very, if
you will, Polish-Jewish,

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.540
Yiddish-speaking milieu.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.800
So that would be the
second piece of it.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.480
The third piece of it is that as
a child I went through a very,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.410
very orthodox Jewish
phase as a result

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.610
of a terrible Jewish
after-school, if I may say.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.330
They were all awful.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.080
The first was the Farbunshyl.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.850
The next was the Darshyshel
and the next was Atelmatoira

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.150
and they were all really awful.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:39.080
But as a result of my brief
period of strict orthodoxy,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:45.190
when I wasn't able to go to
movies, tear paper, write,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.120
take a bus, anything, there
was one thing I could do --

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.940
and this was before the
era of helicopter parents.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.940
I could walk by myself
at the age of ten

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.360
to the Royal Ontario Museum

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.100
which I did every
single Saturday.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.160
And it was only the
permanent collection.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.760
There was no such
thing as an exhibition

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.680
and there were no
temporary exhibitions.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.490
And that was the beginning
of my great love of museums.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:15.270
But the other moment had to do
with the beginning of my PhD

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.600
in the folklore department
at Indiana University.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.360
Because in the very
first semester,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.710
taking a fieldwork course
in the folklore department

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.340
with Jerry Mince, he
discovered that I knew Yiddish.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.560
And he said, "Well, why don't
you do your fieldwork project

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.750
on Yiddish folklore?"

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.990
So I went home and I did.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.230
And I began interviewing
my father.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.530
And I interviewed
him for over 40 years

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.500
and I never stopped
interviewing him.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.900
And being well-trained
as a folklorist,

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.760
I recorded those interviews.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:53.070
And moreover, when he retired
and was at sort of loose ends,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.600
my mother and my husband
who's an artist, and I,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.190
begged and pleaded
with him for years

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.000
to paint what he could remember.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.310
And he did.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.960
And as a result, he
really did the most

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.600
extraordinary paintings.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.590
And so I would say that
was another extremely

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.890
important moment.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.510
40 years of a conversation

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.340
with somebody whose
memory was bottomless,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.930
who remembered everything
about growing up in Poland

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.530
in the 1920's and '30's and who
then visualized it in hundreds

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.270
of paintings and drawings.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.650
That was another element.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.560
Now while that was happening
at the very, very same time,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.330
I was at the YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.780
and I had the opportunity to
work with Lucian Yaroshefsky,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.110
a marvelous man, a survivor of
the Ghetto of Lodz who had a PhD

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.090
in history from Warsaw
University.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.390
And he was a victim of the
March '68 anti-Semitic campaign

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.850
in Poland and came to New York
without a word of English.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.280
And he was hired by YIVO
to catalog their collection

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.160
of almost 15,000
photographs of Jewish life

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.740
in Poland before the Holocaust.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.700
And they asked me
to work with him

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.750
and to develop an exhibition, a
book and then eventually a film.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.120
And so as a result, I at
the end of that process --

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.460
we opened up the Jewish Museum

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.240
in the '70's -- I
had an image bank.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.120
I had all my father's memories.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.070
I had an image bank
of all of these black

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.110
and white photographs and I
said to myself, "You know" --

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.600
and we published a book
and we did the exhibition.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.850
I said, "You know, I've
got to go to Poland."

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.930
And of course before going to
Poland I had all my training

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.840
and all of my academic
preparation in folklore,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.320
in ethnography, in oral
history, in Yiddish studies,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.650
in east European Jewish studies.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.150
So I was really ready
for the next step.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.250
And so this is the kind
of photograph that I knew

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.330
from the YIVO collection
working with Yaroshefsky

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.100
that we used this kind of
material in Before My Eyes.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.290
So this would be market day
in my father's hometown.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.230
And this is how he remembered
the market in his hometown.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.870
And of course this is
market day but of course not

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.620
as full as the photograph.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.440
And this is what it
looks like today.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.510
Because of course there
are no market days today

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.970
in these towns, but
rather they've been turned

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.200
into parks basically.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.590
And so when I was invited
to work on this museum

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.800
and it was an invitation --

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.580
well, first of all it began
really as a phone call in 2002.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.840
Would I come to Warsaw
and review the preparation

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.140
for the creating of this museum?

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.150
And I thought to
myself, "This is crazy."

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.580
It's 2002, it's a
little more than a decade

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.520
after the fall of communism.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.280
It's hard for me to
imagine how it's possible.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.300
And I went.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.420
And I was very impressed
with the plan.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.840
They had been developing --

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.810
and I'll explain in a
moment the process --

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.220
a master plan for
the exhibition.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.920
And so I went and then when the
museum was founded I was asked

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.570
to lead the project.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.170
So I want to convey to you the
nature of the project but what I

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.460
as a folklorist feel
I could bring to it

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:05.880
that I hope contributed to what
makes it very, very special.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.560
And of course I think
of myself rather

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.040
as an orchestra conductor,
as a midwife working

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.390
with an extraordinary
team of academics,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.680
curators, designers and others.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.760
And so this is where this museum
actually has been created.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.390
It's been created on the
ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.330
which was the pre-war
Jewish neighborhood.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.590
And after the Germans suppressed
the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.920
they leveled the whole area.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.170
And you can see in the
background the leveling of 85%

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.810
of the historical core,
the city of Warsaw,

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:42.760
after they suppressed
the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.600
Now when we had the grand
opening which was 2014 --

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.950
and that's when we opened
the permanent exhibition --

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.340
there was this comment
by Arnie Eisen

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.810
from the Jewish Theological
Seminary.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.930
And it was a very
moving comment for me

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.780
and a very, very meaningful one.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.110
"It's not often that
a museum makes history

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.740
as well as chronicles it.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.400
And rare too when otherwise
cautious observers remark

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.280
at the opening of a new museum
that it may prove a source

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.610
of hope and pride that propels
an entire society forward.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:17.550
Both of those things
happened this week in Warsaw

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.730
with the opening
of POLIN Museum."

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.730
Now there are several
things here that were very,

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.690
very meaningful for me.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.430
Otherwise cautious observers
is an understatement.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.570
Because in fact there
was great skepticism

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.040
about this project
for many reasons.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.370
American Jews thought it
was a Polish states plan

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.990
to whitewash the history
and extract tourist dollars.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.450
And Poles thought it was going
to be a museum of the history

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.660
of anti-Semitism and blacken
the good name of Poland.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.960
And there were others

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.850
who thought it was an
unrealistic project

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.330
that could never be completed.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.350
So cautious observers is
really an understatement.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:03.870
But the second is the idea that
the creation of the museum was

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.560
in and of itself making history
as well as chronicling it.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.450
And that it could
actually make a difference

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.750
to the wider society.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.120
And I like to think of
that not only as Poland,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.470
but also the wider
society more generally.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.460
And that's something
we maybe can take

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.670
up a little bit later on.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.030
So the museum as you saw

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.000
from the very first
image faces the Monument

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.360
to the Ghetto Heroes.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.780
And this photograph
is from 1948.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.380
And what it's showing you is
the unveiling of the monument

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.240
on sort of this mound
of the rubble.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.160
Because by 1948 it was
the fifth anniversary

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.460
of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.980
but it was only a couple
years after the war.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.820
And there's a path
that's been cut through,

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.580
but you can see the people have
to climb up the rubble to get

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.680
to the monument,
and it took decades

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.210
to actually clear the rubble
and to flatten the area.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.800
And in the back you can see
the destroyed city of Warsaw.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.520
So the decision as to
where to put the museum --

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.530
well, first of all,
because almost nothing --

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:14.070
there's almost no material trace
of the vibrant Jewish community

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.720
of Warsaw, the largest
Jewish community in Europe

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.560
and for a time the largest
Jewish community in the world.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.590
There's almost nothing
to indicate

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.650
that such a community
existed except maybe

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.940
for the Jewish cemetery
in Warsaw.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.570
But that means that since 1948
and until the museum opened,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.000
perhaps the most iconic marker
was in fact this monument,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.600
the Monument to the Ghetto
Heroes showing the fighters

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.200
on one side and the great
deportation on others,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.040
and surrounded by
communist-era apartment blocks

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.480
in a very sleepy
part of the city.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.300
It's still central city,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.790
but these communist-era
apartment blocks are --

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.750
this really gives you a
feeling of there are no cafes,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.420
there's no lively street life.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.440
There's a plaza, there's a park.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.170
But when the decision
was taken to actually try

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.650
to create this museum, the city
allocated the land facing the

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:10.530
monument which was the perfect
location for this museum.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:15.990
And the museum itself
as an idea arose in '93,

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.130
but it wasn't actually
founded until 2005.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.590
And that's when the
architectural competition was

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.350
organized and the winner
was a Finnish architect

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.850
who created a building
that was by the rules

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.190
of the competition not higher

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.200
than the communist-era
apartment buildings around it,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.590
and had to be able to sit within
this residential neighborhood.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.100
And here you can see the
building from the other side

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.960
of the monument which
is the side

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.140
that shows the great
deportation of 300,000 Jews

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.910
from the Warsaw Ghetto
in the summer of 1942

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.230
to the death camp in Treblinka.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.950
The museum's name POLIN comes
from the Hebrew word for Poland

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.630
so it would be Polin in Hebrew

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.490
and it would be Poiln
in Yiddish.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.460
And this is silkscreened on
the glass, I would say almost

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.630
like scales on a fish that
line the outside of the wall

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.950
in Hebrew and in Latin letters.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.650
And I'll explain in a
moment why that name.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.080
But this beautiful building

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.010
of glass is really I
would say an architecture

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.100
of hope on a site of tragedy.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.330
And it just shimmers in
the light and it is open

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.760
and transparent,
and it's reflective.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.060
And it really I think

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.860
as architecture communicates
what this museum is all about.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.900
And all the drama
is on the inside,

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.110
using a technique
called shot-crete,

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.750
shooting actually a mixture of
concrete and quartz crystals

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.910
from a hose onto
netting over an armature.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.660
And it's created the most
dramatic and marvelous interior.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.590
But what that does is it allows
the exterior of the building

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.750
to stand in a proper
relationship to the monument

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.320
which was also one of the
rules of the competition.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.290
Now at the heart of the
museum and of course the area

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.790
that I worked on is the
multimedia narrative exhibition.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.610
And the minute you
say narrative,

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.440
you're talking to a folklorist.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.430
It's all about storytelling.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.690
And if there's anything that
modern museums have learned,

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.140
that is that they're not
really an ideal medium

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.020
for communicating information.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.330
But that the single
best way to communicate

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.710
with a visitor is
through storytelling.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.730
And that is through
those small stories

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.710
that you can create a big story.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.180
And it's through storytelling
that you can make sense,

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.480
and it's through storytelling

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.160
that you can create an
experience that is memorable

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.790
and is emotional and
is thought-provoking.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.310
And so I felt like
I was in my element.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.420
I had written my doctoral
dissertation on storytelling

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.380
in the Toronto Jewish community.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.600
I had studied narrative
top to bottom.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.990
Semiotics and structuralism
and you name it,

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.070
and sociolinguistics,
ethnography of communication.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.230
Whatever there was to
think about storytelling,

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.840
whatever tools I
could possibly have,

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.170
I feel as a folklorist
I got them in spades.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.800
And I was able to
bring that feeling,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.100
that sense of storytelling
and the power of storytelling

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.890
to the creating of this museum.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.410
And so we enter the museum

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.100
from the main hall
down a set of stairs.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.470
And we come into what I think
of as a theater of history.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.890
And that is that this
is a museum that began

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.700
without an historic building,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.880
without an historic
neighborhood,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.410
without a collection.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.480
But its single greatest
aspect was intangible.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.380
Its single greatest
aspect was its story.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:43.120
And they started with the
story, and the challenge was how

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.930
to communicate that story

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.920
in a really powerful way using
the medium of an exhibition.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.870
And so of course we showed
objects, we used objects.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.950
And the single most important
collection of such objects is

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.770
at the Jewish Historical
Institute in Warsaw.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:02.060
But this collection, like
almost all collections

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.980
of Jewish material related to
the history of Polish Jews,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.270
it's 19th and 20th century,
it's largely art and Judaica,

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.220
photographs and memorabilia.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.160
There's virtually almost nothing
from the medieval period.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.240
There's very little from
the 16th, 17th centuries.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.940
You're lucky if you
can find some Judaica

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.450
from the 18th century.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.750
And so the idea that you could
create a compelling 1,000-year

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.780
story based on a collection
was out of the question.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.170
And so since the story was
primary and since communicating

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.450
with our visitors was primary,
we had to do something else.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:44.150
So just a quick idea of
the unique circumstances

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.680
around the creating this museum.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.690
So the idea in 1993 was
prompted by the opening

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.160
of the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum here

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.460
in Washington.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.580
And the thought was if there's a
Holocaust Museum in Washington,

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.050
there should be a
Museum of the History

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.200
of Polish Jews in Warsaw.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:07.270
And I would say the idea became
a formal project in 1996.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.330
And it was initiated
by the Association

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.740
of the Jewish Historical
Institute of Poland,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:19.380
which is a Jewish NGO
established in 1951 in Poland.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.890
And of course the story
being all they had,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.960
it was the developing of
the permanent exhibition

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.990
that the association
dedicated itself

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:32.710
to literally from
1996 until 2005.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.320
So for over ten years, that's
all they did was to work

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:40.090
on developing the basis for and
then the actual master plan.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.970
In 2005 the museum is founded,
there's the competition.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.850
There were over 200 entrants
with about 11 finalists.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.910
And among them Daniel
Liebeskind.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.660
And the architects like to say

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.270
that the best prize is second
prize because you get the prize

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:57.270
and you don't have to build it.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:02.310
So I'm not so sure that some
of these famous architects --

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:06.180
and they had marvelous
projects, but not for this site.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.370
You know, Daniel Liebeskind,
it was an open book

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.220
with these pages like wings.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.220
Can you imagine that with this
communist-era architecture

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.770
in this residential
neighborhood?

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.290
Out of the question.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.260
So then we opened the building,
we had the grand opening

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.820
and then in 2016 it was
the first time any museum

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.340
in Poland had won these awards.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.980
The European Museum
of the Year Award,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.060
the European Museum
Academy Prize.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.470
And no museum in Europe
had ever won both prizes

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.770
in the same year.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.460
Although I have to say that the
European Museum Academy was a

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.760
little miffed.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.300
They said, "Oh my God,
if only we had known

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.950
that you'd got the other award."

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.520
And I thought, "Good
that you didn't know."

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.130
So we got both of those.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.350
And then as of now,
since we opened,

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.710
we've had about 3
million visitors

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.540
which is really very,
very exceptional.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.550
I would say only paralleled --

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.690
and we're speaking now not
about Holocaust museums

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.080
but about Jewish
history museums.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.390
I would say the only
comparable museum

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.400
of that scale would be the
Jewish Museum of Berlin.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.450
So it's really quite
exceptional.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.350
So coming to this as an
academic, not as someone

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.490
who worked her entire
career in a museum,

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.280
and working with an
international team of academics,

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.220
we developed a set of principles

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.460
that would guide the
creating of the narrative.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.610
And it was very, very
important to us basically

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:31.760
that we have a kind of
consistent and coherent approach

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.770
to the overall historical
narrative and also

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.260
to the way in which we tell it.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.100
This was really important
so that it wasn't

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.480
like the designers come in,
you give them the stuff,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.380
they come back to you with the
design and it's kind of a mix

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.610
of a little bit of this
and a little bit of that.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:50.440
No. So the first was to
declare clearly and strongly

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.710
that the single most
important period in the history

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.320
of Polish Jews is 1,000 years.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.260
Not the Holocaust, not
the post-war years,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.850
not the inter-war years.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.710
And of course nobody ever
said the medieval period

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.550
which is more than 500 years.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.380
And our medieval historian
used to always complain.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.000
She'd say, "I've got more
than half the millennium

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.470
and nobody's interested."

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:15.130
But as it turns out, actually
it's one of the most interesting

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.930
and most appreciated
of all of the sort

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.760
of seven historical galleries.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.960
The second was that Jews
are an integral part

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.260
of the history of Poland.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.530
That they're not only in
Poland but also of Poland.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.830
And the idea of an integral
history was very important

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.130
to us.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.520
The third is that we would
focus or structure our narrative

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.130
around what we called a
spectrum of relations.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.430
Because there was an assumption

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.620
that the single most
important relation

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.960
or the determining relation in
this history was anti-Semitism.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.310
And we said no.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:51.150
This is a story of coexistence
and conflict, cooperation

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.100
and competition, separation

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.070
and integration,
inclusion, exclusion.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.380
And it's a spectrum.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.780
Sometimes one of those
terms is in the foreground

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.960
and other times another.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.870
A fourth principle was that
Jews created a civilization

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.320
that is categorically Jewish
and distinctly Polish.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.620
Excuse me.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.750
And that this community became
the largest Jewish community

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.340
in the world and a center
of the Jewish world.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.540
But the 18th century, half the
Jews in the world were living

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.340
in this territory,
that is the territory

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.630
of the Polish-Lithuanian
commonwealth

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.980
which includes today
Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.280
and surrounding areas.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.120
And that's 750,000 Jews.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.890
That was half the
Jewish population

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.020
of the entire world
was living here.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.460
And there's no way that
the population would grow

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.150
to that extent and that there
would be a continuous Jewish

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.380
presence across 1,000 years

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.740
if this was essentially a
history of anti-Semitism.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.610
And then the power of telling
the story in the very place

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.610
where it happened which
might seem obvious,

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.400
but I cannot tell you how
many people say to me,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.010
"Why are you making
this museum in Poland?"

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.310
[ Laughter ]

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.610
I say, "Well, where
should we make it?"

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:08.930
They say, "You should
make it in Tel Aviv

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.230
or you should make
it in New York.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.950
You should make it
where the Jews are."

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.730
I said, "We're going to
bring the museum to the Jews.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.200
No, we're going to bring Jews
and everybody else to Poland

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.090
and the power of
telling this story

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.590
in the very place
of this story."

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.050
That is incomparable.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.350
There is nothing to replace it.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:31.310
And so like a good folklorist,
we begin the 1,000-year history

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.040
of Polish Jews with a legend.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.350
And it's the legend of Polin.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.280
And we use a very beautiful
retelling of the legend

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.250
by Agnon, the Nobel Prize-winner
for Hebrew literature.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.330
And the legend goes
something like this.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.570
Jews in western Europe
were being persecuted.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.880
They fled east.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.890
They found themselves
in a forest.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.640
And then of course there
are versions of variance.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.680
And according to one
version, the clouds broke

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.060
and an angel's hand pointed and
they heard the words, "Polin."

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.990
According to another version,
the birds were chirping "Polin."

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.910
In another version,
there were pages

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:08.800
of a holy text were
floating down,

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.870
or they saw Hebrew words
carved on the trees.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.170
But when they heard the words

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:17.670
"Polin" they though they heard
Hebrew, "Pau leen", rest here.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.730
And so they said, "It
is divinely ordained

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.150
that we should stay here
until the Messiah comes

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:26.240
and we are taken
to the holy land."

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.650
And so they say that's
how Poland got its name.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.950
We know that.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.740
Maybe the others don't, but we
know how Poland got its name.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.420
And indeed Polin and
Poiln are the Hebrew

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.920
and Yiddish names of Poland.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.430
And so wat we did is to
create this very poetic,

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.540
very evocative forest inspired

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.400
by the UNESCO World Heritage
Site in Northeastern Poland

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.940
which is the marvelous
primordial forest.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.150
And we then retold the
legend in this space.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.350
And so our visitors
actually begin in a space

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:02.340
and a very poetic space, a
space of historical imagination

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.230
where you have sort of a
sense of how Jews are trying

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.940
to explain to themselves
how they came to Poland.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.710
And that they should explain it

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.390
in such a positive way is
a very counterintuitive way

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.190
of beginning this
1,000-year story.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.240
Now we come to the
medieval gallery.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.520
The moment that we enter
the medieval gallery,

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.550
we cross a threshold
between legend and history.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.720
Now what do we have to work with
from this over 500-year period

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.530
from 960 to 1507, more or less?

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.550
There are exactly two kinds
of objects for this period

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:40.340
that are directly connected to
Polish Jews, Jews in Poland.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.640
Tombstones.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.950
This is the earliest Jewish
tombstone from Braclaw.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.250
It's 1203.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.110
And Bracteates, one-sided coins

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.610
that actually have Hebrew
inscriptions on them

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.990
that were either
minted by Jews or minted

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.710
under their supervision.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.010
That's it.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.630
And of course they're
not that big.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.340
They're the size of a dime.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.870
And a 500-year story
made out of tombstones --

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.910
of course we can't bring
all these tombstones

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.860
into the gallery anyway --
and of little tiny coins?

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:13.430
No way? So what did we do?

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.400
What we did was this.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.810
Our greatest asset in this
entire exhibition is intangible.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:29.300
It is the stories that we're
able to glean from sources

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.070
like rabbinical correspondence,
travel accounts, chronicles,

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.630
legal documents,
religious texts.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:43.220
From any one of any number of
texts, and it's those stories

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.950
that are our bread and butter.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.730
They are our artifacts.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.150
They're intangible, but we
think of them as our artifacts.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:54.040
And so we went to
our medieval sources,

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.460
to these travel accounts,
to rabbinical correspondence

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.880
where one rabbi is
writing another rabbi.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.230
"I have this dilemma,
give me your advice."

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.400
And those letters
were actually compiled

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.860
so we've got access to them.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.430
So we got the stories
from there that refer

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:13.270
to these Jewish traveling
merchants and what was going

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.220
on in the wild east in
the medieval period.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.010
And then we took
illuminated manuscripts

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.560
from the Ashkenazi
communities in the Rhineland

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.320
which is the region from
which Jews came to Poland.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.310
And we gave them to two

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.110
of Poland's most celebrated
comic book artists.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.780
And we said to them,
"Illustrate the stories."

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.060
And then we asked two, actually
three church conservators,

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:46.340
conservators of Polish churches,
to actually hand-paint the walls

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.660
with those illustrations.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.160
And they are in a style
that changes from century

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.560
to century to century.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:58.380
And the result -- and we also
had a gilder actually gild

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.910
with real gold the
sections that deal

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.490
with the what we
call royal relations.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.620
And the result is a
hand-painted gallery.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.120
So this is a gallery

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.760
in a multimedia narrative
exhibition --

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.860
you expect all high-tech
and immersive and whatever.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.200
And here you've got a
handmade gallery which is

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.650
like an illuminated manuscript

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.570
that is life-size
and 360-degrees.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.360
And you're actually inside it.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:30.480
And so here in the presence
of tombstones and coins,

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.140
we actually have something
very, very startling.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.950
And so we've organized
it in that way,

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.770
and of course we provide
interactive opportunities

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.910
to dig deeper into the story.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.170
When we move from
the medieval period

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.210
to the early modern period,

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.160
we move to the Polish-Lithuanian
commonwealth,

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.740
and let me just show
you the map.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.860
And this now is the
territory at its largest.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.490
It is Ukraine has been
absorbed into Poland

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.800
in the medieval period
and now Lithuania joins

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.440
and they form the
Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.300
And this is a period that both
in I would say Polish history

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.920
and Jewish history is treated
as something of a golden age.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.220
And of course golden
age is a trope.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.380
But what's interesting here is

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.090
that during this period
there was a lampoon --

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.290
and in many versions
in variance --

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.390
which basically criticized
everything about Poland.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:28.070
And among what they criticized
was what they called --

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.210
they said Poland is a
paradises Judaiorum.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.030
It is a Jewish paradise
which was a criticism.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.470
In other words, Jews
had it too good.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:40.230
And so we take this
paradises Judaiorum as a kind

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.540
of ambivalent with
a question mark.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.510
But they also say the
nobility yare no good

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.610
and the clergy are no good
and the foreigners are no good

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.790
and everybody's no good,
and everything's wrong

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.090
with the commonwealth.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.390
And so you can see --

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:54.690
you probably can't
read it from there,

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.910
but I can maybe read
it from here.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.410
It says here, "The
Polish burghers,"

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.930
let's see here, oh yes.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:05.590
It's "Paradise for the
Jews, hell of the peasants,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:10.350
purgatory for the burghers
and it is rule by servants."

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.460
And it's a bit like
the criticism

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.000
of immigrants, et cetera.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.300
But what did we do?

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.950
We created -- and this is a
hallmark of the exhibition --

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.580
we created a multi-voiced
narrative.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.870
Not a single voice, and
everything is in what I call

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.560
in quotation marks,
the "first person."

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.580
Meaning that as much as
possible we drive the narrative

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.720
from quotations from primary
sources from the period

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.450
and we try to keep our
visitors inside the moment

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.240
of the telling of the story.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.490
And so here what you have
is you have a quotation

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.810
from the great rabbi Moses
Isserles who says basically,

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.570
"Things here aren't as bad
as they are in Germany,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:51.870
and may it stay that way."

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.860
In other words, he had
very low expectations.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.450
But this is the early
modern period.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.600
This is what religious
toleration looked like.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.960
And we have Karahite and we have
a nobleman and we have those

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.610
that are for and those
that are against.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.270
And it's kind of a
chorus of voices.

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:09.000
And the whole exhibition is
organized around that principle

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.170
of multiple voices,
primary sources all

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.150
from the period itself

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.470
and in what we would call
the historical present.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.500
Now we wanted to communicate
some very abstract ideas.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.870
And in this section of the early
modern period, meaning 16th

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.540
and 17th centuries, one of the
big ideas is that the center

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.240
of the Ashkenazi
world has shifted

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.250
from the Rhineland to Poland.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.310
And why? For two reasons.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:40.550
One, because Poland becomes
known, renowned as a center

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:45.840
of rabbinical authority,
scholarship, printing.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.940
And because there was
a very high degree

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.240
of Jewish self-government.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.080
Those were extremely
abstract ideas, very difficult

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.860
to communicate in an exhibition.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.280
And we decide to do it through
a history of printing --

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.790
and in fact the earliest
Yiddish printed books and very,

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.650
very early and important
printed Hebrew books.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.100
And to make it as
impactful as possible.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.710
It turned out that manual
interactives are far more

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.650
effective than digital ones.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.400
And here what we did was to
create four printing presses.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.090
Initially they were intended for
kids, but adults love them too.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.390
And so you've got --

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.640
our visitors are printing
title pages, printer's marks,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.180
et cetera, framing
them, taking them home,

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.570
hanging them on their walls.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.480
If you can imagine
all over Poland,

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.110
you have these Yiddish printed
and Hebrew printed elements

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.730
which I find absolutely
extraordinary.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.810
But of course we also
wanted to open those books

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.330
up which we do digitally,

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:46.440
and to interpret them including
a wonderful Kabbalistic scroll

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.540
that had never been
shown before.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.510
And we break the period
and treatise Asazura,

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:57.720
the Khmeltnytsky uprising
of 1648, and that brings us

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.500
into the second half of
this commonwealth period

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.990
where we zoom in
on everyday life

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.360
in what we call the Jewish town.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.990
The most characteristic
form of Jewish settlement

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.610
in this territory were towns

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:15.830
because Jews were always
settling in towns and in cities.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.130
They weren't agricultural.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:21.820
They managed agricultural
assets like farms and villages

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.050
and mills and fisheries
and forests.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.350
But they lived in the town

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:30.200
and they were the economic
engine of the noble states.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.750
And here is a wonderful
opportunity

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.310
to capture everyday life.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.320
Because one of the hallmarks of
this exhibition is its emphasis

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.790
on ordinary people, everyday
life, social history,

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.230
cultural history,
not only the elites

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.570
but also the everyday people.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:52.070
And I think probably the most
dramatic expression of something

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:56.710
that folklorists would
appreciate especially is the way

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.280
we dealt with a completely
lost object.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.140
And so let me just
take you through this.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.890
Some of you may have
seen Raise the Roof.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:06.340
How many saw Raise the Roof?

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.790
A few people saw it.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.650
It's now available I
think for streaming,

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.950
but I really recommend it.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:15.440
It's a wonderful film and you'll
understand why in a moment.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.870
So we wanted to communicate
in our Jewish town

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.510
that there were two
centers of gravity.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.590
There was the marketplace and
then there was the synagogue.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.480
The marketplace was
about economics.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.610
It was about Jewish interaction
with their neighbors.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.960
Around the marketplace
there would be a tavern,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.330
a church, a town hall, homes.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.580
And that would be one story.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.810
And then there was
the synagogue and all

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.910
of the Jewish communal
buildings around it,

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.470
and that was another story.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:48.410
And we always felt that one
of the most unique features,

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.410
if you will, of Polish Jewish
civilization was the synagogue.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.480
It of course shares
architectural forms

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.800
and it shared building
techniques and iconographic

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.890
and other techniques
with its surroundings,

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.710
whether they're Ukrainian,
Lithuanian, Polish.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:10.210
But the ensemble, the actual
ensemble is a really uniquely I

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.300
would say distinctly
categorically Jewish,

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.060
distinctly Polish,
Ukrainian, Lithuanian object.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.030
Now there were about 200

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.220
of the great wooden
synagogues in this territory.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.340
I would say the ones
that are from the 16th,

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.080
17th and 18th centuries,
there were about 200 of them.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.910
And with the outbreak of
the war and during the war,

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:34.950
the Germans destroyed
all of them.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.150
Not one of them is
still standing.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:42.270
However, during the 1890's and
especially up to World War I

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.970
and during the '20's and '30's,
there was a kind of I would say

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.270
like an arts and
crafts movement,

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.430
but it was a preservationist
movement.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.280
And there was an interest,
a kind of discovery

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.030
of the vernacular architecture
and an appreciation of it.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.630
And then a concerted
effort to document it.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:02.220
And it so happens that there
was one of these synagogues,

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.460
the one that once stood
at Gloycnez which is today

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:08.670
in Ukraine that is the
single best-documented of all

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.970
of the wooden synagogues.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.130
And it happened to be
destroyed in World War I

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.350
when the Russian front
moved through Gloycnez.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:19.630
But the documentation began
in the 1890's and it continued

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.660
with -- the material
is incredible.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.060
Not only photographs, but
also architectural drawings,

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.390
cross-sections, cutaways,
floor plans, measurements,

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:31.030
photographs and paintings.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.320
This is a painting of the
interior of that synagogue

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.750
from about 1897, and
this is Isadore Kaufman,

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.160
a Jewish artist living in
Vienna, who used to spend months

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.240
in the sort of rural part
of what's called Galicia,

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.390
the partition of the
Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:57.100
And this is his painting of
one section of that interior.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.030
He also painted a
section of the interior

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:01.820
of a nearby wooden synagogue

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.170
that had been done
by the same artist.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.300
So we have some color
references.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:10.150
So what do you do when you're
dealing with a lost object?

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.740
We worked with an
educational studio

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.740
in Massachusetts called
Handshouse Studio.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:21.900
And their mission is to
recover lost objects.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.850
Three words, recover
lost objects,

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.840
captures perfectly
what they're about.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.040
And what they say is you can
never recover the original

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.650
object in the sense of
the original material.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.070
So you can never
recover it in the sense

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.080
of what was tangible about it.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.220
But you can recover the
knowledge of how to build it

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:44.910
by building it using traditional
tools, materials and techniques.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.830
In other words, you can
recover the intangible heritage.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.860
You can recover something
that is of enormous value,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.850
but in order to recover
it, you actually have

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.180
to do something tangible.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.140
And the outcome is an
object, but it's not a copy,

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.230
a facsimile, a replica,
a reconstruction.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:07.160
I absolutely categorically --

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.510
I can't even believe
I uttered those words.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.860
I categorically reject
that terminology.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.770
Because it is an actual object.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:19.700
It is a new kind of
object and its value lies

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.410
in the way it was created
and in the knowledge

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.390
that was recovered
from creating it.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.290
And I think of it as a
very Japanese approach.

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:29.610
In other words, there are
shrines in Japan that claim

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.080
to be 800 years old and
never more than 20 years old.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.520
Because every 20 years they
tear it down in order to have

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.300
to rebuild it, because
it's only be rebuilding it

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.230
that they can transmit to the
next generation how to do it.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:47.390
And they value the
knowledge of how to do it more

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.110
than they value the
original material.

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.760
So this is intangible
heritage on steroids.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:46:00.330
It is the gold standard for --
in a sense not only the recovery

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:05.770
of a tangible heritage, but
also the role if you will

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.950
or the relationship between
intangible and tangible.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.390
That is what's so
absolutely brilliant.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:12.690
So what did we do?

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.540
We went to the Open Air Folk
Architecture Museum just outside

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.540
of Sanok in the south of Poland.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.810
And they were really great
in collaborating with us.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:24.700
And they allocated a big,
huge piece of their territory.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.880
They said, "Okay, you can make
your wooden synagogue here."

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.510
And of course I wanted to do it
100% scale, the whole synagogue.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:32.810
It's not that big to start with,

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.940
but my museum director
said it was too much.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:40.720
So I settled for the roof and
the painted ceiling, 85% scale.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:46.490
So we then ordered 200 logs
with the bark still on.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:50.100
And we collaborated with the
Timber Framers Guild of America

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.810
and with other timber
framers in Europe.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.630
And these timber
framers, they're maniacs.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.000
They come with their --

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.790
they will go anywhere
to timber frame.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:02.590
And they bring with them their
historical axes and adzes

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:06.080
and lathes and pit saws
and every imaginable tool.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.210
They brought them in golf bags
and ski bags on the airplane.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:10.910
I don't know how they did it.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:13.180
And it was like Lord of the
Flies -- not Lord of the Flies.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.090
Lord of the Rings.

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.170
[ Laughter ]

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:20.150
Oh my God, how could you
mix those two things up?

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:23.600
Well, maybe under certain
circumstances, you know.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:28.660
And so we put together a team of
volunteers and these volunteers,

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.070
often students, had never,
ever picked up a saw, a hammer

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:33.900
or anything in their lives.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.720
And the whole idea was
that it would be also --

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.280
because Handshouse Studio
is an educational project.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.580
And it is very do-ey.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.990
It's very learn by doing.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.710
And so this is a pit saw.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:47.080
And then in the course of
three two-week workshops,

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.920
we completed all
the timber framing.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.770
And so this structure,
this is the roof structure,

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:54.450
is held together by wooden pegs.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:48:01.570
And at the end of the six
weeks, we pulled the pegs out,

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.870
numbered all the parts,
put them under a tarpaulin

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.350
and let them sit out
there for almost two years

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.410
until we were ready to bring
all the pieces to the museum.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.830
And then you can imagine with
these beams what it was like.

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:17.360
I photographed the whole
process of bringing these beams

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.760
into the museum and
lowering them

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.230
without destroying the building.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.010
And that was really something.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:24.850
And so what we did then
was take all the pieces,

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.200
put them back together again
and we hoisted this structure.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.660
And fortunately we had come
up with what we wanted to do

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.100
in time for the architect
to modify the plan

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.140
and to create an
opening in the gallery

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.030
so that this structure
could come all the way up

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:44.390
and the upper part of the roof
would be in the main hall.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:47.080
That means that when visitors
came into the main hall

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.680
for their cup of coffee or
to sit down, it was a bit

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.300
like a spider's web, you know?

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.270
You would capture them and
they would say, "What's that?"

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:56.680
And we kept a lot
of the roof open

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.950
so that they could see inside
to the internal structure.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:04.930
And so then it was time to
create the painted ceiling.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.350
So we divided the
painted ceiling up into

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:12.270
about eight sections, and each
section was a two-week workshop

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:17.360
that we conducted in a
still-standing masonry synagogue

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.050
in different locations
across the length

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.350
and breadth of Poland.

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:26.500
So in Warsaw, Rawa, Solna, in
Chebshevin and [Polish city]

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.230
and Krakow, and just really --

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.550
for the students to be
actually creating a panel

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.530
of the painted wooden
synagogue in an existing,

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:39.600
standing masonry synagogue
was an incredible experience.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:45.070
And this is the result,
which is really fabulous,

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:46.440
absolutely fabulous.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.370
Now the beama, the reader's
platform in the middle,

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.190
is actually 100% scale.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.050
And it was created in
exactly the same way.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:55.530
And so you get a little
bit of a sense of it.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:59.360
And then we have multimedia
presentation on the lectern

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.010
which explains what
all the symbolism is

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.220
and that kind of thing.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.420
But my favorite is the kids.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.720
Because we have a little cushion

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.400
for the kids that
have two straps.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.700
And they wear it -- they're

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.100
like little turtles wearing
their house on their back.

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.890
But when they come to this area,
we encourage them just to lie

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.560
down and to look at the ceiling.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.860
And I have a feeling for some

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.180
of these kids it will be the
single most memorable experience

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.040
of their childhood.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.930
Now we are very consistent
within the exhibition

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:35.010
in keeping our visitors
in the moment.

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:40.110
And we only use sources from
the period in the period.

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:42.740
However, we wanted to
communicate the process

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.500
by which we created this
incredible structure,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.670
and the materials
that we used for it.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:51.230
But that we do on the upper
level in the main hall.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.110
And we have a glass ledge
that goes all the way around,

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:58.200
but I was astonished to see one
kid showing another kid what is

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.950
going on with this roof and see
a little kid looking at a map

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:03.810
to see where these
wooden synagogues were.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:06.940
So even kids -- I
mean, you would think

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.660
that kids need somehow or other
something more spectacular,

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.960
something more digital.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.380
But actually it's
not the case at all.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:17.900
So I think what I'm going to do
is very briefly give you a sense

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.460
of the rest of the
exhibition, because I wanted

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:25.530
to focus today more on heritage,
on tangible, intangible

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:27.140
and a folklorist's perspective.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.770
But I'll just very, very briefly
give you a little bit of a sense

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.910
of where we go from that
early modern period.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:37.820
So at the end of the
18th century, in 1772,

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.380
the Polish-Lithuanian
commonwealth was

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.680
quite decentralized.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.730
It was what was called
a republic of nobles.

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:46.800
It had a very weak army, had
a weak king, and Prussia,

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.100
Russia and Austria decided that
this was the perfect moment

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:55.270
to each take a piece of the
royal cake, to divide up the map

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:56.890
of the Polish-Lithuanian
commonwealth

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:58.400
and each take a part.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.480
And so our long 19th century
is essentially the story

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.090
of what happened in each of the
parts, each of the three parts

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.060
that were taken over by
the kingdom of Prussia

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.040
and by the Russian
and Austrian empires.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.600
And we call this
encounters with modernity.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.190
And I think a hallmark
of our approach is

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:20.160
that we look not only at
the geopolitical situation,

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.380
at the legal situation,
but also at everyday life.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.530
We look at memoirs and
we especially look also

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.370
at women's experience.

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.810
And we take for example
the Jewish wedding

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:34.510
and its transformations over the
whole period as a way of trying

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.320
to understand how
ordinary people

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.160
in their everyday lives were
affected by the new laws

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.640
and new circumstances and
conditions of now living

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.780
within these two empires
and the kingdom of Prussia.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.020
We also work with the
absence of objects

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.080
for communicating a very
important development

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.620
which was the modern Yeshiva.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:59.170
We created a beautiful
stenography in a computer,

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:03.130
but we also painted live
actors and filmed them as a way

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:07.160
of conveying the development
of organized responses

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.460
to encounters with modernity.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.120
Which means the Jewish
Enlightenment,

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.100
the modern Yeshiva
and also Hasidism.

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.460
We come to the middle
of the century

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.970
and it really is the
beginning of the story

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.060
of industrialization
which we convey

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:25.450
in a very beautiful multimedia,
intuitive format without words

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:28.050
but only with images
that we've animated.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.480
And the rise of modern
Hebrew and Yiddish culture

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.700
and new modern Jewish social
and political movements.

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.180
With World War I, we
have the establishment

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.210
of the Second Polish Republic.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:44.500
That is to say last year, 2018,
was the 100th anniversary.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:45.800
It's a very short period.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.610
It's just the '20's and '30's,
but it's a very vibrant period.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:51.850
It's a period of
economic hardship.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:54.160
It's a period of
rising anti-Semitism,

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.480
but it's also a period of
extraordinary political energy,

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.750
extraordinary cultural
creativity in Yiddish

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.700
and in the Polish language.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:09.560
And with a great sense of
if you will, possibility

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.200
but at the same time
uncertainty.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.980
Now I sort of want to
share one little moment

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.280
in this inter-war years gallery.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.880
We divide it up thematically
into politics, culture,

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.180
growing up and daily life.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.720
And in growing up we go all the
way from childhood in the family

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.240
to the child's autonomous world
of play, to the school system,

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.790
to adolescence and
their youth movements

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:36.440
and youth groups and clubs.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.760
But it was in the courtyard
of child's autonomous play

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:47.480
that I had the opportunity to
find a place for my father.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.550
So what happened was that
what I wanted to communicate,

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:54.850
what I wanted to communicate
was kids made their own toys

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.150
and they made them
out of nothing.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:55:02.460
They made them out of newspaper,
string, tin, rubber, branches,

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:05.160
and they threw them away because
they would just make them

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.230
and then throw them away
and make them again.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:09.860
And the idea of buying toys --

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:12.200
my father doesn't
ever remember ever

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.100
that his family ever
bought him a toy.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.870
He made all his own toys.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:22.920
And in the late-'60's, like
'68, '69, I did a survey

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.780
of Yiddish folklore in Canada
for the Canadian National Museum

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.900
for their Center
for Folk Culture.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.850
And one of the things I
did was I got my father

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:35.910
to make all the toys he could
remember from his childhood.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.860
Everything, everything.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.180
And he taught me
how to make them,

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.720
so I know how to make them too.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.730
And I documented
them all of course.

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:49.480
And I had him make a set for
the Canadian Museum in Ottawa.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.860
I had him make a set for YIVO.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:57.280
And so when it came time to
develop this area, I said,

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.730
"Look, the whole idea here
is I want the children

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:04.620
who are coming, I want
them to make these toys."

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.610
So we developed the
table that has drawers,

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:08.700
paper, string, whatever.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.550
And then I made these toys and
in the very middle is my father

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:16.110
with my favorite toy,
which is a bark --

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.970
it's actually a bark
horn, is what it's called

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:20.320
in England, in the UK.

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.730
What it is, is he
called it a "tompeita"

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:26.370
which would be a trumpet or
a "scheufer," a ram's horn.

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:29.640
And apparently the Polish
peasants used to make them,

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.040
but huge ones that when
you blew into them,

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.960
they made an enormous sound.

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.990
But as we know, a lot of those
old instruments as they devolve,

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.300
they become children's
toys essentially.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.760
So in any event, this is --

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.610
and this is a little
mouse made out of a hanky.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.760
I actually have some hankies,
I can demonstrate this later

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:50.870
if anybody's interested, how
to make a mouse out of a hanky.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:53.150
And then everyday
life across the length

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:54.480
and breadth of Poland.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:01.850
And so finally, ultimately we
come to 1939, September 1st.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:05.550
And this is one of
seven galleries

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.100
in our historical narrative,

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.710
and it is the gallery
dedicated to the Holocaust.

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:13.770
And it is here that we
really develop I think --

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:15.760
the approach that we
use is very important.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.490
And that is that it's
very important for us

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:22.780
that our visitors not
anticipate the Holocaust or look

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.730
at the 1,000-year
history of Jews

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:26.220
through the lens
of the Holocaust.

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.830
This is extremely important.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:31.120
So we did everything we could
to pull back on the kind

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.660
of ideological drive
to the Holocaust.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.730
And so when you look
down the street,

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:38.530
what you see are
people looking up.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:40.900
And the question is, what
are they looking up at?

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.760
They're looking up
at the bombing

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.710
of Warsaw during the first
week of September 1939.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:51.230
This is the American
ambassador to Poland

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:54.150
and his staff standing
outside the American embassy,

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:55.620
getting ready to evacuate.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.760
And it's only when
you turn the corner

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.010
that you actually see what
they're looking up at.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.250
And so the Holocaust
gallery is set

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:04.930
within the borders
of occupied Poland.

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.460
That means to say
within the borders

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:09.220
of what had been the
Second Polish Republic.

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.650
And in fact all the way
through the exhibition,

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:16.560
the story unfolds within the
borders of whatever is Poland

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.620
at that time, and the Holocaust
gallery is no exception.

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:24.300
Now we using our approach,
which is stay in the moment

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:28.220
of the story, don't anticipate
what's going to happen next,

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:33.650
keep the horizon forward,
if you will the distance

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:35.880
between where you are in
the moment and what's going

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.250
to happen next, keep
it very, very shallow.

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.450
And as the visitor
walks through the story,

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.660
the future is never
very far away,

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.470
but the past gets
deeper, deeper, deeper.

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:49.150
So if it works, it's a
very special experience.

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:54.150
And we were able to do that
for one very particular reason.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:56.720
So this is a map that
shows you the Warsaw Ghetto

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.440
in the city of Warsaw.

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.700
And what's important here is
that during the inter-war years,

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.440
a third of the population
of the city was Jewish.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.140
And the area that was allocated
for the ghetto represented

00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:15.090
between 2 and 3% of the
territory of the city.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:16.640
And a third of the population

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.740
in an additional 100,000 Jews
were squeezed into that area.

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.220
So you had eight to
nine people in a room.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.810
So it was a very,
very, very compressed,

00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:29.020
very, very crowded area.

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.650
And one of the most
extraordinary

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:35.120
and exceptional aspects of
the story of the Warsaw Ghetto

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:40.970
which is if you will, for us
the culmination of the process

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:43.480
of separation and isolation.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:47.580
And we take the ghetto
as a culmination

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:51.270
and we take the Warsaw
Ghetto as our pars pro toto.

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:55.890
It's that the gentleman on
the left, Emmanuel Ringeblum,

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:57.680
he was a labor Zionist.

00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.050
He was a social activist
and he was an historian.

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:06.450
And he created a team of
about between 40 and 60 people

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:11.400
who created a secret archive
of everything that was going

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.780
on in the Warsaw Ghetto.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:18.110
They collected diaries,
letters, ration cards,

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.190
candy wrappers, everything.

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:23.900
Posters, announcements, reports.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.320
They gathered everything.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.880
And the man on the right,
Chenyakow, was the head

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.180
of the Jewish Council

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.270
of the Judenraete the
Germans had established

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.190
to run the ghetto and to
carry out their orders.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:37.190
And so what we do here is
we draw from their diaries

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:40.280
and we quote from their
diaries, Ringeblum in Yiddish,

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.720
Chenyakow in Polish, always
in English translation.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.980
And they accompany our
visitors through this story

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.960
and this is always point,

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.480
counterpoint; point,
counterpoint.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.710
It's a double-voiced narrative.

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:55.380
But what's critically important
is the materials that we have

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.890
to work with, because
during the Great Deportation

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:02.250
when this team -- and
there is now a film,

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:05.560
Who Will Write Our History,
which is about this archive.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.130
During the Great Deportation,

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:11.190
when they realized they wouldn't
survive, they packed the archive

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.950
up into those tin boxes
and they buried them.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.930
And then a few weeks before the
Warsaw Ghetto Uprising a year

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.660
later, when they realized
it was absolutely the end,

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.870
those that were still in the
ghetto packed up the rest

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:25.870
of the archive and
put it into milk cans.

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:27.660
And so there was a second cache.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:32.200
And it was extraordinary
that very shortly

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.960
after the war ended, three of
the team that survived went

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.260
out into the rebel
of the ghetto.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.770
And you can imagine
there are no streets.

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:41.080
How do you find anything?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.450
And they located the first
cache which were the tin boxes.

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:46.920
And they dug them up.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.930
But the second cache
was found in the 1950's

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.050
when they were digging
foundations

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:56.540
and the earth-moving equipment
revealed these milk cans.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.560
And at first some
of the workers,

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.440
they thought the milk cans
were of value and they wanted

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.180
to throw out what was inside.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.460
And apparently the foreman on
the crew said, "No, no, no.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.760
This looks like Jewish stuff.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.110
We should give it to the
Jewish Historical Institute."

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:11.410
And they did.

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:14.220
And it's said that
there's a third cache

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.520
but we've never found it.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.790
And it was thought that it
was under the Chinese embassy

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:23.030
in Warsaw, but we can
start to speculate there.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.400
And they actually let
us do some excavating.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.900
It was never possible
to find it.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.120
And there's even the thought
that maybe there wasn't.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.000
So we look at Polish-Jewish
relations during this period,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.070
again a spectrum of relations.

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:39.820
And then there were those who
said we should end the story

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.660
with the Holocaust gallery
and we said absolutely not.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.660
That there's a very important
post-war story to tell,

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.600
and we begin it with
survivors coming back.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.220
So before the war there were
about 3.3 million Jews living

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:56.130
in Poland and 90% of them were
murdered and most of those

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.660
who survived survived
in the Soviet Union.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.220
They were "saved
by deportation."

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.730
And about 250,000 Jews
ended up back in Poland,

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.300
most of them coming back
from the Soviet Union.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.560
About 25,000 came out
of concentration camps.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.700
About 25,000 survived in
hiding out of 3.3 million.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.570
And the rest were
from the Soviet Union

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:21.350
and some state of
the Soviet Union.

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:23.630
And the big question they
asked themselves was whether

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.480
to stay or to leave.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.960
And along one wall we
tell the story of staying

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.250
and on the other wall
the story of leaving.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.390
And of course being a
site-specific museum,

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:34.850
we present the history
of the creating

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.430
of the Monument to
the Ghetto Heroes.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:40.810
We also present the
immediate post-war violence,

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:44.610
the [foreign word] which some
of you may be familiar with it.

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:47.160
It was followed by
emigration panic and more

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.380
than half the survivors living
in Poland at the time left.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.310
We also present the
story of those who stayed

01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.170
and what life was
like under communism,

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:59.120
first under Stalinism
then under communism.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.840
Everyday life, ordinary
life, ordinary people.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.160
And we come to the
if you will last wave

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.350
of immigration, March 1968.

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:10.650
This year -- last year, rather.

01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:15.650
It's only 19 days since last
year, so I'm still in 2018.

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:17.240
But it's the 50th anniversary

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.740
of the government-sponsored
anti-Semitic campaign,

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.280
anti-Zionist, ostensibly
anti-Semitic campaign

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.900
of March '68.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.330
And by that time, of the
approximately 250,000 Jews

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:31.590
who had been in Poland
right after the war,

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:33.360
there were now maybe 20,000

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.350
because of these
waves of immigration.

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:39.190
And more than half of them left
as a result of this campaign.

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:40.490
But we don't end there.

01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:42.040
We don't end there either.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.030
In fact, we come out into
the space of the building

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:49.330
and the renewal of Jewish life
after the fall of communism

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:52.260
and that would be in 1989.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.500
And it's the first time that
we use video interviews.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.400
There are no survivor interviews
in the Holocaust gallery.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.580
There's no post-war material
in the Holocaust gallery.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:04.790
And the first time you get
video interviews is from now,

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:07.960
because they were about
now and they were made now.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.930
And the beauty of these
interviews are the questions

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:13.120
that we asked about 20 Jews
living in Poland today.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.790
We asked them, is there a
future for Jews in Poland?

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:17.800
Is there anti-Semitism
in Poland?

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.210
Who can make Jewish Culture?

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:20.560
Is religion important to you?

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.880
Is Israel important to you?

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.960
But the single most surprising
question from my point of view,

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.570
not for my team, but I found
unbelievably surprising

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:32.750
because I would never, ever,
ever have thought to ask

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.930
such a question in the
United States or Canada.

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:39.620
And that question was, did you
always know you were Jewish?

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:44.650
And it just never occurred
to me, having grown

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:49.030
up in an intact Jewish
family and Jewish community.

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:50.580
It just never occurred to me.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.350
And when people ask, "How many
Jews are there in Poland today?"

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.470
the best answer is
from the chief rabbi

01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.270
in Poland, Rabbi Schudrich.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:01.960
He says, "Look, we don't know
exactly how many Jews there are.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.990
All we know is that the
number keeps increasing

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.130
without the birth
rate going up."

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.240
[ Laughter ]

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.970
Which gives you a
little bit of a sense.

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:18.500
So I like to think of the museum
as in a sense contributing

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.510
to the renewal of Jewish
life by demonstrating

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:26.030
that the reasons why parents,
whether they were birth parents

01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:30.140
or adopted parents, kept that
knowledge from their children,

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:31.720
the reasons were fear and shame.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.390
And I like to think that the
museum is a way of dispelling

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:36.960
that fear and that shame

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.570
and that the museum provides
a very rich reservoir

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:45.190
of possibilities for
what it might mean

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:48.480
to be a young Jewish
person in Poland today.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.950
But it's not the absolute
end, because we want to create

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.740
in our circulation
space in the middle

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.500
of the exhibition
an area dedicated

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.450
to Jews who left Poland.

01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:02.260
And a way for me to
convey to you what

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.670
that means is there were
these hometown societies

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:06.970
that immigrants formed,

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:09.820
and my father's hometown
society -- it had branches.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:14.070
His is from the Opatu,
or Upt in Yiddish.

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.660
And the Upters had a branch
in New York and a branch

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.210
in Tel Aviv and a
branch in Latin America

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:22.000
and a branch in Toronto.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.640
And my father when he
was already in his 90's,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.390
he said basically they
gave interest-free loans,

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:32.790
they sold cemetery plots, they
could all be buried together.

01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:35.480
My father said, "If nine
of us left, it's over."

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.000
But sure enough, somebody from
the younger generation decided

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.440
to revive this society,

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.340
this hometown society,
this Manslenschaft.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.810
And of course I joined.

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:46.240
And I get a message and it says,

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.110
"On this Sunday we want
everybody from Opatu,

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.620
everybody from Upt
to get together

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.100
for a group photograph."

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.160
90 people turned up
including infants.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.090
And I thought that was
absolutely exceptional

01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:04.520
that the fifth generation
should still care and identify

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.060
with the place from which
their parents, grandparents,

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.650
great-grandparents came.

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:13.800
And so we want to really
capture the, if you will,

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.100
the legacy of Polish Jews and
the life that Jews created

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.320
when they actually left Poland.

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.790
And so what I'm hoping
is that you'll come.

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:26.810
That you'll come to Poland and
you'll come to POLIN Museum.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.770
Because we would
love to welcome you.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.510
Thank you.

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:40.130
[ Applause ]

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:42.110
So I know that some
people have to leave.

01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:45.310
It's a lunchtime thing, so
please feel free to do so.

01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:47.570
And those who would like
to stay for a couple

01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:49.610
of questions, with pleasure.

01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:50.910
Yeah.

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:53.210
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hang on just one second.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.300
&gt;&gt; So the part of
what was then Poland

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:04.130
which is now western
Ukraine was eastern Galicia.

01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:09.280
A lot of people were
killed during the Holocaust

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.060
in the small towns that were
run together for various ways.

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:19.860
Does the museum go into
any of that experience?

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.160
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.400
I would say that you know, I
think there's actually a bias

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.520
in the scholarship that
is being rectified.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.420
Because the scholarship
and the public perception

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.140
of the Holocaust is
largely a story of what went

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.980
on in the general vergamon,
meaning in the death camps.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:42.280
And that the story of the
area that was first occupied

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.870
by the Soviets and then
occupied by the Germans

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:48.780
when they pushed the Soviets
out, which is the story

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.870
of the Einsatzgruppen
and the death squads

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:52.940
and of the mass killings
in pits,

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:56.590
not in death camps,
not with gas.

01:09:56.590 --> 01:10:01.100
It was direct murder,
literally, through shooting.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.070
That is the story that's
now really being told.

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:08.430
It's a very, very important
area because it's also very,

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:12.100
very important in terms of
Polish violence against Jews.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.420
Because it's in those
circumstances when Jews are not

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.000
in ghettos and not in
death camps but are somehow

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.620
in this much more I would say
loosely controlled situation

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.760
that you get some of the really
worst violence of neighbors.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.330
So we actually don't -- I'll
tell you, we do, actually.

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:34.830
So what we do is this.

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:38.030
We have a section
that basically deals

01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:40.090
with the Barbarossa
campaign which is that.

01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:42.890
The Barbarossa campaign
is the German invasion

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:45.050
and the pushing out
of the Soviets.

01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:48.500
And what we do is the
way that we handle it is

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.060
by presenting [foreign phrase].

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:56.600
And a map that shows
many, many other pogroms

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.460
in this period in
the summer of '41.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.910
And then what we do is
we do a parse pro toto

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:04.610
and we present in detail Ponara.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:11.530
And it stands in for that
period of basically mass murder,

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:15.440
but with its very specific
character in that region.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.820
So we do, yeah.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.620
The answer is yes.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:24.570
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.200
Exactly. Exactly, exactly.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.500
Yes?

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:32.930
&gt;&gt; Hi. This is more of a comment
than a question because I wanted

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:36.240
to say I've been
to POLIN Museum.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.950
And I am absolutely your target
audience and I congratulate you.

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:43.110
I think you've succeeded
so perfectly.

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:44.780
I also have a little
anecdote to go with this.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:48.030
But as someone who
is an American Jew,

01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:50.420
second generation
four parents born

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.650
from what was formerly the
commonwealth of Poland.

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:56.150
Two of them from what
is still Poland and one

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.740
who lost all her family
in a Warsaw suburb.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:01.970
We don't even know if they
made it to the ghetto.

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:04.340
And had a cousin who
survived Auschwitz.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:07.730
No one from my family
ever went back to Poland.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:11.840
In my 50's I had the opportunity
to go to a conference in Krakow.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.760
Then I decided it
was time to do this

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.320
and that I would go
to Warsaw as well.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.360
Fortunately, I have a
master's degree in folklore

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.660
and a PhD in American studies.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.880
I work here at the library
and I had the opportunity

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.500
to hear Dr.
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett talk

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.750
about her exhibit
before it opened.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.600
So I knew I was going
to the POLIN Museum.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.260
What I did not know is I was
going there every day I was

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:33.560
in Warsaw.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.110
[ Laughter ]

01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:37.870
Back and back, and I still
was not able to absorb it all.

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:40.210
And for me personally,
this was part

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:43.220
of a really life-changing
experience which was

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.480
to understand that I am Polish.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.340
My family thought Poland was the
place where they killed people

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.840
and that's how I was brought up.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.060
And it really had a
tremendous impact on me.

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.590
I went in 2016.

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:56.890
So I want to thank you for that.

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:59.510
And then my anecdote is
strangely I happened to end

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:04.580
up in Warsaw in the same time
period that NATO was there.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.920
Unbeknownst to me I came
from Washington DC along

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.890
with Barak Obama,
and as a result,

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:11.440
lots of street closures,
other things.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.110
But strangely, on
the third day I was

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:15.660
at the museum towards
the end of the day,

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:19.910
I saw Dr. Kirshenblatt-Gimblett
in the museum, in the hallway.

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:22.220
And I recognized her
immediately, told my spouse,

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.060
"Oh my God, that's BKG.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.680
She designed the exhibit."

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.910
And she was walking
out with a group

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:29.210
of what must have
been dignitaries,

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.510
and then she came
back in by herself.

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:31.810
I don't know if you'll
remember this,

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.110
because so many people
talk to you.

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:35.380
But I walked up to her
and said, "Hi, excuse me,

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.400
but I'm a folklorist and I need
to tell you I recognized you.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.700
This is fabulous."

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.210
You listened to me very
politely for a few minutes,

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:44.530
thanked me for the
praise I heaped upon you

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.150
and then you politely
excused yourself.

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:50.490
Ten minutes later, I
discovered her giving a tour

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:52.860
to Justin Trudeau
in the exhibit.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.860
And I have on my phone
here pictures of her

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.510
and Justin Trudeau in
the Gwodziec synagogue.

01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:02.630
And so I thought you
would all appreciate that.

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:06.100
So she is very important
in Poland as well.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.400
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.900
Oh my God.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.090
[ Applause ]

01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:12.390
That's phenomenal.

01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:13.690
Thank you so, so much.

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:15.670
Thank you.

01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.820
&gt;&gt; So I'll follow Susan

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:21.530
with a small anecdote
and then a question.

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:25.820
The anecdote is that my father's
father was from Bialystok,

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.600
and I'm not in one
of those families

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.900
where nobody ever went back,
because my father did go back

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:36.390
to Poland and was knocked
out just by being there.

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:37.790
And I can only imagine

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:41.380
if he were alive today what he
would feel seeing this museum.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.200
It just looks incredible

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.490
and I think he would
be knocked over by it.

01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:48.190
And the question
is, I wonder if --

01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:50.590
and this is a very specific
question so forgive me.

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:56.720
But I wonder if in the Holocaust
gallery there's any reference

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.510
to the human starvation study
that was done in the hospital.

01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:01.810
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett: Yes.

01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:03.110
Yes, there's a whole
section, actually.

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:06.060
One section of the Warsaw Ghetto
presentation is specifically

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.360
on hunger disease.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.960
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.260
Actually it's a section
on how doctors try to cope

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.560
with impossible conditions.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.070
And there are three
aspects of it.

01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:19.410
Well, one is typhus and
the other is starvation.

01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:20.710
And that hunger study,

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:23.450
which incidentally
is full-text online.

01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:26.110
It's in Polish, but the
full text is online.

01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:28.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my father edited
the English translation

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:30.400
of it called Hunger Disease.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.790
His name is Myron Winnick and
he was the editor of that.

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.090
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:36.390
Oh yes, I know.

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.730
Yes. Yes. It's really incredible
because it's sort of in the face

01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:41.170
of when you can't do anything
about it, you study it.

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:42.480
&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.770
And the story is
amazing as well.

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:48.180
I don't know if you know the
story of the stamp collection.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:52.150
But there was a gestapo guy who
was a stamp collector and one

01:15:52.150 --> 01:15:54.090
of the doctors was
a stamp collector.

01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:56.900
And that was the way they
got some of the equipment was

01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:03.080
that the gestapo guy wanted
stamps from the Jewish doctor

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.730
and was willing to help him
out with certain equipment

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.030
that they didn't have.

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.330
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett: Amazing.

01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:10.630
&gt;&gt; So I'll be in touch
with you about it later.

01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:11.930
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:13.230
We'll be in touch, great.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:14.530
Thank you.

01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:16.320
&gt;&gt; This was just incredible.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:22.050
My connection to my Polish
Jewish ancestors is completely

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:26.960
lost, but my partner has
maintained this tremendous

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.100
connection through
the village of Sucaty.

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.050
And she at this very
moment is out in Memphis

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:38.060
with her cousin putting together
a book about the memories

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.510
of their family from Sucaty
and how they came to the US,

01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:46.470
which fortunately was in
the '20's for many of them.

01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:53.430
And there's a rededication of
the Jewish cemetery planned

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:58.140
for the spring and now I know
we can go and spend a week

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.660
or two at the Poland museum.

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:01.960
So thank you.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.260
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.560
Oh, my pleasure.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.860
You know, just a comment,
and that is I think

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:11.720
that the POLIN museum, like the
wonderful new National Museum

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.820
of African American history and
culture is a new kind of museum

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.820
in the sense that
these are museums

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:22.890
where visitors spend a lot
of time, if they expect to.

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:25.150
I mean, I think one of the
issues is expectations.

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:27.770
Because often visitors
expect in any museum

01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:30.610
that two hours is more than
enough, maybe only an hour.

01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:31.910
And then they discover

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:34.390
that they're there three
hours already, four hours,

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:35.740
and they're not finished.

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:40.030
So what's happening is that
what they call dwell time,

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.670
or the length of the visit.

01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:44.310
It's a very, very
different situation.

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:45.610
It's different than going

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:48.570
to see a temporary
exhibition, an art exhibition.

01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:52.110
People are spending like
the whole day, several days.

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:54.180
They're coming back
over and over again.

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:56.530
It's really something different

01:17:56.530 --> 01:18:00.790
from I think what
we've seen before.

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:04.180
I think of it also for the
Holocaust Museum as well.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.150
And even though we do
offer a two-hour tour,

01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:09.460
everybody says it's frustrating,
that they didn't feel

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.760
that they could see everything.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.980
Of course you can't
"see" everything anyway.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.580
You've got to make choices.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:19.330
But the idea that -- I was just
checking Trip Advisor the other

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:21.240
day and there are
all these people

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.870
on Trip Advisor advising each
other, "Oh, allow a whole day,

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:26.380
not less than three hours.

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.890
Four hours is the minimum."

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:30.910
And they're actually
telling each other

01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:34.110
that this is not
a two-hour visit.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:37.660
So I do appreciate that.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:40.110
I mean, we had one guy
who came for a whole week

01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.280
and he spent one
day in each gallery.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.580
That's very dedicated.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.410
I'm not suggesting
that everybody do that.

01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:52.000
But definitely -- and also
there's a very rich cultural

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.210
and educational and
public programs

01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:55.540
and temporary exhibitions.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.710
And it's an educational
and cultural center

01:18:57.710 --> 01:19:00.360
so it's doing all
kinds of other things.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.500
I mean, I worked on the
permanent exhibition which is

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.660
so defining of the museum.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.920
But the museum is
much more than that.

01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:12.510
Is there a question here?

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:22.290
[ Inaudible ]

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.910
&gt;&gt; Just to continue that,
I want to thank you.

01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:31.230
It's been such a revelation
to me in many ways,

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:36.960
but one of them is how
you've changed the face

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.520
of modern museums.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.280
I was a Smithsonian
fellow last year.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.140
That's exactly what
they're trying to do,

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.240
is become more relevant.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.130
And I teach ESL students
and I ask them,

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:55.420
"Have any of you ever
been to a museum?"

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.150
No. They have to
go on a field trip.

01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:00.230
It's obligatory in my class.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:03.330
I can't tell you how I
have to drag them there.

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:04.770
And afterwards they write to me
about how they've been living

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:06.300
in America for six years and
they learned more in one day

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.600
than they did, et cetera.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.900
So you are really in the
forefront, the cutting edge

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.200
of the idea of museum and the
visitor which is a question

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.500
of finding identity more
than learning and knowledge

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.800
and interactive games
and playing.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.100
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett:

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.400
But you know what's interesting,

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.700
museum-going isn't
something to assume.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.000
As a child, my parents
never took me to a museum.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.300
It was only as a school group.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.600
But my parents never --

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.900
I went by myself because of
my strange Orthodox moment.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.200
[ Laughter ]

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.500
I know that's a crazy way to
actually come to love museums,

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.800
but that's how it happened.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.100
But my parents never took me.

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:30.770
Now later of course they
would read and they would go.

01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:33.130
But not during my childhood.

01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:37.260
And I have a feeling
that that's true for --

01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.310
there's whole sections
of society

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:40.920
where they're not
comfortable in museums.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.790
They don't think that
museums are for them.

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:45.580
And I think that museums
are making a huge effort

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:48.710
to somehow reach out and
become more accessible

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:50.390
and more welcoming.

01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:52.370
And I think it's a
huge opportunity.

01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:53.670
So it's great that
you take them.

01:20:53.670 --> 01:21:06.150
&gt;&gt; Also I have tapped into
the idea of narrative.

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:11.440
I'm writing my doctorate
on Holocaust memoir

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.740
and transgenerational trauma.

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.040
And I got kicked out of
the composition department.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.340
I had to do it as literature.

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:16.640
&gt;&gt; Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett: Oh.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.940
&gt;&gt; Because it's neither
history -- it's kind of fiction,

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.240
you know, but it isn't at all.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.540

between two schools.
