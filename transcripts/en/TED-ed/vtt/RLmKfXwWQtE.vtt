00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:10.536
Russia, with the largest territory in the world,

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:13.751
has roughly the same total population as Nigeria,

00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:16.255
a country 1/16 its size.

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:18.369
But this similarity won't last long.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.009
One of the populations is rapidly growing,

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.427
while the other is slowly declining.

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:25.616
What can this tell us about the two countries?

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:29.641
Population statistics are some of the most important data

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:33.367
social scientists and policy experts have to work with.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.201
But understanding a country's situation

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.066
and making accurate predictions

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.283
requires knowing not just the total size of the population

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:42.403
but its internal characteristics,

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:45.240
such as age and gender distribution.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.044
So, how can we keep track of all that data

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:49.867
in a way that makes it easy to comprehend?

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:51.996
Complex data is more easily interpreted

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:53.499
through visualization,

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.375
and one of the ways that demographers represent

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:57.919
the internal distribution of a population

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:00.178
is the population pyramid.

00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:02.451
Here, the data is divided by gender

00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.510
with females on one side and males on the other.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.055
The population numbers are shown

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.116
for each five-year age interval,

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:10.974
starting from 0-4

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:12.977
and continuing up to 100 and up.

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:14.813
These intervals are grouped together

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:17.570
into pre-reproductive (0-14),

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.151
reproductive (15-44),

00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:23.369
and post-reproductive years (45 and up).

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.126
Such a population pyramid can be a powerful predictor

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:28.117
of future population trends.

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:29.576
For example,

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:33.079
Rwanda's population pyramid shows it to be a fast-growing country,

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.670
with most of the population

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.450
being in the youngest age groups at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.704
The number will grow rapidly in the coming years.

00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:42.537
As today's children reach their reproductive years

00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:44.117
and have children of their own,

00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:47.010
the total population is almost certain to double

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.617
within the next few decades.

00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:50.366
For our second example,

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:51.866
let's look at Canada,

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.642
where most of the population is clustered

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:55.394
around the middle of the graph.

00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:56.811
Because there are less people

00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:58.688
in the pre-reproductive age groups

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:00.566
than there are in the reproductive ones,

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:03.238
the population will grow more slowly,

00:02:03.238 --> 00:02:06.532
as the number of people reaching their reproductive years decreases.

00:02:06.532 --> 00:02:09.161
Finally, let's look at Japan.

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.158
Because the majority of its population

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:13.162
is in its post-reproductive years

00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:15.368
and the number of people is smaller

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.873
at each younger interval,

00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:18.869
this means that at current rates of reproduction

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.782
the population will begin to decline

00:02:20.782 --> 00:02:24.590
as fewer and fewer people reach reproductive age.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.451
Comparing these three population pyramids

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:27.635
side by side

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.220
shows us three different stages

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.700
in a demographic transition,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.265
as a country moves from a pre-industrial society

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:34.700
to one with an industrial

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.769
or post-industrial economy.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.367
Countries that have only recently begun

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.147
the process of industrialization

00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:42.900
typically see an increase in life expectancy

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.074
and a fall in child mortality rates

00:02:45.074 --> 00:02:46.654
as a result of improvements

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:49.657
in medicine, sanitation, and food supply.

00:02:49.657 --> 00:02:51.575
While birth rates remain constant,

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:53.492
leading to a population boom.

00:02:53.492 --> 00:02:55.370
Developing countries that are farther along

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.202
in the industrialization process

00:02:57.202 --> 00:02:59.370
begin to see a fall in birth rates,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.669
due to factors such as

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.449
increased education and opportunities for women outside of child-rearing

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.451
and a move from rural to urban living

00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:09.134
that makes having large families

00:03:09.134 --> 00:03:11.533
less economically advantageous.

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:14.682
Finally, countries in advanced stages of industrialization

00:03:14.682 --> 00:03:15.723
reach a point

00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:18.451
where both birth and death rates are low,

00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:20.229
and the population remains stable

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.980
or even begins to decline.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.650
Now, let's take a look at the projected population pyramids

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.873
for the same three countries in 2050.

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:29.072
What do these tell us

00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:30.616
about the expected changes

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:32.371
in each country's population,

00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:33.785
and what kinds of factors

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:36.579
can alter the shape of these future pyramids?

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.507
A population pyramid can be useful

00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:40.749
not only as a predictor of a country's future

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.951
but as a record of its past.

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.702
Russia's population pyramid

00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:47.449
still bears the scars of World War II,

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.343
which explains both the fewer numbers of elderly men

00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:52.093
compared to elderly women

00:03:52.093 --> 00:03:54.138
and the relatively sudden population increase

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:56.181
as soldiers returned from the war

00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:58.142
and normal life resumed.

00:03:58.142 --> 00:03:59.783
China's population pyramid

00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:02.784
reflects the establishment of the one child policy

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.398
35 years before,

00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:06.284
which prevented a population boom

00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:07.984
such as that of Rwanda

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:10.073
but also led to sex-selective abortions,

00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:13.955
resulting in more male children than female children.

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:16.241
Finally, the pyramid for the United States

00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.435
shows the baby boom that followed World War II.

00:04:19.435 --> 00:04:20.704
As you can see,

00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:22.785
population pyramids tell us far more

00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:23.919
about a country

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.335
than just a set of numbers,

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:26.951
by showing both where it's been

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:28.255
and where it's headed

00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:29.673
within a single image.

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:31.951
And in today's increasingly interconnected world,

00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:33.970
facing issues such as food shortages,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.972
ecological threats, and economic disparities,

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:38.475
it is increasingly important

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:40.702
for both scientists and policy makers

00:04:40.702 --> 00:04:43.145
to have a rich and complex understanding

00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:46.903
of populations and the factors affecting them.
