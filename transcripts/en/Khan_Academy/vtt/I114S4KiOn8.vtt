00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:02.073
- [Salman] I am now
going to give an overview

00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:03.157
of ancient Greece.

00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:05.678
In future videos we're gonna
go into a lot more depth

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:07.339
on a lot of these events and ideas.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.191
But this one is to give you
context on the big picture.

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:14.358
And just to start, let's
begin with the name Greece.

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:17.785
It turns out that the Greeks do not call

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:21.361
where they live, Greece,
neither did the ancient Greeks.

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.194
They called it Hellas.

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:25.351
Hellas, Hellas.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.186
And the word Hellas comes from Hellen,

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:33.449
so this comes from Hellen,

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.891
which is this legendary
figure who is viewed

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:38.924
as a progenitor of the Greek people.

00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:39.831
You could kind of view him

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.743
as the father of the Greek people.

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:45.166
And it's not well established
in the historical record

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.364
when Hellen actually existed,

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.886
but this is where we get
the name Hellas from.

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:52.764
And it's very important.

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:56.781
Do not confuse this Hellen, who was a man,

00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:59.146
with Helen of Troy.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.973
Helen of Troy was a different person.

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:04.146
When I was a child and I
heard about Hellenic things

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:06.946
or the Hellenic period, or the Hellenes,

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:07.779
I was like, oh,

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:10.385
maybe that's something
to do with Helen of Troy.

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:11.218
No.

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:15.070
That's referring to the
Greek progenitor Hellen.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.427
And so that's where the
word Hellas comes from,

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:22.436
and ideas like Hellenes,
which is the Greek people.

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:25.547
Or Hellenic, which is referring
to something that is Greek,

00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:27.116
or the Hellenistic Period,

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:29.499
which we'll talk about
many videos from now,

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.264
which is this period of Greek influence.

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:35.053
Not just over Greece and
the Anatolian Peninsula,

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:37.636
but over Persia and over Egypt.

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:39.998
So with that out of the way,

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:44.010
let's now talk about
the big arc of history

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.706
of ancient Greece.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:49.074
And it's believed that the Greek Peninsula

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:52.366
has been settled by human beings

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.474
for thousands and thousands of years.

00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:56.047
And as time goes on we'll
hopefully understand

00:01:56.047 --> 00:01:57.761
more and more about them.

00:01:57.761 --> 00:01:59.372
But my timeline right over here

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:01.460
starts with Mycenaean Greece,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.862
or it starts with the
end of Mycenaean Greece.

00:02:04.862 --> 00:02:06.275
In other videos we might talk more

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:09.023
about the Mycenaean Empire.

00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:10.851
And as that empire falls,

00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.274
we enter into the Greek Dark Ages.

00:02:13.274 --> 00:02:15.122
And the reason why it's
called the Dark Ages,

00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:18.114
is there's not a lot of
historical record of this period

00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:21.031
roughly between 1100BCE and 800BCE.

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:24.402
Now there's one event,

00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:26.944
and I'll kind of say that
with a slight emphasis

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:29.810
or a question that is worth noting here.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.727
I have Trojan War question
mark around 1200BCE.

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.555
Once again, there's not
a strong historic record

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:42.697
for the Trojan War,
but it is a famous war,

00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:45.394
that was chronicled by Homer.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.484
And even Homer, we don't
know if he really existed,

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:49.972
or whether he was an
entire literary tradition.

00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:51.622
But it was chronicled in the Iliad

00:02:51.622 --> 00:02:53.682
in the aftermath in the Odyssey.

00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:54.515
And once again,

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.806
this was chronicled many
hundreds of years later,

00:02:56.806 --> 00:03:00.306
and even Homer is a semi-legendary figure.

00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:03.321
But when people talk about the Trojan Wars

00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:04.695
or you see movies about it,

00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:06.202
we're talking about something that,

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:08.361
if it happened the way it happened,

00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:10.778
it's on the order of 1200BCE.

00:03:13.597 --> 00:03:16.215
Now as we exit the Greek Dark Ages,

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:19.384
that's when we start to have
some of the institutions

00:03:19.384 --> 00:03:22.886
that really, that we now
identify with the ancient Greeks,

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:24.286
get established.

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:26.616
You have the Oracle at Delphi.

00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:29.972
The Oracle of Delphi, or Pythia,

00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:31.743
often known as the Oracle of Delphi.

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:34.441
This is where leaders
of the Greek city-states

00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:38.886
went for direction to understand
what was likely to happen,

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:40.356
to get prophecies.

00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:43.213
And this institution,
the Oracle at Delphi,

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:47.469
lasts through this entire
period I have on my timeline,

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.552
into Roman rule, for over 1000 years,

00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:56.828
where the Oracle at Delphi is
a very, very prominent figure

00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:59.905
in influencing Greek leaders.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:03.550
At around the same time, you
also have the Olympic Games,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.479
where they're held at Olympia,

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.685
where people compete to
show their athletic prowess.

00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:12.187
And this ancient Olympic Games once again,

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:15.187
it continues on for over 1000 years.

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:20.103
Our modern Olympics are just
kind of a flash in the pan,

00:04:20.103 --> 00:04:24.338
and it was obviously modeled
after the ancient Olympics,

00:04:24.338 --> 00:04:27.541
compared to how long this lasted.

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:30.624
Now when most people think of Greece,

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:35.049
they're actually talking
about classical Greece.

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.514
So this is the Classical
Period right over here.

00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:39.821
And we're gonna do videos
on a lot of these events,

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:44.239
but it's roughly the period
between the Persian invasions

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:46.614
that were successfully put off,

00:04:46.614 --> 00:04:50.903
and the rise of Alexander
and the fall of Alexander.

00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:54.001
And that's where you
have all of these ideas

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:58.168
of Greek democracy really
kind of coming to the surface.

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:04.197
Pericles, the Strategos of Athens,

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:07.847
who had the influence to
really help democracy flourish.

00:05:07.847 --> 00:05:10.778
Under his leadership, or
during his leadership,

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:13.395
you have the Acropolis and the Parthenon,

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:17.958
these famous icons of Greek
culture being established.

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.075
But once again, this is in this period.

00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:23.095
That's in this period right over here.

00:05:23.095 --> 00:05:25.190
This is also the period that we associate

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.085
with the famous Greek philosophers.

00:05:27.085 --> 00:05:28.159
These lines right over here

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.094
are the lives of Socrates and Plato,

00:05:31.094 --> 00:05:33.616
who is Socrates' student,

00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:35.158
established the famous academy.

00:05:35.158 --> 00:05:37.275
Aristotle who was Plato's student

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:40.608
and famous tutor of Alexander the Great.

00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:44.122
Now as I mentioned, you
had these city-states,

00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:46.473
and the ones that are worth mentioning,

00:05:46.473 --> 00:05:48.296
all of them are worth mentioning.

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.939
But I have in this diagram,

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.252
the most significant
city-states of ancient Greece

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:53.356
that you'll hear a lot about.

00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:55.051
We talked about the Oracle at Delphi,

00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:56.868
the Olympic Games at Olympia.

00:05:56.868 --> 00:05:59.471
A lot of the conversation
tends to focus around Sparta

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:00.971
and around Athens.

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:06.818
And then you'll also hear a
lot about Corinth and Thebes.

00:06:06.818 --> 00:06:10.651
Sparta is famous for its
militaristic society.

00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:13.001
It's often glorified.

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:15.129
But it's also worth noting that they were

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.516
significant slave owners.

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:19.268
At different parts in Spartan history,

00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:22.659
they had somewhere between
seven and 20 slaves

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.884
for every Spartan.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.614
Athens is famous for its philosophy.

00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:31.824
It's famous for the
birthplace of democracy.

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:34.001
It's famous for its art, it's
famous for its architecture,

00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:36.481
all of these areas are
famous for its architecture.

00:06:36.481 --> 00:06:40.112
But it's also worth noting
that during the Golden Age,

00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:42.127
and you have the Athenian Empire,

00:06:42.127 --> 00:06:45.097
they were also pretty brutal
in putting down rebellion

00:06:45.097 --> 00:06:48.074
and in some ways subjugating
different people.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.935
So it depends how you want to view things.

00:06:50.935 --> 00:06:52.480
And we're gonna have a lot of videos

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.660
on all of these things.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.032
But at that time, we talk
about these city-states,

00:06:57.032 --> 00:06:59.452
even though they shared a common language

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:00.319
and common culture,

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.945
they sent folks to the Olympic games,

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:05.891
they went to the Oracle of Delphi,

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:08.296
they were independent states.

00:07:08.296 --> 00:07:11.591
And it wasn't until you
have Philip of Macedonia

00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:15.302
in the fourth century right over here,

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:19.061
where he starts to really
unify these Greek city-states,

00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:22.144
and it culminates with his
son, Alexander the Great.

00:07:22.144 --> 00:07:25.288
And Alexander the Great
not only unifies Greece,

00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:27.690
but he takes over the Persian Empire,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.057
and really kind of with his death,

00:07:30.057 --> 00:07:31.492
and he has a very short life,

00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:33.696
he ushers in the Hellenistic period,

00:07:33.696 --> 00:07:36.258
where you have Greek culture influencing

00:07:36.258 --> 00:07:37.718
that entire region.

00:07:37.718 --> 00:07:41.740
Not only Greece, not only
what was the Persian Empire,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.313
the Middle East, Egypt,

00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:47.802
that whole region gets
influenced by Greek culture.

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:50.958
And Greece, I guess you
could say, at the end,

00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.230
finally gets under Roman control,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.484
and it depends which
date you wanna use it.

00:07:55.484 --> 00:07:58.415
In the middle of the second century BCE

00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:01.273
is when Greece itself falls to Rome,

00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:04.242
but then other parts of,
I guess you could say,

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:07.907
the Hellenistic world,
finally succumb to Rome.

00:08:07.907 --> 00:08:12.189
For example, Ptolemaic Egypt
in the first century BCE.

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:13.290
But even then,

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.692
even when it becomes
part of the Roman Empire,

00:08:15.692 --> 00:08:19.859
it influences the Roman Empire
very, very, very heavily.

00:08:20.874 --> 00:08:23.415
Now other things that you
will hear us talk about

00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:24.664
when we discuss the Greeks,

00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:28.130
besides the democracy and the philosophy,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.353
we're gonna talk a lot about wars.

00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:35.323
And it's worth noting what
Greek warriors looked like.

00:08:35.323 --> 00:08:37.715
So this is a depiction of Hoplites,

00:08:37.715 --> 00:08:41.752
which are Greek citizen
soldiers in ancient Greece.

00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:44.211
And you'll also here about a phalanx.

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.197
A phalanx is a formation where they walked

00:08:46.197 --> 00:08:48.753
or they marched very tightly together.

00:08:48.753 --> 00:08:51.423
And when archers came they
would put all their shields up,

00:08:51.423 --> 00:08:53.933
and they'd almost be
like this armored tank.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:58.227
And it was a very effective
method of warfare.

00:08:58.227 --> 00:09:00.178
Another word that you will hear associated

00:09:00.178 --> 00:09:02.637
with Sparta and those slaves is Helots.

00:09:02.637 --> 00:09:04.341
Those were the names of those slaves.

00:09:04.341 --> 00:09:06.162
They weren't owned by individuals,

00:09:06.162 --> 00:09:09.155
they were actually owned by the state.

00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:11.020
Now some of the other cities here,

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.031
Corinth, will come up a lot.

00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:15.058
It has a very strategic location

00:09:15.058 --> 00:09:16.601
in the Isthmus of Corinth.

00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:18.767
Notice to get from the mainland,

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:22.733
or I guess into the
Peloponnesian Peninsula,

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:25.170
you have to go through this Isthmus.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.083
Thebes right here was a
significant rival to Athens

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:31.585
at different periods of Greek history.

00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:34.459
It was the dominant city.

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:35.442
Now the last thing I wanna mention

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:38.757
is there is a ton of culture
that comes from the Greeks,

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:41.654
and a lot of words that we even use today.

00:09:41.654 --> 00:09:43.182
For example, the word draconian,

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:46.202
which is used for something
that's very harsh.

00:09:46.202 --> 00:09:48.052
Well that comes from Draco's law,

00:09:48.052 --> 00:09:52.796
which came in the seventh
century BCE from Athens.

00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:55.213
He was an Athenian legislator

00:09:56.134 --> 00:09:59.013
who composed a very harsh series of laws.

00:09:59.013 --> 00:10:01.139
That's where the word
draconian comes from.

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:02.751
When people say something is spartan,

00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:05.683
they kind of imagine it's
something that's very basic

00:10:05.683 --> 00:10:07.920
or you just have the necessities.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.193
And it comes from the
idea of Spartan culture

00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:13.317
that they really,

00:10:13.317 --> 00:10:16.684
everything revolved
around military necessity.

00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:18.611
Even the word laconic,

00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:22.066
which means someone who says just enough

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:23.646
to get their meaning across.

00:10:23.646 --> 00:10:27.653
It comes from the region
where Sparta is, Laconia.

00:10:27.653 --> 00:10:29.574
The Spartans were famous for their kind of

00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:31.074
very terse speech.

00:10:31.954 --> 00:10:33.679
Famously, when Philip of Macedon

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:34.848
was threatening the Spartans,

00:10:34.848 --> 00:10:37.410
and he's saying, "If you
don't come on to my side

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.122
"I'm going to do this and that to you

00:10:39.122 --> 00:10:42.512
"if you don't become part
of my kingdom, my empire,

00:10:42.512 --> 00:10:43.686
"I'm going to do this to your city,

00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:45.649
"I'm going to do that to your people."

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:49.780
And the Spartan's famous reply was, "If."

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.180
which is kind of a good
example of laconic speech.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.166
With that one word they
were able to convey a lot.

00:10:57.166 --> 00:10:58.981
So I'm going to leave you there.

00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:00.465
In the next few videos,

00:11:00.465 --> 00:11:02.642
we're going to go into some depth on this.

00:11:02.642 --> 00:11:04.112
But it's important to realize

00:11:04.112 --> 00:11:05.564
that when people talk
about ancient Greece,

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.682
they're talking about a
large span of history,

00:11:07.682 --> 00:11:09.924
and most of what we associate
with ancient Greece,

00:11:09.924 --> 00:11:14.065
the Acropolis, the
Parthenon, the Persian Wars,

00:11:14.065 --> 00:11:16.246
the great Greek philosophers,

00:11:16.246 --> 00:11:19.759
most of that is associated
with the classical period,

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:21.684
often associated with the Golden Age.

00:11:21.684 --> 00:11:24.017
Which is right around there.

00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:27.566
Well before this period,

00:11:27.566 --> 00:11:29.845
the Greeks weren't all these philosophers

00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:31.192
sitting around in togas.

00:11:31.192 --> 00:11:32.388
They might've been wearing togas,

00:11:32.388 --> 00:11:34.071
but at these earlier periods

00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:37.023
they were more adventurers and conquerors,

00:11:37.023 --> 00:11:39.002
and they might have
been in small villages.

00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:42.224
And eventually those
evolved into the city-states

00:11:42.224 --> 00:11:44.373
that especially in Athens and Sparta

00:11:44.373 --> 00:11:47.880
had their Golden Age in
this period right over here.
