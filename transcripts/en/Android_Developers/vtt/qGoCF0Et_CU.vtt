SPEAKER 1: Publishing
a new app or releasing

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.460
a new version of an app
is an exciting moment

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.552
for every developer.

00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:07.760
It's a critical moment when
you have to pay attention

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.610
to all the details to make sure
your users will have the best

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.680
experience with your app.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.240
To make this process
easier, we're

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.670
announcing a new way to publish
apps-- the Manage Releases

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.670
page in the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.010
You start by creating
a new app listing.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.750
Click Create
Application, and you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.430
can access the new Manage
Releases page in the left side

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.359
nav.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.900
It takes you to this page which
shows the tracks to which you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.210
can publish your app--
the production, beta,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.587
and alpha tracks.

00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:36.170
Of course, we recommend running
a beta test for all your apps.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.670
It's a great way to test new
features before you launch them

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.070
publicly.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.620
If it's your first release,
the page will be empty.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.660
And you need to select a
track to create the release.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.270
For example, select
Manage Production and then

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.670
New Release.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.580
Clicking on Upload APK
will open the usual pop-up.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.560
And you can pick the
file you want to upload.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.340
After uploading the APK,
it shows up in the APKs

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.214
to Add section.

00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:01.130
The release name is
filled in with the version

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.876
name from the uploaded APK.

00:01:02.876 --> 00:01:04.459
And if you're releasing
an app update,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.875
don't forget to
fill in the What's

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:08.082
New section in the release.

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:10.040
You also get the chance
to provide localization

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.570
for all the
languages you already

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.040
support in your app listing.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.400
And one of the best things about
the new Manage Releases flow

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.734
is that at any moment, you can
save your draft release date

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.650
and you can work on other
parts of the listing

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
and come back to
finish it later.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.690
To resume to your save
state, navigate back

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.670
to Manage Releases, Manage
Production, and hit Resume.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.420
Once the release is
ready to be published,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.878
you can click on
Review, and you'll

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:36.050
be presented with a
summary of the release.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.820
If you've got no
validation errors,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.010
click on Confirm Rollout
to publish your app.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.619
And you'll be redirected
to the Releases page.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.160
The flow is slightly different
if you're updating an existing

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.730
app, because when you choose
your track and click on New

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.110
Release, a new draft is
created, like before,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.840
but the draft is based
on the previous release.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.360
The APKs of the previous
release will all

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.330
be added to the list
of APKs to deactivate.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.640
Of course, if you want, you
can choose to retain them.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.960
Click the Retain button.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.110
And you'll keep the old
APKs because maybe they're

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.530
providing support for
earlier API versions.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.140
You can add as many APKs
you want at this stage.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.750
And for each upload,
you'll see a basic pop-up

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.550
with information about the APK.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.150
And it's here that you can
also attach expansion files.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.460
When you are done with
new APKs, like before,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.199
you can edit the release
name and the What's New.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.740
After filling in
all the information,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.077
you're ready to
review your release.

00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:31.910
If you're releasing on
the production track,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.130
you can change your
rollout percentage directly

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.810
in this summary screen.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.520
Rolling out your app gradually
is a recommended best practice,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.580
and it has been for
a while, especially

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.740
for significant app releases.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.540
It helps you identify
problems and fix them

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.360
before your app update
hits 100% of the user base,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.330
helping avoid bad
reviews and low ratings.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.010
You can read more
about staged rollouts

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.759
in the Google Play
Developer Help Center.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.050
Now, whenever you're ready,
you can adjust your rollout

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.150
percentage by clicking
on Update Rollout

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.070
and just changing the value.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.860
If you have any doubts about
what percentage to use,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.630
we have suggestions
there for you.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.440
So if you have any problems
on your ongoing stage rollout,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.030
it's now easier than
ever to halt it.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.450
Just click on the Halt Rollout
button and confirm the action.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.856
It's worth being aware that
halting a stage rollout out

00:03:16.856 --> 00:03:18.230
will prevent new
users from being

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.521
able to update to this version.

00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:22.760
But users who already have the
bad update will still have it.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.630
So make sure you introduce
the fix as quickly as you can.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.760
Once you've got the fix,
create another release,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.220
upload it, and then
roll out that release.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.037
Simply keep the
bad release halted.

00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:36.620
Of course, if the fix was made
without creating a new release,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.340
maybe you fixed it
on your servers.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.680
You can just choose to hit
Resume Rollout at any point.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.300
Another new feature
we're launching

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.730
to help give you greater
control over the releases

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.830
is the Artifact Library.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.320
Artifacts include
APKs, expansion files,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.520
and any other app files.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.370
And you can see the update
in the apps artifacts

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.850
if you go to the Artifact
Library under Manage Releases.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.140
You'll see everything uploaded
with your release app.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.030
With the new Manage
Releases functionality,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.180
managing your app release is
now smoother, more transparent,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.230
and easier to track.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.075
It gives you the ability
to manage your app releases

00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:12.950
with more confidence.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.300
