ELIZABETH CHOE: Just wrapped
up the end of day six.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.880
Today was the table
read where everyone

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.540
showcased their scripts
for the first time.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480
Table reads are always
so much more awkward then

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.620
I would anticipate.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.170
It's just a lot of
dead space and silence.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.900
I'm really feeling the time
crunch with this class now.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.310
The panic seems to
sort of be setting

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.310
into the students' mind.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.930
At the end of class, they
were like, our stuff is due

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.250
next Thursday, basically.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.610
I do think that their scripts
are in much, much better form

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.310
than they were last week.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.120
I guess I wonder if it's
more valuable for them

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.810
for me to just give them
the feedback online, which

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.680
is what I did for half of them,
versus talk during these group

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.570
table reads.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.120
But I also think it's
really important for them

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.370
to be able to read the scripts
aloud in front of the class,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.495
and to get some of the
input from their classmates.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:02.820
I mean, Andrea brought up really
good points to PJ-- or Paul--

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.250
at the end.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.205
And that didn't happen when I
was just sending him comments

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:10.790
through Google Docs.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.270
There's a fine line between
constructive criticism

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.290
and just doing
the work for them.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.650
I was super tempted
over the weekend

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.930
to just say, change this word to
this, sort of be their editor.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.486
And I had to fight
that, because I

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.860
think it's more
valuable for them

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.184
to sort of discover
that on their own.

00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:31.975
But the problem is that
takes so much time,

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:33.770
and it's time that
we don't have.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.220
It's been a challenge
to balance that so far,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.890
and I think it will
continue to be a challenge.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.580
Adjusting assignments
on the fly,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.955
and adjusting lecture
materials on the fly,

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:46.010
and taking stuff out--
a lot of stuff out,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.290
actually-- has been not
the easiest thing to do.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.890
I had a very interesting
discussion with [? Sari ?]

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.590
after class about if
this class could really

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.760
be feasible in a semester,
in the style of the semester.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.440
I can't really break up a
lecture into 45-minute chunks.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.030
Josh's storyboarding
lecture wouldn't have made

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.419
any sense in only 45 minutes.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.590
Maybe it could have, but it
would've been so different.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.310
And it's really
inefficient to just shoot

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.010
for 45 minutes at a time.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.400
All in all I feel antsy.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.300
I feel very antsy.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.480
I feel antsy for the students.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.020
It's going to be a
sprint to the end.
