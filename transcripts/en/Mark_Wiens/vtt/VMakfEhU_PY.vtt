00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:02.507
- Hey everyone it's Mark Wiens

00:00:02.507 --> 00:00:04.053
and I am hanging out

00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:04.886
- Hey guys.

00:00:04.886 --> 00:00:06.179
- This is Trevor James, the Food Ranger.

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:08.174
We decided that it would
be a fantastic idea

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.402
to take a road trip to go eat a lobster.

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:12.332
- [Trevor] A lobster journey.

00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:13.165
- [Mark] We're starting in Bangkok

00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:14.879
we're going to drive down to Mahachai,

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.198
which is a seafood market,

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:17.730
and then from there we'll be going on

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.063
to Hua Hin to eat a lobster.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:24.050
- [Trevor] Let's go find a juicy one.

00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:29.680
- [Mark] Your mouth is going to water

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.256
when you see the monstrous
lobsters coming up.

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:33.180
But to build your excitement,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.422
we first stopped to
explore a seafood market

00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:36.538
and enjoyed some amazing massaman curry

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:38.871
at a Thai street food stall.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.590
(upbeat music)

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:48.785
We just arrived to Mahachai.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:50.671
That was about a one hour drive.

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:53.104
Mahachai is one of Thailand's biggest

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:56.354
wholesale seafood distribution markets.

00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:00.796
These are freshwater prawns.

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:01.960
- [Trevor] Freshwater prawns,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.758
so those are packed with head butter.

00:01:04.758 --> 00:01:06.175
- [Mark] Yes sir.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.245
I think this might be inside the market

00:01:14.245 --> 00:01:15.204
if we can go in here.

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:17.481
I think these are king mackerel, right?

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.248
King mackerel and they are dried,

00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:24.346
they are salted and dried
and slightly rotting.

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:26.997
So a little bit of this
provides a lot of flavor.

00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:28.817
Just found this indoor market section

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:30.110
or it's covered market section,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.694
especially for dried seafood.

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:33.021
There's a lot of dried shrimp back here

00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:34.048
and some shrimp paste.

00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:36.166
(speaking Thai)

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.402
Oh okay, okay.

00:01:37.402 --> 00:01:39.163
This is krill

00:01:39.163 --> 00:01:40.412
and this is shrimp.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:41.846
By the way he said we can taste test.

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:42.679
- Really?

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.512
Should we taste this shrimp paste?

00:01:48.928 --> 00:01:50.716
- [Shop Owner] Eat. Very good.

00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:53.466
- [Trevor] Very good. Try it out.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.105
That is surprisingly really nice.

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:58.137
- [Mark] Really salty.

00:01:58.137 --> 00:01:59.264
This one is the most expensive,

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:01.497
so it probably is the best quality right?

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.586
- [Trevor] I'm gonna taste
a little bit of that.

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:07.669
It's shrimp flavor is a lot stronger.

00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:13.136
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:14.075
It's smoother too.

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:14.908
- [Trevor] It's smoother.

00:02:14.908 --> 00:02:15.741
- Smoother and less grainy.

00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:16.773
But you'll definitely need some water

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:18.467
if you snack on too much shrimp paste.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:19.300
- Yeah, it's quite salty.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.865
- It is salty, but it's really good.

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:21.698
Very, very fragrant.

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:22.531
- [Trevor] Very nice.

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.085
- I have decided to order
one kilo of shrimp paste

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:26.675
to bring back home for Ying's mom.

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:29.523
So far we've mostly seen dried seafood,

00:02:29.523 --> 00:02:30.576
but back here in the market

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:33.493
there should be more fresh seafood.

00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:38.965
Oh yeah, it is confirmed king mackerel.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:47.178
Most of the vendors here
have been telling me

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:51.315
most of the fresh seafood is
only open early in the morning.

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:52.240
So we're here a little bit late.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.533
If you come to this area
probably at 7 am or so,

00:02:55.533 --> 00:03:00.211
it would probably just be
packed full of fresh seafood.

00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:01.048
Just looking for something to eat.

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:03.288
These kind ladies

00:03:03.288 --> 00:03:04.717
they have just told us like

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.916
ten different things that are available

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:10.095
in this vicinity. Different noodles.

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:13.528
But actually I think I was the khao gaeng

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:14.718
which is rice and curry right here.

00:03:14.718 --> 00:03:15.635
- [Trevor] Actually
curry sounds pretty good.

00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:16.766
- [Mark] Oh this looks incredible.

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:18.166
So we're going to get a plate of rice

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:20.440
and then you can choose whatever
dish you want on top of it.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.777
- [Trevor] You can just
get one or can you get--

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:23.938
- [Mark] You can get
however many you want.

00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:25.465
They'll just charge
according to what you get.

00:03:25.465 --> 00:03:27.648
Get as many as you want.

00:03:27.648 --> 00:03:29.469
Normally, yeah, two, three, four.

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.089
Usually three.

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.414
- [Trevor] This looks delicious here.

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:33.855
- [Mark] This is massaman curry.

00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:35.455
- [Trevor] That massaman looks thick.

00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:36.990
Chicken and potatoes and carrots?

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.050
- [Mark] Yes. And peanuts on top there.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.864
- [Trevor] Oh look at all those peanuts.

00:03:41.864 --> 00:03:44.589
That looks like it's packed with flavor.

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.437
- [Mark] Yeah, it does look great.

00:03:46.437 --> 00:03:49.348
And I love how there's whole onions.

00:03:49.348 --> 00:03:50.181
- [Trevor] Oh onions!

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:52.848
Look at that, carrots, potatoes.

00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:56.887
- [Mark] I asked him to give you an onion.

00:03:56.887 --> 00:03:58.220
- [Trevor] Good.

00:04:15.512 --> 00:04:16.345
That looks awesome.

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:17.546
- [Mark] Yeah that looks awesome.

00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:18.796
What up Trevor?

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:23.058
And we wanted to actually
have a very simple lunch

00:04:23.058 --> 00:04:26.885
because tonight we are going
to have an extreme lobster.

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:31.169
- [Trevor] We're going to
try and find a big fat one.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.002
- And that's going to
be a significant meal

00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:33.208
so we wanted to keep it simple for lunch.

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:34.157
We're just walking around,

00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:37.811
curry rice stalls are some of my favorite.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.970
- [Trevor] This looks amazing.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.210
- [Mark] It does look good.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.551
I think we have to start
with the massaman, right?

00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:42.623
- Yeah, wow.

00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:43.928
Curry and rice stall.

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:46.575
That gets the mouth watering.

00:04:46.575 --> 00:04:48.132
- [Mark] And you can
see those peanuts on top

00:04:48.132 --> 00:04:50.277
and I think that's black pepper as well.

00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:51.934
- [Trevor] You can smell the peanuts.

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:55.326
Oh and the sauce is just
soaked into the rice.

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:58.243
- [Mark] Oh yeah look at that bite.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.457
Mmmmmm.

00:05:01.457 --> 00:05:02.290
Oh yeah.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.291
That's good.

00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:07.184
- That's really good.

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:08.344
- Yeah it is.

00:05:08.344 --> 00:05:09.177
- That peanut,

00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:10.753
that peanut fragrance.

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:11.938
- That's better than I expected it.

00:05:11.938 --> 00:05:13.771
- There's some sort of

00:05:15.288 --> 00:05:18.284
- There's a lot of pepper in there.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.567
Maybe using some cumin.

00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:20.421
- [Trevor] That's what it is.

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:21.482
- [Mark] Cumin in there.

00:05:21.482 --> 00:05:23.273
- Just on that rice.

00:05:23.273 --> 00:05:24.930
- Yeah, that's a really good massaman.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.106
I'm going to move into that egg yolk,

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:27.021
mixed with the massaman.

00:05:27.021 --> 00:05:27.854
- [Trevor] Oh mine's broken.

00:05:27.854 --> 00:05:30.104
- [Mark] Oh it just popped.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.864
Oh few things as beautiful
as a popping egg yolk.

00:05:36.864 --> 00:05:38.328
Okay then if you take
some of that egg yolk

00:05:38.328 --> 00:05:40.312
and mix it with the massaman.

00:05:40.312 --> 00:05:42.849
And the nuttiness of that massaman

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:43.903
is also really, really good.

00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:45.486
That's a highlight.

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:52.798
Egg is delicious.

00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:55.839
- The egg, the massaman,
the peanut fragrance

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.263
and the rice, it's just
saturated in one bite.

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:01.981
- I think we actually should go ask

00:06:01.981 --> 00:06:03.748
for some more of the massaman sauce.

00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:04.795
- Let's go do that.

00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:06.435
Let's go do that.

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:07.493
- We can right?

00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:11.410
- We're going to go ask
for some more massaman.

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:24.721
- That is going to bring
it to the next level.

00:06:24.721 --> 00:06:27.335
It's like a massaman soup now.

00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:28.304
- [Mark] Look at that dude.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.413
Juicy, oiliness.

00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:32.577
- [Trevor] The rice is just
saturated with massaman.

00:06:32.577 --> 00:06:34.251
- [Mark] Okay I'm going
to take a bite now.

00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.652
Um right in that pool of oil and sauce.

00:06:37.652 --> 00:06:39.037
- [Trevor] Look at those
peanuts in there right?

00:06:39.037 --> 00:06:40.704
It is so good right?

00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:44.704
- [Mark] I'm going to quickly
taste the gaeng ki lek

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.751
which is the cassia leaf curry.

00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:48.546
You can feel free to try if you want too.

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:50.581
- Yeah, I'm going to go in for my curry.

00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:51.440
- Mmm.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.906
It's sour and bitter.

00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:56.099
And I think we should add some chilies.

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.302
- [Trevor] We're just
adding a little bit of

00:06:58.302 --> 00:07:00.302
fish sauce with chilies.

00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:12.969
- [Mark] Man what a meal.

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:13.802
Yeah that was good.

00:07:13.802 --> 00:07:14.635
- [Trevor] That was insane.

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:15.468
- [Mark] What was your favorite dish?

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:16.758
- Definitely the massaman.

00:07:16.758 --> 00:07:20.395
- Massaman was really good and
it had a really good spice,

00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:23.066
dry spice blended flavor to it.

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:24.212
- [Trevor] Now we're going to move on.

00:07:24.212 --> 00:07:25.759
- From here now we're going
to walk back to the car

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.928
and we are on our way to
Hua Hin to go eat a lobster.

00:07:28.928 --> 00:07:31.511
(upbeat music)

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:54.308
We successfully made it to Hua Hin

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:56.608
and we literally, we just parked

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:59.381
and we are going straight for the lobster.

00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:01.942
- The anticipation is just totally--

00:08:01.942 --> 00:08:03.525
- Sky high!
- Yeah.

00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:07.528
- The lobster quest is almost complete.

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:11.466
- Kind of a touristy night market area.

00:08:11.466 --> 00:08:13.549
There's lots of souvenirs

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.187
but then lots of restaurants as well.

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:19.514
Oh and I'm starting to see some lobsters.

00:08:19.514 --> 00:08:20.347
- Oh!

00:08:20.347 --> 00:08:21.485
- And gigantic prawns.

00:08:21.485 --> 00:08:22.431
- [Trevor] Wow!

00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:23.393
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:08:23.393 --> 00:08:26.961
- [Trevor] (laughing) They're huge!

00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:28.794
- [Mark] Thy are huge.

00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:32.436
(speaking Thai)

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.834
Yes we came here to eat.

00:08:39.964 --> 00:08:42.933
Wow look at that stack of seafood.

00:08:42.933 --> 00:08:43.766
- [Trevor] They're huge.

00:08:43.766 --> 00:08:45.130
- [Mark] Look, that's a prawn man!

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.215
- Oh that's a prawn!

00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:47.621
- [Mark] That's a prawn dude.

00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:48.462
- Okay

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:49.462
- Thank you!

00:08:50.547 --> 00:08:52.396
This is a prawn!

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:53.646
This is insane!

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:56.580
- Wow.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.499
- [Mark] I don't know if I've ever seen

00:08:57.499 --> 00:08:58.423
a prawn this big before.

00:08:58.423 --> 00:08:59.256
- [Trevor] No.

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:01.794
So shall we have two lobsters and two--

00:09:01.794 --> 00:09:03.535
- [Mark] We're getting two
lobsters and two king prawns?

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:04.702
- Let's do it.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.826
- Man there's just nothing more satisfying

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:11.027
than anticipating a journey all day long,

00:09:11.027 --> 00:09:12.722
or something you want to eat all day long.

00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:14.518
And then finally getting here.

00:09:14.518 --> 00:09:17.153
The three hours drive.

00:09:17.153 --> 00:09:18.542
The stop at the market.

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:20.629
But our minds were
always on these lobsters.

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:22.645
A lobster the size of Micah.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:26.812
All right he is getting
ready to chop up our lobster.

00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:42.518
Oh, look at that tomalley!

00:09:47.076 --> 00:09:48.243
Oh! The spray!

00:09:56.934 --> 00:09:57.879
I think they're going
to steam it real fast

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.379
and then grill it.

00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:07.484
And these tiger prawns are just gigantic.

00:10:07.484 --> 00:10:09.310
Oh man they're huge.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.060
Those are ridiculous.

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:14.300
Look at all of that head goodness.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.133
That tomalley.

00:10:15.133 --> 00:10:16.349
Wow.

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:17.535
It's amazing when they grill and

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:21.452
you can just see the
bubbling starting to come.

00:10:22.315 --> 00:10:23.148
Oh the flip.

00:10:23.148 --> 00:10:23.981
Oh the flip.

00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:25.832
- [Trevor] Oh that's
the magic right there.

00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:26.915
Look at that!

00:10:32.695 --> 00:10:36.872
- [Mark] Look at the
size and beauty of those.

00:10:36.872 --> 00:10:37.901
So they're out of the steamer now.

00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:41.291
The lobsters are out of the steamer.

00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:42.124
- [Trevor] Those are huge!

00:10:42.124 --> 00:10:46.291
- [Mark] Look at that amount
of meat in that shell!

00:10:49.694 --> 00:10:51.777
Oh that steam is amazing.

00:10:52.844 --> 00:10:54.462
That is like a lobster steam bath.

00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:56.437
- [Trevor] Therapeutic lobster steam.

00:10:56.437 --> 00:10:59.270
- [Mark] That is, seriously.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.247
Oh just look at that steam coming up

00:11:01.247 --> 00:11:04.527
off that freshly grilled lobster.

00:11:04.527 --> 00:11:07.248
He's going to cook the
phat phak bung fai daeng

00:11:07.248 --> 00:11:09.018
which is the water morning glory,

00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:10.948
and he's going to give us
a little fireworks show.

00:11:10.948 --> 00:11:14.865
So he's got to get that
oil really, really hot.

00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:16.980
(sizzling)

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.813
Whoa!

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.413
I have a teardrop.

00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:27.065
I have a little teardrop man.

00:11:27.065 --> 00:11:28.304
- Now we're going for the feast?

00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:31.185
- Man and on that note,
all the food is cooked.

00:11:31.185 --> 00:11:33.080
Trevor and I are sitting down

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.916
for like a feast of our lifetime.

00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:39.717
The entire table is just
covered in lobster and shrimp.

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:42.615
- [Trevor] So much juicy meat.

00:11:42.615 --> 00:11:43.448
We just gotta get in.

00:11:43.448 --> 00:11:45.044
- Dude I'm like speechless.

00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:46.492
- My mouth is watering, let's dig in.

00:11:46.492 --> 00:11:47.578
- The only thing better than one lobster

00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:48.848
is two lobsters.

00:11:48.848 --> 00:11:50.581
- [Trevor] Where are
you going to dig from?

00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:51.562
- [Mark] I wanted to get some of

00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:52.511
that yellow buttery goodness

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:54.692
along with some of the meat.

00:11:54.692 --> 00:11:57.359
I'm just going to go in right...

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.159
It's like a strip man.

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:03.076
A strip just comes off.

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:06.432
- [Trevor] Oh the head butter in there.

00:12:06.432 --> 00:12:08.959
- [Mark] Yeah and I'm going
to take my piece and probably

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:11.017
grab a piece and dip some of that.

00:12:11.017 --> 00:12:13.242
Dip some of that juice from the head.

00:12:13.242 --> 00:12:14.753
- Dip the head juice in there?

00:12:14.753 --> 00:12:15.860
- [Mark] You gotta make
your first bite count.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.411
That's for sure.

00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:18.626
- [Trevor] Let's go in for the kill.

00:12:18.626 --> 00:12:19.526
- [Mark] This is a bite
we've gotta toast man.

00:12:19.526 --> 00:12:20.359
- Yeah, cheers.

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:21.442
- Cheers man.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.233
Mmmm.

00:12:31.404 --> 00:12:33.111
That is insane.

00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:35.028
- Whoa the head butter.

00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:39.153
- That's like a bite you
don't even want to swallow.

00:12:39.153 --> 00:12:40.460
- You don't want it to end.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.434
- [Mark] You just want to keep
it in your mouth, hold it.

00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:44.325
- [Trevor] There's just so much here.

00:12:44.325 --> 00:12:46.447
- [Mark] That is ridiculously good.

00:12:46.447 --> 00:12:48.614
It's so soft and so silky.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.178
- [Trevor] Silky and packed with juice.

00:12:52.178 --> 00:12:55.352
- [Mark] And sweet. You're
right about the juice too.

00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:59.019
- [Trevor] Oh just look
at that head butter.

00:13:00.622 --> 00:13:01.839
- [Mark] This meat just slides

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:03.554
out of the shell so effortlessly

00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:05.340
that you can take the entire lobster tail.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.411
- Look at that.

00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:09.411
It just pulls right out.

00:13:10.268 --> 00:13:12.267
- That is just absolutely insane.

00:13:12.267 --> 00:13:13.982
- [Trevor] This is an
experience of a lifetime.

00:13:13.982 --> 00:13:14.815
- Look at that!

00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:15.648
Look at that!

00:13:15.648 --> 00:13:17.928
It almost looks like an
alligator, crocodile tail.

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:20.219
- [Trevor] Right? Like
a dinosaur or something.

00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:22.246
I think Micah was getting a little grumpy

00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:23.840
because he was wanted some lobster.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.673
Now he's in.

00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:27.006
We've got the lobster tails.

00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:29.429
Cheers.

00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:31.353
- I think I'm going to
dip it in this spicy lime.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.028
This is the Thai seafood sauce.

00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:38.195
There's chilies in here,
should be full of lime juice.

00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:44.121
(laughing)

00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:47.799
- That muscular texture.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:48.935
It's so muscular.

00:13:48.935 --> 00:13:49.856
- Yeah.

00:13:49.856 --> 00:13:51.347
Very muscular.

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:53.587
What an experience Mark.

00:13:53.587 --> 00:13:56.915
- It could definitely be considered

00:13:56.915 --> 00:13:59.708
one of the wonders of the world.

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:01.889
- This is a pilgrimage.

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:03.204
Lobster pilgrimage.

00:14:03.204 --> 00:14:04.037
Cheers.

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:05.822
- Micah.

00:14:11.247 --> 00:14:13.546
- [Trevor] This lobster is
everything you could want

00:14:13.546 --> 00:14:16.235
in a bite of food and more.

00:14:16.235 --> 00:14:17.635
- When you eat something so good,

00:14:17.635 --> 00:14:19.648
it is actually hard to
like think straight.

00:14:19.648 --> 00:14:24.339
- You feel a little bit
dizzy and just so happy

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:25.790
when you taste it.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.186
- That euphoric delicious.

00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:30.103
This is like the gold
medal of the Olympics here.

00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:31.925
We also wanted to taste the difference

00:14:31.925 --> 00:14:35.342
between the tiger prawns and the lobster.

00:14:36.403 --> 00:14:37.236
You can just rip out the entire thing.

00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:38.316
- [Trevor] You can take the whole thing.

00:14:38.316 --> 00:14:39.149
Look at this.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:41.816
- That butter, that head butter.

00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:43.552
Oh man.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.232
- Oh that head butter.

00:14:48.232 --> 00:14:50.156
- [Mark] That is ridiculous as well.

00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:52.410
That head butter is like stronger

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.885
and maybe a little grainier.

00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:55.558
I just wanted to take one bite

00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:57.310
of the phat phak bung fai daeng,

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.220
which is the water morning glory,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.061
which he fried actually
in a flame of fire.

00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:04.894
He literally cooked it in seconds.

00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:12.329
That literally tastes
like it's on fire still.

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:14.032
Even though it's cooled down.

00:15:14.032 --> 00:15:15.365
Very, very good.

00:15:16.302 --> 00:15:18.136
- What an experience.

00:15:18.136 --> 00:15:19.986
- It's hilarious people walking by and

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:22.153
just looking at the table.

00:15:24.232 --> 00:15:25.065
They'll just walk by
normally and be like whoa!

00:15:25.065 --> 00:15:27.193
- What are they eating,
what are they doing?

00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:28.584
Huge lobsters.

00:15:28.584 --> 00:15:29.417
- It's really good.

00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:30.356
- It's really good.

00:15:30.356 --> 00:15:32.290
Really, really good.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.602
- You could just keep going,

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:37.998
there's like unlimited areas to find meat.

00:15:37.998 --> 00:15:38.831
- Yeah seriously.

00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:42.902
In all these little crevices
of lobster and juice

00:15:42.902 --> 00:15:45.013
that you can suck out.

00:15:45.013 --> 00:15:46.263
It's very good.

00:15:47.635 --> 00:15:48.641
Very, very good.

00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:50.534
- Yes very good.

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:51.367
- Hey man!

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.200
- Hi.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.033
- Nice to meet you.

00:15:53.033 --> 00:15:53.892
- Nice to meet you.

00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:57.975
- All that's left are
shells and empty tentacles.

00:15:59.442 --> 00:16:01.609
But what I did want to
do for one last bite

00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:03.143
is grab this head shell,

00:16:03.143 --> 00:16:05.387
and you can see some of that yolk,

00:16:05.387 --> 00:16:07.887
that tomolley within that head

00:16:08.773 --> 00:16:12.346
and what I'm going to do is
just slide my fingertips,

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:14.346
slide them up that head.

00:16:15.722 --> 00:16:18.972
It almost looks like uni, like mustard.

00:16:21.499 --> 00:16:22.332
- Look at that.

00:16:22.332 --> 00:16:23.165
- You don't want that to go to waste.

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:23.998
- No, no.

00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:27.002
- Last bite man.

00:16:29.477 --> 00:16:30.978
It's like foamy.

00:16:30.978 --> 00:16:32.036
- Yeah!

00:16:32.036 --> 00:16:33.338
- A little bit bitter.

00:16:33.338 --> 00:16:34.171
A little bit sweet.

00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:35.404
- It's like creamy sea foam.

00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:39.449
- Like molecular gastronomy
but without anything added.

00:16:39.449 --> 00:16:40.364
That's natural.

00:16:40.364 --> 00:16:42.528
Absolutely stunning.

00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:44.918
- I think we're both a little bit...

00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:46.070
Euphoric here.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.055
- You actually--

00:16:47.055 --> 00:16:48.299
- Feel a little dizzy.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.833
- Dizzy, I'm like lightheaded.

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:51.920
Each of of these is 1.3 kilos.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.469
We just ate 2.6 kilos of lobster.

00:16:55.469 --> 00:16:56.641
- What?

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.825
Doesn't that sound insane?

00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:01.787
The 2.6 kilos doesn't even
include the tiger prawns.

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:04.257
- The tiger prawns were bhat kiet.

00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:05.712
They were 800 grams both of them,

00:17:05.712 --> 00:17:07.711
so they were 400 grams
each for the tiger prawns.

00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:11.878
So it's not a cheap meal, by
any stretch of the imagination.

00:17:12.864 --> 00:17:14.244
- [Trevor] But totally worth it.

00:17:14.244 --> 00:17:15.780
- [Mark] Man it was a once
in a lifetime experience.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.914
But if you come to Hua Hin and

00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:19.636
if you are looking for
some wonderful seafood,

00:17:19.636 --> 00:17:22.711
some lobsters, some tiger prawns,

00:17:22.711 --> 00:17:25.314
Lung Ja Seafood is a great restaurant.

00:17:25.314 --> 00:17:27.471
And it was also awesome
to hang out with Trevor

00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:29.857
and Micah and Ting Ting and Ying

00:17:29.857 --> 00:17:31.959
and just enjoy this feast as well.

00:17:31.959 --> 00:17:32.905
- It was really nice.

00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:33.738
- Cool environment.

00:17:33.738 --> 00:17:35.295
Yeah, just a great time.

hanging out with you.

00:17:36.796 --> 00:17:37.740
