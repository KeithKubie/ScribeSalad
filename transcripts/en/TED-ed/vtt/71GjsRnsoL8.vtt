00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.976
In the early days of organic chemistry,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.976
chemists understood
that molecules were made of atoms

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.976
connected through chemical bonds.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.976
However, the three-dimensional
shapes of molecules

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.976
were utterly unclear, since they couldn't
be observed directly.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
Molecules were represented using
simple connectivity graphs

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.976
like the one you see here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.976
It was clear to savvy chemists
of the mid-19th century

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.976
that these flat representations
couldn't explain

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.976
many of their observations.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.976
But chemical theory hadn't provided
a satisfactory explanation

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.381
for the three-dimensional
structures of molecules.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:56.976
In 1874, the chemist Van't Hoff
published a remarkable hypothesis:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.976
the four bonds of a saturated carbon atom

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.976
point to the corners of a tetrahedron.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.976
It would take over 25 years

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.976
for the quantum revolution
to theoretically validate his hypothesis.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.976
But Van't Hoff supported
his theory using optical rotation.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.143
Van't Hoff noticed that only compounds
containing a central carbon

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:20.976
bound to four different atoms or groups

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.976
rotated plane-polarized light.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.976
Clearly there's something unique
about this class of compounds.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.976
Take a look at the two molecules
you see here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.976
Each one is characterized
by a central, tetrahedral carbon atom

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.976
bound to four different atoms:

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.976
bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and hydrogen.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.572
We might be tempted to conclude
that the two molecules

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:44.976
are the same, if we just concern
ourselves with what they're made of.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.976
However, let's see if we can
overlay the two molecules

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.976
perfectly to really prove
that they're the same.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.976
We have free license to rotate
and translate both of the molecules

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
as we wish. Remarkably though,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.976
no matter how we move the molecules,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.976
we find that perfect superposition
is impossible to achieve.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.976
Now take a look at your hands.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.976
Notice that your two hands
have all the same parts:

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.976
a thumb, fingers, a palm, etc.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.976
Like our two molecules under study,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.976
both of your hands are made
of the same stuff.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.976
Furthermore, the distances between stuff
in both of your hands are the same.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.191
The index finger
is next to the middle finger,

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:29.976
which is next to the ring finger, etc.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.976
The same is true
of our hypothetical molecules.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.976
All of their internal distances

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.976
are the same. Despite
the similarities between them,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.976
your hands, and our molecules,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.976
are certainly not the same.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.976
Try superimposing
your hands on one another.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.976
Just like our molecules from before,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.976
you'll find that it can't
be done perfectly.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.976
Now, point your palms toward one another.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.976
Wiggle both of your index fingers.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.976
Notice that your left hand
looks as if it's looking

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.976
in a mirror at your right.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.976
In other words, your hands
are mirror images.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.976
The same can be said of our molecules.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.976
We can turn them so
that one looks at the other

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.976
as in a mirror. Your hands
- and our molecules -

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.976
possess a spatial property
in common called chirality,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.976
or handedness.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.976
Chirality means exactly
what we've just described:

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.477
a chiral object is not
the same as its mirror image.

00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:29.976
Chiral objects are very special
in both chemistry and everyday life.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.976
Screws, for example, are also chiral.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.976
That's why we need the terms
right-handed and left-handed screws.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.976
And believe it or not,
certain types of light

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.976
can behave like chiral screws.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.976
Packed into every linear,
plane-polarized beam of light

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.976
are right-handed and left-handed parts

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.976
that rotate together
to produce plane polarization.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.976
Chiral molecules, placed
in a beam of such light,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.976
interact differently
with the two chiral components.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.976
As a result, one component of the light
gets temporarily slowed down

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.976
relative to the other. The
effect on the light beam

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.976
is a rotation of its plane
from the original one,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.976
otherwise known as optical rotation.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.976
Van't Hoff and later chemists
realized that the chiral nature

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
of tetrahedral carbons can explain
this fascinating phenomenon.

00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:28.976
Chirality is responsible for all kinds
of other fascinating effects

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.976
in chemistry, and everyday life.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.976
Humans tend to love symmetry

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.976
and so if you look around you,
you'll find that chiral objects

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.976
made by humans are rare.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.976
But chiral molecules
are absolutely everywhere.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.976
Phenomena as separate as optical rotation,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.976
Screwing together furniture,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.976
and clapping your hands

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
all involve this intriguing
spatial property.
