00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:06.550
JOHN WOOLARD: We're
very fortunate to have

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.910
Secretary of Energy,
Ernie Moniz, here today.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.890
He's got a long, very
rich history working

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.770
in that complicated interface
between energy and environment

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.060
that dates all the way back to,
I guess, the early days of a BS

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.720
in physics at Boston College.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.920
Then he got his doctorate
in theoretical physics

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.700
from Stanford.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.989
But most of the career was
balanced between MIT and DOE.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.030
ERNEST MONIZ: Mostly DOE.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.515
JOHN WOOLARD: Mostly DOE.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:37.365
ERNEST MONIZ: Mostly MIT,
mostly MIT, excuse me.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.870
JOHN WOOLARD: So at MIT, Dr.
Moniz, or Secretary Moniz,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.730
headed the Department of
Physics and the Bates Linear

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.560
Accelerator Center,
and he was also

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.420
founding director of the
MIT Energy Initiative

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.680
and director of the MIT
Laboratory for Energy

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.140
and the Environment, so quite
a rich past and a fairly

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.700
challenging day job
today now at DOE.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.209
So we'll do a quick
conversation up here,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.660
but then I want to open it
up to questions from you guys

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.060
as well.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.940
Some of them we'll have
from the Dory and others--

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.970
do we have mics?

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.180
Yes, so we can actually
have live questions,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.550
which would be even better.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.600
So first, your mission
at DOE states--

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.260
and I'm going to
have to actually

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.860
read this because
this was long--

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.890
"advancing the President's
all-the-above energy strategy,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.060
maintaining the
nuclear deterrent

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.940
and reducing the nuclear danger,
promoting American leadership

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.100
in science and clean energy
technology innovation,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.570
cleaning up the legacy
of the Cold War,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.370
and strengthening
management and performance."

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.560
So that's quite a
burly job description.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.170
Could you just give
us a little bit

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.210
of a sense of how you balance
across all those priorities

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.880
and what it really takes to
run a department like this?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.255
ERNEST MONIZ:
First of all, I can

00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:59.520
provide a more concise
description of our missions--

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
weapons and windmills,
quarks and quagmires.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.080
Those are the four
things that we do.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.860
So in that order, weapons means
that-- the Department of Energy

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.870
is kind of a derivative
of the Atomic Energy

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.090
Commission from the old days.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.600
And so we do still
have responsibility

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.450
for nuclear weapons,
for cleaning up

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.180
the world of dangerous
nuclear materials,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.030
and also providing
the propulsion

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.020
for the nuclear Navy.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.050
So those all come into our
nuclear security remit.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.010
I would just put that in a
kind of a policy context.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.470
I think the president
stated a strong commitment

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.810
recognizing it's a long-time
process of reducing

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.680
our stockpile and
eventually, hopefully,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.510
having the world denuclearized.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.890
In that context,
the job that we do

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.460
in terms of maintaining a
continuously safe and reliable

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.470
shrinking stockpile
without nuclear testing

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.480
is a foundation for
being able to pursue

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.610
that kind of a policy.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.330
And I might just say--
I'll move onto windmills,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.540
but the last point
there, perhaps,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.970
is that this job had to
be completely reinvented

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.710
in the 1990s because of the
absence of underground testing.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.520
So a new science-based
approach had to be invented.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.190
It was invented, and it
succeeded for 22 years

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.970
without testing, and we see no
reason to expect that will not

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.230
remain the case for a long time.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.290
So I think that's a
big success story.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.460
The president also has
had a signature item

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.080
of reducing nuclear materials
globally, and, for example,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.780
sometimes working with
Russia-- with whom

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.880
we have a little bit of an
interesting relationship

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.150
at the moment-- but
continuing to work with them,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.310
we have eliminated completely
high-enriched uranium,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.709
for example, from 12 countries
in the last few years.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.010
So that's one mission.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.885
JOHN WOOLARD: And we
even consume quite a bit

00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:25.130
of the nuclear material
from old weapons

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.570
in some of our
power plants today.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.840
ERNEST MONIZ: Yes, I would
argue that the greatest

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.200
nonproliferation program
that there has been

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.360
is the so-called Megatons
to Megawatts Program.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.010
It just finished 20
years on schedule,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:48.840
and 500 tons, metric tons,
of Russian HEU material

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.670
was blended down into
low-enriched uranium

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.280
for American nuclear
power reactors.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.530
And for 20 years,
it provided the fuel

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.770
for half of our nuclear fleet.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.960
So we were burning Russian
nuclear weapons material

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.650
in our reactors, and 500
tons is a lot to get rid of.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.870
Windmills-- of course,
our energy mission.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.870
We pursue a clean energy
agenda for several reasons,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.930
but I would say preeminently for
climate change risk mitigation.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.180
And that agenda--
I presume we're

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.240
going to talk more about
that as the main focus

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.260
of our discussion-- that
agenda, I would say,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.100
has a very, very strong
technology focus.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.950
And that technology focus
ranges from very early

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.580
stage basic research through
development and demonstration

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.120
to a huge deployment program.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.040
In fact, Google has
partnered with us

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.640
in some of our major loans
and loan guarantees that

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.620
have implemented large
clean energy projects.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.170
I would just mention now that
in addition to that technology

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:15.390
development focus, we also have
some regulatory authorities,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.820
such as setting efficiency
standards for appliances,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.180
for electric motors, et cetera.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.050
And a lot of these
sound individually

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.820
small, like efficiency
standards for standby power

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.080
in microwave ovens, but
when you add these up--

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.600
and we have picked up
the pace dramatically

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.630
on these standards-- when we
add up all the standards that

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.020
had been put in place
just in the Obama years

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.940
and what we expect to do
in the next two years,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.550
and you accumulate that to
2030, we're talking $450 billion

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.070
of energy savings and
three gigatons of CO2.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.170
So you've got to
just keep at it.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.120
We'll do 10 standards this year.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.060
We hope to do 25 more
in the next two years.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.920
It's very popular with
everyone, I can assure you.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.110
And then, a third
element is-- another way

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.260
we go about our business
is simply by using,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.034
frankly, the convening
power of the department.

00:07:29.034 --> 00:07:30.450
And a good example
of that, again,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.190
is in energy
efficiency, something

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.350
we call a Better Buildings
Challenge, for example.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.920
And we can discuss more of that,
but there we have about 11%

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:48.460
of all of the commercial floor
space, big commercial space,

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.080
under this program,
where we convene.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.030
We propagate best practices.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.940
They're shared
among the companies.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.940
The goal is 20% energy
reduction by 2020,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.160
and we are ahead of that pace.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Some companies have actually
reached the goal in a few years

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.430
and have doubled down.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.550
So it's everything.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.240
It's science and technology,
and its regulatory approaches,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.770
and it's convening.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.580
Third, quarks.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.620
That's the science agenda.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.010
And this morning,
actually, I was

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.540
out at Slack, one
of your neighbors,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.130
one of our 17
national laboratories.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.289
Let me just say that
the Department of Energy

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.990
sometimes is recognized,
sometimes is not,

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.549
as an absolute
kind of a backbone

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:42.289
in the American science and
technology establishment.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.770
The 17 national
laboratories, including,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.960
at those laboratories, these
facilities like big light

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.650
sources, big neutron sources
that are nowhere else, frankly.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.250
30,000 scientists use
those facilities every year

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:04.690
for their research, from
universities and other places.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.870
It's also maybe
interesting to know

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.590
that if you take
our light sources--

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:16.420
we have four places--
a third of their work

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.210
is now in the life
sciences, biology.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.110
I mean, users coming in to
use them-- it's been said,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.370
and I believe it's true, that
there is no new drug that

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.410
comes onto the market
in the United States

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.590
that did not, in its
development phase,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.750
go through one of our light
sources, to understand.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.940
So it's a big responsibility
to maintain this science

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.650
enterprise, and the quagmire is
cleaning up the Cold War mess.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.150
JOHN WOOLARD: Oh, I thought you
were talking about Congress.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.339
You said quagmire, but
the other quagmire.

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:49.380
ERNEST MONIZ: You know I
have no comment on that.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.560
But anyway, just to say
that it's a pretty tough--

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.970
we've done the 90%
of the jobs that

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.270
could get done
relatively easily,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.560
and now we have some really
tough ones left to do.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.970
But let me just note that all
four of those mission areas

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.410
are fundamentally, largely
science and technology areas.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.960
And that's where, again, our
laboratory system of 17 labs

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.970
comes in as a
principal, not the only,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.720
but as a principal
way of implementing

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.502
our missions in
science and technology.

00:10:26.502 --> 00:10:28.960
JOHN WOOLARD: One of the things
we talked about earlier was

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.530
just what's been happening
in China recently

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.610
and the whole macro
picture around carbon

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.330
between now and 2050.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.040
I'd love if you could
just walk the audience

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.510
through a little more
of what's happened

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.120
in China with the US, what that
deal looks like, what it means,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.930
maybe even with respect to
the existing policy 111(d),

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.871
and how all of this
can fit together

00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:53.995
from a climate perspective.

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:55.770
ERNEST MONIZ: OK.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.420
A lot of things to
put together there.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.040
So, China.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.712
First of all, starting with
the announcement on Tuesday--

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:06.160
well, Tuesday here in
the United States--

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.230
by Presidents Obama and Xi.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.610
Obviously, we've been
working on this for a while.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.210
And frankly, in the end,
the most important message

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.920
was simply the fact that the
two presidents stood together

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.070
and talked about what, in the
different context that we have

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.500
in the United States and Russia,
are reasonably ambitious goals

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.600
for addressing carbon--
well, greenhouse gases more

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.450
generally.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.470
Clearly, the nature
of the commitments

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:45.480
was quite different
in terms of what

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.620
goals were discussed
on the road to Paris.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.852
In the United
States' case, clearly

00:11:54.852 --> 00:11:59.310
the reduction of CO2
from 2005 into the 26%,

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.031
28% range is going
to be aggressive.

00:12:03.031 --> 00:12:04.030
I mean, it's aggressive.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:14.850
We've done modeling, et cetera,
and with current authorities,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.970
we think there's a chance.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.580
It's a tough call, I mean,
but we think we can do it.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:25.790
Clearly, we'd be in much
better shape if we can get--

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.330
and I'm optimistic,
frankly, that we

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.940
will get-- I don't
mean in two years--

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:35.440
but that we will get, relatively
soon, some statutory approach,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.450
which would really help
make things simpler to reach

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.590
those kinds of goals.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:47.020
Anyway, so that was a major part
of the United States statement.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:52.130
In the Chinese case, the big
news is simply-- first of all,

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.890
it's simply that they
announced that they

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.960
are going to tackle carbon.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.040
They announced it in two ways.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:06.420
One is as a 20% carbon-free
goal and that they

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:12.930
will peak C02 2030,
and hopefully--

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.460
and they had the
statement-- with the intent

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.110
of trying to advance
that even earlier.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:23.740
So clearly, getting China,
biggest emitter, large,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.550
emerging economy-- frankly,
a country whose reluctance

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.990
previously to commit
to a carbon goal,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.240
even though they were doing a
lot of programs domestically

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.600
that would lead you there, but
that reluctance was clearly

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.160
a major issue in terms of how
other countries would or would

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.110
not come on board.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.540
So we think this was
kind of a big deal,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.362
in terms of setting us
up for the road to Paris.

00:13:54.362 --> 00:13:56.320
JOHN WOOLARD: Now the
Chinese had, before this,

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.770
goals, but not
commitments, I guess.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.500
How far beyond their
existing goals--

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.000
ERNEST MONIZ: Their
goals were never

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.070
phrased in terms of carbon.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.919
The goals were--

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:05.960
JOHN WOOLARD: Renewable--

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.070
ERNEST MONIZ: --in
terms of air pollution,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.590
which of course is a huge issue.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.980
It was in terms of goals for
nuclear power expansion, goals

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:22.560
for CAFE standards for vehicles,
goals for renewable deployment.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.490
But to actually say that
this is about carbon,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.970
and it's going to take us a
little bit longer to peak-- us

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.520
I mean Chinese-- and then
we're going to come down,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.660
is really a big step.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.600
And again, I think, and we
all certainly hope and think,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.750
that, again, this will
facilitate a very different

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.870
discussion
internationally, especially

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.290
on the road to Paris.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.220
Of course, the EU
already also declared

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.810
their goals, which,
by the way, because

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.020
of the different
baseline year 1990,

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.340
have roughly the same kinds of
annual reductions as the United

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.652
States.

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.560
JOHN WOOLARD: Right,
it was a 2005--

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.643
they used a 1990 baseline.

00:15:06.643 --> 00:15:09.830
ERNEST MONIZ: 1990 baseline,
and as we all know,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.170
they have certain
carbon advantages

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.075
in using 1990 as their baseline.

00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:15.774
JOHN WOOLARD: Right.

00:15:15.774 --> 00:15:17.440
Now you could say the
same about the US,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.970
that we never framed it as
much in terms of carbon,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.440
that we've had renewable policy
and another driving functions.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.320
Are we going to need
to do more than what

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.195
exists in law today with 111(d)
and some of the other tools?

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.570
ERNEST MONIZ:
Well, first of all,

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:37.150
I would say that we have spoken
about carbon and climate,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.349
et cetera.

00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:40.640
After all, the president
issued the climate action plan

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.870
in June 2013.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:51.120
Now, we don't have the statutory
carbon policy at this stage,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.040
so certainly in terms of the
programs we are executing,

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.940
they were not
authorized specifically

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.630
for a carbon context.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:07.730
But starting with Kyoto,
frankly, Copenhagen,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.530
and most especially, I would
say, the president's climate

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.320
action plan, it's about climate.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.060
And so it's the
other way around.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.990
It's about climate.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:23.950
And there are, by the way, many
other advantages and objectives

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.270
to be served by these programs.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.720
So whereas in the Chinese
case, there really

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.877
was no governmental statement
about a carbon issue.

00:16:35.877 --> 00:16:36.960
So again, it's a big deal.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:46.060
Now, in terms of the 111(d), et
cetera, when we model this out,

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:52.090
we are including the
30% kind of reduction

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.790
anticipated from 111(d).

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.700
We have to remember, it's
a draft rule right now.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.500
The final rule
following comments--

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.240
the comment period in fact,
is, I think just about,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.960
well, it's not quite over yet.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.250
And we hope certainly
that will be

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.940
on schedule in June of next
year to issue the final rule.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.150
But in our modeling,
et cetera, yeah, we

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.650
are incorporating
the CAFE standards.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:28.890
I remind you, the date given
was 2025 for our commitment,

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.910
and so there, we already have
a CAFE standards trajectory

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.020
to 2025, 50 plus miles
per gallon, for example,

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.140
for light duty vehicles.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.045
We have 111(d) for power plants.

00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:45.180
JOHN WOOLARD:
Primarily acting on th

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.790
the authority that
we already have.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.206
ERNEST MONIZ: Yes,
so this was all

00:17:48.206 --> 00:17:50.840
based upon authorities we have.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.640
And again, the
climate action plan

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.690
that was put out last year, the
president said, initialing it,

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.190
that look, we would love
to work with Congress

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.340
and have a statutory approach.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.550
It gives a lot more
flexibility in terms

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.170
of an economy-wide approach.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.930
But in the meantime, the
words are, we can't wait.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:16.080
And so that plan was
fundamentally as aggressive

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.370
as we could be, at least in
our thinking at that time,

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.340
using existing authorities.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.090
Now, in the
meantime, we're still

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.579
being challenged to
think of other ways

00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:29.120
that we can use
existing authorities,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.500
and we are making some progress.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.800
So basically, we throw
all that into the mix

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.750
and feel that the
announcement in Beijing

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:47.631
is kind of the stretch side of
what we can do in that context.

00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:50.500
JOHN WOOLARD: Maybe this is a
good way to move to windmills.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.044
So as you look at
how decarbonize

00:18:53.044 --> 00:18:54.460
or how to get some
of these goals,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.530
we don't have a
national RPS standard,

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.924
but we do have states, but
the more cost-effective wind

00:19:00.924 --> 00:19:02.340
and solar become,
the more they're

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.715
going to continue to
penetrate the energy supply.

00:19:05.715 --> 00:19:07.590
I guess there are two
themes to explore here.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.150
One is, what do you see in
terms of technology and cost,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.390
and the other is, what
are the challenging issues

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.480
around intermittency and
integration with renewables

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.790
that you see, and how to
think about addressing them?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.230
ERNEST MONIZ: So
first of all, in terms

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:29.810
of reaching the low
carbon objectives,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.740
we certainly have very
strong emphasis on renewables

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.020
and efficiency, but I do want
to emphasize that we do have,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.990
and really mean, in all of the
above strategy, which really

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:49.490
means that we start with
the carbon constraint.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:54.510
We are absolutely committed
to looking at a lower carbon

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.550
future.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:20:01.160
Within that, then,
we allocate resources

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.590
across the board for
approaches to lower carbon.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:10.410
So for coal, that amounts to
carbon capture, and sometimes

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.990
carbon utilization,
and certainly carbon

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:19.220
underground storage,
and nuclear as well,

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.010
and renewables and efficiency.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:28.674
In all cases, the goal
is cost reduction.

00:20:28.674 --> 00:20:30.590
In the end, that's really
what it's all about.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.900
As a reminder, all of
these terrific technologies

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.930
that are being
developed and deployed,

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.260
they don't provide fundamental
new services to people.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.422
This is not Google.

00:20:51.422 --> 00:20:52.796
JOHN WOOLARD:
[INAUDIBLE] energy.

00:20:52.796 --> 00:20:53.670
ERNEST MONIZ: Right.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.720
It's light.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.280
It's heat.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.790
It's mobility.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.260
But it's providing
them in different ways

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.260
and in cleaner ways.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.470
And that's critical.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.280
But ultimately, we've got to get
the cost down in this business.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.360
As you said, we
have seen, in some

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.200
of these areas, very
dramatic cost reductions.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.441
One you did not mention, which
is a huge story, of course,

00:21:22.441 --> 00:21:22.940
is LEDs.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.750
It wasn't very long ago, people
were talking about $50 LEDs

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:33.250
to replace a 60-watt
incandescent.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.990
And even though
that was actually

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:41.570
a life cycle good deal, because
the energy savings would

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.380
be about $130 over the lifetime
of the LED-- of course,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.480
that was not a discounted
energy savings, number one.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.780
And number two, well, it may
be a good life cycle deal.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.650
It's pretty hard to put out $50.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.560
But putting out
$5, which is kind

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.060
of where we're at least almost
at, is a whole different deal.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.810
The payback periods are
now getting below a year,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.550
and that's not even counting
the ancillary benefits

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.320
that you would see from,
for example, not having

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.990
to change the fixture
for a long time.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.460
You want to change something
up here, you need a ladder.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.690
You need all kinds of issues.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.000
And so what have we seen?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.380
We've seen a deployment go up
100x in less than three years.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.240
It's the cost reduction
and the quality, then,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.240
of what one is getting.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.750
So solar, we all
know, we have seen

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.420
very, very dramatic reductions.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:53.120
We are certainly talking
for utility-scale solar.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.640
We can be talking, all in,
certainly below $2 a watt.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.950
The holy grail has
always been $1.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.050
On the module, we're
getting very close.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:13.560
We're very close to the $0.50
per watt module that was always

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.720
dreamed of.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.750
We're having a little bit of a
harder time on the other costs,

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.530
but still for
utility-scale, we're

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.310
certainly below
$2 in most cases.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.490
That's a big deal in terms of
the ability now to penetrate.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.080
In fact-- if I may make an aside
on that-- if I go to our loan

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:39.720
program, in 2009,
the United States

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.380
had zero utility-scale
photovoltaic plants.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.320
I'm using that to mean
100 megawatts or bigger.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.340
And debt financing
in that time period

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.470
was, of course,
extremely difficult.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:01.100
The loan program from DOE
supported the first five

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.680
utility-scale projects.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.070
They all had PPAs.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.930
I mean, they're doing fine.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.490
We're now out of that business.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.200
But there are 17 other
projects going forward

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.770
with private financing.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.670
And that's exactly the
model that we want,

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.390
that we kind of
helped get going--

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.649
take some of the
early risk, but then

00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:23.065
have the private
sector take over.

00:24:23.065 --> 00:24:25.231
JOHN WOOLARD: And when you
say out of that business,

00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:27.810
you're with reference to
large utility-scale PV, not

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:28.940
the loan guarantee program.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.700
ERNEST MONIZ: No, exactly.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.658
The loan guarantee program,
we are in business.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.490
If we go there for
a second-- so we

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:41.100
have loan guarantee and
conditional commitments

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.390
of about $34 billion.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:52.330
The losses so far are about
2 and 1/4%, $780 million.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:57.930
It's interesting--
two days ago, we

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.370
announced that, just
as an amusing factoid,

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.980
that we have now collected
$810 million in interest.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.485
So we're actually in the black.

00:25:08.485 --> 00:25:09.735
JOHN WOOLARD: Congratulations.

00:25:09.735 --> 00:25:11.555
It was good to see.

00:25:11.555 --> 00:25:16.420
ERNEST MONIZ: But I don't want
that to divert our attention

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.720
from the fact that the
aim of this program

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.000
isn't to make money.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.130
The aim of the program is to get
these technologies out there.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.110
And we think a pretty damn
good job has been done there.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:32.630
We do have $40 billion
left of authorities,

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:38.370
and we will be working very hard
to use at least a very large

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.710
fraction that $40 billion
over the next two years.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.240
JOHN WOOLARD: What
categories are

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.450
interesting as you look at
how loan guarantee funds could

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.106
be used?

00:25:46.106 --> 00:25:47.480
ERNEST MONIZ:
Well, first of all,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.360
the buckets are not
at our discretion.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.202
They're in statute,
so we have $4 billion

00:25:55.202 --> 00:25:59.320
in play for renewables
and efficiency.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.870
For example, as one
example-- let me say,

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.920
we're open for business.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:14.620
But the fundamental condition is
that the project, of course it

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.510
must satisfy a reasonable
due diligence in terms

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.080
of having a future if it
gets this kind of support.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.910
But it has to also move
the technology envelope.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.630
Now, it doesn't mean it's
going to be revolutionary,

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:35.010
because that will probably test
the market viability in most

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:35.710
cases.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.390
But it's got to move
the envelope, which

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.730
is why I said for
utility-scale solar,

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.800
unless there is something new
about it, we've done five,

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.800
and now it's time for
the private sector.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.690
You ask, what's an example?

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.560
In the renewables,
in the request

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.450
for applications,
the call, one example

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.640
given that has
not been supported

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.922
and has substantial potential
is micro hydro, for example.

00:27:05.922 --> 00:27:06.880
So there could be that.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.670
It could be re-powering
existing dams, et cetera.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:18.067
Then, we have $8
billion in fossil.

00:27:18.067 --> 00:27:19.650
JOHN WOOLARD: And
when you say fossil,

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.869
that's with sequestration
or something novel or new?

00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:23.410
ERNEST MONIZ: Could
be sequestration,

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.730
but it could be a new kind
of combined heat and power,

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.060
for example.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.370
So it's anything using fossil.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:42.960
It could be utilizing currently
vented resources like methane

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.210
and putting those
to beneficial use.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.110
So it's anything that reduces
greenhouse gas emissions

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:53.260
and has some novelty in
pushing the envelope.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:59.360
Then, we have $16 billion for
the Advanced Technology Vehicle

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.290
Program.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:04.210
This is the one that loaned the
roughly half billion to Tesla

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.160
and was repaid, I think, 19
years early or something.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:14.470
And there, in the future,
we've made it very clear

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:21.010
that auto suppliers,
being in the supply chain

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.230
for the future
efficient vehicles,

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.080
would be a very
interesting area.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.420
And we've said, hey, open for
business, open for business.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.950
And the fourth area is nuclear
energy, where, again, we

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.510
have had one loan to get the
first so-called Generation

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:45.360
III-plus reactors to help
them get in that project.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.150
JOHN WOOLARD: That's
the Vogtle plant?

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.950
ERNEST MONIZ: That's the
Vogtle plant in Georgia,

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.200
with Westinghouse
AP1000 reactors.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.690
But maybe there
could be something

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:00.380
on modular reactors,
our new fuel that

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.585
gives greater efficiency.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.710
It's a very, very broad call.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.310
JOHN WOOLARD: When you look
at nuclear, what do you think,

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.460
as you look forward, about
new technologies versus maybe

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.130
the Gen III-plus?

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.150
But then, you move into
Gen IV and even fusion.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.680
How should we think about how
those could play in the mix,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.830
and when those types
of technologies

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.016
could have access to funding?

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:28.060
ERNEST MONIZ:
Anything nuclear is

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.710
going to take a long
time to-- it's not

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:35.510
an area that changes quickly,
and for obvious reasons,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.620
and a strong regulatory
process, et cetera.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.970
So the Generation
III-plus, there

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.360
are reactors being built
elsewhere, including China,

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.890
but now we have
four of those being

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.730
built in the United States.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.880
And they have been
certified by the NRC,

00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.540
as has more recently-- a GE
advanced boiling water reactor

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.030
design has also now been
certified by the NRC.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.470
I think the big
issue there-- I've

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.190
said it all along--
we go back to cost.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.630
Will these new reactors in
Georgia and South Carolina

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:17.790
be built on at least reasonably
close to cost and schedule?

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.680
That'll have a huge impact.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:27.850
As far as new technologies go,
probably the new technology--

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.110
and it's new only
in one sense-- that

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:37.580
is most near the marketplace
are small modular reactors.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.170
We are providing some
assistance, for example,

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.370
to a 50 megawatt type reactor.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.135
But even there--

00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:46.870
JOHN WOOLARD: But it's still
a pressurized light water.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.320
ERNEST MONIZ: It's still a
light water reactor, exactly.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.500
And it's precisely because,
if you take too big a step,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.660
you have a real
regulatory challenge.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.710
They do have different
features, integral design,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.580
very good safety features.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.262
The question is,
what will they cost?

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:05.720
And our view is,
we don't know what

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.770
they will cost until we
start building a couple.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.750
So we are hoping
the first couple

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:17.270
will come online in roughly
the 2022 time period.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:21.830
So a decade from now,
and then we'll see.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.170
JOHN WOOLARD: If anybody has
questions before we run out

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.586
of time, there's
a mic back there.

00:31:25.586 --> 00:31:27.580
You can just stand up,
and let's open it up.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.000
But while people are
queueing up, and if not,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.410
I've got a few that
were submitted earlier

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.100
from the Dory.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.400
How do you think about--
one last nuclear question.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.480
Everything feels like it's
by necessity incremental.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.050
If you had something a little
more, not even radically,

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.790
disruptive, but a thorium-based
molten salt, something

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.170
that was a different
approach, what's

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.160
the path between where things
are today and commercialization

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.590
for something that's a
little more out of the box?

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.100
ERNEST MONIZ:
Well, I think there

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.750
are a number of very
interesting technologies,

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:08.190
but as I say, taking
that in the nuclear realm

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:13.380
through the testing, the
licensing, et cetera stage,

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.310
it's expensive.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.330
To be honest, I would
be surprised to see

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.900
a kind of a big
leap in technology,

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.990
actually in kind of a
commercial deployment phase.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.410
2030 would be pretty--

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.410
JOHN WOOLARD: Realistic.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:33.940
ERNEST MONIZ: --ambitious.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.120
Realistic, ambitious.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.930
Right.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.860
We'll see.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.740
Again, the smaller reactors,
including-- by the way,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.430
there are some, as we know--
Bill Gates, for example,

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:51.080
is very interested in a
very new design reactor.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.290
The Chinese have a demonstration
of a high temperature gas

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:55.890
reactor, which,
of course, we used

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.330
to have one in
the United States,

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.160
and that didn't
work out too well.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.250
Some of those, maybe
those could move back

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.680
into the decade time scale.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.370
But I think to see anything
before a decade deployed is

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.440
just not realistic in
the nuclear business.

00:33:18.757 --> 00:33:20.590
JOHN WOOLARD: I've got
a couple of questions

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.910
that had come in online.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.020
And once again, feel free.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.900
If anybody has questions,
the mic's up there.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.462
Actually, most of them
we've covered, I believe.

00:33:31.462 --> 00:33:33.045
This one's an interesting angle.

00:33:33.045 --> 00:33:34.920
I'm going to re-ask you
the thorium question.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.260
"So as weapons diminish
as the central focus

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.520
of American nuclear policy,
will we investigate thorium

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.010
fuel reactors as a
proliferation-resistant,

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:47.306
carbon-free, waste-minimizing
source of energy?"

00:33:47.306 --> 00:33:48.680
ERNEST MONIZ:
Well, first of all,

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.785
we have, of course,
researched thorium reactors.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.490
I think one of the issues
with thorium reactors

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.780
that is often not
mentioned is, you

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.801
do need to go into
a recycling economy,

00:34:04.801 --> 00:34:06.300
if you want to do
a thorium reactor.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.350
Thorium is not a
fissile material.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.900
So what a thorium reactor
is really fissioning

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:19.070
is Uranium-233, which
you breed, and then, you

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.120
have to go through a recycling.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.600
If you have a pure
U-233, that is not

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.600
very proliferation-resistant.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.710
So there are ways of addressing
that, called Radkowsky cycles,

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:34.949
for example.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:38.350
Without going through a whole
big deal about Radkowsky

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:42.679
cycles, let's just say
that it does accomplish

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:48.110
the goal of having uranium
that is not viewed as a weapon

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.290
material present at any
time in the fuel cycle.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.980
However, the price you pay is
you have introduced plutonium

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.260
back into the system.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.810
Not as much as with current
reactors, but it's there.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.490
I think there are some
interesting features of thorium

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.010
reactors, but it does
require recycling,

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.166
and right now, I would
again say, don't count on

00:35:13.166 --> 00:35:15.245
that in the next decade.

00:35:15.245 --> 00:35:18.321
JOHN WOOLARD: I think
we had a question.

00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:20.900
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you, Secretary Moniz,

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.150
for coming and speaking to us.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.960
I actually have two questions.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:29.270
I was wondering
about-- early on, I

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.320
think, the Department of Energy
or the predecessor sponsored

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.225
a lot of test
nuclear reactors that

00:35:34.225 --> 00:35:36.600
could test some of the concepts
like you were describing,

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.433
the thorium reactor.

00:35:37.433 --> 00:35:40.830
Or another concept that I've
heard a lot of press about

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.660
was these trans-- I think it's
called transuranic processing

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.420
life cycle reactors
that could actually

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.940
burn some of the nuclear wastes
that are very problematic.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.580
And if I could ask
another question,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.480
earlier today, there
was a news report

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.610
about how Russia is
starting to step away

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:02.515
from some of the
nonproliferation partnerships

00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:04.690
that the United States
has had, and which

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:07.590
have been very successful.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.260
If you have any
comments on that,

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.790
that'd be very interesting.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.425
Thank you.

00:36:11.425 --> 00:36:14.800
ERNEST MONIZ: OK,
so on the first one,

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.800
what's being referred to for
the non-nuclear aficionados

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:33.530
is that when you burn up the
fuel in a nuclear power plant,

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.040
you produce plutonium.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.010
The plutonium, of
course, can be--

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.830
and I'm not going to get into
the nonproliferation issues--

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.750
but certainly from an
energy perspective,

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:51.810
the plutonium can be recycled
and reused in the reactor.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:59.000
However, those who do that, for
example, the French-- in doing

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.840
that, the transuranic
elements other than plutonium

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.660
are put into the waste stream.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.370
Neptunium and americium
and curium, et cetera.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:23.260
They are also very
long-lived and still

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:28.480
contribute to a waste stream
that has the millennia time

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.940
scale as opposed to
the century time scale.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:35.980
So the idea is, instead,
put all of those elements

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:42.020
back into the fuel and
burn them in a reactor that

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.250
has a fast neutron spectrum.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:53.400
Again, no law of physics
is violated in doing that.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:38:00.990
However, it is tough, and
there are some real issues

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.570
if you want to do that,
in terms of the inventory

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.105
you build up within the
reactors, et cetera.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:15.930
I think that has some attraction
as kind of a nuclear waste

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:23.560
holy grail, but again, don't
even think about 2030 for that.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.430
It's farther downstream.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.780
And there's a huge
R&amp;D program needed.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.440
It'd be very expensive.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.180
Frankly, other
than paper studies,

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.070
we don't have a lot
going on on that today.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:42.440
On the second issue with
Russia, for obvious reasons,

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:47.250
we have a difficult
relationship at the moment.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:59.230
Statements have been made that
our cooperation on securing

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:04.930
nuclear materials will
not go on past 2014.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:08.510
That's a little bit too stark.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.730
First of all, a
statement has been

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:16.060
made that we would
continue to cooperate

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:21.692
in removing nuclear
materials from 30 countries.

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.150
I think I mentioned
earlier that we

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:28.050
have worked, in fact, together
to do that to remove fuel

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.530
from third countries,
for example.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.550
And the fuel, the
high-enriched uranium,

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.130
goes back to either the
United States or Russia,

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.830
typically, the country
from which it first came.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:48.600
So for example, last year,
we did that from Vietnam,

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.590
for example-- moved all the
HEU out from Vietnam together.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.840
And it went to Russia.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.220
So those opportunities,
as they arise,

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.910
are clearly in our
mutual interest,

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.550
and we expect to
keep doing that.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.620
With regard to other
programs, especially those

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:14.580
taking place within Russia,
we have a dialogue continuing.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.340
It's clear that the
cooperation will not

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.350
be at the level it
was, following 2014.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.400
But I do believe on
a case-by-case basis,

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.260
as we see important
programs of mutual interest,

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.220
I think there's still
a good possibility

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.560
that we can move forward.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.422
But it's a different dialogue,
let's face it, at the moment.

00:40:35.422 --> 00:40:37.350
JOHN WOOLARD: So given
those challenges,

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:42.630
as you look at how to find
large, single-source, or large,

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.580
dispatchable power plants
that are zero carbon

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.680
and for the next 20 years, do
you tend to put more of a heavy

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.530
focus on things like coal or
natural gas with sequestration

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:56.409
as a more viable,
nearer-to-mid-term path?

00:40:56.409 --> 00:40:58.700
Or do you still think we
should be building up nuclear?

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.120
Do we need to build
up sort of a nuclear,

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.140
given just conventional or
today's existing technologies?

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.650
ERNEST MONIZ: Our view
is that, first of all,

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:15.690
our job really is to
help the marketplace--

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:19.620
policymakers,
regulators, investors--

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.600
understand what the options are.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.540
And to understand
them means not only

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.780
to get invested in the earlier
stage, technology developments,

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.350
but to help in the deployment
of these technologies, which

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.100
has played a big role also in
part of the cost reduction.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:46.140
The way I come at it
is, it's not up to us

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:51.440
to dictate a market
share, that ultimately, we

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:57.200
want the marketplace to make the
low carbon choices, of course,

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.920
in the context of a
carbon policy that

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.712
has to be established.

00:42:02.712 --> 00:42:04.170
JOHN WOOLARD: But
you can encourage

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.160
R&amp;D in various categories?

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.870
ERNEST MONIZ: So the R&amp;D, we are
carrying out across the board.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.120
We really are.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:19.570
The R&amp;D, the loan program--
these are all across the board.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.750
And one of the important
points, I think,

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.650
which is not emphasized
often enough,

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:28.970
is that there is no one
low carbon solution.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.060
Different countries
and different parts

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.260
of our own country are going
to have different low carbon

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.790
solutions, depending
upon resource

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.800
mix in that part of
the country, frankly,

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.050
depending upon
regulatory structure.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:47.060
For example, it's no accident
that the four new nuclear power

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.010
plants being built
are in the southeast.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.110
It's largely because of
the regulatory structure.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:57.630
So we're just going to
see different mixes,

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:02.740
and we feel our job is to help
prepare the grounds so that all

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:07.720
of these technologies and
their cost and performance

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.675
characteristics are understood
as well as possible.

00:43:11.675 --> 00:43:13.430
JOHN WOOLARD: Well,
we appreciate your--

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.460
ERNEST MONIZ: And,
of course, also work

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.240
on the enabling technologies.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.430
You mentioned earlier--
I didn't go to it.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:26.910
For example, you
mentioned large deployment

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:30.000
of variable resources,
wind and solar.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.370
Clearly, storage
is very important.

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:34.470
Clearly, what we
do with the grid,

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:40.670
both high voltage grid, smart
grid, distribution systems,

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.550
distributed energy,
distributed storage--

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:48.110
those are all areas that we
are advancing, and I might say,

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.970
in the technology space.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.970
But also in trying
to provide analytics,

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.590
because a lot of these
things I mentioned--

00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:04.430
let's say storage or
end-use efficiency.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:10.210
How those are valued
in a rate structure

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:13.945
is not exactly in great
shape at the moment.

00:44:13.945 --> 00:44:16.570
JOHN WOOLARD: So you're going to
enter the rate-making business

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.520
with the PUCs.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.660
ERNEST MONIZ: Yeah.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.090
We don't do that,
but we can provide

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.330
analysis and
technical assistance,

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.240
et cetera, capacity markets.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.850
So we know, huge
fight's going on.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:34.660
Net metering, I
mean, you've got it.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.750
So we are in a
transition period.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.370
Transition periods
are always challenging

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.205
for a variety of
newcomers and incumbents.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.770
A new set of rules is used.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:53.160
Look, to take the most
simple example, kind

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:57.490
of an historical approach to
retail electricity prices,

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.370
based upon-- I'll
exaggerate slightly

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.840
--putting everything on
a kilowatt hour basis.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.980
It may have been
fine at one time.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.580
If we talk now about
a dramatically changed

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.280
architecture of
the system, we're

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.300
going to have to go to where the
actual services being provided

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.370
are costed appropriately.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.510
And, let's face it, we
have not figured that out.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:29.440
And again, it's a hodgepodge in
different parts of the country.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.260
We have a big transformation
to a low carbon

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.430
future that we are
trying to accelerate,

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:39.170
and doing that has got
challenges in business models,

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.750
in technology, and
regulation across the board.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.270
And we're trying to take
a big picture view of this

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.010
and see if we can move it along.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.260
JOHN WOOLARD: We need somebody
with a big picture view

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.700
because right now, we're getting
a lot of flawed incentive

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.120
structures out there, and
it's a little bit of a mess.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.260
Thanks for your time today.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.050
We really appreciate it.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:56.780
ERNEST MONIZ: I appreciate it.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.946
JOHN WOOLARD: If everybody
can give him a warm hand.

00:45:58.946 --> 00:46:01.240
