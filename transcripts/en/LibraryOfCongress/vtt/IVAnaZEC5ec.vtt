00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.930
&gt;&gt; Good Afternoon.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.230
My name is Georgette Dorn.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.950
I'm the Chief of the
Hispanic Division.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.250
It is a great pleasure to
welcome Luis Alberto Ambroggio

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.080
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.590
But first of all I
would like to make sure

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.930
that you close your cell phones.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.700
So we don't-- we're not disturbed.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.090
And then I want to thank
Talía Guzman Gonzalez

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.910
for having organized this event.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.130
And Catalina Gomez for having
produced this beautiful flyer.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.220
Luis Alberto Ambroggio
is a poet and essayist.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.150
A member of the North American
Academy of the Spanish Language.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.330
And a great friend of
the Library of Congress.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.040
In discussions will be
doctor Enrique Pumar.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.360
Who is a sociologist, a professor
at Catholic University of America.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.490
And a contributor to the handbook
of Latin American Studies.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.990
And Carmen Benito-Vessels, who
is a professor of literature

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.610
at the University of Maryland.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.000
Thank you.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.540
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.840
My name is Enrique Pumar.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.550
And I am the Chair of the Sociology
Department at Catholic University.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.450
And also a contributing
editor to the handbook.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.350
It is always a pleasure to be
invited to the Library of Congress.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.210
And especially to be invited
by Georgette and her team

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.400
in the Hispanic division.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.490
It's truly an honor to be here.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.890
And especially on this
occasion when we have to--

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.230
we have an opportunity to
discuss such an important book.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.880
So my role here today is to
offer some introductory remarks.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.640
I am the warm up act for the main,
you know, for the main attraction.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.600
And that should take very briefly.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.860
I wrote some remarks just
to sound more organized

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.160
than what I usually are.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.940
So I hope you don't
mind if I read them.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.930
The recent publication of
"Estados Unidos Hispanos"

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.270
by Luis Alberto Ambroggio.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.590
Constitute a significant
development in the sociology

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.730
of knowledge of Hispanic Studies.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.950
According to Carma Hein,
"Historical conditions give meaning

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.760
to particular manifestations
of knowledge production".

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.830
In his words, every epoch has
its fundamental neo-approach.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.780
And it's characteristics--
characteristic point of view.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.470
And consequently sees the same
object in new perspectives.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.960
Following this parsimonial
observation, one can conclude

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.350
that the growing number
of self-identified.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.480
Hispanic residents in the
United States and the density

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.350
of migration flow in
the last decades.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.050
Are the ecological conditions
primarily responsible

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.580
for the abundant and often
contentious literature.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.780
Revealing the own forces--
the forces behind the growth,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.400
the impact in corporation
dispersion.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.320
And composition of the
Hispanic community.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.030
Today about 54 million
Hispanics or 17%

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.180
of the population call
the United States home.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.670
If demographers are
correct or trusted at all.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.840
This figure is expected to
rise to about 31% in 2016.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.870
It is no wonder that even as candid
literature review of the term

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.410
"Hispanic Studies" would
yield 1,000's of entries.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.400
Despite the volume and
depth of the field.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.190
Alberto Ambroggio's contributions

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.340
in his latest book are
noteworthy in many respects.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.770
First, after conducting an
exhaustive historical research

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.070
Ambroggio [audio glitch].

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.820
That Hispanics and Hispanic culture
have marked a constant presence

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.150
in American Society.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.220
And were major protagonists
in the formation

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.840
and development of this nation.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.080
Reaching this conclusion is
not a small accomplishment.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.590
When one considers the
neglect and careless narrative

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.150
that so much characterized
the pro's of well-known,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.060
mainstream American historians.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.400 position:56%
On this point, however,
Ambroggio's book is in good company.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.750 position:56%
Many other scholars for example, Ray
Suarez have also documented these--

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.700
the indispensability of
this marginalized history.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.960
Second, unlike many of his
contemporaries however,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.920
Ambroggio investigates the presence

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.670
of Hispanic culture
one step further.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.660
When he documents how
meaningful our world was--

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.890
our world was regarded by
such key American figures.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.320
As Jefferson and even Walk Whitman.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.140
Already in 1790, the statesman from
Virginia was reading "Don Quixote".

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.240
And few indispensable exposition
of the Hispanic historiography.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.030
Third, we learn also that
the exile condition far

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.140
from being restraining is
a source of inspiration.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.550
And unleashes the copious
cultural production

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.900
of many intellectuals in exile.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.230
The literature and the literary and
artistic repertoires of this group.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.160 position:56%
By that I mean the Hispanic refugees

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.550
or exile community are too
numerous to summarize here.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.410
But who can forget the resilience

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.560
with which Jose Maria Heredia
turned nostalgia and adversities

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.890
into the pedigree of his-- life.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.990
Or the voluminous work
of Garcia Lorca

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.950
after his brief residence
in New York City.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.700
In 2000, the New York Times--

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:36.890
a New York Times article about the
work and-- life of Garcia Lorca.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:44.590 position:56%
Concluded that the poet went back to
Spain "A changed man" in quotation.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.860
Fourth, the evidence presented

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.310 position:56%
in this book leads even the casual
reader to one unsettling conclusion.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.180
The cultural production in
exile constitute the filler

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.070
of our own national identity.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.270
Consider for instance the
work of Faustino Sarmiento

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.850
or even more recently, Octavio Paz.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.810
What would they have
said about who we are

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.190
without confronting the other?

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.840
The concluding feature
that one draws

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.130
from the 5 chapters
that organize this book.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.520
Is a dynamic-- is a dynamic,
cosmopolitan community

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.830
who embraces diversity
and celebrates creativity.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.810
And it's in constant
co-existence with others in exile.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.610
As Richard Sennett, a very
prominent sociologist would say.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.680
"The trajectory of Hispanic culture
in American amount to nothing more

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.750
than a fine illustration
of the uses of disorder".

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.270
Luis Alberto amply stipulates,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.610
"Las estadísticas aquí utilizadas
de diversos años y décadas pasadas

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.070
se actualizan.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.940
Con una progresión ilusionante.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.740
Nuestra rica historia y realidad
se consolida positivamente".

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.110
In sum, one can only
hope that pundits

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.530
and policy makers do not overlook
the lessons this well researched

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.460
and encyclopedic book
so fondly brings us.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.800
Immigrant communities bring life,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.140
cultural life to the
experiment that we call America.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.510
Thank you very much.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.500
[ Applause ]

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.510
&gt;&gt; The beautiful part
of our community is

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.260
that you will learn
many different accents.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.690
So this is the Argentinian accent,
the one that I'm going to use.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.190
And I will be bilingual.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.470
My presentation as the
book is in Spanish.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.320
But I will try to translate.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.030
How many of you here
speak only English?

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.240
So, okay. So I will
try to do my best.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.210
Thank you so much Enrique
for the presentation.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:07.870
And what I will do now is offer
you a power point sharing some

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.250
of these great discoveries
that I had when I came here.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.400
I came here in 1967.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.470
The following year, I was

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.920
on the leadership program
for the United Nations.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.830
And I had to do my
internship at the White House

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.630
under the first year
of President Nixon.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:33.170
And as I tell in the book,
at that point in time,

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.010
some of the fellow
White House staffers.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.950
When they met me and I--
they would say, "Well Luis,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.500
you have to really learn English
and talk in English and so on".

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.990
And I would tell them, "Well
listen, I am doing that with you

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.120
but you better learn Spanish".

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.820
And a few of those guys
who survived me now,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.430
they are in the mid 80's or so.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.360
When they see they said, "Oh
Luis, you were so right".

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.000
Okay, anyways how many of you
do not understand English?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.480
Do I need to translate that?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.780
&gt;&gt; Spanish.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.480
&gt;&gt; No, no English so that I
can translate it into Spanish.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480
No, everybody understood
what I said?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.860
With my accent and everything?

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:20.370
Great. Okay, then I will start
my power point presentation.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.890
And this is the-- obviously
the cover of the book

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.190
which is out there for sale.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.730
And I will be glad to sign it.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.920
And okay, let's go to the next.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.030
Now, you know, our history--

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.720
Hispanic history in
the US is amazing.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.180
Our-- the first people that
came over here, Ponce de Leon.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.300
Was with different
expeditions in 1513.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.410
So that's about a century
before the pilgrims.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.690 position:56%
And not only that, there are
certain things that are unbelievable

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.360
because there were expeditions.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.800
And not only expeditions,
actual settlements

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.360
in different parts of the US.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.830
Like Ponce de Leon will go from
Florida all the way up north.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.600
They went to Missouri, Mississippi.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.930
They went west to many
different states.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:25.480
And for instance, I found out that
the Jesuits placed some missions

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.970
in Virginia.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:32.770
It is there, very, very small
letters in that paragraph.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.180
By the way these are paragraphs
taken from my book of the history.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.860
So you have all kinds
of dates and so on.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.060
And this is what the
book is all about.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.850
Statistics, dates and
funny stories that some

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.140
of them I will share with you.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.180
The picture which is on the
book is Gaspar de Villagrá.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.550
Gaspar de Villagrá wasn't Spanish.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.850
He was an American.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.190
He was born in Mexico.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.280
But he was a lawyer.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.460
In fact he was the one who
led the first whatever--

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.140
court, lawsuit or claim.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.390
He wrote also-- he
was a poet as well.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:22.870
And in 1598 on the expedition
with Juan Oñate in Nuevo Mexico.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.400
He wrote his book of poetry.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:37.140
I will read for you a
paragraph in English

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:44.880
of someone referring to his book.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.590
He says-- and this is F.W. Hodge.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.990
This "what works about the poem"--

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.790
this is "Historia de
la Nueva Mexico".

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.850
That was published in 1610.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.040
By the way, he studied
law in Salamanca.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.760
Even though he was
born here in Mexico.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.710
He says, "What works about
the poem is the disclosure

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.150
of competing claims in the
epic structure of intent.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.060
And epic celebrates,
exploits intelligence

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.690
and courage of the protagonist.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:24.190
But to do so it also requires
honoring the antagonist.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.000
The Homeric Greek epic for
example celebrates conquest.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.850
And yet it dramatizes
the agony of warfare.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.710
Making heroes of both the
victor and the vanquished.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:42.210
And creates this equal measure
in order to immortalize Greece.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.900
Or in the case of Villagrá, Spain
yet it seems to me that Villagrá

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.780
in some strange and I
think unintended way.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.680 position:56%
Immortalizes not Spain but America".

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.170
Okay, enough.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.580
I don't have too much time.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.030
I'd like to leave time for us to
engage on a dialogue, un coloquio,

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:09.150
discutir un poco así
que voy a ir rápido.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:14.060
Okay. See in our actual territories
the US you see all of the states

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.230
that were either Spanish
or Mexican and so

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.520
on even after the independence.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.620
So you have there for instance,
Alabama Spanish until 1783.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:32.960
Arizona until 1821 and Mexican
until 1848 and so on and so forth.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.800
Quite a number of the states that
actually form the US, our US,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.590
were Spanish-- Hispanic I will say.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.560
So either Mexican or Spanish.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.250
By the way, as I said all of these
are paragraphs from the book.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:55.810
So and I even you know as I
said as a prophecy in 1775.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:00.450
The congress, continental
congress following Thomas

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.370
Jefferson' suggestions.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:08.070
They rejected the British
pound, the sterling pound.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.940 position:56%
And they adopted the Spanish dollar.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.970
In fact, the sign of
dollar is from the--

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:24.420
Imperial logo of arms
with a logo of plus ultra.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.100
And it's amazing, I
mean, I played this game.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.580 position:56%
I said, "Well pull out a dollar from
your pocket and see who signs it".

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.440
Usually it will be a Hispanic name.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.390
Let me see, I will pull one just
to make sure that I am correct.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.290
And if it not-- let's
see this is $1.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.960
And who signs it?

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:52.890
Rios. So it's one of those
whatever, do I have it here?

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.450
Yeah, Rosa or Mateo Rios.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.960
Okay, let's go to the next one.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.350
Now, another interesting
fact is you know

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.300
who placed the actual foundational
stone on the White House?

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.710
And I will say, well
usually you need to ask one

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.000
of the presidential candidates
and they will name the name.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.460
Because it happened to be a
Hispanic immigrant, Pedro Casanave.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.050
He came from Navarre,
Spain and he worked

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.390
like we all immigrants
usually do and work hard.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.540
He was a real estate agent

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.520
and became the fifth
mayor of Georgetown.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:40.450
Which was the oldest part
before Washington was created.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:45.020 position:56%
And he placed the foundational stone
on the White House or the key stone.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.890
I don't know how you
say that in English.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.280
La piedra-- la-- the
key stone, right?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.380
Key stone on the White House.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.660
That time it was called
the president's house.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.560
And he selected a really
interesting date.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.410
The 12th of October of 1792.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.190
And that is the reason
why we are called--

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:15.500
our capital is called Washington
DC, District of Columbia.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.030
Okay that's one.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:23.260
Like that there are many,
many anecdotes both personal

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.930
and I will share some of those.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:30.580
As we all historical that are not
well known or not known at all.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.260
Okay, one of my discoveries
was amazing.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.350
It's the fact that our creator,

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.970
Thomas Jefferson not
only he knew Spanish.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.850
But he obligated his
daughters as well

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.400
as all the relatives
to learn Spanish.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.270
See, this is Peter Carr, he
sent him this letter in 1787.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.630
See it's in Spanish and in English.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.440
You can read the English there.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.380
"Español, préstale mucha atención.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.230
Y procura adquirir un
conocimiento exacto del mismo.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.990
Nuestras relaciones venideras con
España y la América Hispánica harán

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.910
que la adquisición de este
idioma sea muy valiosa.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:17.430
La historia antigua de esa parte
de América también se ha escrito en

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.730
ese idioma.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.190
Te envió un diccionario".

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.920
He always-- siempre hacia eso.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.220
He always did that.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.620
Either sent a grammar or
a dictionary or a Quixote.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:35.160
See this is probably too
small but here is the letter

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:42.290
to Mary Jefferson Eppes
which was the youngest one.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.100
He writes to her aunt.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.930
Said, "I have insisted of her here.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.990
I have insisted on her
reading 10 pages a day

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.330
in her Spanish "Don Quixote".

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.900
And getting a lesson in
her Spanish grammar".

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.220
And he seems to be,
he was very insistent.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.130
O sea Jefferson aparentemente
insistía totalmente porque en

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.430
sus cartas.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:12.660
En el capítulo relacionado con esto
en el libro pues hay muchas citas.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.760
Insistía tremendamente en eso.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.900
Tal es así que la hija,
Mary wrote him back.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.570
And said, "Dad, I finished
Reading "Don Quixote".

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.660
Now I am starting to read
Lazarillo de Tormes".

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:35.260
Another classical novel in
Spain and the Spanish world.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.560
Not only that.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.960
That was a novel that was forbidden
by the inquisition as well.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.770
Anyway, so-- and not only that.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:48.670
For instance, I mentioned
before his nephew Peter Carr.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:54.830
Over there he is sending a
dictionary Ingles-Español

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.130
de Baretti.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.370
And then also grammar and
other books in Spanish.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:04.990
And I like to-- I like to emphasize
the second paragraph which he says.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.300
"Cuando llegues a ser
un hombre público,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.740
político tendrás oportunidad
de utilizarlo.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.710 position:56%
Y las circunstancias de poseer tal
idioma podría darte una situación de

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.980
preferencia frente
a otros candidatos".

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.950
Hello-- what?

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.210
That's, you know, it's amazing.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.510
I don't know.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.280
Is he our founder, our creator,
our-- amazing, amazing, amazing.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.730
Okay, I could keep on going
but you can read the book.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.750
Then, Walt Whitman.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.500
Walt Whitman when he was
young he was in favor

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.410
of the Mexican war in 1848.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.320
But then he changed totally
his mind and his attitude.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.340
And he wrote this when they invited
him to celebrate the anniversary

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.700
of the foundation of Santa Fe.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.460
And look what visionary
declarations he made there.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.830
I don't know whether I have
it in English in the book.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.410
I think I may have.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.580
But let me see, oh yeah.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.880
Let me see.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.260
No, it's not translated
into English yet.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.460 position:56%
But basically what he says there es.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.020 position:56%
"El carácter hispano le va a proveer
algunas de las partes más necesarias

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.800 position:56%
a esta compleja identidad Americana.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.380
Ningún origen muestra una mirada
retrospectiva más grandiosa,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.510
más grandiosa en términos
de religiosidad y lealtad.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.860
De patriotismo, valentía,
decoro, gravedad y honor.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.060
The Hispanic carácter will
provide one of the most important,

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.660
necessary elements to this
complex American identity.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:53.840
No other origin shows such a
retrospective vision bigger.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.130
Bigger in terms of
religiosity and loyalty.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.590
Patriotism, courage and so on."

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.590
So this is our poetic icon.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:10.480
So these are discoveries that I
have really discovered myself.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.160
When I came here, I never-- okay.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:21.680
Then, the book, the 5th
chapter of the book deals

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.480
with the literature,
Hispanic literature.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.590
This is literature written
in Spanish in the US.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.190
Which starts in 1522.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.570
The first book published,
written in this area

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:45.780
by Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca was
published in Spain in 1542.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.400
But it deals with--
and it was written

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:55.330
through his mission in
Nuevo Mexico in 1539.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:59.330
And then in the poetic gender--
and this book by the way.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.880
Deals not only with
the prose novels,

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.130
also theatre and essays and so on.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:17.860
The poetic gender is led by
Bartolome de Flores in 1571.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:23.950
And he published this
book in Sevilla.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.490
And probably written in Florida.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:33.250
And the other person that wrote
the famous poem Florida was Fray

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.070
Gregorio de Escobedo.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:41.200
Who wrote that poem between
1583 thru 15-- probably 89.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.370
Even though it was
published in Spain

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:48.430
in the beginning of the 1600's.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:53.670
Amazing, this I cannot translate
except for the first one.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:24:04.460 position:56%
These poems were written in mid-18--
19-- 1800's o sea 1850, 1850's.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.910
Look at the type of topic.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.740
In this book I point out
to many topics that are

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.110
so current, it's amazing.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.320
Here for instance,
the first one says.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.620
"Hermoso idioma Español.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.400
Que te quieren prohibir.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.410
Yo creo que no hay razón
que tu dejes de existir.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.480
Beautiful Spanish language.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.030
They want to forbid you.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.240
I don't think there is any
reason for you not to exist".

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.100
You know, and here we-- have
English only and this and that.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:42.780
Now, the second one is interesting
from the point view of Spanglish.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.310
Obviously for English speaking
people probably this is not

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.610
so important.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:54.630
But in Spanish, the mixture of the
languages is such that you know.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:59.170
If you don't use the correct
word-- I can tell a personal story.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.130
I translated and published
Robert Pinsky's "Selected Poems."

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.950
He was the poet laureate.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.150
And he insisted in
reading the poem in Spanish

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.630
on some of the presentations.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.570 position:56%
I said, "No listen, let me read it".

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.390
Because if you don't put
the right accent or the--

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:20.170
pronounce the ñ. You know
the words change totally,

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.100
the sense of the word.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.570 position:56%
Year for instance in Spanish is año.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:31.950
If you don't pronounce the ñ,
it's a totally different word.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:37.330
And I will not say it because
they are videotaping this.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.140
So it's interesting that that poem

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.560
and if somebody is
willing to translate that.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.960
Because I don't know
how to do it, it says.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.960
"Conocía en California
una paisana muy bella.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.430
De 18 primaveras educada
en una Americana escuela.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:58.730
Ingresaba algunas frases que
olían a gringo a la legua.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.970
Con frecuencia se le oía
llamar al cesto, basqueta.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.360
Cuenta las cuadras por bloques.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.760
A un cerco decirle fensa.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.630
Al café llamarlo cofe.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.930
A los mercados, marqueta.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.970
Al bodegón, groceria".

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.190
Now, I won't translate
the whole poem.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.480
But grocery obviously in English.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.690
I mean, I'm going grocery
shopping and so on.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:30.100
In Spanish it means-- what would be
the best translation for groceria?

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.400
&gt;&gt; Bad word.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.700
&gt;&gt; Rudeness.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.540
&gt;&gt; Rudeness.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.880
Ugly. Everything totally
different from grocery shopping.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:48.210
Okay. This is a first-- we have
the first Hispanic poet laureate

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.110
in the US, Juan Felipe Herrera.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.110
By the way, all these pictures
are in the book as well.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:58.680
And obviously we have
the first court--

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.550
Supreme Court judge is
Hispanic, Sonia Sotomayor.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.430 position:56%
And I bring this up because the book
is full of these firsts and so on.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.290
First senator, congressman,
this whoever.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.470
Just to document our history.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.470
And our future is really,
really great.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:26.140
And basically I just want to
point out with Silvia Puente.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.390
The idea is not the
Hispanic, the US.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.170
Here I am emphasizing that
but the idea is the we.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.060
We, as part of the US.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.640
This is not like the
language that we speak.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.690
Our Spanish is not from--
of Spain or of Mexico.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.020
It's our Spanish, our
US Spanish language.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.580
And we are US Hispanics.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.640
We are not Mexicans or whatever.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.130
In fact, I will tell you a
story from my family album.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.310
My middle son, Javier,
he's the genius type.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:11.210
And when he was 22, he got a
doctorate PhD in Biophysics

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.190
from the University of Cal Tech.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:19.250
Anyways, when he was 5 years
old, I went to the director

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.770
of the primary school that was
about 2 blocks from our house.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:28.210
I knew him because we both
coached soccer for the kids.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:33.880
So I told him, "Listen, if Javier
goes there to kindergarten.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.820
He will make life miserable
for everyone else.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.100
Because he gets bored and starts
doing all kinds of things."

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.020
And he said, "Okay Luis,
don't worry about it.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.780
Just bring him over.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.250
He will take a test
for half an hour.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.270
And if he passes this, he
goes straight to first grade".

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.570
I said, "Great".

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.870
So I bring Javier.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.440
5 minutes, the test is over.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.740
He passes.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.640
Okay, my oldest son had been
going to that primary school

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.830
for 5 years prior,
never heard a word.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.330
Now the second day
Javier was in school,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.580
Fred Cook, he calls me at work.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.490
And said, "Luis, I have
Javier here in my office".

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.790
I said, "Oh my goodness!"

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.090
And he was laughing.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.150
Said, "He must have done
something really bad for them

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.490
to bring him to your office".

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.090
And he was, "Yeah, so on--
" "Well, what did he do?"

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.140
He said, "No, you better
talk to him".

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.780
I said, "But give me a
clue or something so-- ".

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.080
"No, that's fine.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.150
It's better for you to
talk" and he was laughing.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.820
And I said, "Well you know,
Luis was there for 5 years.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.490 position:56%
Never they took him to your office".

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.790
"Si, I know"."

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.380
Fine, I'll talk to him
when I get back from work".

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.110
So by 3:00 o'clock I
get back from work.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.260
I wait for Javier to come in.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.560
I open the door.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.860
I said, "Oh hi Javier.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.160
How are you?"

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.460
"Fine, dad".

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.760
"How was your day in school?"

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.060
"Oh great."

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.890
"Oh, okay," I said, "You know,
Mr. Cook called me and told me

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.360
that they had taken
you to his office."

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.660
"Oh yes dad".

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.960
"Well, what happened?"

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.690
"No, this kid called me Mexican
and I told him Virginian.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.220
And Mexican, Virginian".

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.150
"And then what happened?"

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.980
"No, then I hit him".

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.680
"Oh my goodness", I said.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.490
And then he turns and I still
remember his face and said.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.890
"By the way dad, what is Mexican?"

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:30.590 position:56%
Okay, so probably Chris-- neither
Chris nor him knew what Mexican was.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.700
But my son probably say, "Oh
you know, this is not water.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.130
This is agua".

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.050
And then Chris told him Mexican.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.110
"By the way dad, what is Mexican?"

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:46.100
So anyway, the idea is
that Jefferson asked us

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.170
to learn Spanish, to
learn many languages.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.820
So the idea is that we are more

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.040
and more multi-cultural,
multi-lingual nation.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.050
And-- okay this is the end.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:03.430
And this is a book that I have
written with passion and pride.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.010
And I hope that it will be
coming in English as well.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:11.250
So I hope that not only
we, the Hispanic community,

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.900
read it and learn from it.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.190
But also-- the English
speaking community

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:21.830
so that we all learn our
history, truly as it is.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.810
And not just the official version.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:29.150
And this is a poem that I
have read many, many times.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:33.690
Which is whenever I go in
Latin America, they announce me

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.400
as a poet or writer from the US.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.940
They always say, "Oh, down
with giant keys of whatever".

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.400
And I say, "No wait a minute."

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.080
I said, "You know, the US,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.120
we are part of America
and Hispanic America."

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.270
And then I read them
this poem which is called

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.250
"Paisajes de Estados Unidos".

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.960
"Si cada ladrillo hablara.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.090
Si cada Puente hablara.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.060
Si hablaran los parques,
las plantas, las flores.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.510
Si cada trozo de pavimento hablara.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.580
Hablarían en Español.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.750
Si las torres, los techos, los
aires acondicionados hablaran.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.450
Si hablaran las iglesias, los
aeropuertos, las fábricas.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.990
Si cada surco de este país hablara.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.290
Hablarían en Español.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.600
Si los sudores florecieran
con un nombre.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.520
No se llamarían piedras.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.940
Sino González, García,
José, Rodríguez o Peña.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.370
Pero no pueden hablar.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:37.980
Son manos, obras, cicatrices que
por ahora callan o quizás ya no."

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.680
Estados Unidos Hispanos.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.980
Thank you so much.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.280
And now-- [applause].

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:51.130
It is my pleasure to introduce
la Doctora Carmen Benito-Vessels.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:55.790
Which will lead the debate or
the discussion on these topics.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.850
And Enrique if you want
to come on over as well.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:04.960
And I think that probably
we will do it in-- oh no.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.140
We have 1 Spanish-English-- great.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Luis Alberto

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:15.260
for giving me the opportunity
to be here today.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.420
And thank you for organizing
this event.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.360
I think that this poem
is probably the best way

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.580
to start our conversation.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.440 position:56%
And is-- when I first read the book.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.010
I was looking for specific
data and I knew it was there.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:36.460
So I read it a little bit
fast and I was overwhelmed

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.830
by the amount of information.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.630
The second time when I was
invited to lead the discussion.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:48.080
I was even more amazed because this
in my view is a little [inaudible].

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.950
It's an encyclopedia
that is disguised

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.210
in the form of a very humble book.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.950
Like this poem, I think it's the--
and this poem is the history,

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:03.610
in my view, of the Hispanic
population in the US.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:12.520 position:56%
And I don't know if there is more
room to add to what is already here.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.230
But if we have something,
I'm sure that-- well.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.610
As Luis Alberto has mentioned that
you have made several discoveries

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.310
in your-- during the
writing of the book.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.430
And I wonder if there
is still something else

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:28.730
that you would like to add.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.430
I'm sure a second edition
is at the door.

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:34.170
Because you have more to
say and what else would you

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.890
like to include in this book?

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:43.740 position:56%
Or to expand because obviously there
is enough material here to do so.

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.680
&gt;&gt; Amazingly enough I think

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.360
that practically every
day, we find something new.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.930
I mean, a new name, a new
person that has won an award

00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:57.760 position:56%
for instance is of Hispanic descent.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.650
In fact, yesterday or
something I read so and so--

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.880
this was in the sports side of
the-- and all of the sudden I said.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.370
"Oh my goodness, this is a--

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.570
like Football, American
Football" and all of the sudden.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:16.590
This guy was considered to be the
most valuable player sort of say.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.440
And his name, for instance,
it wasn't Escobar.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.660
I know that Escobar was a
national, it's a baseball player.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.960
But something like that.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.810
Every day you find more and more--

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.800
you discover more and
more contributions

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.020
of the Hispanic community
to our general culture.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.670
And our general history
and so on so--

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:41.050
&gt;&gt; Right but in addition
to obviously the new data

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.550
that is coming up every day.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.680
Probably I'm sure that the
audience may have questions

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.880
about this presentation.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.480
If not, I could continue but
do you have questions for any

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.800
of these either poems or topics

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.710
that Luis Alberto Ambroggio
has presented?

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.010
&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is [inaudible].

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.310
I'm with [inaudible].

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:07.000
Thank you very much for the
book and for your comments.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.280
I have 2 quick questions.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.160
1- What inspired you
to write the book?

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.300
And what was the need you
thought you were answering?

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.760
And second, when is the
translation in English coming out?

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.150
&gt;&gt; I am looking for a translator.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:29.810
The first question was what
inspired me to do this?

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.600
I was then as a cultural
envoy for the US

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.220
to give lectures in
several countries.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.510
And those were the
topics that I selected.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:46.140 position:56%
Such as Walt Whitman and the
Hispanic element on our nationality.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.160
Or Thomas Jefferson and
the Spanish language.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:55.780
And-- but basically it's the fact
that I was really totally at awe

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.520
with this reality when
I first came here.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.220
I came to the US in '67
thinking, "Well, here I am.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.660
This is English only type of thing
so I better do it and so on".

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.120
And all of the sudden I start
discovering no, the guy who comes

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.410
around when I call
Smith and whatever.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.810
And somebody else to
come over to do the lawn

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.280
and the guy that come is Jose.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.710
And if I say, "Hola" instead of
"Hello" he-- "Oh, my goodness."

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.010
That's good.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.810
So these are-- this
is one of the motive

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.190
of my sharing this discoveries.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:34.680
And as far as the English version,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.360
I'd like it to come out
as soon as possible.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.410
Hopefully in 3, 4 months
we should have it out.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:46.270
And I'm-- I think it's
basically as I said before.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:55.640 position:56%
The passion and the pride as a-- not
as a Hispanic separately but as part

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.710
of this beautiful country of ours.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.540
&gt;&gt; And [mumbles] if I may say,
you know, one of the things

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.910
that distracts more in this book.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:08.360
Is not only the passion and the
pride but the intellectual pride.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:14.290
And the acute remarks that are
constantly written throughout

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.590
the book.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.900
You know, we are part
of the US as well.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.490
Is it time that we
re-write the history books?

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.330
Is it time that we
teach our students?

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:30.890
Or we let the common citizen
know about the Hispanic past?

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.170
Because this Hispanic past
is part of their history.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.360
As Jefferson very well
mentioned, you know, this.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.440
We didn't start with
a war of independence.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.650
We started much prior.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:48.340
And even our literary roots, you
know, the way Luis Ambroggio pre--

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.540
Luis Alberto Ambroggio
presents it is very original.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:58.040 position:56%
Because usually we think about other
figures from either Latin America

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.420
or Spain that have impacted
North American literature.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.210
And comes to mind, Mark Twain with

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.650
"Huckleberry Finn"
on the pick as novel.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:14.680
Or "Knight in the Court of King
Arthur", that's Mark Twain.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:20.580
But what we find in this book
is that this is a 2 way street.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:25.670
And we find Whitman
in Hispanic poetry.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.580
And so it's a mutually
enriching history.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.270
I think that is one of the things
that is most-- more fascinating.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:38.070
As well as the equanimity
that one finds in this book.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.370
The precision of the
words, you know.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.690
And there is not one
perfect Spanish.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.060
There is not 1 Spanish.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.150
There is many variations.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.790
And I think that I would
like to ask Luis Alberto or--

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:55.040
1 question and then
another for the audience.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.750
It's obvious that you
not only use the language

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:02.300
as a poet but with-- as an art.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.600
I find that each word
in this book is crafted.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.570
And I wonder, all of us have a
mechanism for survival being here.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.740
And suffering the aberration
of many foreign languages

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:18.890
or our own students who don't speak
very well the Spanish language.

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:23.020
And we have to make effort-- an
effort to keep our Spanish more

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.540
or less, you know, under
academic standards.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.870
Or-- you know, or improve
our own language.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:34.690
And I wonder what Luis Alberto
reads to keep his Spanish

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:40.820
that beautifully preserved
and so rich

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.380
after all these years in the US?

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a really
good question.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:55.900
Part of it I think I-- obviously
language is part of my identity.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.190
And as such I love it
like I love my culture,

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:02.440
like I love my family,
like I love-- this is.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.910 position:56%
They say that when we go into exile,

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.830
they ask for however
we want to call it.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.910
We tend to grasp something.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:14.860
And basically I think that what
we grasp is precisely our--

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.370
things that-- things
that identify us.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:20.310
It's true that here, here
I am talking in English.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.830
So bilingual is in
one of the chapters

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.160
of the book deals with that.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.590
Bilingual is an identity.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:31.820
Because in reality, here in the
US, this is part of our identity.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.890
Is being able to say,
"Hola" and say "Hello".

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:38.280
That's what makes me
Hispanic American.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.440
That's what I tell when
I go to schools here

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.180
and I you know, worships
and something.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.570 position:56%
I am the first one to insist,
"Listen learn English like the best.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.100
But never forget your Spanish."

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.080
This is something--
and my kids know that.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:01.360
And basically I am-- I
study social linguistics.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.690
So I am open to the idea
that languages communicate.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.580
And the dialogue and
so on and so forth.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:16.530
But also, I feel that I
shouldn't say words in English

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.830
and make them like Spanish.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.920
Or vice versa, make
English words Spanish.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.470
Like I don't think that
I should say, "Troca".

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.490
I'd rather say truck.

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.700
And then if I need to say in
Spanish, I say, "Camioneta".

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.430
Or and so and I can go on and on.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.730
I have poems.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.300
I have articles written
to that effect.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.060
I think that's important because
that's part of the respect

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:48.810
of our different nationalities that
are conjugated in our personality.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:52.080
So that we are-- well
Walt Whitman usaba--

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.830
he used many words in Spanish.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.230
Por ejemplo, libertad, camarado--

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:01.230
el decía camarado, no
camarada-- and so on.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:05.080
But he used them in Spanish.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.980
He won't say for instance,
"libertady or something

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.620
like that" I am inventing that.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.370
So I think that's why
I kept my language.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.280
And I wanted my kids
to-- keep this language.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.280
And it's so helpful being
bilingual and being good bilingual.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.830
In other words, good
English and good Spanish.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.290
Another story of the family album.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:36.290
My daughter is-- has a
PhD in-- oh my goodness.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.750
I am becoming senile.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:43.270
It's a PhD in epidemiology.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:47.660
And she was invited by
the-- by El Salvador.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.750
They were interested in the
research that she was doing.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:57.610
And so they sent a letter from
the department of public health

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:02.280
in El Salvador inviting her.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.130
Her boss was so impatient that
went ahead and used Google

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.870
to translate that invitation.

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.150
Coming del departamento de
salud pública del Salvador.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.470
Y entonces fue a Google--
¿todos entienen Español acá?

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.770
Sí. Bueno.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.470 position:56%
Fue a Google a buscar la traducción.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.380
Y entonces de repente
viene y la llama a mi hija.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.410
Dice, "Ven, que quiero reunirme
con respecto a ese proyecto".

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:30.030
Y viene mi hija y lo nota
a él todo como enfurecido,

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.090
así serio que se yo y entonces.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:34.350
Le dice el a ella en Ingles ¿no?

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:35.890
"¿Qué es esto?

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:39.470
Es un-- este es un chiste."

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.910
"¿Por qué?", le dice ella.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:42.210
"No, ¿Qué es esto?

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:48.050
Una invitación la carta of the
department of public God bless you.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.350
What is this?"

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.070
Así se lo había traducido Google.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:55.060
El departamento of
public God bless you.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.420
Así el departamento
de salud pública.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.330
Como nosotros decimos cuando
estornudamos, "Salud".

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:05.470
Entonces aquí, "God
bless you" así que--

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:11.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Luis-- Enrique ¿quieres--
o tienes un comentario o-- ?

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.360
&gt;&gt; Allá hay una pregunta.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.660
&gt;&gt; Oh, allá.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.960
Perdón.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.870
&gt;&gt; Tengo un comentario y
lo voy hacer en Español.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:32.280
Pase todos los años-- 52 años que
vivo en este país enseñando en la

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:37.090
universidad con el gobierno.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:43.290
En estos momentos habiendo
sido profesora--

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.470
en estos momentos hay
algo que no sé.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:56.510
Por ejemplo, cuando uno va--
hablando de ser bilingüe.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:06.250
Cuando una-- pero ¿Por
qué cuando voy a votar?

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:11.500 position:56%
Hay un cartón que dice, "Vote aquí".

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.000
¿Por qué?

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.030
¿Los españoles no hablan Inglés?

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:23.710
no saben, no les preguntan.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:36.860
Y si es así, si no hablan
Inglés, ¿Cómo van a votar?

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:49.520
Cuando uno vota, vota por una
persona que usted la conoce.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.400
Que usted sabe que va hacer.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:00.340
Usted tiene que decidir
entre una u otra persona.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:06.170
Si esa persona no habla
Inglés ¿Cómo puede votar?

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:10.960
¿Por qué necesitan poner un
cartel que dice "vote aquí"?

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.300
A mí me ofende, la
verdad, que me ofende.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.600
&gt;&gt; ¿Quieres-- ?

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.920
&gt;&gt; Si. A mí no me--

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.850
&gt;&gt; Es que ninguna persona--

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.150
&gt;&gt; Si.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:24.040
&gt;&gt; Cuando es una cosa
del país, que va votar.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.350
Va votar por la administración
en este país.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:29.440
No, no en fin nomas aquí.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.830
¿Para qué necesitan poner un
cartel que dice "vote aquí"?

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:34.130
&gt;&gt; Si. A mí--

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:35.430
&gt;&gt; Es ofensivo.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.750
&gt;&gt; Claro, eso es personal ¿no?

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:40.080
En el sentido de que
a mí no me ofende.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.190
Si no que me enorgullece
ver el Español ahí.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:44.490
¿Por qué?

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.560
Porque dentro de nuestra comunidad,

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.440
y digo este yo ayudo aquí por
ejemplo al centro de alfabetización

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.740
en español, CENAES.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.210
Nuestros inmigrantes a veces
vienen sin tener mucha educación

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:55.510
incluso allá.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.200
&gt;&gt; Entonces no puede votar.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.440
&gt;&gt; Perdón, este-- aquí
se vota y se habla.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.790
Se habla porque hay gente dentro
de nuestra comunidad, mucha.

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.850
La mayoría de la gente
es bilingüe.

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.340
Entonces posiblemente hablan.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.800
Hay periódicos en español que
precisamente hablan de toda

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.100
la política.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.400
Y que esta gente que
lee, puede leer.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.000
Entonces-- y por el otro
lado, digamos hay-- nosotros.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.650
Yo soy miembro de la Academia
Norte Americana de Lengua Española.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:25.910
Tenemos un acuerdo con el gobierno
para traducir documentos oficiales.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:32.240
O sea, el español ha sido ahora
digamos reconocido como un idioma

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.070
que debe ser traducido.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:39.810
Precisamente porque reconocen
la importancia de esta minoría.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:43.440
Y seguro que los políticos
son los primeros que dicen,

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.740
"Pongan 'voten aquí'".

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:49.960
Porque el voto Hispano ha
significado una gran diferencia.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.260
&gt;&gt; Ese, sí.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.460
&gt;&gt; Cuando se va votar aquí.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:59.770
No sé cómo es en todos los estados
pero muchas veces hay que seguir

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.360
unas instrucciones técnicas.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.010
Del botón, cual viene
primero, mueva lo demás.

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.920
Y tal vez allí es que también
necesitan ayuda las personas que no

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.220
dominan tan bien el inglés.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.520
Para poder seguir las
instrucciones y que su voto sea

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.820
registrado adecuadamente.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.120
Son unas-- es parte del proceso.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.420
Creo que estoy de acuerdo con usted
que hay suficiente información en

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.780
español que se está promoviendo
para los que no dominan la lengua

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.080
en Ingles.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.380
Periódicos, la prensa
y los candidatos.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.680 position:56%
Ellos están hiendo a las comunidades
en español y hablando en español.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.980
&gt;&gt; Hablando en español.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.280
&gt;&gt; Si.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.580
&gt;&gt; Así que creo que lo veo así.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.880
Pero tengo una pregunta.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.180
&gt;&gt; Si.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.480
&gt;&gt; En la primera-- ficha que puso.

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.780
No sé si fue que no lo vi bien.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.080 position:56%
Donde usted menciona los territorios
y estados que eran españoles y ahora

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.380
son parte de estados unidos.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.680
No sé si incluyo a Puerto Rico.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.980
&gt;&gt; Puerto Rico, hablo de Puerto
Rico pero es un caso especial.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.280
Porque en este momento o sea
la-- como te podría decir.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.780
La situación jurídica de Puerto
Rico es diferente de un estado en

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.080
este momento.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.380
O sea--

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.680
&gt;&gt; Pero es un territorio.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.980
&gt;&gt; Es un territorio.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.280
Por eso digo, tampoco
hablo de Hawái o cosas así.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.870
O sea, hablo de los estados aquí
dentro del-- esta por ejemplo.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.720
Cuando hablo de la literatura
Puertorriqueña en el libro.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.960
Hablo de la literatura continental.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.910
No de la isla de Puerto Rico.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:04.530
O sea, porque por ejemplo hay más
Puertorriqueños posiblemente en

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.190
Nueva York que los
que hay en la isla.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.400
Pero hablo de la literatura
escrita en el territorio,

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.730
en el continente de
los estados unidos.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.320
No, de Puerto Rico, ¿Por qué?

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:18.870
Por la situación especial de Puerto
Rico y que todavía está definida

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.450
pero no del todo, ¿no?

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.590
Así que por eso no lo menciono.

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:25.370
&gt;&gt; Muy válido, claro,
en la investigación.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:26.800
&gt;&gt; No, o sea realmente
no sé-- si Georgette.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.310
&gt;&gt; I think the genius of the United
States of your, that of Hispanics

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.490
like all the other languages.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:35.880
Is that it can also
go into Vietnamese,

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.320
you know, Cambodian [phonetic].

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.920
So the genius of this continent is

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.870
so many wonderful cultures
and languages.

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:46.150
&gt;&gt; Right, right and if I may
add one little thing, you know.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:50.590
Is Spanish was the first
language spoken in Virginia.

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:53.070
Much prior than English.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.140
Therefore, I am really
looking forward to the day

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.430
when we have not only
the "vote aquí".

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:03.890
But also the names of the streets
or directions in both languages.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:08.820
The same way that it happens let's
say in Catalonia or in Belgium.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:13.460
Because the population
knows both languages.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.950
That doesn't mean that one
is superior to the other.

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:20.730
It means that they
are-- sufficient numbers

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:24.400
that justify this bilingualism.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.460
And that-- as I said, that doesn't
mean that you have to forget one.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:33.220
As Luis Alberto mentioned,
and or give priority

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.090
of one language over the other.

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.810
Of course there is one thing,
common sense and there is plenty

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:42.880
of attention to that
common sense in this book.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:47.190
Because I'm going to add, we
also have our differences.

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:49.840
The Spanish you know
about language, the--

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:54.160
nuances and we are all very picky.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.600
&gt;&gt; Lo que si no me gustaría que
dijese, "Bote aquí" con B larga.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.440
Y ¿Qué pasa?

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.920
Por ejemplo, una vez en un--

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:09.140 position:56%
en un restaurante estábamos hablando
con unos amigos de la señora del

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.770
dueño de ese restaurante.

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:15.260
Y la chica que hablaba
un poco hablaba español.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.810
No sé de donde era
pero hablaba español.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:21.970
De repente nos dice, " Ah sí,
ya le voy a traer a la vaga".

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:26.850
Y nosotros nos quedamos, "Oy
Dios mío que falta de respeto."

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:29.680
Porque estábamos hablando
de la señora del dueño.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.070
Y no ella se refería al bag.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.910
Iba a traer a la baga.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:38.200
Pero estábamos discutiendo,
"Pero vaga es con v corta".

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.230
&gt;&gt; There's one more
question here, please.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:48.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Si, primero agradecerle mucho por
el libro realmente pienso que es un

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.530
libro fascinante y
muy poco conocido.

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:02.640
Muy necesario y que
realmente [inaudible].

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:10.160
Mi caso particular,
nosotros tenemos 3 hijos.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.210
Nosotros somos Argentinos.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:22.110
Mis 3 hijos crecieron
inmigrantes por el trabajo.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:25.090
Y ellos son bilingües perfectos.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:32.520
Pero hay que-- bilingües en
el sentido de bi-culturales,

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.560
bilingües y bi-culturales.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.440
Es decir saben adaptarse
a las culturas,

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.590
al modo de ser cultural
de los 2 digamos de las 2

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:45.890
poblaciones [inaudible].

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:59.670
Pero tenemos un tema, un tema
muy serio con nuestras nietas.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:13.980
Allí estamos porque nuestros 3
hijos se casaron con 3 americanos.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:25.460
2 americanos y 1 americana,
tenemos dos nenas y un barón.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:41.090
Y este libro va salir muy bien
para apoyar la campaña que estamos

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:44.490
haciendo para que nuestros nietos
también sean bilingües como

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:45.790
debe ser.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:47.090
Porque a veces no se aprecia--

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:48.390
ya, yo creo que el tema del
bilingüismo como usted muy bien

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:49.690
lo expresa.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:51.170
Es una-- muy necesario
inclusive al pasar de los años.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.470
Y sin embargo no ha premiado.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:53.990 position:56%
Es decir que todavía piensan que
con el inglés solo las cosas están--

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.060 position:56%
se van a llevar la pared por delante
con la identidad salir al mercado.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.360 position:56%
Para mi es ese comentario solamente.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.660
Agradecerle mucho [inaudible]
de un tema tan, tan interesante.

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.960
&gt;&gt; Si, el orgullo que debe
sentir cuando lo dije aquí ¿no?

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.280
Cuando uno de sus nietos
lo llama abuelo, ¿no?

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.840
Creo que es realmente una
obligación nuestra también ¿no?

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.140
solo que--

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.440
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.740
It's wonderful.

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:08.040
&gt;&gt; Bueno. Thank you.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.640
Thank you for that.

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.940
&gt;&gt; Thank you [applause].

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
