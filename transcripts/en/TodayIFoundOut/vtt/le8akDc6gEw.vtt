00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:09.280
Kipchoge Keino, aka Hezekiah Kipchoge Keino
or (thankfully in the interest of avoiding

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.349
typos) just Kip, is a retired athlete who
ran for the country of Kenya.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.061
Throughout his career, Kip earned almost a
dozen medals, half of which were gold, for

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:21.950
being an amazing middle to long distance runner.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.690
The story we want to share is the time Kip
was almost late for his own race and had to

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.529
(literally) run to get there, then won a gold
medal anyway, despite another major adversity

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.730
in that race, which we’ll get to in a minute.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.730
First, a little info on the man himself, because
he’s awesome.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.199
We’ll start with his name.

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.730
Kipchoge is a Nandi expression for something
to the effect of “born near the grain storage

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.730
shed.”

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.219
If you guessed he came from humble beginnings,
you’d be right.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.170
Things didn’t get better when both of his
parents died when he was very young; he then

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.219
moved in with his aunt who raised him.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.579
When once asked about his childhood and how
he got started running, this was Kip’s response:

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.070
When I started at primary school.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.751
I ran in my bare feet four miles to school
in the morning, home for lunch, again for

00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.320
afternoon school and back at the end of the
day.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.110
I did this every day until I left school

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.640
If your mind is still trying to work out the
maths for that one, Kip ran 16 miles every

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.160
single day in Kenyan heat without shoes just
to get to school- Kip managed this starting

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.820
as a 5 year old.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.000
You may think that with this impressive running
ability, Kip was destined to be a runner.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.310
After finishing school, though, he didn’t
immediately get into competitive running.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.490
Instead, Kip became a physical training instructor
for the Kenyan police force.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.450
At the time, Kenya was not the runner generating
powerhouse it is today.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.830
In fact, Kip was one of the first great runners
the country produced.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.420
It wasn’t until the early 1960s that Kip
realised that his thighs demanded a greater

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.000
challenge and he took up competitive athletics
on the side from his day job.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.280
Though Kip was ultimately one of the finest
distance runners of his time- perhaps one

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.200
of the finest of all time- he didn’t achieve
significant results until the 1964 Tokyo Olympics,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.119
where he narrowly missed qualifying for the
1500M final.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.299
A year later, in 1965, Kip broke two distance
running world records (the 1500M and 5000M

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.329
events respectively) at the 1965 All-Africa
Games.

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.709
A year after that impressive feat, during
the 1966 commonwealth games, Kip won a double

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.010
gold in the mile and three mile sprint events.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.140
His greatest feat came two years later during
the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.999
We say “greatest feat” because for the
entire duration of the games, Kip was suffering

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.299
from crippling gallstones.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.719
And we mean crippling- Kip literally collapsed
while running the 10,000M. This was especially

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.810
cruel when you realise that Kip was in the
lead when the pain overwhelmed him and he

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.069
had only three laps to go!

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.019
By stepping off of the track after he collapsed,
he’d automatically disqualified himself.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.209
Determined to finish the race anyway, he stumbled
back onto the track and, despite the pain,

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.310
managed to do the final laps, even though
it didn’t count.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.640
The eventual winner of that race was one,
Naftali Temu, another Kenyan who now holds

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.060
the honor of being Kenya’s first gold medal
winner.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.420
An honor that almost went to Kip.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.390
Now this is where the story gets interesting.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.319
Prior to running the 10,000M, Kip had been
told by a doctor not to run and that any strain

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.019
to his body was at risk of causing him serious
harm, and in the extreme case could even lead

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.129
to his death.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.439
Of course, Kip ran anyway as noted.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:32.519
Two days after the 10,000M- the race he collapsed
in- Kip ran in the 5000M and won a silver

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.480
medal, finishing just one fifth of a second
behind the gold medalist.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.780
On top of that, he then ran another 1500M
race and qualified for the final of the event.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.209
At this point, you may think Kip was tempting
fate, but we’re still not done.

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.370
The day of 1500M final, Kip, presumably due
to the fact that HE HAD GALLSTONES, elected

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.409
to sleep in and there was some thought that
he was simply choosing not to race that day

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.959
when his absence was noticed, given the day
before he had indicated he might not given

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.309
his medical problem.

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:06.550
Nevertheless, only an hour before the actual
event, he hopped out of bed and headed off

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.550
to the games.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.919
On the bus ride to the Olympic stadium, the
bus became stuck in traffic and this is where

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:11.919
the story gets interesting.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.299
Realising the bus was going to be late, Kip
got off and ran the remaining 2 miles to the

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.459
Olympic stadium while carrying his equipment.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.729
He then registered with 20 minutes to spare,
got himself ready, and walked out onto the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.639
track and won a gold medal, outpacing the
second place runner by an astounding 20 metres-

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.780
the longest distance anyone had ever won by
in the event at that time.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.780
(And possibly even to this day as far as I
can find- though don’t quote me on that,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.780
as I didn’t go through every Olympics from
then to now.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.780
I just wasn’t able to find any record of
a greater lead from my research in the 1500M.)

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.789
Not only this, the man he beat by such a huge
margin, Jim Ryun, had not been defeated in

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.610
the 1,500M in three years.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.430
Further, Kip had now raced five times in that
Olympics, while Ryun was completely fresh.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.360
And, of course, that’s not to mention the
gallstones.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.050
In the end, Kip finished with a time of 3:34.9,
the second fastest in history at that point.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.250
To put that in slightly more common terms,
that’s a pace of 25.13 km/hr or 15.61 mph

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.970
for 1500 metres!

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.860
Seriously, go watch the race here and realise
that not only is Kip running with a constant

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.690
stabbing pain in his abdomen, but that he
had just ran 2 miles to the stadium in sweltering

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.690
Mexican heat.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.690
Then, feel angry when you scroll down and
see that the video’s description is “Jim

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.690
Ryun wins the silver medal at the 1968 Olympics“-
surely Kip’s victory was a little more noteworthy,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.690
eh, YouTube poster?

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.740
After this victory, Kip went on to win several
more medals before eventually settling down

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.990
in Kenya, where he currently runs a charity
for orphans, as well as helped found a primary

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.259
and a secondary school.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.870
For his many humanitarian works in his post-professional
career, he was inducted into the World Sports

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:45.550
Humanitarian Hall of Fame.
