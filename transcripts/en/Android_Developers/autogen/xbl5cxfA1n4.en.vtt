hi my name is Ellen shamsky I'm an
 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.820
hi my name is Ellen shamsky I'm an
intern on the Android team at Google and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830
intern on the Android team at Google and
 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.079
intern on the Android team at Google and
today I'll be talking about some of the

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.089
today I'll be talking about some of the
 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.239
today I'll be talking about some of the
various methods you can use to animate

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:15.249
various methods you can use to animate
 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.490
various methods you can use to animate
fragments so today I'm going to discuss

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500
fragments so today I'm going to discuss
 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.620
fragments so today I'm going to discuss
a few different things including how you

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630
a few different things including how you
 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.810
a few different things including how you
can switch how you can animate the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820
can switch how you can animate the
 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.490
can switch how you can animate the
switch we can run from one another using

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500
switch we can run from one another using
 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.189
switch we can run from one another using
using fragment transaction I'll talk

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199
using fragment transaction I'll talk
 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.839
using fragment transaction I'll talk
about how you can create animations

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849
about how you can create animations
 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.939
about how you can create animations
using via code create using object

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949
using via code create using object
 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.439
using via code create using object
animators to animate those fragments as

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449
animators to animate those fragments as
 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.330
animators to animate those fragments as
well as a couple very useful callbacks

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340
well as a couple very useful callbacks
 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.310
well as a couple very useful callbacks
leak in fragments that you can use to

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320
leak in fragments that you can use to
 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.400
leak in fragments that you can use to
create very custom animations for your

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410
create very custom animations for your
 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.860
create very custom animations for your
fragment transitions so jumping straight

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870
fragment transitions so jumping straight
 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.990
fragment transitions so jumping straight
at the demo you can see here we have

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000
at the demo you can see here we have
 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.580
at the demo you can see here we have
just an image and this is a fragment

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590
just an image and this is a fragment
 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.889
just an image and this is a fragment
that only contains an image clicking

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899
that only contains an image clicking
 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.720
that only contains an image clicking
tapping on it it slides into the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730
tapping on it it slides into the
 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.459
tapping on it it slides into the
background and pops up another fragment

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469
background and pops up another fragment
 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.470
background and pops up another fragment
so this here is just another framing

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480
so this here is just another framing
 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.880
so this here is just another framing
containing text about the Golden Gate

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890
containing text about the Golden Gate
 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.189
containing text about the Golden Gate
Bridge which is our original image

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
Bridge which is our original image
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.569
Bridge which is our original image
tapping once again slides that back out

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579
tapping once again slides that back out
 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.360
tapping once again slides that back out
so looking at it once again

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
so looking at it once again
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.919
so looking at it once again
tapping one slides it back in into the

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929
tapping one slides it back in into the
 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.599
tapping one slides it back in into the
background has this kind of dimming

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609
background has this kind of dimming
 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.640
background has this kind of dimming
effect where it darkens it brings out

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650
effect where it darkens it brings out
 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.730
effect where it darkens it brings out
the text fragment and tapping once again

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740
the text fragment and tapping once again
 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.249
the text fragment and tapping once again
slides out the text fragment dims out

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259
slides out the text fragment dims out
 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.370
slides out the text fragment dims out
that dark hole review and animated image

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
that dark hole review and animated image
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.950
that dark hole review and animated image
framing back out so jumping straight

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960
framing back out so jumping straight
 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.499
framing back out so jumping straight
into the code there's a few different

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509
into the code there's a few different
 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.429
into the code there's a few different
things to note here today firstly we set

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439
things to note here today firstly we set
 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.960
things to note here today firstly we set
up there's some boilerplate code we set

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970
up there's some boilerplate code we set
 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.190
up there's some boilerplate code we set
up a click listener to switch the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200
up a click listener to switch the
 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.780
up a click listener to switch the
fragments every single time we click on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790
fragments every single time we click on
 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.240
fragments every single time we click on
the screen and in switch fragments the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250
the screen and in switch fragments the
 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.980
the screen and in switch fragments the
first thing you want to look at is here

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990
first thing you want to look at is here
 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.399
first thing you want to look at is here
so I create a listener at the end of

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409
so I create a listener at the end of
 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.469
so I create a listener at the end of
which we're going to do the actual

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479
which we're going to do the actual
 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.080
which we're going to do the actual
fragment transition so I start a new

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090
fragment transition so I start a new
 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.969
fragment transition so I start a new
transaction and I call this method

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979
transaction and I call this method
 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.370
transaction and I call this method
called set custom animations what set

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380
called set custom animations what set
 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.530
called set custom animations what set
custom animations does is taken for

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540
custom animations does is taken for
 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.020
custom animations does is taken for
reanimated resource files you can use to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030
reanimated resource files you can use to
 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.149
reanimated resource files you can use to
animate one fragment in and omit it out

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159
animate one fragment in and omit it out
 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.910
animate one fragment in and omit it out
and as well as when you're popping this

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920
and as well as when you're popping this
 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.380
and as well as when you're popping this
type for the fragment transaction you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390
type for the fragment transaction you
 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.870
type for the fragment transaction you
can you can also pass the resource files

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880
can you can also pass the resource files
 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.789
can you can also pass the resource files
for enemy now the other fragment in and

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799
for enemy now the other fragment in and
 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.160
for enemy now the other fragment in and
out we have to note here though is that

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
out we have to note here though is that
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.440
out we have to note here though is that
I am passing in resource files for the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450
I am passing in resource files for the
 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.779
I am passing in resource files for the
text fragment sliding up and down but

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789
text fragment sliding up and down but
 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.450
text fragment sliding up and down but
I'm passing in zeros for the for the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460
I'm passing in zeros for the for the
 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.710
I'm passing in zeros for the for the
image fragment that I'm animating

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720
image fragment that I'm animating
 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.110
image fragment that I'm animating
because that's a little more custom then

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
because that's a little more custom then
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.530
because that's a little more custom then
I add my text ring and onto my stack

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
I add my text ring and onto my stack
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.190
I add my text ring and onto my stack
I I said that - no and I commit my

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
I I said that - no and I commit my
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.990
I I said that - no and I commit my
animation so what this lets me do is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
animation so what this lets me do is
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970
animation so what this lets me do is
later simply pop my fragment manager

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
later simply pop my fragment manager
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.720
later simply pop my fragment manager
stack and then my my image frame will

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
stack and then my my image frame will
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.459
stack and then my my image frame will
come back up after the text fragment is

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469
come back up after the text fragment is
 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.580
come back up after the text fragment is
animated out so the all of this does all

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
animated out so the all of this does all
 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.410
animated out so the all of this does all
of this is done at the end of a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
of this is done at the end of a
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.500
of this is done at the end of a
animation listener and if you go here to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510
animation listener and if you go here to
 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.089
animation listener and if you go here to
slide back that's where it's actually

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099
slide back that's where it's actually
 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.339
slide back that's where it's actually
gonna get executed so I set up a few

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349
gonna get executed so I set up a few
 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.050
gonna get executed so I set up a few
animations for the image fragment I'm

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060
animations for the image fragment I'm
 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.509
animations for the image fragment I'm
going to rotate it about the x-axis I'm

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519
going to rotate it about the x-axis I'm
 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.610
going to rotate it about the x-axis I'm
going to scale it so it actually it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
going to scale it so it actually it
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.319
going to scale it so it actually it
rotates in the background and scales and

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329
rotates in the background and scales and
 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.839
rotates in the background and scales and
it comes a little smaller and what what

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849
it comes a little smaller and what what
 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.910
it comes a little smaller and what what
I'm actually going to do as well is this

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
I'm actually going to do as well is this
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.250
I'm actually going to do as well is this
M dark hard review which is just a view

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260
M dark hard review which is just a view
 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.890
M dark hard review which is just a view
with an opacity let with an opacity less

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
with an opacity let with an opacity less
 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.770
with an opacity let with an opacity less
than 1 and a black background color it's

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780
than 1 and a black background color it's
 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.020
than 1 and a black background color it's
going to it's going to fade in over my

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
going to it's going to fade in over my
 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270
going to it's going to fade in over my
image fragment so one of the things you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
image fragment so one of the things you
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.119
image fragment so one of the things you
can do with such custom animations is

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129
can do with such custom animations is
 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.949
can do with such custom animations is
add animations to other widgets or other

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959
add animations to other widgets or other
 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.960
add animations to other widgets or other
items that you have on the screen using

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
items that you have on the screen using
 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.399
items that you have on the screen using
this method you can actually add

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409
this method you can actually add
 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.110
this method you can actually add
animations at the same time as the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
animations at the same time as the
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.849
animations at the same time as the
fragment is animated except to things

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859
fragment is animated except to things
 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.589
fragment is animated except to things
that are that may be completely separate

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599
that are that may be completely separate
 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.110
that are that may be completely separate
from the fragment itself once I set up

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
from the fragment itself once I set up
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.199
from the fragment itself once I set up
all my animations I add a start delay

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209
all my animations I add a start delay
 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.659
all my animations I add a start delay
such that what is such a what's actually

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669
such that what is such a what's actually
 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.759
such that what is such a what's actually
gonna happen is after I animate the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769
gonna happen is after I animate the
 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.890
gonna happen is after I animate the
image from into the background only then

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
image from into the background only then
 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.129
image from into the background only then
will well that takes for many come back

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139
will well that takes for many come back
 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.020
will well that takes for many come back
up and then at the end of that animation

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
up and then at the end of that animation
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.939
up and then at the end of that animation
that's when the fragment popping end

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949
that's when the fragment popping end
 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.210
that's when the fragment popping end
transaction actually happens so if you

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220
transaction actually happens so if you
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.729
transaction actually happens so if you
keep sliding back down there's a method

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
keep sliding back down there's a method
 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.740
keep sliding back down there's a method
called slide forward and slide forward

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
called slide forward and slide forward
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.159
called slide forward and slide forward
actually gets called right here so what

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169
actually gets called right here so what
 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.140
actually gets called right here so what
happens is when you click when you click

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150
happens is when you click when you click
 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.990
happens is when you click when you click
on the when you click on the screen when

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000
on the when you click on the screen when
 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.629
on the when you click on the screen when
the text fragment is is in focus what

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639
the text fragment is is in focus what
 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.009
the text fragment is is in focus what
we're going to do is pop the stack in

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019
we're going to do is pop the stack in
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.080
we're going to do is pop the stack in
order to bring the image ringing back in

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090
order to bring the image ringing back in
 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.000
order to bring the image ringing back in
focus and when the back stack has

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
focus and when the back stack has
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.530
focus and when the back stack has
changed we're going to call slide

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
changed we're going to call slide
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.809
changed we're going to call slide
forward in slide forward we're doing

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819
forward in slide forward we're doing
 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.280
forward in slide forward we're doing
almost the exact same thing as where we

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290
almost the exact same thing as where we
 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.890
almost the exact same thing as where we
didn't slide back we're rotating about

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900
didn't slide back we're rotating about
 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.259
didn't slide back we're rotating about
the x axis back out we're scaling we're

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269
the x axis back out we're scaling we're
 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.120
the x axis back out we're scaling we're
scaling our image sharing back up and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130
scaling our image sharing back up and
 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.759
scaling our image sharing back up and
we're fading out the dark Harborview

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769
we're fading out the dark Harborview
 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.219
we're fading out the dark Harborview
instead of fading it in all of this is

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229
instead of fading it in all of this is
 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.830
instead of fading it in all of this is
all this is then put together using an

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
all this is then put together using an
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.529
all this is then put together using an
animator set and that's how the end

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539
animator set and that's how the end
 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.020
animator set and that's how the end
takes place so this this this is where

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
takes place so this this this is where
 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.460
takes place so this this this is where
you can do if you want to have a custom

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470
you can do if you want to have a custom
 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.839
you can do if you want to have a custom
object animator and set custom

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849
object animator and set custom
 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.969
object animator and set custom
animations but the other important thing

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979
animations but the other important thing
 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.059
animations but the other important thing
that I really wanted to note was in tech

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069
that I really wanted to note was in tech
 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.040
that I really wanted to note was in tech
in any fragment there's a callback

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
in any fragment there's a callback
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.290
in any fragment there's a callback
method you can override called on create

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300
method you can override called on create
 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.540
method you can override called on create
animator and the thing about on create

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550
animator and the thing about on create
 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.710
animator and the thing about on create
animator is it's a method that gets

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720
animator is it's a method that gets
 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.999
animator is it's a method that gets
called when you want to get the

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009
called when you want to get the
 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.529
called when you want to get the
animation object for a fragment

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539
animation object for a fragment
 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.140
animation object for a fragment
transaction it has a few useful

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150
transaction it has a few useful
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.850
transaction it has a few useful
parameters you can use but the key

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860
parameters you can use but the key
 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.950
parameters you can use but the key
behind this is that you can essentially

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960
behind this is that you can essentially
 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.809
behind this is that you can essentially
create any custom animation you want

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819
create any custom animation you want
 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.330
create any custom animation you want
here and never be limited just to do

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340
here and never be limited just to do
 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.839
here and never be limited just to do
things in an animated resource file so

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849
things in an animated resource file so
 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.520
things in an animated resource file so
and then if we actually just take a

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530
and then if we actually just take a
 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.899
and then if we actually just take a
quick look at the resource file that we

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909
quick look at the resource file that we
 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.540
quick look at the resource file that we
passed in to set custom animations there

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550
passed in to set custom animations there
 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.360
passed in to set custom animations there
right here we set up an object animator

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370
right here we set up an object animator
 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.870
right here we set up an object animator
with a from value a to value a property

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880
with a from value a to value a property
 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.210
with a from value a to value a property
name and a duration but one of the

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220
name and a duration but one of the
 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.490
name and a duration but one of the
things I did here is I created a custom

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500
things I did here is I created a custom
 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.010
things I did here is I created a custom
property called Y fraction and the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020
property called Y fraction and the
 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.629
property called Y fraction and the
reason I did this is because unlike and

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639
reason I did this is because unlike and
 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.089
reason I did this is because unlike and
in view in older view and tween

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099
in view in older view and tween
 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.070
in view in older view and tween
animations property animations are

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080
animations property animations are
 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.990
animations property animations are
independent of what the container

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000
independent of what the container
 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.510
independent of what the container
actually is so if for example in twin

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520
actually is so if for example in twin
 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.950
actually is so if for example in twin
animations you could tell a view to

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960
animations you could tell a view to
 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.659
animations you could tell a view to
animate from zero to a hundred percent

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669
animate from zero to a hundred percent
 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.059
animate from zero to a hundred percent
of its parents with we can't do this

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069
of its parents with we can't do this
 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.709
of its parents with we can't do this
with proper animation and I found a

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:38.719
with proper animation and I found a
 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.080
with proper animation and I found a
workaround for this by using Y fraction

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090
workaround for this by using Y fraction
 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.339
workaround for this by using Y fraction
so in text fragment there is a custom

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349
so in text fragment there is a custom
 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:53.860
so in text fragment there is a custom
property there's a in sort in fractional

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870
property there's a in sort in fractional
 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.379
property there's a in sort in fractional
in fractional linear layout which is

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389
in fractional linear layout which is
 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.390
in fractional linear layout which is
actually there's a custom property

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400
actually there's a custom property
 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.659
actually there's a custom property
called

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669
called
 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.170
called
Y fraction and so what happens when you

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180
Y fraction and so what happens when you
 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.689
Y fraction and so what happens when you
create an object animator that enemies

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699
create an object animator that enemies
 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.189
create an object animator that enemies
the property Y fraction it's going to

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199
the property Y fraction it's going to
 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.709
the property Y fraction it's going to
look for a setter called set Y fraction

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719
look for a setter called set Y fraction
 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.930
look for a setter called set Y fraction
and given the setter right here

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940
and given the setter right here
 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.550
and given the setter right here
satellite fraction what I'm doing is

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560
satellite fraction what I'm doing is
 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.189
satellite fraction what I'm doing is
animating a float value between zero and

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199
animating a float value between zero and
 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.800
animating a float value between zero and
one but since in runtime I can determine

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810
one but since in runtime I can determine
 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.050
one but since in runtime I can determine
what the width and height of my screen

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060
what the width and height of my screen
 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.080
what the width and height of my screen
is I can actually just do do some simple

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090
is I can actually just do do some simple
 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.899
is I can actually just do do some simple
arithmetic and animate it from zero to

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909
arithmetic and animate it from zero to
 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.700
arithmetic and animate it from zero to
some certain percentage of its parents

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710
some certain percentage of its parents
 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.490
some certain percentage of its parents
container so yeah so those are some

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500
container so yeah so those are some
 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.399
container so yeah so those are some
different ways of animating fragments as

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409
different ways of animating fragments as
 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.269
different ways of animating fragments as
well as a way to work around not having

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:37.279
well as a way to work around not having
 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:38.360
well as a way to work around not having
percent

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370
percent
 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.760
percent
percent animations with object animators

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770
percent animations with object animators
 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.409
percent animations with object animators
unlike you did in older view animations

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419
unlike you did in older view animations
 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.090
unlike you did in older view animations
so I hope you enjoy the video and thanks
