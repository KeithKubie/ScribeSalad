00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next step in this funnel is remember we just talked about getting customers

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and let's talk about keeping customers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is what I called the you-should-be-so-lucky-to-have-this-problem part of the funnel,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that's how you grow the customers you have.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When you're thinking about growing customers, nothing magic.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You've now sold these customers way back here under purchased,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and you've kept them around with relative programs and product updates,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but really what you'd like to do, understanding now that it's a lot cheaper

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to sell existing customers more stuff than it is to get new customers,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is let's go try to sell them some stuff, and how can we do that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, the first thing you might want to think about is,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
can I un-bundle some of the stuff in my startup that I tried to package all at once.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What are the mistakes that early stage ventures make that this new company is thinking

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that you have to stick every possible feature in the product and sell it for the one price.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It might be possible once you understand more and more about your customers

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to know that, you know what, most people just kind of want the base product

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
or you might have a freemium strategy which just says I'll give them the base product for free

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but really understanding that what they're going to want some percentage is these other things.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Un-bundling is just a fancy word for saying--can I somehow decompose the product

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
into separate pieces, giving some for free or if you're lucky, charging for everyone of them.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I used to do this all the time to actually increase the average selling price by un-bundling the product.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And next thing to think about is can I up-sell the product.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
A retailer in the United States called Sears had a line of tools

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that they sold to people who made things and their product line always

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
had three types of products--good, better, and best.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And what they would try to get you to do is get you into the store

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
looking at the price of the good product but then when you got there, you said--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
well, I deserve better and then someday I could aspire to the best.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And so that was kind of up-selling in the same product line

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and in fact in the United States from the 1920s to the 1960s,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the master of up-selling was General Motors.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
When they had separate brands, each had a fixed price point.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You started buying a car with a Chevrolet then you moved up to a Buick, then a Pontiac,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
then an Oldsmobile, then eventually you could aspire to a Cadillac.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And these were all kind of up-selling based on aspirations

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the quality and features of the product increase as well.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You might want to think about creating an up-sell strategy.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Cross-sell, well that's also kind of simple.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Gee, if you're buying one product, are there any accessories

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
or companion products that you ought to just figure out to make sure

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that you customers are aware of or on the pricing page or on a price list say--

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Gee, when you buy this product, we'll give you a 20% discount off of this other one,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which most consumers would realize, ooh I'd like to have that too, and so thinking about

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
what adjacent products, what products next to the one you're already selling

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
customers can buy is a cross-selling strategy.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Finally, the last piece is referrals and that's another grow strategy.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And referrals basically generates this outer viral loop.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Remember what we were trying to do in the initial purchase

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
or get your new customers to start telling their friends about your products,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
you want to do the same thing after you've had those customers for a while.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Maybe now you want to give them discounts on future purchases.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You want to say thank you for doing this, by the way, a $100 off or $5 off to the next purchase.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
When you bring in the next new customers, banks now think that's a popular strategy,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and this referral program just helps your customers,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
hopefully, who are satisfied sell more of your product for you.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And so that's get, keep, and now grow customers.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
By the way, this grow funnel just like in get customers, there's nothing magic about cross-sell,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
up-sell, and un-bundling, there might be other strategies

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that your company and your startup might want to stick in to this funnel as well.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We put this up as kind of a canonical model because most companies

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
tend to use these types of techniques but it really depends

00:04:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
on what you're industry and product line is.
