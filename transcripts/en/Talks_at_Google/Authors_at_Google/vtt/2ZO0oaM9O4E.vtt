00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
&gt;&gt; Welcome.
On behalf of Green Google and Authors at Google,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.829
it is my privilege to introduce Dr. Henry
Pollack today.

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:12.780
With his colleagues on the inter-governmental
panel on climate change, Dr. Pollack shared

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.400
the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former vice
president Al Gore.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.279
Dr. Pollack has been a professor of geophysics
at the University of Michigan for more than

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.300
40 years, and has conducted scientific research
on all seven continents.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.919
He now serves as a science advisor to Al Gore's
climate project.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.260
Dr. Pollack is here today to talk about his
latest book, "A World Without Ice.”

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.070
Following the talk, we'll have a Q and A session.
And please remember our remote audience at

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.370
that time, and use the microphone in the center
aisle when you're asking a question.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.791
And with that, please join me in welcoming
Dr. Henry Pollack.

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:54.320
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:07.620
Dr. Henry Pollack: Hello, everyone.
Thanks very much to Google for the invitation

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.500
to come and talk about my new book, "A World
Without Ice.”

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.520
I know there's a lot of excitement on the
campus at this very moment with Secretary

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:27.440
of Energy, Steve Chu, announcing the ARPA-E,
new energy grants that are going to play a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.620
big role, we hope, in mitigating the effects
of climate change.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.659
The introduction by your president just a
few moments ago over in the other auditorium

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.960
said that, Steve Chu is, you know, someone
who -- you know, some guy with a Scandinavian

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.380
accent called early in the morning one day
 -- and that, of course, was the reference

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.381
to the way in which people learn that they
have won the Nobel Prize.

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:08.500
As you just heard in the introduction that,
the 2007 Peace Prize was shared between Al

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.090
Gore, who had half of it, and the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, which I'm a member,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.810
got the other half.
So people said, "Did you get an early-morning

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.150
call from Oslo? Or Stockholm?”
And I said, "No, but I did get one from New

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.560
York.”
And they said, "What was that about?”

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.200
And I said, "Well, it was a -- kind of a faux,
Scandinavian accent, and it took me about

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.010
maybe ten seconds to recognize that it was
my son calling.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.251
He had just heard about the IPCC winning the
Nobel Prize on the radio, and he wanted to

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:52.599
be the first to let me know.
So there he was in his best Norwegian accent,

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.950
[imitating accent] "May I speak to Professor
Pollack," and such.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.069
So that's how I learned about the Nobel Peace
Prize.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.590
And I'm sure that Google has lots of Nobelists,
but maybe not two in one day within an hour.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.440
And so, it's a pleasure to be here.
Let me just say a little bit about myself,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.150
and then we'll get to talking about the book.
I'm an Earth scientist: geologist, geophysicist,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.300
climate scientist.
And I teach at a university, and do research

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:40.580
in wonderful places around the globe.
And I've found that it's been a hard sell

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.970
persuading the public that climate change
is real and that humans are playing a big

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.530
role in it.
These two facts -- that climate change is

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.040
real and humans are playing a big role -- are
very apparent to the scientific community.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.739
And yet, there's about half of Americans who
don't believe that it's happening, and certainly

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.019
don't think that people have anything to do
with it.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:12.440
And so, I've -- in addition to my scientific
work -- have tried to reach out and help people

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.900
understand the realities of climate change.
And part of that work has been working with

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.840
Al Gore -- who, I understand is going to be
here in just a couple of weeks with his new

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.460
book, which I had a chance to read and draft
for him about a month ago.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.690
But, I have been working with Al Gore in his
climate project, which is a project that is

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.720
designed to train community volunteers to
go out into their hometowns and talk at schools

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.970
and churches and rotary clubs -- whatever
audience they can pull together -- and talk

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.610
about climate change.
And so, I've been helping him in this training

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:02.259
program of bringing people to Nashville, that's
Al Gore's hometown, and a long weekend of

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.910
intense activity.
We send them back, and they become "climate

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.380
messengers," as we call them.
So, in that context, I'd also written this

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:25.620
book called, "A World Without Ice.”
And the book is about ice, climate, and people:

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.750
the role that ice has played in the development
of our landscape, in the development of Earth's

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.361
climate, and its effects on human civilization,
and the reciprocal impact that people are

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:46.090
now having on ice.
A theme interwoven throughout the book is,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.480
Earth's changing climate, both in the past,
present, and in the future.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.570
Now, why ice?
Why did I choose ice as a vehicle to carry

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.460
the story of earth's changing climate?
There are three principle reasons that I like

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.389
ice.
The first is that, ice plays a big role in

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.430
Earth's climate system.
In the polar regions where you have these

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.270
big expanses of white ice, basically, ice
is a very good reflector.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.960
Snow is too.
And if you've been skiing, you know you run

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.830
the risk of getting sunburned, not from the
sun coming from above, but from the reflection

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.449
off of the snow from below will give you a
lot of radiation.

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.210
So ice is a very good reflector.
And, as a reflector, it takes sunshine -- that

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.300
would otherwise warm earth -- and sends it
right back to space without it doing any warming

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.210
at all.
And so, the more ice there is, the less sunshine

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.520
Earth receives to warm it; and, the less ice
there is, the more earth receives.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:04.120
And so, the coming and going of ice is a big
piece of the global climate system.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.520
Secondly, ice is a sensitive and unambiguous
indicator of climate change.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.460
On Earth, ice is very close to its melting
point.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:23.259
And a few degrees warmer, and you get a substantial
reduction in Earth's ice.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:29.360
And likewise, if we were to have it be a few
degrees cooler, we would see an expansion

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.509
of Earth's ice.
But changes in temperature result in very

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:39.001
visible changes in the distribution of ice
on Earth.

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:46.970
And so ice, as a sensitive indicator, also
is a good vehicle to tell the story of climate

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.220
change.
And ice is also neutral as an indicator.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:58.020
This is the only reading from the book I'll
do for you, but in it, I say that, "Ice asks

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:06.569
no questions; it presents no arguments, reads
no newspapers, listens to no debates.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:13.060
It's not burdened by ideology, and it carries
no political baggage as it crosses the threshold

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.520
from solid to liquid.
It just melts.”

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:26.380
And that's why it is to be an indicator, and
it leads to big changes in the distribution

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.490
of ice on Earth with very small changes in
Earth's temperature.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:40.279
The third reason that I have chosen to tell
this story through ice is that, the consequences

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:50.769
of Earth losing its ice are very big.
The first ice to go will be the glaciers that

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:55.889
sit on top of mountaintops in tropical and
mid-latitude regions.

00:08:55.889 --> 00:09:04.290
And they are melting back very, very fast.
The ice on Kilimanjaro, which is very nearly

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.249
on the equator, will likely be gone in another
decade.

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:17.100
The ice in the Andes -- the equatorial Andes
and temperate Andes -- is shrinking fast.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:24.110
Glacier National Park will probably not have
its name sake, glaciers, in another two decades.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:31.899
The importance of this meltback is that, the
water that comes from melting mountain glaciers

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:39.250
provides the agricultural water and the domestic
water -- drinking and sanitation and the like

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:47.079
 -- for about a third of Earth's population,
is a tremendous resource that, once it's gone

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:53.189
 -- if you think there are water problems,
water shortages, and certainly you in California

00:09:53.189 --> 00:10:00.079
know about water shortages -- you will see
that same story all over the globe.

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:05.639
In the parts of Asia where the water supply
comes from the high Himalayas.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:14.699
In the Andes where much of Peru, Chile, Bolivia,
their fruit industry, their flower industry.

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:21.889
Much of that will be greatly distressed and
imperiled once the mountain ice is gone.

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:30.059
The other big consequence of melting ice is
that, eventually, it leads to higher sea levels.

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:33.529
When you turn ice into water, the water runs
downhill.

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:37.970
It eventually comes into the ocean, which
alone, will raise sea level.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:44.640
But, as the oceans themselves are warming
up, as the climate changes, they also thermally

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.089
expand.
And that is an additional source of sea level

00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:55.230
rise coming from the warming simply through
the physics of expansion of water.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:02.340
And so, those are the reasons that I've chosen
ice as the vehicle for this book.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:11.879
Now, I try and develop the story of ice on
Earth as a panorama through time starting

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:19.819
roughly at the peak of the last Ice Age, about
20,000 years ago.

00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:29.779
At that time, ice covered all of Canada and
North America, from the Canadian border down

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:34.420
to about the Missouri River in the west, and
the Ohio River in the east.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:41.230
And in fact, those two rivers were actually
the result of carrying away all of the melt

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:48.540
water from the last Ice Age, and they define
the southern limit of the ice.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:58.509
In Europe, ice came as far south as about
the midlands in the United Kingdom, and through

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:05.679
Central Europe and the like, and had mountain
glaciers in the Alps.

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:10.999
And, as a result, there was an immense amount
of ice.

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:17.769
But ice and water are what I call, "Playmates
on a Seesaw.”

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:23.910
And, when you have a lot of H2O tied up in
ice, you have much less of it tied up as water.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:29.579
And so, when you have ice on the continents
starting an Ice Age, you also have much lower

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:34.029
sea levels.
And, in fact, the ocean level at the height

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:39.319
of the last Ice Age, was about four hundred
feet lower than it is today.

00:12:39.319 --> 00:12:44.610
And it exposed large swaths of the continental
shelves -- which conveniently provided pathways

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:51.019
for humans to migrate from place to place
and from continent to continent.

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:54.209
The Bering Land Bridge was certainly an important
one.

00:12:54.209 --> 00:13:01.399
The English Channel was dry, and so, the communication
between the United Kingdom -- not yet the

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:07.230
United Kingdom but that terrain and continent
of Europe -- was just a walk.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:15.089
And throughout Southeast Asia there was a
lot of dry land that facilitated human migrations.

00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:24.380
And so, the high ice volume, low water level
was a characteristic of the peak of the last

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.519
Ice Age.
Now, how about the people?

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:33.549
At that time, they weren't many.
The total population of the globe, about 20,000

00:13:33.549 --> 00:13:37.709
years ago, was perhaps on the order of one
million people.

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:41.720
One million people.
Pick out your favorite city with one million

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.139
population, but imagine that spread over the
entire globe.

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:50.840
That's the population density of the peak
of the last Ice Age.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:59.279
Well, now, we have a different situation.
We've come out of the last Ice Age, and we

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:06.579
have seen ice reduced on the globe.
The main places for ice today are on the tops

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:16.679
of the high mountains in the tropics and mid-latitudes,
and in the big icecaps in Antarctica and Greenland,

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:21.049
and then, in the frozen sea ice of the Arctic
Ocean.

00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:26.079
The ice on the Arctic Ocean is not very thick,
it's just sea ice that has frozen.

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:30.819
But, those are the main places where we have
ice.

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:36.910
So we have reduced ice, but we have a lot
more people.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:45.149
From the one million people at the end of
the last Ice Age to the year about 1800, the

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:50.939
growth of population went from one million
to about one billion.

00:14:50.939 --> 00:15:00.959
1800 was the year when Earth first reached
the threshold of a billion population.

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:10.279
So that took, let's say, almost 20,000 years.
But the next billion, between 1800 -- the

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:19.739
next billion came in 1930 -- 130 years later.
And the next billion after that came in 1955.

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:26.100
And the next billion after that came in 1974,
when we reached 4 billion people.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:33.059
And today, we're approaching 7 billion.
And we'll reach 8 billion by 2025, or so.

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:38.109
And 9 billion perhaps at mid-century, depending
on which way the demography goes.

00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:43.739
That's a lot of people.
If you were to take Earth's population today

00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:53.470
 -- close to 7 billion people -- and try and
grasp how many people that really is.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:16:00.859
If someone were born every second, and no
one ever died, it would take more than 200

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:08.910
years to produce 7 billion people.
So it's an astounding rate of growth that

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.209
we've experienced in just the last couple
centuries.

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:19.569
Not only, of course, do we have a lot of people,
but they're a lot more clever than were the

00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:26.669
cave people and the people living on the fringes
of the ice during the last Ice Age.

00:16:26.669 --> 00:16:33.169
The people today have learned to use energy.
And I know that, in the other talk by Steve

00:16:33.169 --> 00:16:39.949
Chu, the subject of energy usage, the subject
of carbon-based energy, and the need to make

00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:47.729
the transition to non-carbon-based energy,
was under heated discussion when I left.

00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:54.929
So we have, not only a lot of people, but
they all use a lot more energy, and the energy

00:16:54.929 --> 00:17:02.519
let's them make a big impact on the Earth
as a whole.

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:11.110
The landscape of the Earth that we have admired
for a long time -- such as Yosemite Valley

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:16.819
here in California, the Great Lakes in the
Midwest, the Finger Lakes in New York, and

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:22.919
other characteristics around the globe, was
all carved by ice during the last Ice Age.

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:28.130
But today, humans are becoming a big rival
for Earth-moving.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.960
Currently, humans move more earth than rivers
do.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:38.159
And we have a process of mining going on in
the east today called "mountaintop removal,"

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:44.480
where they simply blast the tops off of almost
five hundred peaks now, or crests, in the

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.720
Appalachians, and dump the debris into the
surrounding valleys to be able to mine coal

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:58.720
that's a few meters under the surface.
So humans have become rivals of nature in

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.840
the ability to move earth.
We have interfered with the hydrological system

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:11.559
in dramatic ways.
We have dammed every major river in the USA.

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:16.279
There's not an uncontrolled river that flows
to the sea.

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:24.750
No longer.
And we have, not only added all kinds of chemicals

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.429
to the environment, but they are eventually
making their way to the sea as well.

00:18:29.429 --> 00:18:36.490
Currently, the use of agricultural fertilizers
and the chemicals that accumulate on the impervious

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:41.880
surfaces of our cities and are washed into
the sewer systems by big storms -- those make

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.830
their way to the sea, and are today causing
dead zones in the sea where the major rivers

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:55.559
empty into the ocean.
The coast off of Louisiana, where the Mississippi

00:18:55.559 --> 00:19:02.720
enters the sea, has very substantial and extensive
dead zones where, effectively, nothing is

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.380
living.
We've had big impact on our atmosphere.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:17.230
We have, you know, created smog that drapes
our cities and acid rain that falls on our

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:22.320
lakes and forests, killing both the trees
and the fish in the lakes.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:31.419
And, we have used the synthetic chemicals,
the chlorofluorocarbons -- put them to great

00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:40.130
use, but later discovered that they were destroying
ozone over Antarctica at a creation of the

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.690
Antarctic ozone holes directly linked to our
use of synthetic chemicals.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:53.990
And among other things that we've been putting
into the atmosphere are the greenhouse gases.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:20:00.429
Carbon dioxide is a direct product of burning
the carbon-based fuels: coal, petroleum, natural

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:06.730
gas.
And the carbon dioxide, for the most part,

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:11.009
is going into the atmosphere.
Some of it gets dissolved in the oceans, but

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:15.730
the oceans can't take it up fast enough.
And so, the concentrations of carbon dioxide

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:21.360
in the atmosphere have been growing.
We have known, from studies of ice cores,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.529
what the concentration range of carbon dioxide
has been in the past.

00:20:26.529 --> 00:20:34.860
Through ice ages and periods between ice ages,
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has oscillated

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:42.650
between about 200 and 300 parts per million.
Today, the concentration in the atmosphere

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:49.530
is well out of that range of natural variability.
We are at 390 parts per million and adding

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:56.360
two or three parts per million to the atmosphere
every year under our current industrial economy.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:03.419
And so, humans are embarked on a vast experiment
 -- an inadvertent experiment with the chemistry

00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:08.919
of our atmosphere -- and the nature of that
chemical experiment is also one that is an

00:21:08.919 --> 00:21:14.580
experiment with our climate.
And, because the greenhouse gases trap heat

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.789
trying to leave Earth, the atmosphere warms,
the surface warms.

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:27.669
And it is that warming that is having its
impact on the ice of the world.

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:32.840
And so, what is happening to the ice?
As I mentioned earlier, mountain glaciers

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:38.720
everywhere are retreating.
And it's likely that most mountain glaciers

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:47.870
in the world will be gone before mid-century.
We also see big changes in the sea ice of

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:52.049
the Arctic Ocean.
The Arctic Ocean, I mentioned earlier, is

00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:55.620
just frozen sea water.
That's the icecap on it.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:04.309
It's on the order of oh, 15 feet thick in
many places, a little thicker sometimes in

00:22:04.309 --> 00:22:08.321
other places.
But in the summertime, there's a little bit

00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:14.570
of a breakup of the sea ice in the Antarctic,
until the last few decades when there's far

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.200
more than little bit.
The area of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean in

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:27.149
the summer has been shrinking dramatically
over the last few decades, until today, about

00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:35.059
only sixty percent of the area of summertime
sea ice that formerly existed is present today,

00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:38.899
and its thickness has been reduced by about
half.

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:45.659
The net result of that is that, the Arctic
Ocean is much more open, and the sunshine

00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:49.860
that might have been reflected away by the
white sea ice is now being absorbed by the

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:56.820
dark sea water and warming the Arctic Ocean.
What that does is, it prevents the freezing

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.419
in the fall.
It pushes it back a few months later into

00:23:01.419 --> 00:23:06.659
the fall.
And it also leads to earlier breakup.

00:23:06.659 --> 00:23:14.450
So we're on a pathway, I think, to see an
ice-free Arctic Ocean in the summertime in

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.230
just a few decades.
And that will be a whole new regime change

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.860
in the Arctic.
There will be commercial interests that will

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:30.640
move in very quickly, searching for resources.
There will be fishery ships coming in and

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:37.129
scooping up the Arctic fisheries resource.
There will be trade routes open up.

00:23:37.129 --> 00:23:43.389
The fabled "Northwest Passage" and the "Northeast
Passage" will become reality, and lead to

00:23:43.389 --> 00:23:50.059
much more sea traffic in the Arctic Ocean.
And so, big changes just due to the loss of

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:56.950
sea ice in the Arctic Ocean.
Then, of course, comes the rise of sea level.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.429
Sea level rice is not something of the future;
it's already happening.

00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:05.480
Sea level has risen about eight inches in
the 20th century.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:12.690
And the projections of the IPCC -- and I'll
come back to how conservative they are in

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.409
a minute.
The IPCC said that you can expect another

00:24:17.409 --> 00:24:28.049
two feet of sea level rise in the 21st century.
Now, that is far and away a lower bound in

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:33.049
my mind.
Because we're learning a lot of things about

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:40.360
how rapidly ice is leaving Greenland and Antarctica,
and popping into the ocean.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:48.139
The IPCC calculation of what we could expect
in sea level was basically a melting calculation:

00:24:48.139 --> 00:24:52.700
How fast Greenland would melt, how fast Antarctica
would melt, and that water would eventually

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.029
make its way to the sea.
But you don't need to wait for ice to melt

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:01.429
to raise sea level.
If you drop an ice cube into a beverage glass,

00:25:01.429 --> 00:25:06.460
you'll see that the level in the beverage
glass rises right away.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:14.690
And we're now witnessing wholesale loss of
ice from both Greenland and west Antarctica.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:21.091
Greenland has the equivalent of about 20 feet
of sea level rise with its ice and West Antarctica

00:25:21.091 --> 00:25:25.960
the same.
East Antarctica is a much bigger pile of ice,

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.340
and it stands much higher.
And it's going to take a lot more to destabilize

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:35.340
that.
But Greenland and West Antarctica are already

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.870
losing their ice at faster rates than the
IPCC had predicted.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:48.279
Now, the IPCC understood why its projections
were on the low side.

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:57.130
Because, already, the rapid acceleration of
ice off of Greenland was visible and the same

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:02.409
in West Antarctica.
And the reason being that, there is a lot

00:26:02.409 --> 00:26:10.269
of summertime melting of the top of the ice
sheet, and the water was finding its way down

00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:15.820
through fishers to the base of the ice sheet
and lubricating the base of the ice sheet.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:22.269
And it was slipping off much faster than simply
melting from the top.

00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:28.039
In the Antarctic, some of the big ice shelves
that are simply glacial ice that spilled off

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:35.419
the continents onto the sea -- they too are
becoming unstable, because the sea water is

00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:40.879
warming and eroding them from below and thinning
them and breaking them up.

00:26:40.879 --> 00:26:47.379
And so, my guess is that, we're more likely
to see something on the order of three to

00:26:47.379 --> 00:26:53.740
six feet of sea level change in the 21st century.
Now, what would that mean?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.750
What would three feet of sea level change
mean?

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:04.870
Well, it means that you would lose about the
southern 20 percent of Florida.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.929
It would be reclaimed by the sea.
All of the Florida Keys would be gone.

00:27:08.929 --> 00:27:16.030
Much of the gentle, Atlantic seacoast of the
Carolinas and Georgia would see big incursions

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:22.279
of the sea.
But the human tragedy is big.

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:28.660
If you look at how many people live within
three feet of sea level the world over, you'll

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:38.799
discover that the number's about 100 million.
And we experienced the social problems of

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:46.210
dealing with dislocated people, with the people
in New Orleans, following Hurricane Katrina.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:52.170
We had about a 150,000 people that were climate
refugees.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:59.720
The number of people affected by three-foot
rise in sea level is about 100 million people

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:07.159
worldwide.
And that's a social challenge and international

00:28:07.159 --> 00:28:13.039
challenge of the first order.
And it gives urgency to all of the things

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:23.149
that Secretary Chu is talking about in the
other auditorium just a few moments ago.

00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:31.600
Some people say that we should not let the
concentration of greenhouse gases reach beyond

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.789
450 parts per million -- that really bad things
start to happen then.

00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:42.919
Currently, we are at 390, and increasing at
around three parts per million every year.

00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:46.279
Well, you can do the arithmetic.
I know that people at Google are good at doing

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:50.549
arithmetic.
There's sixty parts per million to work with,

00:28:50.549 --> 00:29:00.399
and if we're adding three parts every year
 -- that gives us about two decades to stabilize

00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:04.029
our emissions of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.

00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:13.190
And, that may sound like a long time, but
two decades to totally reinvent the energy

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:18.230
usage -- energy supply -- around the world,
is a big challenge.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:22.879
Now, I was listening to Secretary Chu, and
he was asked the question, "Well, are you

00:29:22.879 --> 00:29:28.019
optimistic?”
And in some ways, I am optimistic.

00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:36.909
Because I know that, once you get people's
attention in serious ways, that they can respond

00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:44.230
very impressively.
I'm old enough to remember World War II when

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.190
U.S. was suddenly hit over the head with a
two by four.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:58.100
That was our entry into World War II.
And, all the best at industry was ended and

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:04.570
converted to a wartime industry.
No more passenger automobiles.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:10.340
No more refrigerators.
No more appliances.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:19.649
Every bit of industry was turning to build
airplanes, tanks, vehicles, artillery.

00:30:19.649 --> 00:30:29.009
And, in just one year, the transformation
was so dramatic, that one aircraft factory

00:30:29.009 --> 00:30:36.070
near my hometown in Michigan -- one aircraft
factory -- was making more airplanes than

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.590
all of Japan.
And that was a transformation of dramatic

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.470
proportions.
But it took something to get our attention.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:51.549
And I think that we need to pay attention
now.

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:54.580
That's one of the reasons that I wrote the
book.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.610
And it's one of the reasons that I try and
talk in various venues around the country

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:06.090
 -- even around the world for that matter.
To make people very aware that we don't have

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:13.779
a lot of time to dillydally, and that there's
a real sense of urgency in making a transformation

00:31:13.779 --> 00:31:19.009
to non-carbon-based energy.
If we do that, we'll still be able to retain

00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:22.549
our ice.
If we don't do that, then you're going to

00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:28.600
get what I have as the title of my book, a
World Without Ice.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.499
With that, I'm going to stop talking.
And I'd love to have some discussion with

00:31:33.499 --> 00:31:40.820
you, and to hear your thoughts and your questions.
And let's have a good chat.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.820
Thank you very much.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.620
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:51.559
Dr. Henry Pollack: What's the custom here
at Google?

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:56.639
Does anyone just stand up and go to the mic,
or whatever?

00:31:56.639 --> 00:31:59.230
All right.
We have a volunteer.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:14.240
Q So, I think one difficulty that we face
on this issue is basically communicating sort

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:21.369
of, What exactly the sort of global threat
that we're envisioning if we get to 450 parts

00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:26.309
per million to the general population?
Because it seems kind of abstract.

00:32:26.309 --> 00:32:33.559
Dr. Henry Pollack: Well, it does.
And the reason that ice may not be a perfect

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:39.030
medium is that, the ice is a long way away
from where the people are, but the sea level

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:45.710
change affects the entire globe.
And so, the task is to have people be aware

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:54.499
that, what seems to be a remote issue, in
fact, is one that has very direct consequences.

00:32:54.499 --> 00:32:59.919
Q And, just to follow up, so it sounds like,
based on what you're saying that, kind of,

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:06.179
the direction that we're headed is maybe losing
lots of ice whether we get to 450 or not.

00:33:06.179 --> 00:33:10.510
Or maybe that's only if we get to 450, then
that's going to start happening.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:15.679
Dr. Henry Pollack: No, it's already happening.
We don't want it to go beyond that threshold.

00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:19.899
Some actually think 350 is the proper threshold.
We're already past that.

00:33:19.899 --> 00:33:24.940
They want to return as quickly as possible.
Bill McKibben is one who advocates that.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:34.639
But, I think that the answer -- the real question
you're asking -- is, we have to translate

00:33:34.639 --> 00:33:39.690
this into issues that are closer to home that
people do understand.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:45.961
And, in that context, I think that the global
financial crisis is a stroke of luck.

00:33:45.961 --> 00:33:51.391
Sorry that, you know, for all the people who
are out of work, that's no stroke of luck

00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:56.389
at all.
But it is kind of the lack in the head that

00:33:56.389 --> 00:34:03.269
I speak of where people say, "Gee, everything
we've been doing suddenly doesn't seem like

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:07.769
we really knew what we were doing.
So, maybe we can take bold steps now.”

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:15.399
And Al Gore said something like, you know,
"Our dependence on foreign oil and the security

00:34:15.399 --> 00:34:23.280
issues associated with that, our status as
the world's largest debtor nation, our financial

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.720
instability around the world, and climate
change are not four separate problems.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:34.730
They're all four facets of the same problem
 -- a misguided, national energy policy.”

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:43.399
So I admire the way that Steve Chu and his
colleagues in Washington are focusing on energy.

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:47.790
If we get our energy policy right, that's
something everyone understands locally.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:50.909
They don't have to think about polar ice to
get the message.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:58.170
So having that now as a vehicle to get people's
awareness and their creativity thinking -- going

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.750
 -- I think is a good step.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.190
Q Hi.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.069
Dr. Henry Pollack: Hi.

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:09.450
Q Thank you so much for coming.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.450
Dr. Henry Pollack: Thank you.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:15.349
Q So, if you see that a lot of these things
are already happening, and you could see the

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:22.549
change, my first question is, How do you still
sleep at night if you know that this was all

00:35:22.549 --> 00:35:23.549
coming?

00:35:23.549 --> 00:35:29.819
Dr. Henry Pollack: Well, it's a good question,
because I'm as concerned as any.

00:35:29.819 --> 00:35:37.050
And I don't lose sleep over it, but I do think
about it and try and think of, "What can I

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:42.559
do differently to reach more people to develop
an awareness?”

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:48.049
And so, while -- as I say, I'm not losing
sleep, but it has energized me during the

00:35:48.049 --> 00:35:55.700
day to explore as many avenues as possible.
And one of them, I should say, is that, people

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:02.001
say, "Well, what can I do individually to
help mitigate climate change?”

00:36:02.001 --> 00:36:08.430
And, of course, you heard all of it.
You know, we want to have our houses more

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.220
energy efficient.
We want to have our transportation more energy

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.000
efficient.
We want to change lightbulbs.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.270
We want to drive less.
We want to choose where we live so we don't

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:24.450
have to commute so much.
And all of those are important, personal decisions.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:32.049
I've even become aware of -- even rethinking
your eating habits is something that can have

00:36:32.049 --> 00:36:34.869
a big impact.
Because, of course, there's so many of us,

00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:40.890
and choices among foods have very real, energy
implications.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:48.500
But, I still think that the problem is so
big that it won't come from volunteers or

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:53.849
more individual choice.
We need both state and national policies and

00:36:53.849 --> 00:37:01.090
international policies that become from our
elected representatives, and so your vote

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:05.270
is very important.
If the people that go to Congress that represent

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:08.859
you aren't representing you on this issue,
you should let them know that.

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:14.339
And let them know, if there's an election
in 18 months, or whatever, and if they don't

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:18.510
establish a track record, you know, we're
going to work hard to move you out.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:25.680
So votes are important, and communicating
your impatience with your elected representatives

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.210
is important.
They do understand that they have to get reelected.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:35.910
And, if you cast it just that starkly, that
plays a big role.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:42.190
We're not going to do it individually; we're
going to do it through national and international

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.030
policy and leverage.
Thank you.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:54.819
Q Hi. I was wondering if you could -- I know
this is a complex subject -- but try and explain

00:37:54.819 --> 00:38:00.800
the cooling and warming model a little bit.
Because -- to me, who is sort of untrained

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.880
in this -- ice and carbon seem like two different
things.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:12.130
And if we factor out people, you know, you
talked about reflectivity, and that completely

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.451
makes sense.
I can see that.

00:38:13.451 --> 00:38:20.010
But, if I apply that to the past Ice Age,
it would seem like, "Oh, we'd never warm up

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.660
again.
Because as the ice got thicker and thicker,

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:27.369
we'd get more and more reflective, and then
there'd be nothing to tip the balance back.”

00:38:27.369 --> 00:38:30.650
And so, there must be something.
And so, I was wondering if you can kind of

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.650
unify that model?

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:35.329
Dr. Henry Pollack: Yeah, well, it's not my
unification.

00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:40.500
It has been, of course, studied intensively.
And, in fact, ice ages do end.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.470
And they're followed by rapid warming.
But part of the end of ice ages has to do

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.640
with orbital factors in the Earth and its
orbit about the sun.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:56.990
And that, the tilt of the Earth's axis -- which
is today about 23 and a half degrees from

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:02.990
the plane of our orbit about the sun -- that
actually oscillates between 21 and 24 degrees.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:11.850
And the shape of the ellipse about the sun
oscillates with a period about 100,000 years.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:17.880
And the procession of the equinoxes, which
determines which hemisphere is getting more

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:24.309
sunshine in June or December -- that has a
period in the low 20,000 years.

00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:28.809
And those factors are the big pacemakers of
the ice age.

00:39:28.809 --> 00:39:35.880
But, what we've noticed is that -- throughout
the ice ages -- temperature and carbon dioxide

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:40.569
have marched together.
Now, the lesson of that is that, the two are

00:39:40.569 --> 00:39:45.049
strongly coupled.
That the temperature and the carbon cycle

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:51.839
are tied together.
And whenever either one gets out in the lead,

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:55.800
it pulls the other along.
So, if the temperature were to warm, it would

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.910
pull the carbon dioxide up.
If the carbon dioxide is added, quite independently

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.980
of temperature, it would pull the temperature
up.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:09.950
In the current world, we are pulling carbon
dioxide way out ahead of temperature, and

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:16.050
the temperature is starting to catch up.
And so, yes, there are the long period, orbital

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:22.400
factors that play a role, but right now, we
are pulling carbon out of the Earth, and sending

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.080
it back to the atmosphere at a pace that it
hasn't seen for over a million years -- probably

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.080
many million years.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:37.690
Q So I can imagine how we can adapt to rising
sea levels and missing ice.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:44.330
I'm more concerned about ocean acidification.
I wonder if you have any insider words to

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:48.970
add about how dramatically the ecology of
the oceans will shift as the pH drops?

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:57.850
Dr. Henry Pollack: Well, there's quite a well-established,
observational data about the slow decline

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:04.049
in the pH.
And the oceans are still not acidic in the

00:41:04.049 --> 00:41:10.849
technical sense, but they're approaching -- they're
becoming less alkaline and approaching acidity.

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:18.110
And that, of course, does affect any of the
organisms that use calcification as the way

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:21.770
of building their shells or their reefs or
whatever.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:29.049
We're just beginning to see studies that show
that coral reefs are having trouble.

00:41:29.049 --> 00:41:34.530
Some of the bivalves on the ocean floor -- their
shells are thinning.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:39.680
And so, it's at a stage now where you're getting
all the early warning signs.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:47.700
But, just as we need to stabilize our emissions
into the atmosphere -- after all, that is

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:55.210
what is driving the decrease in pH in the
oceans is that, the oceans are asking to absorb

00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:00.990
more and more of the carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, and they do that, but it's changing

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:05.140
the pH.
Where it's going to take us is not so clear

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.060
to me.
I'm not a biologist, and I don't have that

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.690
insight.
But, it's a very real problem, because the

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:22.510
marine environment, of course, is a huge source
of human nourishment, and to see that be impacted

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:28.069
in this way is ominous.
Now, I might add that there are schemes afoot

00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:33.280
to block sunshine.
It's called geo-engineering or climate-engineering,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:40.900
by putting artificial pollution into the atmosphere
to reflect sunshine away or to spray water

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.640
vapor into the atmosphere to promote cloud
formation.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:50.880
All of that is to, kind of, mechanically interfere
with sunshine reaching the Earth, but that

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:58.109
doesn't do anything for the problem you cited.
If we're still pumping out carbon dioxide

00:42:58.109 --> 00:43:03.410
and trying to adjust climate by reducing sunshine,
the carbon dioxide is still going to go into

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:10.681
the ocean and lead to a drop in pH.
So I think that the geo-engineering or climate-engineering

00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:19.940
solutions are shortsighted if they focus only
on blocking sunshine.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.520
Q Apologies if you covered this earlier in
your talk, but methane is one of the other

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:30.360
large contributors to effects in the atmosphere.
And we have, you know, billion of tons of

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.150
biomass in the Arctic that's thawing out and
letting methane out.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:40.770
It seems to me that could have a pretty disastrous
impact on the behavior of the atmosphere and

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.410
I was wondering.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:48.950
Dr. Henry Pollack: The comment that, as the
regions around the Arctic are thawing out,

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:53.470
the permafrost degrading.
And that, there's a lot of methane locked

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:58.270
in the permafrost that's making its way to
the atmosphere.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:03.010
And that's all true.
And there is also methane stored in ice just

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:08.420
below the ocean floor, which has a huge amount
of methane that, if it were destabilized and

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:14.559
went into the atmosphere that, it too, would
add to the greenhouse gas burden of the atmosphere.

00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:20.319
About the melting of the permafrost -- once
again, kind of the first stage of measurements

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:26.130
in the permafrost lakes that are developing
 -- show -- yes, indeed -- there is a methane

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:33.020
flux.
And how fast that will penetrate -- the melting

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:37.849
will penetrate -- and release more, is the
big question.

00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:45.130
Most calculations of the diffusion of heat
downward to melt the permafrost and release

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:54.880
the methane, shows that it's not a fast problem.
It's one that would progress slowly and have

00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:02.220
a time scale that would be in the centuries,
rather than an immediate belching out of large

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:11.500
amounts of methane.
So while it's nothing to trivialize, it's

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:18.350
not something that's going to overwhelm us
with a very fast and furious feedback into

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:19.350
the greenhouse.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:26.960
Q I was, I guess, looking more at the Arctic
climate in Siberia as opposed to the one in,

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.280
say, northern Canada, because the biospheres
there were tremendously different.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.990
Dr. Henry Pollack: Well, the area that's been
studied -- at least that I'm familiar with

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:40.349
is, in fact, the Siberian permafrost.
That's where these early measurements that

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:44.690
I was describing first were made -- I'm sure
the Canadians are active too.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.920
But as you pointed out, maybe it's quite a
different biosphere.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.890
So I can't offer a lot of insight into that,
other than to say that, I think that the physics

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:58.960
of the destabilization is fairly slow. Yes?

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:06.001
Q Hi. I think it's great that there is more
consciousness, you know, around our problems

00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:10.329
and people are changing habits and there is
progress being made, but I still worry very

00:46:10.329 --> 00:46:15.600
much about the rate of that kind of progress
when you talk about hundreds of millions of

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.230
billions of people being added to the Earth.
When you talk about we're only sixty million

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:25.859
parts away from a really nasty threshold and
we're rising quickly.

00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:31.329
You talked about how quickly the -- in your
point on being optimistic -- you saw what

00:46:31.329 --> 00:46:37.079
happened in your town with the conversion
to military industrial capability.

00:46:37.079 --> 00:46:40.740
Where's the Pearl Harbor, though, that's going
to help us out this time?

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.579
Dr. Henry Pollack: Where is the Pearl Harbor?
Where is the two by four that gives us the

00:46:46.579 --> 00:46:54.369
whack?
I can envision two by fours.

00:46:54.369 --> 00:47:03.740
I can envision, for instance, a large dislodgement
of ice from Greenland that would raise sea

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:08.780
level, you know, maybe three or four inches
at one time.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:15.010
That could happen, and three or four inches
is a lot.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:25.050
When you think of what it means and increasing
the strength of any storm that strikes the

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.230
seashore.
The storm surges are bigger; the tides are

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:32.640
bigger.
Everything about it suddenly is augmented

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:38.569
by this half foot of sea level rise.
That maybe would get attention.

00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:49.640
It's hard to know what kind of an earthquake
that it would take to say, "Wow, this is,

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.069
you know, we really have to do something about
it.”

00:47:52.069 --> 00:48:02.529
And part of that, I think, has to do with
 -- people don't consider themselves strong

00:48:02.529 --> 00:48:09.670
in the face of nature -- that they are wowed
by earthquakes, that they've seen their actions

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:18.079
before, and that they say, "Woe is me.
You know, hurricane or tsunami or an earthquake.

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:21.109
You know?
Who am I in the face of powers of nature?”

00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:26.750
But what they don't realize is that, collectively,
all -- almost seven billion -- of us are now

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.950
the most powerful, geological force on the
planet.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:37.829
And it's that awareness that has to shift.
And that's a tough one, because it's a cognitive

00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:40.890
problem.
It's a sociological problem.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:44.150
It's not quite the same as a surprise attack.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:49.829
&gt;&gt; So I wanted to thank you for coming to
Google today.

00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:54.090
And, for those of you who got books, he'll
be signing books over there after this.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:55.281
So, thank you for coming.

00:48:55.281 --> 00:48:56.281
&gt;&gt; [clapping]

00:48:56.281 --> 00:48:57.281
Dr. Henry Pollack: Thank you.

00:48:57.281 --> 00:48:57.283
&gt;&gt; It's wonderful.
