00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.060
The world’s first horror movie begins with
a bat flying into a castle then magically

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.160
turning into a caped demon figure known as
Mephistopheles.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.660
It ends with Mephistopheles being chased out
by someone holding a crucifix.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.539
Okay, the Shining or Exorcist, it is not.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.450
But this 1896 film entitled Le Manoir du Diable
(or “The Haunted Castle”) directed by

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.150
legendary film visionary Georges Méliès
is generally considered the first horror movie

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.589
ever created.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.239
Featuring a boiling cauldron, a tiny minion,
phantoms, a skeleton, apparent suicide from

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.530
one of the terrified characters, and even
a witch, it certainly hits a few of the tropes

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.429
we are accustomed to seeing in today’s scary
movies.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.289
The film’s (for the time) state-of-the-art
special effects also adds thrills.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.899
And all of these screams are delivered in
a runtime of just under three minutes.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.680
It’s generally accepted that the first “movie”
ever was Eadweard Muybridge’s groundbreaking

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.859
1878 “Horse in Motion,”, which we’ve
covered in fascinating depth here.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:10.450
But the method used to capture the images
used in that one was essentially just high-speed

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.550
photography using multiple cameras.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.540
The result was more or less what we’d think
of as a very short animated gif, than a movie.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.540
It all changed, however, when Thomas Edison
visited Muybridge’s studio sometime in the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.620
mid-1880s.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.390
Taking a keen interest in Muybridge’s groundbreaking
work, but unimpressed by his execution, Edison

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.700
began to develop a device that “would do
for the eye what the phonograph does for the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
ear.”

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.060
Around 1889, the Kinetograph debuted out of
Edison’s West Orange lab.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.970
Despite Edison’s claims that he was the
one who invented what many hail as the first

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.720
camera to photograph motion pictures, historians
generally attribute Edison’s assistant,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.430
William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, as the creator
of this history-making invention.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.170
In 1890, Dickson shot a test movie he entitled
Monkeyshines No. 1, featuring the movements

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.280
of another lab assistant, with the result
being like something a ghost hunter would

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.910
use as “proof” that evil spirits are lurking,
rather than like the films that would soon

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.930
start to come out.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.120
Nevertheless, it’s generally given credit
for being the first official video camera

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.280
motion picture in history.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.560
It also inspired Edison to build what was
perhaps the first movie studio near his West

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.570
Orange lab.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.071
Calling it “Black Maria” because they
thought it resembled a police wagon, this

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:33.280
is where they shot hundreds of motion pictures
featuring vaudeville, magic shows, boxing

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.240
matches, and Wild Wild West stunts – included
among the latter is a video of Annie Oakley

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.930
showing off her prodigious skills with a rifle.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.680
From here, motion picture innovation took
off.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.140
In April 1894, the Kinetoscope Parlor opened
in New York City – essentially the first

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.140
public movie theater.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.480
Then, there was the first movie projected
for a wide audience, the first on-screen kiss,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.010
and the first theater permanently created
entirely for a film.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.350
In 1895, the Lumières brothers, who made
several groundbreaking advancements of their

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.030
own in film and video camera design, became
the first real film auteurs, making and exhibiting

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.540
films with short narratives – including
the famed 50-second short Arrivee d’un train

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.730
en gare a La Ciotat.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.290
They also debuted the first comedy film featuring
a gardener and his water house.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.050
With their revolutionary technology, the Lumières
brothers began attracting audiences from far

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.990
and wide, including shoe-maker-turned-illusionist
Georges Méliès, who attended one of their

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.560
screenings in late 1895.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.770
Méliès was born in Paris in 1861 to a shoemaker,
who fully expected his sons to follow in his

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.210
footsteps when he retired.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.770
Despite showing an interest in stage performance
at an early age, his father refused to support

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.130
him in this career and, after attending school,
Méliès dutifully settled into a career as

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.130
a shoe maker.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.580
Soon, though, his father did retire and handed
off the business to his three sons, including

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.580
Georges.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.440
Georges still wanted nothing to do with it
and promptly sold his share of the shoe business

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.910
to his brothers, using the money (along with
a sizable dowry from his wife) to purchase

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.520
an old run-down downtown theater called Robert
Houdin Theater.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.870
Méliès turned the theater into a popular
magic show venue, but he was always looking

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.739
for an edge and, upon seeing the Lumières
brothers’ demonstration of their magical

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.041
device that showed motion pictures, he attempted
to buy it off of them.

00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.320
The Lumières refused.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.139
So, Méliès built his own video camera with
the help of an engineer.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.370
Filming his illusions and playing them back
to the audience proved to be a big hit.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.150
He soon took his camera outside, filming street
scenes and creating narratives.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.439
It was supposedly in the autumn of 1896 when
Méliès discovered a significant trick the

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.039
camera could play when it jammed up while
filming.

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.590
In his own words,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.819
During this minute, the passerby, buses, carriages
had moved of course.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.870
When I projected the film, joined at the place
where the break had occurred, I suddenly saw

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.629
a Madeleine-Bastille bus changed into a hearse,
and men changed into women.

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.069
The substitution trick, called stop-motion,
had been discovered.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.680
This simple special effect became the basis
for “The Haunted Castle.”

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.240
While it’s thought of today as the first
horror movie, Méliès meant the film to be

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.099
more surprising and attention-grabbing than
anything else.

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.749
The premise is pretty nonsensical, obviously
intended to showcase stunning (for the late

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:30.620
19th century) special effects, rather than
any particular compelling story.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.539
As you can see if you go watch it, throughout
the nearly three minutes, images keep popping

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.720
up, disappearing, and turning into other things.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.449
A bat turns into a demon, girls turn into
witches, a bench suddenly has a skeleton,

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.880
and the thin air turns into a trident-wielding
goblin.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.069
At the end, a crucifix is used to chase the
demon character out.

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.430
Because of this ending and the general garb
of the evil protagonist, not to mention his

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.289
ability to turn into a bat, it’s sometimes
described as the first vampire movie.

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.099
Notably, Bram Stoker’s Dracula would not
be released until the next year.

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:07.289
Also, of note, one of the women in the film
is Jehanne D’Alcy – who would become Méliès’s

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.080
mistress and, later, his second wife.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.229
“The Haunted Castle” is not Georges Méliès’
finest film, however, just a very early effort.

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.309
His most lauded work is generally considered
to be A Trip to the Moon, a masterpiece that

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.629
is the direct ancestor of every science-fiction
ever made.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.610
It’s fantastical narrative about going to
the moon – including that iconic image of

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.729
the moon with a rocket stuck in its eye – has
inspired filmmakers ever since.

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.800
Georges_MélièsIn all, Méliès astonishingly
made around 500 films in just 14 years, or

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.819
an average of about 1 every 10 days.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.669
Unfortunately, only around 200 of these have
survived since.

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.080
While many were more highly regarded than
1896’s Le Manoir du Diable, none but that

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.639
can stake the claim as being the first horror
movie ever.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.889
As for Méliès himself, a series of missteps,
an inability to adapt to new film sales models,

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.819
and WWI would ultimately see the once extremely
prosperous filmmaker impoverished and working

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.249
in a little toy/candy booth in Montparnasse
train station in Paris.

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:11.280
If this story all sounds familiar, perhaps
you’ve seen the film Hugo, which is based

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.539
on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret,
which in turn is loosely based on the life

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:51.770
of Georges Méliès.
