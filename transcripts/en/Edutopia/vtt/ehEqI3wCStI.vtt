&gt;&gt;Marco: Guys, let me have one more
picture, 'cause I just realized,

00:00:11.106 --> 00:00:11.986
when you guys win the Grammy,

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:14.966
you guys need a good picture
to have up on the top.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These nine students from
diverse backgrounds came together

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:21.036
for the first time to participate
in a creative experiment

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:23.436
at the NAMM music convention
in Anaheim.

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:26.196
&gt;&gt;Marco: We have students
from four different schools.

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:30.866
We have a combination of an opera
singer to hip hop producers.

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:33.356
We have coupla brass players.

00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:34.376
We have a guitar player.

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:36.456
We have a couple of rappers.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:40.826
So we'll see in this big
stew what actually comes up.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:43.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They would have
just six hours to create

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:47.186
and record an original tune and
produce a music video about it,

00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:49.906
aboard a high tech
rolling recording studio,

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:52.406
the John Lennon educational tour bus.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.706
&gt;&gt;Steve: And whenever we actually
finish recording the song,

00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:56.656
we normally come up here.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.896
They all sit here, have
the engineer sitting here,

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.546
and we will create the music video,

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:03.106
using these computers
here in the front studio.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:07.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The bus has been on the
road since 1998, stopping at schools

00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:10.096
and events around the
country, offering small groups

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:12.836
of students a glimpse of the
world of professional recording

00:01:12.836 --> 00:01:16.056
and video making, and an
opportunity to collaborate

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:19.066
with top flight recording
artists and skilled engineers.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.426
&gt;&gt;Herminio: Imagine
peace, Paz, Imagine peace.

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:22.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: All for free.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:22.836
&gt;&gt;Boy: That's what we needed.

00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:27.206
&gt;&gt;Brian: Our whole reason for
being is to supplement, support,

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:31.236
and inspire music and video
programs, and teachers

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:32.496
and communities and leaders.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:34.876
&gt;&gt;Boy: You guys, can everybody hear
themselves while they're playing?

00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:37.316
&gt;&gt;Brian: The more opportunities
we can expose young people to,

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:41.996
the more chances they have to
imagine themselves as successful,

00:01:42.396 --> 00:01:44.996
professional, happy, creative people.

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:47.386
&gt;&gt;Rob: I mean, whatever sound
you want, we can give you.

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:52.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Engineers Rob Healey,
Herminio Quiros and Steve Miller live

00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:54.266
on the bus for ten
months out of the year.

00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:58.486
At each stop, they serve as
mentors, showing students how

00:01:58.486 --> 00:01:59.466
to run the high tech gear.

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.346
&gt;&gt;Rob: You're going for a
string sound there, man?

00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:04.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And helping to
jumpstart the creative process.

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:07.546
&gt;&gt;Rob: If we get, you know, a little
tiny riffle, decide if that's chorus

00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:09.956
or not, and then we can
even move on from there.

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:13.516
&gt;&gt;So have you guys been working
on any riffs or anything lately?

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:15.016
&gt;&gt;Boy: We had this one.

00:02:15.486 --> 00:02:23.926
I don't know about this one,
but it's like [plays guitar].

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.236
&gt;&gt;Irving: At first it
was just hard, you know,

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:28.126
trying to get the different genres
and stuff, trying to collaborate,

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:29.786
and then everyone had
different ideas,

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:31.526
from their background
or whatever they played.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:36.466
So we just-- we just--

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:41.056
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Everybody brought
something to the table.

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:42.816
&gt;&gt;Irving: Yeah, to the tables.

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:45.236
&gt;&gt;Marco: To me, the
fundamental component

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:47.926
of creativity is one's
ability problem solve.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:52.066
And I think that in any creative
project that you go into,

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.656
whether it's movie, whether it's
music, whether it's photography,

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:58.646
design, math, science, social
studies, language arts,

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:02.886
I think at the basic core is
your ability to problem solve,

00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:06.406
and I think that this gives kids
the confidence to take risks.

00:03:06.456 --> 00:03:08.236
&gt;&gt;Boy: I like writing
about what's true.

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:09.436
I don't like writing
about what's fake.

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:11.976
&gt;&gt;Ryan: The tools that
you learn through music,

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:14.566
like you can apply to
any aspect in life.

00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:16.776
I mean, 'cause you have
to have discipline,

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:18.896
like 'cause sometimes
you know, like dang,

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.776
I can't go out party this weekend.

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:22.606
I gotta record, I gotta
practice, you know what I mean?

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:24.076
So you get discipline.

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:25.906
&gt;&gt;Boy: Oh, do you wanna
do like the last measure--

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:28.646
&gt;&gt;Mike: One of the great
untold lessons of music is

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:31.736
that when a kid learns music,
the kid learns how to learn,

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:34.926
and that's a lesson then can be
applied to the study of mathematics

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.216
or language or history or
anything else, because learning how

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.776
to learn is the secret
to successful education.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:43.776
&gt;&gt;Rob: You guys ready to do this?

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:48.966
All right, Five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:53.516
&gt;&gt;Fernando: Building their character,
showing people how to analyze,

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:57.866
how to proscribe solutions
to difficult problems.

00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:00.546
I think they're lifelong
lessons that carry

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:02.496
on to everything that you do in life.

00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:05.596
&gt;&gt;Rob: All right, guys,
let's start it again here.

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.186
&gt;&gt;Fernando: So even
though I'm teaching music,

00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:09.416
I'm trying to teach more than that.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.906
You know, I think it's more
important than the notes on the page

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:14.236
or the performances
that come out of kids.

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:16.476
If you just hear the
kid playing a song,

00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:19.246
then you miss the whole picture.

00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:27.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With the rhythm
and solo tracks laid down,

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:28.816
it's time to record the vocals.

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:30.076
&gt;&gt;Boy: -- that you will live to tell.

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:32.596
I've been through a lot
growing up through these years,

00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:35.026
but the knowledge that I
gained, I said, we're my peers,

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:36.426
teenagers and we won't stop.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At most bus stops,
renowned recording artists

00:04:38.956 --> 00:04:44.646
like Al Jarreau swing by to
add their talent to the mix.

00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:48.696
Today's guest artist is Casey Brown.

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:49.266
&gt;&gt;Casey: Nice voice.

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:53.526
So are you wanting to do that, and
you want me to harmonize with you,

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:54.656
or do you want me to do that?

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.646
&gt;&gt;Boy: Whatever, whatever works.

00:04:57.646 --> 00:04:59.226
&gt;&gt;Casey: I think you should do that,
and then I'll harmonize with you.

00:04:59.226 --> 00:04:59.976
&gt;&gt;Boy: Let's do that,
that'd be sweet.

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:01.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After the
audio tracks are recorded,

00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:04.946
the musicians switch hats and
become video producers and actors,

00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:08.936
lip syncing a stage performance
and scouring the surrounding area

00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:11.886
for additional footage to
integrate into the final piece.

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:15.606
&gt;&gt;Rob: The second half of the day
is always spent shooting video

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:16.946
and editing the video.

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:19.486
So Miguel is editing.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.996
He had a bunch of stuff
already laid out

00:05:20.996 --> 00:05:23.196
and had been using
the rough audio mix,

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:26.856
while Herm is completing the
final mix in the back studio.

00:05:27.056 --> 00:05:29.056
&gt;&gt;Miguel: I'm syncing the
footage with the song,

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:32.126
so I'm trying to put it all together
so that-- so it goes flawless,

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:34.996
so you won't be able to notice what's
going, or if it's right or wrong,

00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:38.266
which is why I just wanna
capture like the whole thing.

00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:40.356
Oh, that was nice.

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:42.186
&gt;&gt;Marco: Giving the
students an opportunity

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:46.956
to learn both the audio part of
storytelling or the audio part

00:05:46.956 --> 00:05:49.126
of communicating, as
well as the visual part

00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:50.686
of communicating is
extremely important.

00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:53.466
So if the kid wants to tell
a sad story, then they know

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:57.786
that they can pull an A minor
chord and visually, there's colors

00:05:57.786 --> 00:06:00.426
that you would choose and
color palette to communication.

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.026
&gt;&gt;Miguel: We're trying
to like final style.

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:04.796
We were going for more like the
kinda gritty black and white.

00:06:05.416 --> 00:06:08.226
&gt;&gt;Marco: Regardless of whatever
field these kids choose to go to,

00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:11.526
these are skills that they'll be
able to bring to their jobs and say,

00:06:11.526 --> 00:06:12.856
"Hey, this is what I can do."

00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:16.976
I can communicate in English,
Spanish and multimedia.

00:06:20.106 --> 00:06:20.456
&gt;&gt;Herminio: Cool, right?

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:21.086
&gt;&gt;Boy: That's awesome.

00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:22.696
&gt;&gt;Boy: Sounded good.

00:06:22.896 --> 00:06:25.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The bus only accommodates
a small group of students

00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:28.456
at each stop, but it's an
exemplary learning experience

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:30.686
that can be replicated at any school,

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:33.186
with a relatively small
investment in hardware.

00:06:33.316 --> 00:06:36.256
And while these students
may not strike it rich

00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:38.836
in the recording industry,
their experience this day

00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:41.916
and their connection
to music is priceless.

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:44.066
&gt;&gt;Marco: Mr. Fingers, here we
go, Mr. Bernal, right here.

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:45.626
&gt;&gt;Mike: There are a lot of kids

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:48.316
for whom music is their
ticket to stay in school.

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:49.966
It's what'll motivate 'em.

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:51.446
It'll what'll keep them interested.

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:55.306
And when public policy officials,
whether they're governors

00:06:55.306 --> 00:06:59.136
or legislators start thinking
about cutting arts programs

00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:01.336
and music programs, they
need to think again.

00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:04.686
&gt;&gt;Marco: Here it is, ladies
and gentlemen, the video.

00:07:04.686 --> 00:07:05.766
See "Paz."

00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:26.836
&gt;&gt;Man: Most of my students do not go

00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:29.246
on to become movie
producers or musicians.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.976
They go on to their
other professions,

00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:37.046
but I know that having had this
experience, the kids learn how

00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:42.076
to work with others, how to convince
others of the concept that they have,

00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:43.816
how to listen and bring in ideas.

00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:47.876
And I think those are
very valuable lessons.

&gt;&gt;Adrian: Me personally, I feel that
this bus itself gives a lot of hope

00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:04.906
for dreams that a lot of youth have
themselves in music and photography

00:08:05.096 --> 00:08:07.766
and film productions, because
it shows that, you know,

00:08:07.766 --> 00:08:09.226
there's a chance out there, and it's

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:11.956
about just going for
what you love to do.
