00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.750
Find the probability of rolling
even numbers three

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.740
times using a six-sided die
numbered from 1 to 6.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.860
So let's just figure out the
probability of rolling it each

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.490
of the times.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.020
So the probability of rolling
even numbers.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.690
So even roll on six-sided die.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.310
So let's think about
that probability.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.360
Well, how many total
outcomes are there?

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.180
How many possible rolls
could we get?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.119
Well, you get one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.890
And how many of them satisfy
these conditions, that it's an

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.420
even number?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.990
Well, it could be a 2,
it could be a 4, or

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.440
it could be a 6.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.160
So the probability is the events
that match what you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.830
need, your condition for right
here, so three of the possible

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.680
events are an even roll.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.310
And it's out of a total of
six possible events.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.700
So there is a-- 3 over 6 is
the same thing as 1/2

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.070
probability of rolling
even on each roll.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770
Now they're going to
roll-- they want to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.860
roll even three times.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.770
And these are all going to
be independent events.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.260
Every time you roll, it's not
going to affect what happens

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.380
in the next roll, despite what
some gamblers might think.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.730
It has no impact on what happens
on the next roll.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:30.160
So the probability of rolling
even three times is equal to

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.670
the probability of an even roll
one time, or even roll on

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.410
six-sided die-- this thing over
here is equal to that

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.210
thing times that thing again.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.510
All right, that's our first
roll-- we copy and we paste

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:01.090
it-- times that thing and then
times that thing again.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.410
Right?

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.560
That's our first roll,
which is that.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.470
That's our second roll.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.210
That's our third roll.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.540
They're independent events.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.150
So this is going to be equal to
1/2-- that's the same 1/2

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.560
right there-- times 1/2
times 1/2, which is

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.240
equal to 1 over 8.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.080
There's a 1 in 8 possibility
that you roll even numbers on

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.620
all three rolls.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.420
On this roll, this roll,
and that roll.
