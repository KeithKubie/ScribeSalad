00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.659
&gt;&gt;presenter: Good afternoon, everyone. It's
a nice, sunny day. It's a actually Bloomsday

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.711
for the James Joyce fans among us, and it's
also the day for another outstanding green

00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:15.290
and Google Talk. So, it is my great pleasure
to introduce Jeff Goodell. Three of the five

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.210
main arms of the google.org deal with sustainability
issues and finding renewable resources and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.100
renewable energy that costs less than coal-powered,
for example. And so, we're always very keen

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.070
on new ideas on, in the sustainability and
the environmental front. And Jeff brings us

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.530
today a particularly compelling story, in
this case, on geoengineering and its effects

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.780
and its potential solutions for the global
warming issues. So, Jeff is a contributing

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.900
editor to Rolling Stone and he's an author
of a variety of books. And his most recent

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.220
book before this one was entitled "Big Coal"
and was a very compelling argument about the

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.160
state of emerging technologies to be cheaper
than coal energy. Using a frank tone and scientific

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.189
evidence, he helps us navigate the complex
environmental issues of our day, whether it's

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.830
through his books or through his columns in
the Rolling Stone. Now, Jeff is fresh off

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.039
a trip to the Arctic Circle--pertinent to
our talk today--so, the relationship there

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.500
is quite apropos. He'll be speaking to us
on his current book, which is entitled "How

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.100
to Cool the Planet: Geoengineering and the
Audacious Quest to Fix Earth's Climate." In

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.190
it, he discusses the state-of-the-art and
the emerging technologies on the geoengineering

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.409
front and its potential for a long term climate
solution. We'll have time for some Q and A

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.079
at the end, so please use the Q and A mic.
And without further ado, please join me in

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.079
welcoming Jeff to Google.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.280
[applause]

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:58.779
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Thank you very much, Cliff. Am I all
right here? Yes, I am just back from the Arctic

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:05.069
and at the end of the talk, I'll tell you
about my polar bear encounters. I just did

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.840
a two hundred mile cross-country ski trip
on Baffin Island across from Greenland, which

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.540
was quite wild and interesting, but not the
subject of the talk today. I want to talk

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.879
about this book, "How to Cool the Planet",
and this idea of geoengineering. And I think

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.069
that it's important to first make clear what
geoengineering is, since most people have

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.439
never heard of it. And geoengineering is--I
would argue-- going to be something, it's

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:46.019
going to be for the 21st Century, something
like nuclear weapons were for the 20th Century,

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.780
a big, disruptive idea that might, is likely
to change the way we think about our place

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.451
in the natural world and our relationship
with technology. And geoengineering, I think,

00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:06.640
is most simply defined as large-scale intervention
with the climate system in order to offset,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.069
or reduce the risk of global warming. There
are a couple ways to do that, which I'll talk

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.050
about in some detail, but the two basic ways
are to use technologies to block some sunlight

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.969
from hitting the planet and cool things off
in a very direct way, in the same way that

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:31.050
a parasol blocks sunlight. If you open a parasol,
it'll be to you even cooler, essentially throwing

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.189
some shade on the planet. And the other category
of geoengineering is technologies that can

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:45.640
suck CO2 out of the atmosphere directly. So,
there's two broad kind of categories of this

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.280
and I'll go into this, into some of the details
shortly. Though I think it's very important

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.780
to make very clear from the beginning that
this is not a simple solution, a simple quick

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:07.980
fix for global warming. This is not a substitute
for cutting emissions. This is a techno fix.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.670
It is a band-aid. It is chemotherapy. It is
all of these kinds of complicated technological

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.500
solutions for things that we should cure in
a more straightforward way, which is by cutting

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.520
emissions. That's how we deal with global
warming, by reducing the amount of CO2 that

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.860
we dump into the atmosphere. However, there's
a problem, which is, after 30 years of talking

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.260
about cutting emissions, we're still not doing
anything about it. Emissions are going up

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.750
more or less as rapidly as they've ever been
going up. I'm sure you all know about the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.710
problems with getting agreements on international
emissions reductions at Copenhagen and other

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.090
places and other international meetings. We
have not come to any agreement; we're really

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.360
not doing anything meaningful about this,
despite all the talk, despite all the investment

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.660
in green technology. The thing that really
matters, which is the amount of CO2 that's

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.819
going into the atmosphere is still globally
increasing more or less as rapidly as it ever

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.330
has. So, the question becomes-- so in a certain
way, geoengineering is a technical fix for

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.460
a political problem; sort of how I've come
to see it. And the question that this raises

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.960
is, is there a new way to think about this?
Is there something to be gained by thinking

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.720
about dealing with the risk of global warming
in a different way than we have? And what

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.979
are those risks and what are the consequences
of thinking about something as sort ofobviously

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:42.050
crazy and radical as trying to mess with the
Earth's climate in a very deliberate way?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.210
So, I thought the best way for me to talk
about this book and why I did it, is to tell

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.840
you a little bit about myself and my background
and why I did this; wrote on what seems to

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.610
anyone who thinks about this for two seconds,
a bold, reckless and probably crazy idea.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.150
And I think it's important to tell you about
where I came from and one of the places I

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.849
came from is like, right down the road. I
grew up here in Sunnyvale. This is a picture

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:19.000
of me at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk at age seven
or something. I lived here; I worked at Apple

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:29.890
in the very early days. I went to Berkeley.
And I grew up with this idea of technology

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.750
being able to fix complicated problems. It
was sort of something that someone like myself

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.389
who grew up around here, you come to really
believe in and really think about. And they

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.530
sort of, I often joke that they sort of put
it in the water, like fluoride around here,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:53.770
this kind of optimism about what technology
can do. And I proved a very little talent

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.390
for coding or any kind of engineering that
would, kept me around here. I decided I wanted

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:05.080
to go off and do other things and be a writer.
But in the '80s and '90s, I was drawn back

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.340
to Silicon Valley and did a lot of writing
for Rolling Stone and for New York Times Magazine

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.400
and other publications about the Internet
boom, about Netscape, about the early days

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:22.440
of the Internet, what turned out to be the
Internet bubble and I was a big booster and

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.159
a big believer and I always have been in the
power of digital technology to transform our

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:35.699
lives to help us think in new, creative ways
about various problems, about the social networking

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:42.660
and all this stuff. The one thing I never
thought about at all was-- I mean, I obviously

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.979
knew that this economy is built on electrons--
but I never thought about where those electrons

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:56.090
come from. If you grew up in California, you
don't see coal plants, you don't see, I remember

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:01.199
seeing the wind turbines at Altamont Pass
and we would drive by. Sometimes, we would

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:08.629
go out to Lake Shasta and see the dam there,
but I never really connected any of that to

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:13.960
this digital revolution that was happening
in the valley. I never gave any thought to

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.750
what the real consequences of these electrons,
of this electron economy really is. And then,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:26.479
in 2001, I was sitting at my desk in New York
and an editor at the New York Times Magazine

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:33.180
called me and asked me if I wanted to write
about the comeback of the coal industry, because

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.269
that had been around the time the Bush-Cheney
energy plan had been rolled out and it was

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:45.079
clear that there was gonna be a lot more fossil
fuels burned in America. And I hesitated and

00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:49.700
little thought bubble above my head said,
"What coal industry?" I'd never seen coal

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:56.140
in my life before. I had no idea, in fact,
that we even still used it. And I imagined

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.440
it was something that would comes out of Charles
Dickens's novels and things like that. I was

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.630
completely naive. I, of course, said-- I didn't
tell that to my editor-- I said, "Great."

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:14.290
And I went to West Virginia and I got my first
look at coal. And I discovered very quickly

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:21.230
that half the electricity in America comes
from coal; that coal is really central to

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:29.170
keeping our economy going. And it was really
an eye-opening little trip for me. I, this

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:35.269
is a picture of a mountaintop removal mine.
This is myself talking with an activist there

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:40.920
and it really, if I remember the first time
that I saw a mountaintop removal mine, I drove

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:48.990
out of Charleston and saw a big dragline;
it's like a bit shovel that they use in coal

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.870
mines to haul dirt around over the top of
the mountain. And I climbed up this mountain

00:09:53.870 --> 00:10:00.430
and looked down into a mine like this, and
this is, this photograph is a very small piece

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:07.920
of it, but they're these enormous mines; thousands
of acres huge. And it was really a stunning

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.160
experience for me because all of a sudden
I realized that these mountains were being

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.190
blown up. I saw the economic devastation,
I saw the environmental devastation in the

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:23.860
coal fields and I realized that this was the
underbelly of the digital economy. This is,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.681
what we're doing here, what you're doing here
at Google, is powered by this and there's

00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:33.350
a direct connection between those two. And
I had never thought about that way. I never

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:41.779
thought of myself as implicit in this whole
thing and yet, clearly, I was. And so I spent

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:46.680
a few months working on a big story that became
a cover story for The New York Times Magazine

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.670
about the coal industry. I learned about the
consequences of burning coal, not just the

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:57.510
destruction of the mountains in West Virginia
and Appalachia, but also air pollution issues

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.269
and most importantly, of course, global warming
because coal is the most carbon intensive

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:09.070
fossil fuel and it is basically the reason
that we're heating up the planet so quickly,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.250
is that not only the United States, but also
developing nations, like China and India are

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.139
burning a lot of coal. It's cheap, it's easy
to get out of the ground, we know what to

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:25.149
do with it and it is a big, big problem. So,
I spent, I decided that I had not really gone

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:28.880
deeply enough into coal. I spent the next
three years writing a book about the coal

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:37.000
industry and looking at the problems, but
also what might be done. Is, are we gonna

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.339
develop solar power, wind power, alternatives,
renewable energies quickly enough to displace

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:47.050
coal? How are we going to do that? What is
the sort of options with that? What are the

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.790
possibilities of capturing carbon dioxide
from coal plants, burying it, dealing, burning

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:57.050
coal in a way that makes it a suitable fuel
for the 21st Century? And basically, I came

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:02.089
to the conclusion that we're just gonna keep
burning coal the same old way for a very long

00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:08.690
time and we're basically going to cook the
planet with it. That, when you looked at the

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:14.350
large trends in developing nations and in
the US, the political problems of displacing

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.339
the coal industry, very, very many reasons
that we were not gonna come anywhere near

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:24.829
reducing emissions to these levels that climate
scientists were telling us we needed to do,

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:32.959
right? You all know about targets that are
being, that the IPCC--the Intergovernmental

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:37.360
Panel on Climate Change-- have set; that President
Obama talks about talks about that we need

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.850
to cut emissions by 80%by 2050, there's various
numbers out there to avert the risk of serious

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:51.449
climate change. And what I figured out from
my years with the coal industry was that we're

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:54.812
not gonna come anywhere near those targets.
There's no way we're gonna, we're gonna, we're

00:12:54.812 --> 00:13:01.350
going to meet those targets. And I finished
the book in 2006, in the four years since;

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:06.520
it's just been proven more true. We are just
not getting up the political moxey to really

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.420
do anything about this. Even President Obama,
who we all, who were involved in energy and

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.209
climate issues had great hopes that he would
really do something bold in the first term

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:25.550
on climate and energy, has really not done
much except talk really a lot about it. But

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:31.680
he hasn't really put his shoulder to the wheel
in any meaningful way. So, what I began to

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.470
think about was, "What are we going to do?"
This is just a, I'm just gonna show you a

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.529
couple of charts that hit me at that time,
which are the--and I promise not to give you,

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:47.709
show you very many charts at all because I
know how boring they are-- but this is just

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:57.760
shows you the red line is the worst case scenario
emissions that the IPCC projected. And you

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:07.459
can see that from the 2005-2006, were already
way above that. So, we're emitting CO2 more

00:14:07.459 --> 00:14:11.700
at a higher rate than we, that even the worst
case scenarios that we anticipated a few years

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:17.810
ago. And one of the important things about
this is that-- and I came to understand as

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.589
I was looking into this question of what are
we going to do-- is that I think most people

00:14:22.589 --> 00:14:28.920
don't get that CO2 is not like local air pollution.
When I grew up here, in Silicon Valley, I

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.580
remember how polluted the air was when I was
a kid; it was really bad. And then there was

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.970
various laws passed, catalytic converters,
various things happened and the air got a

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.180
lot better. You clean up the tailpipes of
cars, pollution falls out of the sky, you

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:50.320
breathe better, it goes away, it's all good.
CO2 greenhouse gases are not like that. CO2

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.750
remains in the atmosphere a large percentage
of it for thousands of years. It doesn't go

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:00.540
away when you stop turning off emissions.
If you stop burning coal, it doesn't go away

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:06.800
immediately. Plus, there's a lot of heat built
up in the ocean. The ocean acts like a giant

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.440
fly, we all absorbing heat and it's going
to continue radiating for a long time. So,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.459
one fundamental fact that I did not know,
and I think a lot of people who think about

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:21.709
the issue of energy and climate stuff still
don't quite grasp, is that even if we cut--

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:27.709
if we all went to skateboards tomorrow and
there was no vehicles, we cut emissions to

00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:33.440
zero tomorrow, this planet is still gonna
keep warming up for the rest, most of the

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.860
rest of this century. So, if we have to cool
things off, if for some reason we decided

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.360
we needed to actually lower temperature, like
Greenland is starting to melt in a very dramatic

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:49.301
way, what would we do? It's not gonna be enough
to say "no more"--not that this has ever happened,

00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:53.889
of course, anyway-- but it won't be enough
to say "no more coal, no more oil, no more

00:15:53.889 --> 00:16:04.920
fossil fuels." We're already locked in for
long-term warming. So, I came to think about

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.811
this thing called, I started hearing about
this idea of geoengineering. It was, I first

00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:17.579
heard about it in a talk, in a paper that
I read from a very, from a Nobel Laureate

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:22.370
atmospheric scientist named Paul Crutzen,
who published a paper about this idea of putting

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:29.259
particles up into the stratosphere. Basically,
the idea, he already agreed that we would

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:33.779
be getting into dangerous situation with climate
change. How would we, what would we do if

00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:40.319
we had to cool things off quickly? And he
came up with this idea of--it's not his idea--but

00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:45.700
he wrote about this notion that we could put
little particles of sulfur high up in the

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.610
stratosphere, 60,000feet or so, would act
like tiny mirrors, essentially doing what

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:57.800
volcanoes do. We know from history the volcanoes
cool off the planet. Mount Pinatubo which

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.440
erupted in the Philippines in 1991 lowered
the temperature of the Earth for about a degree

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.900
for a few years. We know that this works.
You put the particles up high in the stratosphere,

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.140
they reflect sunlight like little mirrors,
the sunlight cools things down and the reduction

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.920
of the sunlight cools things down, and you
don't have to reduce a whole lot to have a

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:27.380
meaningful impact. The common measurement
for climate sensitivity is to think about

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:33.303
doubling of CO2 emissions and what would that
do to the raising of the temperature of things.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:35.710
Well, to offset the warming of the doubling
of CO2 emissions, you only have to produce

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.560
one or two percent of the sunlight, so it's
just a little bit and it could have a big

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.600
impact. So, around two, three years ago, people
started thinking about this and people saying,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.100
"Well, we're not reducing emissions. Is this
a possible solution? Is this one way that

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.140
we might be able to at least buy ourselves
more time?" And I, like others, started thinking

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.440
about this. And this led me to a man named
Lowell Wood, here in the Valley. Actually,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:08.400
he was in Livermore at the time. And Lowell
Wood is a very well-known astrophysicist.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:15.290
He was Edward Teller's right hand man. He's
one, one partly responsible for the construction

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.730
of Star Wars Missile Defense System, the big
boondoggle that cost billions of dollars and

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:28.160
never quite got launched or worked in any
way, but was big part of the Reagan era defense

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:35.210
things. And I started hearing Lowell's name
and I decided to look him up and going to

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:41.340
see Lowell was like looking into the mountaintop
removal mine; a kind of transformative experience

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:48.620
for me because he is so brilliant and so crazy.
And you don't meet many people like that in

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.580
the world, maybe you do, but I don't meet
so many people who-- and he was brilliant

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.890
and crazy in the best kinds of ways. And he
really challenged my thinking about a lot

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.911
of this and his basic view is, "Look, the
physics of this work, we know how to do this.

00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:06.380
We're not gonna cut emissions; get used to
it. Welcome to the world of geoengineering.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:13.410
This is where we are going as human civilization.
This is our future." Cause he was very cynical

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.850
about the way politics works. He was very
cynical that we'd ever--any politician-- would

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:23.250
ever make a hard decision like saying, "Let's
put a cap on carbon." Something like that

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.970
that actually cost people money or seems to
cost people money. And so, and Lowell had

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:34.120
done some work on this idea of putting particles
up in the stratosphere and one of the things

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.890
that was really interesting that he had done
in, that with some modeling with a scientist

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:49.931
named Ken Caldeira at Stanford, is that if
you put enough particles in the stratosphere

00:19:49.931 --> 00:19:59.730
to cool the planet by a few degrees, you can
reduce the-- well, let me put this in a different

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:06.130
way. Some of the climate modeling shows that
if you look at impacts of doublingof CO2,

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:12.531
and then you try to, and then you do the same
kind of climate modeling with sulfur particles

00:20:12.531 --> 00:20:19.050
in the stratosphere, the amount of the geoengineered
world with the particles in the stratosphere

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:24.040
is more like where we're living now than it
will with doubled CO2. So, that's a very interesting,

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:33.100
provocative idea that maybe we can modulate
the sunlight a little bit and maybe we can

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.840
preserve the climate or cool things down or
reduce the risk of change by doing some of

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.150
these radical interventions, innovations.
Now, Lowell had some crazy ideas about how

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:49.320
you did this and one of his ideas was to put
a Kevlar tube in the Arctic or somewhere,

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.470
or near the equator; various ideas about where
and how to do this. But basically, a Kevlar

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.360
tube, it would pump these particles up into
the stratosphere at 60,000 feet, a tube that

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.910
was hung from a high-altitude balloon. He
also explored the ideas of using high-altitude

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:09.170
aircraft, not unlike the one that's hanging
in the lobby here as I walked in. They're

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:16.280
all, it's all ready to go here. The geoengineering's
all ready to go. A various, even some scientists

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.670
before have even talked about using artillery
shells to put it up there. But, the upshot

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.790
of all this was, to me, was that, and Lowell
was, when I asked him, "Well, Lowell, you're

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:30.250
messing with the climate system. What is this
gonna do to rainfall? What is this going to

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:36.700
do to possibility of droughts? What is this,
how is this going to, what impact is this

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.300
going to have on the oceans?" And Lowell's
like, "Oh well, we'll work that out. That's

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:47.390
not a big problem. We'll figure this out.
The point is we know how to do this." And

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.860
so, his brashness really opened my eyes and
challenged me. So, I wrote a Rolling Stone's

00:21:52.860 --> 00:22:00.441
story about him and this is just an example
of the volcano and how they work. This is

00:22:00.441 --> 00:22:04.380
from the recent on in Iceland, which was not
big enough to really have a big impact and

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:09.380
didn't put the aerosols high enough to have
a large impact. But one of the key things

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.740
that Lowell points out, and the scientists
who look at this point out, is that there's

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:20.170
a lot of leverage in doing this. All you have
to do is put five grams of sulfur in the stratosphere

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:26.400
and it basically offsets the warming of a
ton of carbon. So, you can see why the physics,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.970
the dynamics of this are very appealing and
very interesting. You don't have to put much

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:38.400
stuff up there in order to cool things down.
Now, this got me going to thinking about other

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:46.600
ideas and I came across this guy named John
Latham, who's a cloud physicist. He's, spends

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.850
his part of his time in England; part of his
time in the US. And he had been looking at

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:56.760
ship tracks. Now, this is a satellite photo
of the Atlantic and those little lines you

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:04.630
see are tracks where ships went. And what
happens is when the ships go in this region

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:10.771
of the Atlantic, the small particles from
the diesel fuel go up into the low level cloud

00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:16.770
area there and create, essentially, create
clouds in certain regions. So, these, these

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:22.500
particles act as cloud condensation nuclei,
basically giving the droplets, the vapor in

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:30.250
the air a place to condense and create low
level clouds. And these kinds of clouds; clouds

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.790
are very complicated in this sort of climate
dynamics, but these kinds of clouds in this

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:41.250
region reflect away sunlight. So, you had
to have the, a similar affect to the stratosphere

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:47.870
particles, except that they are clouds. Now
John got the idea that maybe we could do this

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:52.970
deliberately. Why not do this deliberately?
And he, along with an engineer, a quite brilliant

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:59.150
engineer in Scotland, came up with these idea
for these boats that use, that actually spray

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:06.820
salt water up into these areas where these
marine strata cumulus clouds can be brightened

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:14.630
and use the actual salt crystals in the salt
water as condensation nuclei. And they're

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:19.220
a lot of modeling has shown that this can
be very, very, have a very, very powerful

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:25.850
impact on cooling off the planet in a similar
way, although not quite as globally, as particles.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:31.050
So, I got interested in that. But I think
the most interesting scientist that I met

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.000
that really is the guy who got me to write
this book and who I actually just went to

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.120
the Arctic with--that's a picture of us, or
him in the Arctic just a few weeks ago-- is

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.690
a guy named David Keith, an engineer at the
University, a physicist at the University

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:53.130
of Calgary, Canada. And David is a really
brilliant guy, who's been thinking about geoengineering

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:59.430
as long as anybody and he had a lot of ideas
about how you would put particles in the stratosphere,

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.990
how these cloud brightening things might work;
he was also interesting in building machines

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.150
that could suck CO2 out of the atmosphere.
And one of the things that happened with me

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:14.830
and David is that he's about as hardcore and
a kind of environmentalist as anyone I know.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:20.290
And is very deeply connected to the Arctic
and to the North. And basically, made this

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:27.560
argument to me that if, that geoengineering
can be a kind of conservation tool; that if

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.620
you really care about, say, the Arctic ecosystem,
given the kind of front loading of heat and

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:39.160
warming that we already have, exploring geoengineering
is basically the, one of the only ways we

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.800
have to possibly preserve this ecosystem;
to cool things down. Cause otherwise, it's

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.480
more or less a goner this century. The Arctic
would, as we know it today, will not exist.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.960
And so, if you wanna think about how to, how
might we preserve that, then you have to start

00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:00.480
thinking about geoengineering. A day that
is, I was really moved by his connection with

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:08.480
this place. This is a polar bear we encountered
while we were up there. But it gave me a seed

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.900
that this tool, like many tools, it seems
scary at first, can be used in a variety of

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:23.430
ways that are not necessarily the sort of
the evil technologist taking over the planet;

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:29.630
that they might be used for preservation,
for traditional environmental purposes. And

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.650
this is just some climate modeling that shows
where the red is; actually, at the bottom

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:38.760
is the Arctic on the right. And that just
shows how you can actually grow back the ice

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:48.200
in the Arctic by seeding, in this case, 70%
of the cloud area of the oceans. You can actually

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.850
begin to grow back some of the ice in the
Arctic, not a lot of preserving, but you actually,

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:55.830
you can see what's happening, right? It's
about building a global thermostat; it's about

00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:02.940
building tools to modulate the Earth's climate
to actually begin to dial it in and to say,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:09.750
"Ok, what temperature do we want? Where do
we want this to be?" Now, this is a recent

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.430
rendering of a big air capturing machine that
David Keith is working on. He's been funded

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.470
by Bill Gates, and others to explore this
idea of building machine that can actually

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:24.430
suck CO2 out of the atmosphere and this is
a model rendering of one of these, what these,

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.930
one of these machines might look like. It's
very doable. It uses very straightforward

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:34.900
chemical processes. The problem with it is
that it's very expensive compared to traditional

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:42.100
ways of like getting CO2 from coal plants
or something. But, out of coal plant stacks.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:48.120
But, it is obviously something that just beginning
to be developed. I like to think of it as

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.780
an iron lung for the planet that could eventually
be-- the good thing about these things is

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.810
that you could put them anywhere. You can
put them in the desert, in wasted spaces,

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:03.260
pull the CO2 out, you could bury it underground,
you could do various things to it; use it

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.381
for industrial purposes and it gives us a
way to disconnect the removal of CO2 from

00:28:08.381 --> 00:28:13.650
energy sources. So, this is really important
to think about because this is, of course,

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.350
the big, the big issue, which is when you
start messing with something like the climate

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.820
system, what might go wrong? And one of the
really important things to say is that reducing

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:31.400
sunlight is not the same as cutting CO2. The
CO2 is, causes many other problems and among

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.530
them, most seriously, acidification of the
oceans, which is a very big deal and is having

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:43.120
a devastating impact on the food chain. So,
if you just throw up sulfur particles in the

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:49.870
stratosphere and reduce the heat of the planet,
you're still allowing high levels of CO2,

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:59.530
which cause acidification of the oceans. So,
that is a potentially devastating side effect.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:05.550
Shifting precipitation patterns around, a
lot of some modeling has shown that putting

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:10.901
particles in the stratosphere will have an
impact on the rainfall in the Amazon and in

00:29:10.901 --> 00:29:16.480
some of the monsoons and that you begin to
shift rainfall patterns around, you begin

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.160
to shift agricultural food growing patterns
around; could have huge impact on millions

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.910
of people, obviously. But the key thing to
think about with this is that it's not like

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:30.110
we're, this is a virgin planet, we're already
going to be shifting around precipitation

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:35.350
patterns, rainfall, by continuing to dump
CO2 into the atmosphere. So, it's not like

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.660
with this going to happen anyway. It may happen
in a different way and we can begin to think

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:48.220
about how this might be controlled, but it's
not like building condos in a virgin Redwood

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.400
forest. There's a whole issue of this is a,
just a suggestion, of nuclear war-- of nuclear,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:59.161
the parallels with nuclear power and nuclear
war and nuclear testing. The problem with

00:29:59.161 --> 00:30:05.670
geoengineering is that it, is it inverses
the problem that we have right now with global

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:10.010
warming and getting emissions reduced, which
is a collective action problem. Geoengineering

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:16.210
is a lone actor problem, sort of like nuclear
war in that you can have an individual nation,

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:21.500
a collection of nations, even a well intentioned
individual could potentially put particles

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.940
in the stratosphere, get a few airplanes like
the one in your lobby, again. Start throwing

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:32.840
particles up there. Well intentioned, perhaps,
maybe tired of the fact that, of our Western

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.600
civilization diddling and not doing anything
and saying, Okay. "Hell with it. I want to

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:42.570
experiment with this and try this." So, the
question is, what do you do if you have an

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:50.240
individual or a nation; China, India, collection
of smaller developing nations, who come together

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.960
and decide to do this? How do you react? What
kind of governance structure do you need to

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:01.530
restrain people? How would you, would it be
to trigger a war? What would it do? Because

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:06.450
this stuff is not that complicated and not
that expensive in the big picture to actually

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:14.440
do. And the other big question is who eats
the risk? Which is, when you start playing

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.460
with this, right? When you start playing with
the climate system there's going to be winners

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:24.140
and losers, just as there's going to be winners
and losers as we continue to warm things up

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.660
by dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. But what's
happening now is we're doing it unintentionally,

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:35.390
supposedly. Now, of course, it's intentional,
but for most part, this is an unintentional

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:40.510
messing with the system. When we start, if
we start doing geoengineering, then we start

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:47.310
actually saying, "Ok, we're going to cool
things to this level. We're going to try altering

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:52.370
things in this way." And then there are going
to be winners and losers from that. There's

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:58.280
going to be people whose rainfall patterns
change or even think they change. And how

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:06.850
do you deal with that? This is, this question
though, of who eats the risk is something

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.140
that's in the news even right now with the
oil spill, right? Here we had this whole question

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:16.460
of, where was the backup plan for what happened
in the Gulf, right? And you could ask a similar

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:22.350
question with climate engineering, which is
you can think of climate engineering as a

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:30.480
sort of backup plan if we get into a real
bad climate equivalent of a meltdown. What

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:35.960
might we do? And geoengineering is one thing
that we might do that could help mitigate

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:44.470
some of the risk to the rest of us. But it's
clear that if we do any kind of geoengineering,

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:48.140
this is not gonna be done by poor farmers
in Africa, right? This is gonna be done by

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.810
rich, technologically sophisticated nations
whether they're US, Western civilization as

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:57.390
we know, or, like I said, developing nations,
but it's going to be people who have airplanes

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:03.740
and climate models and things like that. And
so, how do you give people a voice in this

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.980
when you're messing with essentially the operating
systems for the entire planet? How do you

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.110
make this, in any sense, fair or democratic?
And these are governance issues that are just

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:20.140
beginning to be discussed now, even talked,
to be talked about seriously. So, let me wrap

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:29.700
this up by asking rhetorically this key question,
which is, is geoengineering just a bad sci-fi

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:36.730
novel writ large? Which is what it seems like
to most people who look at it and think about

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:42.110
it. And I think it's easy to argue that it
is. I think that's it's easy to argue this

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:47.770
is a very bad idea. It's easy to argue that
no sane person would ever voluntarily want

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:53.190
to do this and that the fact that we're even
talking seriously about it is an indication

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:58.790
of how screwed up our whole climate and energy
debate is right now. And you can certainly

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:05.530
argue that we, as human beings, have done
a bad job at managing the planet already.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.650
So, that it now, so now we're gonna be more
actively managing it, we're gonna try even

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.700
harder to get our fingers in the things where
we've already screwed things up enormously.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:23.940
I mean, this, just this photo for me just
is a symbol of the sort of artifice of mindless

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:30.860
expansion and mindless human development.
But one of the things that interesting about

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:36.361
geoengineering, I think, is that I came to
the conclusion that it doesn't have to be

00:34:36.361 --> 00:34:48.220
that way. That this, that there's an argument
to be made for mindful and more artful manipulation

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:54.500
of nature, to put it bluntly. And that consciousness
is doing, what we've been doing now is just

00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:00.630
dumping billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere
with no thought, essentially, about what the

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:05.990
real consequences would be. What happens if
we begin to understand how we might pull the

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:12.370
levers and the pulleys of the climate system
a little bit better? And one of the inspirations

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:16.110
for me and thinking differently about this
was and this is my daughter, Grace, who's

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:22.290
seven, who is a big gardener. Those are pumpkins
that she grew. And one of the things that

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:27.850
happens in our family, in our house, is that
we, my wife is a big gardener, my daughter's

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:33.770
a big gardener and this idea of a garden is
a very powerful metaphor, I think, for thinking

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:39.090
about how, what we might do with the climate--with
the planet and for what our responsibilities

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:47.370
are. Because a garden is a very powerful evidence
of this beauty of working with nature, of

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:52.860
human and natural partnerships together. These
pumpkins would not have grown this way, the

00:35:52.860 --> 00:36:00.910
whole, on their own if a product of my wife
and my daughter's care and attention and that

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:08.910
a well-tended garden is a beautiful thing
and that this could be extended as a metaphor

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:14.610
for how we think about our relationship with
the planet. Can we become better engineers?

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:20.460
Can we become better gardeners? Because I
think, to wrap this up, I wanna say just two

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:26.760
things. One is that my conclusion at the end
of this was that we are going to geoengineer

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.770
the planet; that Lowell was right. This is
our future, but if we admit it or not, this

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:37.980
is gonna happen because we are just not dealing
with this problem in any other way. But even

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.320
more broadly, that this is something that
we, as human beings, do. We mess with the

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.930
world we live in and we try to control the
world that we live in. We control the buildings

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:52.130
we live in, we control the temperature here;
we're getting to a point where we're going

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:59.450
to have to learn how to control the climate
because otherwise, we're not gonna survive,

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:05.190
broadly speaking. Not you and I, I think that,
I'm not saying that human beings are going

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:11.230
to vanish, but in general, the idea of modern
civilization as we know it is not going to

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:18.930
survive without us taking more active management
in the climate system. And to me, that is

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.130
the best thing about this geoengineering debate,
which I've gotten a lot of heat about from

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.780
my environmentalist friends for bringing this
up. There's a lot of questions about will

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:33.770
this, the idea of this diet pill for the planet,
as some people have talked about it, cut the

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:41.670
political impulse to reduce emissions, to
take away from the energy. People think that

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.770
there's a simple way out and nobody wants
to run five miles if they can just take a

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:49.270
pill and be skinny. Americans have shown that
over and over, right? So, is this a easy way

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:56.550
out? A dangerous way out? And certainly done
badly, it certainly is. But I think that for

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:04.760
me, having a conversation about this, of letting,
of getting this sort of genie out of the box,

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:10.310
talking openly about the possibility-- not
just the possibility, the reality that this

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:15.090
can be done, that the physics are straightforward,
the costs are relatively inexpensive and there's

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:21.050
a lot of political will behind this idea.
I think it's really important because it makes

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:26.470
clear this, what to me, is the central point
in all this climate stuff of which is that

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:31.980
we humans are in control. And just to have
a conversation about geoengineering, you have

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.511
to talk about, "OK, what kind of planet do
we want to live on?" Do we want to live on

00:38:36.511 --> 00:38:40.450
a planet where we don't mess with the clouds
and we don't mess with the stratosphere because

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.860
we are, we think it's too dangerous and so
we're going to let warming go? Do we wanna

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:51.180
live on a planet where we are going to cut
emissions? I think that this making explicit

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:56.300
that it's not nature that's in control anymore;
it is us that is in control of the kind of

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:03.190
world we live in is really key and central.
And you can't talk about geoengineering without

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:10.230
acknowledging that. And that winds up to the
last final exact, last final point, which

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:14.370
is that after we, spending three years talking
to scientists about this--environmentalists

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:20.120
and everything-- what really scares me is
not technological hubris. That's what a lot

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.381
of people talk about when they talk about
geoengineering technological hubris. What

00:39:23.381 --> 00:39:30.960
scares me is human apathy. And I think the
degree that this discussion about geoengineering

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:37.180
wakes people up, makes us realize how, what
kind of situation we're in, makes us at least

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:42.400
make some decisions about how much control
we wanna exert over this world we live in

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:48.740
is one of the most important points of this
whole topic. And with that, I'm happy to take

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.371
any questions and thank you very much.

00:39:50.371 --> 00:39:51.371
[applause]

00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:58.860
&gt;&gt;Cliff: All right, so, with any luck, we've
got the Q and A mic right here if you have

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:05.240
any questions. I want to kick it off with
just one quick one here in, the debate on

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.750
geoengineering is reallyintriguing and I like
a lot of the ideas that you presented. How

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:13.900
do we prevent this from becoming like introducing
the cane toad to Australia, that we're gonna

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.590
need like another, another fix or a point
of no return where we're like committed to

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.390
like this track or another track?

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:25.290
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Well, that's a great point. A lot
of people bring up the cane toad analogy.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:33.940
So, obviously have a bad track record of trying
to intervene in a helpful way with, to solve

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:39.001
problems like this, but one of the virtues
of some of these systems is especially the

00:40:39.001 --> 00:40:44.290
two that I talked about most, which are cloud
brightening and the sulfur particles, is that

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:50.710
they are reversible. Right? You put these
particles in the stratosphere and they are

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:56.250
gone in a year; they fall out. So, an ideal,
rational world, you start with a little bit

00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:00.710
of it, you put a little bit up there, you
see what happens. If they, if there's any

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:07.470
problems, it, you stop and it falls out and
more or less goes back to where it was a year

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.970
later. Same thing with cloud brightening.
These cloud brightening ideas, you try brightening

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.220
a few clouds, you see what happens; it doesn't
work, you don't like the way it works, it's

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:20.010
changing something you don't understand, blah
blah blah, you turn it off and it stops. So,

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:26.950
there's an element of reversibility to any
of these technologies that, I would say, should

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:34.140
be at least explored to see what the real
risks are. So, that is a big issue and the

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.830
problem with the cane toad thing is that is
wasn't reversible. You let a few of them out

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:42.660
and all of a sudden you've got a big, big
problem. And I think that we've learned a

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:47.120
lot from this kind of thing. And humbleness
is a key virtue in this whole notion that

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:54.080
is a obviously, a hubristic idea. And so I
think that there are ways of doing it that

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.780
really reduce those kinds of risks.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:10.130
&gt;&gt;male #1: You talked a lot about the risks
which people see in it, which makes sense,

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.340
and you also said, which I think is accurate,
that Lowell Wood observed that politicians

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:20.820
are unable to stop what's happening now, so
how can politicians make the decision to take

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.550
these risks that everybody sees to pursue
some sort of geoengineering?

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:29.431
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Well, that's a good question. I mean,
I think that there's two parts of that, that

00:42:29.431 --> 00:42:41.080
one is the near term question is how do you
allow politicians-- how do we get some kind

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:46.220
of sub-scale testing going on? Because what
really has to happen is these, a lot of these

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:51.250
ideas, we know work because of the natural
analogs, like volcanoes and ship tracks and

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:55.060
things like that, but we haven't really done
them yet, right? That we've done climate modeling

00:42:55.060 --> 00:43:00.080
and things like that, but there's no real
experiments going on. And to understand what

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.630
the risks are, we need to do some of those
experiments. So we know, maybe this is a terrible,

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.680
terrible idea for reasons that we have not
understood yet and so we should absolutely

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:16.300
take it off the menu. But that requires some
political courage to say we need to do this,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.830
right? We need to acknowledge, I mean, the
basic problem is that don't even acknowledge

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:24.220
that global warming is a serious problem we
need to deal with on any level, right? We're

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.690
like, that's why I showed the BP thing. It's
like, how do we plan, how did BP plan for

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:33.720
an emergency response? It was to not have
an emergency, right? And that's how we're

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.870
planning with climate is like our emergency
response for climate is to not have an emergency.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:43.900
But, of course, that's just putting our head
in the sand and we know every scientist has

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.460
been telling us for the last 20 years that
the risks that we're running as CO2 levels

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:56.120
get higher and higher and higher. And so,
one of the big fears is that this, we will

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.020
not do any research on geoengineering. We'll
not do any serious thinking about geoengineering

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:05.910
and we'll not be doing any serious reductions
of emissions and we'll have some kind of a

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:13.420
climate--maybe catastrophe is too much of
a word-- but a kind of climate equivalent

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:19.310
of the subprime mortgage meltdown, or the
BP thing. And politicians will then wanna

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:23.240
say, "Do something." But they need to take
action, right? Just like we needed to bomb

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:29.250
Iraq after 9/11. We need, we need action.
It's like Obama right now with BP; he's gotta

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.990
show that he's in charge, right? He's gotta
show his muscle right now and there's this

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:37.030
fight going on. And one of the big fears that
a lot of people, serious scientists who look

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:42.660
at geoengineering, I think is that if push
comes to shove and we do have to take action,

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.860
some of these ideas will be what we will do
because they can cool things off quickly.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:52.620
And if we don't know more about the pluses
and minuses, the real risks, then we're going

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:59.870
to be doing this blindly and that's when it's
really risky and really a problem. Does that

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:00.870
help?

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:05.810
&gt;&gt;member #2: What are the health impacts of
pumping up sulfur?

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:06.810
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I'm sorry, what are the what?

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.650
&gt;&gt;male #2: What are the health impacts of
pumping up sulfur in the atmosphere? Isn't

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.230
that similar to like, particle pollution?

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:15.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff: That's a question that everyone that
asks, that makes total sense and that I am

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:23.110
asked a lot and even the--and there are many
people who think that putting particles in

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:30.290
the stratosphere is a crazy idea-- even those
most outspoken critics don't see any health

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:35.310
impact problems because the amount that you
have to put up there is so small compared

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:42.050
to what's already up there. It's basically
not noticeable, and it doesn't contribute

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:48.730
to acid rain. It, it's really, and there are
other issues such as the health issues, such

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:55.420
as what impact these particles might have
on atmospheric chemistry and the ozone hole;

00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:01.911
to what degree they might contribute to the,
or slow the healing of the ozone hole, things

00:46:01.911 --> 00:46:06.960
like that which could have health impacts.
But as far as particles breathing in the way

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.510
that we do with coal plants and things like
that, not really an issue. Because I remember

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:17.690
coal plants puts stuff up very low level,
basically here in the air that we breathe.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:24.920
This would be high, very high up, very dispersed
and it would just basically be in the mix

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.920
in, of real no consequence.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:37.360
&gt;&gt;male #3: So, thanks for the talk. There
were a couple of things that I reacted against

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.900
during the talk, which I'm sure happens a
lot. For example, your comparison with a garden,

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:49.670
I don't really find very convincing because
a garden is something that you're nurturing;

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.840
it's something that's an old idea of something
which you are nurturing into a different state

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:59.550
whereas this kind of climate engineering is
something where you're trying to patch something

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:06.340
which is going wrong. I'd also put into question
what you said about this is a way of addressing

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:12.630
public apathy because I see it the other way.
If, and this is if people believe already

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:17.140
that we will have technology which will fix
the problems which technology has brought,

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.230
and that's, I think, a way of increasing public
apathy rather than decreasing it. But I'm

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.450
sure that these are common themes; I don't
want to go into them. Actually, the question

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:31.290
that I had was something that you just touched
on very briefly when you showed the model

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:35.260
of the machine which was removing carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere. You haven't really talked

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.460
about carbon's frustration and maybe you could
just give us some idea of if this figures

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.710
in your book, or how this fits in this plan
at all, because it seems to be a far more

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:47.120
cost effective way of trapping carbon out
at the source. And it's something that people

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.700
have talked lots, so maybe you can put that
into the context of what you've been saying.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:56.140
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Sure. I just wanna say one thing about
the garden thing, which I know is obviously,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:02.250
I mean, it obvious my daughter growing pumpkins
and manipulating the entire climate are totally

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:09.210
different, but the point I was trying to make
is about pact of partnerships that, working

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:14.570
with nature in an active way and engaging
and not-- cause I think we tend to think of

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:18.869
the climate and the atmosphere and nature,
in the larger sense, as something that's out

00:48:18.869 --> 00:48:25.280
there in its own force of its own. And this
idea of an active management of a problem,

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.060
of an ecosystem or anything else-- I mean,
there's a lot of that going on right now with

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:33.290
ecosystem restoration and that kind of thing.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.000
&gt;&gt;male: [inaudible]

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.720
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Right.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.430
&gt;&gt;male: [inaudible]

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.010
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Right. Right.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.720
&gt;&gt;male: [inaudible]

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:51.000
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Right, right. No, I totally understand.
Carbon sequestration is really important.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.230
It's, as I said, there's two kinds of geoengineering
in the beginning; the sunlight blocking and

00:48:56.230 --> 00:49:02.450
carbon sort of sucking part of it. And the
first thing to point out about carbon sequestration

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:09.900
is it doesn't get away; it doesn't have the
benefit of being, of working immediately,

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.270
right? I mean, one of these reasons that this
geoengineering of blocking the sunlight is

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:18.970
so much in the forefront of the conversation
is it can, is it happens very fast, right?

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:24.360
So, carbon sequestration certainly lowers
the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere,

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:29.610
but it doesn't really help if you were thinking
about how do we cool things off if we needed

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:34.230
to quickly, that part of it, conversation.
So, carbon sequestration is something I thought

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:41.260
a lot about because that is the central idea
with coal; is what are we gonna do, how are

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.850
we gonna keep burning coal? There's a strong
argument to be made that developing nations--well,

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:52.590
they're obviously going to continue burning
coal-- but they should that there's a economic

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:56.110
and public health benefit to bringing more
and more people into the modern world giving

00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:01.350
them more and more services that cheap electricity
give them. And so, there's a lot of money

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:09.640
right now going into how do you capture the
carbon dioxide out of a coal plant and out

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.641
of the smokestacks? Essentially, the smokestack
of a coal plant and there are various, a whole

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:17.260
bunch of different ideas about this and, but
the striking thing about that is that none

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.940
of it is really happening. I've been watching
the coal industry now, very closely, for ten

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:28.040
years and it's one of these things that the
industry loves to talk about, but doesn't

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.020
really wanna do because we'll raise the price
of electricity. And just for those of you

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:37.110
who don't know carbon sequestration is, I
should make it very clear. It's capturing

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:43.740
the CO2 gases out of the smokestack of a coal
plant, most of the time. You can do it on

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.420
other types of things, but capturing CO2,
compressing into a super critical liquid and

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:52.000
then pumping it underground into deep storage,
usually in saline aquifers that are way down

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.690
several thousand feet below surface. And presumably,
if you do it in the right place, and these

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:03.610
aquifers are in stable geologic systems that
we understand well, it will be locked up down

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:09.680
there for a long time, you'll reduce-- so
you could use the possibility of a essentially

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.730
carbon free coal, right, if you could do this.
The problem, though, the problems are many.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:25.290
One is its, increases the cost of coal-fired
power by half or so. It doesn't work everywhere.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:30.030
It has to have the right geology in the ground
to do this and most coal plants were not built

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.830
with the idea that we need to store carbon,
so they're not built geologically in the right

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:39.010
place. So, you have to pipe the stuff, which
is again, all the headaches of piping and

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:45.280
all that kind of thing and cost of that. And
you have an entrenched industry that basically

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:52.380
sees this as a way of simply increasing their
cost and doesn't wanna do it. And culturally,

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:59.550
they are not very interested in this and they've
done everything they can politically to fight

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:04.090
any kind of regulations that would force them
to do this or they'll actually put a cap.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:08.170
I mean, one of the reasons we don't have a
cap on carbon, one of the reasons Obama cannot

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:13.470
get anything done on this is because of the
coal industry. Those are the, then the Democrats

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:18.250
in the coal states, who are against any kind
of real cap because it will mean having to

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:22.710
put basically, carbon sequestration on coal
plants which will raise the price, which will

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:27.580
make people go to natural gas and make them,
make renewable energy more affordable and

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:33.690
all the things the coal industry doesn't want.
So, one of the virtues of that air capture

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:37.619
thing that I showed the picture that David
Keith is working on, it's much more expensive

00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:44.960
than doing it from a coal plant, but it has
the virtue of, there's a lot of, there can

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.760
be a lot of progress that can be made. It's
just a lot of headroom in development of this

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.670
technology. It doesn't fight an entrenched
industry; it's separate. It's a thing that

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:59.280
is built on its own. It's doesn't, you don't
have to have; the coal guys are not necessarily

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.390
going to be fighting against this. It can
be put in places where the sequestration is

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:09.220
good. We, all you have to do, it doesn't matter
where it is cause when you take a molecule

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:13.230
of CO2 out of the air and the planet, it doesn't
matter where you take it out; it's not like

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:17.340
local air pollution. So, there's many virtues
of this and it's, if you wanna really think

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.680
about how we're gonna have low carbon jet
fuel, or air travel, this is one way that

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:26.220
this could happen because it's very difficult
to think about how we're to be flying airplanes

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:33.290
on biofuels and things like that. And the
idea of having a kind of carbon neutral jet

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:39.330
fuel, this is one possibility of that. You
could use it just to offset airline travel;

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:47.720
things like that. So, it's not simple, it's
not easy, but it is a technology that's really

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.160
being explored.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.380
Yeah.

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:57.170
&gt;&gt;male #3: So, a little bit related to that,
I wondered if you've looked at all into one

00:53:57.170 --> 00:54:01.690
of more far out ideas that I've heard, which
is Freeman Dyson's of bioengineering the Northern

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.250
pine forests to sequester more carbon?

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:12.840
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah, well Freeman is so, I have,
he has a number of ideas and I wanna be clear

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.910
about which one you're talking about. When
you say bioengineering the pine forests, which

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.460
of his ideas do you mean?

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:21.300
&gt;&gt;male #3: He observed that there's a natural
cycle of how much carbon dioxide there is

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:26.800
in the atmosphere, which goes by winter and
summer and he's saying it's because the Northern

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.700
pines absorb so much more carbon during the
summer when they're growing. So, he's suggesting

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:38.280
planting a new kind of pine, which accelerates
that enormously and thus, having a big effect

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.750
on the amount of carbon dioxide.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:43.940
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah. And he and others have also
talked about genetically engineering plants

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:51.900
to have wider leaves, so that they could reflect
more sunlight and also have an effect on the

00:54:51.900 --> 00:55:00.910
albedo. I mean, I think all of these ideas
are in the mix. I don't see that kind of thing

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:08.651
as happening, having a real possibility of
happening very soon. Partly because I think

00:55:08.651 --> 00:55:15.600
the CO2 modulation stuff is gonna be big bang
for the buck, to be really interested for

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:22.420
people right now, and it's this albedo management
stuff that is the real dangerous and interesting

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:28.240
part of this. But I think that, when I was
researching this, there's many--this idea

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.109
of geoengineering--there's many ideas out
there that I just, I mean, I can talk to one,

00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:38.090
I guess scientist might be too generous of
a word, but a researcher who wanted to change

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:43.340
the albedo of the ocean by dumping Special
K breakfast cereal into the Arctic Sea. Another

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:49.940
who thought that putting, setting off, shooting
a nuclear weapon at the moon to cause moon

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:56.290
dust to go into space and reflect sunlight
away. I mean, there's all kinds, I mean, Plexiglas

00:55:56.290 --> 00:56:05.170
on the ocean to reflect sunlight around the
Greenland ice sheets, people with Styrofoam

00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:09.741
balls. I mean, people have all kinds of ideas
up, and there's also other issues that I,

00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:10.911
I mean, other possibilities that I haven't
even talked about, like dumping iron in the

00:56:10.911 --> 00:56:17.610
ocean, which is something that was actually
done for, by some entrepreneurs here in the

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:25.050
Bay area, changing the upwelling currents
to have more of a deep water upwelling and

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:31.470
stimulate plankton blooms that way. It's a
brand new field. There's bazillions of interesting

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:37.750
and mostly crazy ideas out there that people
are exploring and that's fascinating. I mean,

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:42.510
I mentioned of growing up in the Silicon Valley
and it reminds me at a very strange way of

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:46.700
the early days of the PC revolution, where
you had just a lot of crazy ideas and nobody

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:51.000
knows what's gonna work and what's not, but
there's a lot of new thinking going on in

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.530
this world and that's, I think, an example.
I mean, Freeman Dyson is a genius, but I have

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:59.109
some question about some of his ideas about
this stuff.

00:56:59.109 --> 00:57:02.971
&gt;&gt;Cliff: Well, that's all the time we have
for questions today, so thank you very much,

00:57:02.971 --> 00:57:04.460
Jeff. It was an amazing talk.

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.460
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Thanks very much.

00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:05.670
