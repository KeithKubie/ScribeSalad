Now let's get back to Athena's example for a second. Going through this long

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.370
division would have been really messy, so I've gone ahead and done it for you.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.842
What we end up with is still something that's not super pretty, but at least

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:16.079
now you have the numbers. Considering this answer, what is the slant asymptote

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.966
of our function T? I've already written y equals for you, so just fill in an

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.923
expression on the right-hand side of the equation.
