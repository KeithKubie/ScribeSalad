00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.070
So then, I guess you know, this, there is a bug there definitely.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.870
And then if next is equal to blank which is the character we want to

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.410
count the count is incremented using the plus, plus operator.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.600
[COUGH] Then we read the next character again using the read.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.400
function, the read method on on the stream.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.560
And then it would print the character that we just read.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.710
&gt;&gt; Should we really be printing all these characters on a new line every time?

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.960
Or do we want the sentence to actually look like the characters are one

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.500
after another in a sentence?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.660
&gt;&gt; You have to say that was not specified.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.749
So I made that decision but.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.700
It didn't sound like a very good decision.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.354
I mean, you think you're going to have this, [LAUGH] this line of characters,

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:52.227
vertical line of characters coming out that you, then it's difficult for

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:56.224
you to check if the sentence that I put in, that was the sentence,

00:00:56.224 --> 00:01:00.848
try to figure out you know, if it actually caught them all and, and, and-

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:03.484
[CROSSTALK].

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:04.186
&gt;&gt; Kind of drives-

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:04.976
&gt;&gt; Right now it's a vertical line of integers, it's not even characters.

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:09.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.870
&gt;&gt; So, it's-

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.120
&gt;&gt; Even worse.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.970
&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right, okay.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.135
Okay, okay, that's fine.

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:16.188
I didn't realize that, that was going to be printed as an integer.

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:17.885
You're probably right.

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.856
And so it should be really printed as a character.

00:01:20.856 --> 00:01:23.704
[CROSSTALK].

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:24.566
&gt;&gt; You didn't realize.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.339
I mean, you never even ran your code once on your test.

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:32.028
&gt;&gt; I did run it I just, the input wasn't just that.

00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:34.520
&gt;&gt; It's like students who appear in science class.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.660
It just compile it doesn't work.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.978
&gt;&gt; I mean, this is one of the advantages of-

00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:39.053
[CROSSTALK].

00:01:39.053 --> 00:01:42.750
[LAUGH].

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050
&gt;&gt; This is actually, you know, one of the advantages of inspection.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.810
I mean, this code, is could just, part of a larger piece of code and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.835
so we're just reading it right now and didn't really.

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:55.380
[COUGH]. &gt;&gt; Go through a serious testing phase.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.145
Yeah, I compiled. [COUGH].

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:57.590
&gt;&gt; To make sure there were no syntactic errors.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.700
&gt;&gt; We can continue from here.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.560
&gt;&gt; We can continue.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.912
Thank you. [COUGH] Okay, so at this point-

00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:03.450
&gt;&gt; We're going to get bite me to go see if he can compile it and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.150
see if it even compiles.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.100
I'm not even sure if it compiled yet.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.508
&gt;&gt; Well, it may have of compiled.

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:10.229
I can't remember.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.210
The last time I checked I know it didn't work.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.430
It didn't give us what we wanted.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.043
&gt;&gt; It does compile though.

00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:15.729
I mean I'm positive about that.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:16.270
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.
