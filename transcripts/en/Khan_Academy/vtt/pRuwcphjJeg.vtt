00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.739
- [Teacher] So, we've got
the differential equation,

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:03.701
the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal

00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:05.849
to three times y.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.075
And we want to find
the particular solution

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:10.319
that gives us y being equal to two

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.037
when x is equal to one.

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.031
So, I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:16.832
and see if you can figure
this out on your own.

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:18.771
All right, now, let's
work through it together.

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.210
So, some of you might
have immediately said,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.439
"Hey, this is the form of
a differential equation

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140
"where the solution is
going to be an exponential,"

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.033
and you just got right to it.

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.751
But, I'm not going to go straight to that,

00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.921
I'm just gonna recognize
that this is a separable

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.234
differential equation and that
I'm gonna solve it that way.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.263
So, when I say that it's separable,

00:00:35.263 --> 00:00:37.817
that means that we can
separate the y's, dy's,

00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:41.080
on one side, and all the
x's, dx's on the other side.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.565
And so, what I can do is
if I divide both sides

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:48.302
of this equation by y and
multiply both sides by dx,

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:50.052
I get one over y, dy,

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.115
is equal to three-dx.

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:57.880
Now, on the left and right hand sides,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.388
I have these clean things
that I can now integrate.

00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:01.340
That's what people talk about

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.219
when they say separable
differential equation.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.179
Now, here on the left,
if I wanted to write it

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:08.782
in a fairly general form, I could write,

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:10.906
well, the anti-derivative of one over y

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:15.028
is gonna be the natural log
of the absolute value of y.

00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:18.255
I'm taking the anti-derivative
with respect to y, here.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:19.358
Now, I could add a constant,

00:01:19.358 --> 00:01:21.506
but I'm gonna add in a constant
on the right-hand side,

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:24.072
so there's no reason to
add two arbitrary constants

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:24.905
on both sides.

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:26.817
I could just add one on one side.

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:29.563
So, that is going to be equal to

00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:32.813
the anti-derivative here is going to be

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:38.956
three-x and I'll add the
promised constant, plus c,

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:40.373
right over there.

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:43.681
And now, let's think
about it a little bit.

00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.607
Well, we can rewrite
this in exponential form.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.266
We could say, we could write,

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:51.855
that e to the three-x plus c is equal

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:53.573
to the natural log of y.

00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:55.941
I could write the natural of y is equal

00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:57.858
to e to three-x plus c.

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:03.144
Now, I could rewrite this
is equal to e to three-x

00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:05.322
times e to the c.

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:07.215
Now, e to the c is just gonna be some

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:10.849
other arbitrary constant, which
I could still denote by c.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:11.917
They're are going to be different values,

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:14.587
but we're just trying to just get a sense

00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:16.621
of what the structure of
this thing looks like.

00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:18.558
So, we could say this is
going to be some constant

00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:20.856
times e to the three-x.

00:02:20.856 --> 00:02:22.133
So, another way of thinking about it.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.444
Saying the absolute value
of y is equal to this.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.465
This isn't a function yet.

00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:26.777
We're trying to find
this function solution

00:02:26.777 --> 00:02:28.623
to this differential equation.

00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.294
So, this would tell us
either y is equal to c,

00:02:31.294 --> 00:02:32.942
e to the three-x,

00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:36.775
or y is equal to negative
c, e to the three-x.

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:39.948
Well, we've kept it in general terms.

00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:40.871
I haven't put any...

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:42.880
We don't know c is.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.383
So, what we could do, instead,
is just pick this one,

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.476
and then we can solve for c

00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:50.938
assuming this one right over here.

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:54.885
And so, we will see if we
can meet these constraints

00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:57.265
using this and it'll
essentially take the other one

00:02:57.265 --> 00:02:59.724
into consideration, whether
we're going positive

00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:01.474
or negative.

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:03.073
So, let's do that.

00:03:03.073 --> 00:03:05.323
So, when y is equal to two,

00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:08.290
I'm now going to solve for c

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.441
to find the particular
solution, x is equal to one,

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.087
or when x is equal to
one, y is equal to two.

00:03:15.087 --> 00:03:16.573
So, I could write it like that,

00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:19.150
and we get two is equal

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.150
to c times e

00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:25.576
to the third power, three times one.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.259
And so, to solve for
c, I could just divide

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.233
both sides by e to the third,

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:30.963
and so I could, or I
could multiply both sides

00:03:30.963 --> 00:03:32.600
times e to the negative third,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.588
and I could get two e to
the negative third power

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:36.755
is equal to c.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.252
And so let's now substitute it back in

00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:44.469
and our particular solutions is gonna be

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:45.802
y is equal to c.

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:49.889
C is two-e to the negative third power

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.837
times e to the three-x.

00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:57.905
Now, I'm taking the product of two things

00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:58.880
with the same base.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.856
I can add the exponents.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:03.105
So, I could say y is equal to

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:05.272
two times e to the three-x

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:10.351
and I'll add the exponents

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.768
to three-x minus three, and there you go.

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:18.466
This is one way that you could
write the particular solution

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.894
that meets these constraints

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:23.311
for this separable differential equation.
