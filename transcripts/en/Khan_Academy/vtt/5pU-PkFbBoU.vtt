00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:03.283
- [Instructor] Let's say I have
a bag of colored balls here

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:07.829
and we know that 40% of
the balls are orange.

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:11.329
Now, imagine defining a random variable x.

00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:14.350
And x is based on a trial

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.459
where we stick our hand in this bag,

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:19.417
we don't look around, and
we randomly pick a ball,

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.267
look at its color, we record it,

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:22.467
and then we're gonna put it back.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:24.833
So we're gonna assume that
we have our placement here,

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.300
and we're gonna say that
our random variable x

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.467
is going to be equal to one
if we pick an orange ball

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:38.075
and it's going to be
equal to zero otherwise.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.683
You might already recognize this

00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.317
as a Bernoulli random variable.

00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:47.158
And we can construct a
probability distribution for x.

00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:49.433
In fact, let's do this.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.450
So, x is going to be discrete.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.942
It can only take on two different values.

00:00:55.942 --> 00:00:59.859
So x can take on zero
or it can take on one,

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:03.325
and if 40% of the balls are orange,

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:06.267
the one has a 40% chance of happening,

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:07.883
so let me do that.

00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:12.050
So there's gonna be 40%
chance of getting a one.

00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:16.184
So, that's 0.4 right over there.

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.983
And there would be a 60%
chance or 0.6 probability

00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:23.083
of getting a zero.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.150
So this right over here,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.225
just trying to hand-draw it.

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:31.392
So this would be 0.6
probability of getting a zero.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:36.017
So we can call this the
probability distribution,

00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:38.600
probability distribution for x.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.958
This is all review so far,
but the reason why I did this

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.983
is because we're now
going to introduce ourself

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:51.583
to the notion of a sampling distribution.

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:54.257
And it can be a little bit
confusing because in our brain,

00:01:54.257 --> 00:01:56.858
we tend to think in terms
of probability distributions

00:01:56.858 --> 00:02:01.258
and not as much in terms
of sampling distributions.

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:03.392
So what you do in a sampling distribution

00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:07.642
is you still start with a population here,

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:11.192
but then you take a
sample of that population.

00:02:11.192 --> 00:02:12.817
Let me label things.

00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:15.758
So this is our population.

00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:17.867
This is our population here.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.200
We take a sample

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.900
from the population,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.592
and it could have a certain sample size,

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:27.759
sample size n.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.017
And then we'll calculate some
statistic for that sample,

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:37.934
so we will calculate the statistic.

00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:44.733
And then we're gonna think
about the distributions

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:48.450
of the statistics that we
can get from these samples.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.950
So one way to think about
this is keep doing this.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.417
So this is our first
sample of sample size n,

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.158
we calculate the statistics.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.217
Then we take another
sample of sample size n

00:02:58.217 --> 00:03:01.025
and then we calculate the statistic again.

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:02.792
And then we take another sample

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:04.517
and we just keep doing this.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.092
We take another sample of sample size n

00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:10.792
and we calculate the statistic again.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:14.125
And let's say we were to do
this an infinite number of times

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:17.700
and we were to plot the
distribution of the statistic

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.917
that we're calculating.

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:22.042
Well then, we have our
sampling distribution.

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:23.850
Let's try to make this a
little bit more tangible

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.333
by going back to our colored
balls example, and calculate

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.400
or think about a sampling
distribution for that.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.733
So let's say we have our population here

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.483
and we know that a parameter
for this population,

00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:45.225
we know that the proportion
of balls that are orange.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.892
40% are orange.

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:49.533
We don't always know the parameters.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:51.758
Oftentimes, we're
estimating the parameters

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:53.792
by looking at samples.

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:57.475
But let's say we then
take sample sizes of 10.

00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.058
So, sample size 10,

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:06.892
and every time we calculate
the statistic for our sample

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.892
of what percentage are orange.

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:13.508
So let's say the first
time we take a sample,

00:04:13.508 --> 00:04:17.008
this time over here, we get three oranges.

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:24.100
Let's say the next time
we get two oranges.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.375
Actually, let me do these as a proportion.

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:29.825
So if my sample size is
10, I get three oranges,

00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:31.325
which is 30%.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.450
And then if I do it
again, I get two oranges,

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.041
and that is 20%.

00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:42.258
And I just keep doing this.

00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:46.092
And eventually, I can plot a distribution

00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:49.200
of these sample proportions.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.700
You would end up with some type
of a discrete distribution.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.350
And the way to read this
discrete distribution

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.567
is let's say this right over here ends up,

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:00.742
and I'm just gonna make up a number,

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:02.741
this isn't going to be the actual number,

00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.408
but let's say that this is 0.15.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.317
The way to read that is
you have a 15% chance

00:05:11.317 --> 00:05:15.484
of getting a sample where
50% of your balls are orange

00:05:17.158 --> 00:05:20.075
or if this right over here is 0.07,

00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:24.075
that would mean that you have a 7% chance

00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:27.408
where 20% of your balls are orange.

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:31.025
Now, to make this even a
little bit more tangible,

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:34.842
let's run a simulation
that actually does this.

00:05:34.842 --> 00:05:36.400
This right over here is a simulation

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.666
created on Khan Academy,

00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:41.483
on our computer programming
scratchpads by Charlotte Auen.

00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:46.408
It's a simulation to construct
a sampling distribution.

00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:51.308
So here, she's using candies
instead of just colored balls

00:05:51.308 --> 00:05:53.542
but these candies are
essentially colored balls.

00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:56.783
And so here, we can set
the population proportion.

00:05:56.783 --> 00:05:58.925
So let's say that the actual proportion

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.192
as we saw on our example
of, let's say it's green

00:06:02.192 --> 00:06:05.700
as opposed to orange here, is 40%.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.308
And so let's say in each sample,

00:06:07.308 --> 00:06:09.517
just as we said, our sample size is 10,

00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:11.650
so we'll just take a sample size of 10.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.441
And let's just do one sample first,

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:17.258
so let's just draw a sample.

00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:21.558
And so what we did is we
took 10 of these gumballs out

00:06:21.558 --> 00:06:25.058
and we are counting how
many of them are green.

00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:27.033
So in this first sample of 10,

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:29.249
we see that one, two, three,

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.517
four, five, six of them are green.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:36.008
So out of the possible outcomes,

00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:39.092
we're now gonna tally one of our outcomes

00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:42.233
having hey, we got six
of our 10 to be green.

00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:44.083
And if we wanna show the proportion

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:45.792
instead of just the count,

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:48.233
we can just pick percentage here.

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:51.525
And so here, we've had
one scenario already

00:06:51.525 --> 00:06:54.167
where 60% were green.

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:55.383
But we don't wanna just do one sample.

00:06:55.383 --> 00:06:56.775
We just wanna keep drawing sample.

00:06:56.775 --> 00:06:58.633
So let's draw another sample.

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:02.917
So in this last sample, 50% are green.

00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:05.242
And so now that we have one was 50% green,

00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:07.358
one was 60% green.

00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:08.783
Let's draw another sample.

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:12.492
Now we have another sample
where we got 60% green,

00:07:12.492 --> 00:07:16.300
so there are two situations
where we had 60% green.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.250
And so I can keep doing
this over and over and over,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.392
and so what we're creating right over here

00:07:23.392 --> 00:07:26.267
is a sampling distribution.

00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:28.408
And if we were to do this
an infinite number of times,

00:07:28.408 --> 00:07:31.608
we would get the true
sampling distribution

00:07:31.608 --> 00:07:34.250
of the sample proportion

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.717
given the actual population
proportion that is green.

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:41.750
And so, this is after 77 samples.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.683
Notice, this is saying that
out of 77 of our samples,

00:07:45.683 --> 00:07:47.266
22 of those samples

00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:52.092
resulted in 40% of our
gumballs being green.

00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:53.666
Only one of our samples

00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:57.026
had 80% of our gumballs being green.

00:07:57.026 --> 00:07:58.758
And if we just wanna
do a ton more samples,

00:07:58.758 --> 00:08:02.225
I'll go all the way to
drawing 50 samples at a time.

00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:05.225
So let me just keep increasing this.

00:08:07.133 --> 00:08:09.800
Notice, we have 17 samples now

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.650
where we had zero percent that are green.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.150
We have 91 of the 2200 samples

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:18.783
where 10% were green,

00:08:18.783 --> 00:08:21.883
where one out of the 10
in our sample were green.

00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:26.233
Now we could convert any of
these number, 17 and 91, 256,

00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:28.783
we could turn these into percentages

00:08:28.783 --> 00:08:31.558
by just dividing by the number of samples.

00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:33.192
But this is fun, we could just keep going

00:08:33.192 --> 00:08:36.217
and making this larger
and larger and larger.

00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:37.359
I encourage you to play with this.

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:40.358
I'll provide a link for it in
the description on this video

00:08:40.358 --> 00:08:42.050
and on Khan Academy,

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.133
but the main idea is to get an intuition

00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:48.125
for how a sampling
distribution is different

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:51.875
from just a traditional
probability distribution.

00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:53.825
That in a sampling distribution,

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.033
you're taking samples from a population,

00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:58.784
calculating some
statistic for that sample,

00:08:58.784 --> 00:09:01.308
and what you're plotting in
the sampling distribution

00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:04.838
are the various probabilities,
the various likelihoods,

00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:09.005
of the outcomes for those
statistics in those samples.
