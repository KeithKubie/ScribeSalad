00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:16.676
I got in my first car accident when I was sixteen.

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.973
I had just gotten my license and I was driving home

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:20.695
when a car pulled into the intersection

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:22.576
and bang! It hit me.

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:23.894
It had happened that quick.

00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:24.789
Bang!

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.433
But when I play that memory back,

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.409
it doesn't take two seconds.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.789
I see the tires of the car rolling through the stop sign,

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.401
I have time to think,

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:35.863
"You know, I think that car is going to hit me."

00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:37.617
I see the right-hand corner of the hood

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.496
crumple up like tin foil,

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:42.243
I see the red paint flake off and drift off into the air,

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:46.125
I can see all of that, like it's happening in slow motion.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.807
In my memory, that experience takes ten seconds.

00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:50.630
But why?

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.484
Why did that memory play back longer

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.258
than the actual time it took?

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:56.173
This is an interesting phenomenon

00:00:56.173 --> 00:00:57.680
and it's not just for car accidents,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.095
a roller coaster,

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.096
or a first kiss.

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:04.018
These events seem to take longer than they actually take.

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:04.655
But why?

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:07.439
And when it comes to writing about that experience,

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.567
how do I get that peculiar feeling across?

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:13.629
How do I slow down time as a writer?

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:16.545
To get the answer, we have to visit Hollywood.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:18.656
You see, the way filmmakers create slow motion

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:21.782
will tell us a lot about how writers can create slow motion.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:24.079
First, let's remember how film works.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.928
When the camera turns on, it's not recording motion,

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:30.345
it's taking lots and lots of individual pictures.

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:33.597
Then when those pictures are played back in the projector,

00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:36.719
they blend together and create the appearance of motion,

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.667
like a flip book.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:40.754
So, let's imagine that a camera man needs

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:43.471
to film his actress skipping through a field of daisies

00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.131
in regular motion.

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:46.893
Ready, action.

00:01:46.893 --> 00:01:48.691
She skips across the field,

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:49.562
he records it,

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:51.940
and...cut.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.316
Let's say for the sake of easy math

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:56.263
that our camera man took 50 pictures,

00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:59.295
50 little frames on that length of film.

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.116
Now, let's take that film and play it back

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:05.724
at the rate of 50 frames per 5 seconds.

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:06.744
This rate is constant,

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:09.411
the projector will always go at the same speed.

00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:13.943
It's easy, we got 50 frames, so our film takes 5 seconds.

00:02:13.943 --> 00:02:17.487
She skips across the field...

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:18.700
...and cut!

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.006
So, then, how do we slow down time in film?

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:24.390
How do we create slow motion?

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.742
Maybe this is a surprise, but we don't take less pictures,

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:30.897
we take more pictures.

00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:32.306
Ready, action!

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.432
She skips across the field,

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:35.357
he records it,

00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:36.938
and cut.

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:40.509
Now we have a lot of film, a long length,

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.732
let's say 100 frames long.

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:44.838
Now, when we play it back,

00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:48.029
it takes a longer time to get through,

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.948
and there's the actress in slow motion.

00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:56.706
Skipping through the field of daisies!

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:58.168
Which brings us now to writing.

00:02:58.168 --> 00:02:59.959
When you're writing a narrative,

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.624
you may want to use slow motion in one of your scenes.

00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:04.951
It's a cool effect, just like it is in Hollywood,

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.697
and it draws the reader's attention to important moments.

00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:09.334
Well, here's how you do it.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:10.609
You see, when we read,

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.971
our brain makes the words into pictures

00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.440
and the pictures blend into action.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.267
So what we read is what we see

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:20.269
in the time it takes us to read it.

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.356
For example, imagine you're writing a narrative

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:25.283
about your game-winning free throw in the championship game.

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:26.569
Here's a moment as a writer

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.691
that you might want to slow down time

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:32.118
to really capture the second-by-second tension

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:33.658
produced by the scene.

00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:34.700
You concentrate,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.033
you put the pencil to paper,

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:38.369
you really want to slow down time,

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:39.205
you write,

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:41.254
"I shot the ball in the hoop.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:44.052
Time slowed down. Then we won."

00:03:44.052 --> 00:03:46.713
To read that, takes two seconds;

00:03:46.713 --> 00:03:51.030
therefore, your reader imagines a scene that takes two seconds.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.257
Ball goes up, comes down, done.

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:55.972
See, even though you wrote, "time slowed down,"

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:57.974
you didn't achieve that effect for your reader.

00:03:57.974 --> 00:04:00.226
Just saying it doesn't make it happen.

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.396
Now, let's take what we make about film,

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:04.358
time slows down with more pictures,

00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:06.077
and try again.

00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:09.523
This time write A LOT more.

00:04:09.523 --> 00:04:11.545
"I bent my knees and held the ball loosely.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:14.538
Letting the ball bounce on the floor once more,

00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:16.409
I gathered my thoughts.

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.286
This was the moment.

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:22.155
My right arm extended as I released the ball with a gentle flick,

00:04:22.155 --> 00:04:26.754
it rotated slightly as it arched toward the rim.

00:04:26.754 --> 00:04:28.511
I held my breath.

00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:31.805
The ball nudged the back rim,

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:36.768
falling through the net with a gentle, satisfying swish.

00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:41.388
And the crowd exploded from their seats."

00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:44.707
See, we just slowed down time through our writing.

00:04:44.707 --> 00:04:46.205
The bottom line is this:

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:48.698
there are moments in life that take longer

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:49.735
than they actually take.

00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:51.805
When you're planning out your narrative,

00:04:51.805 --> 00:04:53.871
think about those moments,

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:57.244
those snippets of life that took longer than the watch:

00:04:57.244 --> 00:04:59.039
the moment of hearing bad news,

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.004
the moment of hearing good news,

00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:04.938
the moment of exhilaration when you realize you hit the jump,

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:08.548
or the moment when you realize you aren't going to land it.

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:10.804
Once you identify these moments in your narrative,

00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:14.472
you can use this effect of slow motion when you write.

00:05:14.472 --> 00:05:18.393
Just remember, it's not enough to say, "time slowed down"

00:05:18.393 --> 00:05:20.645
and it's not enough to throw a couple adjectives

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:22.730
in a sentence and call it done either.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.369
Descriptive writing is good writing, that's true.

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.401
But if you want to express the feeling of slow motion in life,

00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:32.228
you have to actually take up

00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:34.635
more physical space on the page,

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.749
use more film so to speak.

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:38.675
In doing so, you will create tension

00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:41.124
and keep your reader interested.

00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:42.458
And that way, the next time you write,

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:45.458
you'll control the camera of your own writing.
