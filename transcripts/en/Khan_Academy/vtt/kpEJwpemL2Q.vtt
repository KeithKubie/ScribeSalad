00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.564
- [Voiceover] So we're given
four different equations here

00:00:03.564 --> 00:00:05.247
and each of them have a blank,

00:00:05.247 --> 00:00:06.908
and we need to fill in that blank

00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:08.231
with a missing number.

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:09.949
So let's do each of these.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.794
So on the left hand side of this equation,

00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:14.597
we have one plus four,

00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:18.969
so one plus four is the same thing as...

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:21.425
Well, one plus four is five.

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:23.138
If we take four, and if you add one more,

00:00:23.138 --> 00:00:24.799
you're gonna have five.

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:26.446
So now, we finished that one,

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:29.244
because one plus four is the same thing

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:30.846
as five.

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:33.539
Now here, we're saying four plus something

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.059
is the same thing as five.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.825
Well, we just figured out

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.356
that one plus four, or four plus one

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:41.259
is the same thing as five.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.279
So four plus one is five.

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:44.719
So notice there, we have the equation,

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.296
four plus one is the same thing as five.

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:49.259
Equals means that what's on the left

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:52.805
is the same thing as what
you have on the right.

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:54.403
Now we have blank plus two

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:55.994
is equal to five.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:01:00.266
So what plus two is
the same thing as five?

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.691
Well, three plus two is equal to five,

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.103
or five is equal to three plus two.

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:08.404
Now you go here.

00:01:08.404 --> 00:01:09.948
Well now you have three plus blank

00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:10.911
is equal to five.

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:11.667
Well, we already figured it out,

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:15.125
because three plus two is equal to five.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.052
So we can write three plus two

00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:17.969
is equal to five,

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.467
and then we can check ourselves.

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:20.802
And then we can keep going.

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:22.893
So now we have some subtraction.

00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:25.830
So what's the same thing
as nine minus three?

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.141
So if I have nine things, and if I were

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:28.686
to take away three of them,

00:01:28.686 --> 00:01:30.507
I'm going to have six left.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.686
Nine minus three is the same thing as six.

00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:35.654
10 minus blank

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:38.474
is equal to six.

00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:39.462
So what do I have to take away

00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:43.322
from 10 in order to have six left over?

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:45.451
Well, if I take four away from 10,

00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:48.291
I'm going to have six left over.

00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:49.920
Now something minus one

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.470
is the same thing as six.

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:54.332
Well, seven minus one

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:56.857
is going to be equal to six.

00:01:56.857 --> 00:01:59.104
And then we get eight minus blank

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:00.148
is equal to six.

00:02:00.148 --> 00:02:01.065
So how many do I have to take away

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:04.780
from eight in order to get to six?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.802
Well, if I take away one,

00:02:05.802 --> 00:02:06.604
I'm going to get seven.

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:09.457
If I take away two, I'm going to have six.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.929
So eight minus two is equal to six.
