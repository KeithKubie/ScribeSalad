00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.240
 Chris? 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.200
 Charlie? 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.040
 - Who was it !? - Who who ? 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.360
 A man... 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.480
 a bearded man ... 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 was right there ... 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840
 to stare at me ... 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.880
 before disappearing ... 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 What! 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.440
 Oh yes. It's Khyan. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.360
 The new roommate. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.920
 - You're kidding ?! 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.240
 We kept the last room 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.520
 for my collection of unicycles! 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.640
 Add a bit of your collection 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.840
 before thinking about firing people. 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.240
 Well... 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.560
 B'oui ... Okay. It's okay with me. 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.160
 Sorry to get carried away. 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.960
 Well. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 Just give him a chance, okay? 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.440
 In addition, he prepares us tea! 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.720
 - Charlie: 1 sugar - 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.560
 - Granulated sugar - 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.640
 You were saying ? 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.760
 The tea is ready. 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.040
 - That's nice ... - Call me Khyan! 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.000
 It's cool to know you ... 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.000
 - Is tea to your liking? 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.720
 I imagine... ? 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.920
 All the better. 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.440
 I have prepared another for you. 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.200
 Charlie? 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.600
 Yes... ? 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.840
 Everything is fine !? 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.200
 I believe... 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.120
 Thanks for the tea ... 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.360
 Did you taste it? 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.680
 Is it tasty? 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.800
 Delicious ! 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.040
 I do not bother you, I hope. 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.200
 - Oh, no, no! Not at all ! - Yes... 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.960
 Naturally... 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.440
 Well, I'm going to withdraw. 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.280
 Sleep well. 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.960
 You do not have to drink this thing! 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.680
 He did it for me ... 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.480
 You force yourself! It is obvious... 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.440
 I made you a little tea this morning. 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.600
 I know how important he is to you ... 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.440
 Tchin! 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.440
 Both are for me ?! 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.280
 Both !? 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.440
 Charlie? 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.560
 What... 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.000
 It's not right? 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.680
 - Everything is fine ! 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.320
 Oh, no, I could never ... 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.040
 Well, if you insist ...! 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.040
 He knows we're here? 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040
 - Yeah ... - Nan ... 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.840
 He's a little stressed, that's all. 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.760
 A cup of tea would do him good! 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.640
 I'm not sure that ... 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.040
 I'll make him tea ...! 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.400
 We made you some tea, Charlie. 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.760
 We know how much you love tea. 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.840
 There, sweet ... 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.920
 Drink this tea, everything will return to order. 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.680
 - Charlie? 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.960
 Are you OK ? 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.000
 Do you want a little more tea? 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.360
 - It's a crisis! 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.160
 - Your tea kills him! 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.920
 - Tea is good for you! 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.040
 - Everyone loves tea! 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.240
 - It's not tea! 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.160
 - It's sugar! 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.040
 I do not want to cannose! 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.760
 - Charlie? 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.320
 Charlie! 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.800
 You scared me ! 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.920
 You! 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.640
 You are a shabby tea maker! 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.680
 You are aware ? 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.440
 I never... 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.320
 - since I was born - 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.680
 tasted something too ... 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.600
 heartbreaking! 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.120
 You would even spoil tea powder! 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.560
 - It was sugar, Charlie! 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.680
 - Sugar ! Let's talk about it ! 

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.880
 He was not even dissolved properly! 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.040
 It was like sand in the bottom of my cup! 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.800
 And you have a problem with milk! 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.040
 You empty the whole bottle 

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.000
 when a cloud is enough! 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.760
 You put the milk first, I'm sure! 

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.000
 You are only a monster! 

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.720
 It was so diluted! 

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.120
 - You served me the deca 

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.520
 it's not possible otherwise! 

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.040
 Hey ! 

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.880
 It's not... 

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.040
 only a cup of tea ...! 

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.560
 Not when I have to drink 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.040
 these things one after the other! 

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.400
 - You could say no! 

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.000
 Nobody forced you to drink! 

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.000
 Well... 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.840
 This is inappropriate ! 

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.720
 That's all ! 

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.720
 - Guys ! 

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.760
 - This sugar is perfect! 

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.760
 - I am sorry... 

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.760
 I got a little carried away ... 

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.040
 All that... 

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.640
 - I do not know what took me! 

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.160
 I'm not mad at you ! 

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.680
 I almost killed you, so ... 

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.720
 let's say I did not make a good impression! 

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.440
 - Can I redeem myself? 

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.040
 - Make yourself a real cup of tea ... 

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.440
 No ! 

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.520
 - Finally... 

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.360
 - No... 

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.640
 Really, it'll be fine! 

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240
 But... 

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.280
 I'm sure you're doing really good ... 

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.520
 Scones, and everything ... 

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.160
 That's right, I make excellent scones ...! 

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.280
 Scones... 

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.160
 Scones ! 

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.440
 - Scones... 

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.760
 And that thing you do ... 

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.800
 to appear everywhere ... 

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.040
 like: in my room, while I sleep ... 

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.960
 - You do not have to ! Really. 

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.080
 Promised. 

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.920
 - Tadaaa! 

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.520
 My favorite roommate! 

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.200
 Need me ? - Well... 

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.560
 If you do not want me too much ... 

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.200
 I have a surprise for you ! 

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.560
 I made tea! 

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.640
 Nah, it'll be fine! But... 

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.120
 - Thank you !
