00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.130
Aubrey wanted to see if there's
a connection between the time

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.380
a given exam takes place and
the average score of this exam.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.270
She collected data about
exams from the previous year.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.677
Plot the data in a scatter plot.

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:14.760
And let's see, they give
us a couple of rows here.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.440
This is the class.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.340
Then they give us
the period of the day

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.800
that the class happened.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.780
And then they give us the
average score on an exam.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.754
And we have to be a little
careful with the study-- maybe

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:30.170
there's some
correlation depending

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.630
on what subject is taught
during what period.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.300
But let's just use her data, at
least, just based on her data,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.500
see if-- well, definitely
do what they're asking us,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.320
plot a scatter plot, and then
see if there is any connection.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.530
So let's see.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.660
On the horizontal
axis, we have Period.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.520
And on this investigation,
this exploration she's doing,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.460
she's trying to see, well,
does the period of the day

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.200
somehow drive average score?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.980
So that's why Period is
on the horizontal axis.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.590
And the thing that's driving
is on the horizontal, the thing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.680
that's being driven
is on the vertical.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.700
So let's plot each
of these points.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.950
Period 1, average score
93-- right over there.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.640
Period 6, 87.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590
Oh, that's not the
right place, and then we

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.960
can move it if we want--
87, right over there.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390
Period 2, 70.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.890
Period 4, 62-- right over there.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.890
Period 4 and 86, that's
right over there.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.416
Period 1, 73.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.150
Period 3, average
score of 73 as well.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.320
Period 1, 80,
average score of 80.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.335
And then Period 3,
average score of 96.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.436
So there we go.

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:21.060
And it doesn't really
seem like there's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.970
any obvious trend over here.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.180
So let's make sure
that we got this right.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.040
And we did.
