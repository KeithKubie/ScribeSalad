00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the correct answer is indexes increase the speed of database reads.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yes, that is true. That is what they are used for, at least.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Sometimes you don't make the right index,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but assuming you made the correct index, your index matches your query,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
yes, you will increase the speed of reads.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
At least you hope so.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Indexes increase the speed of database inserts.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
No, that is false.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They probably decrease the speed of database inserts.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That is because when we're inserting a new round to our table,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we probably also have to update all of our indexes,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that takes time.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So there's a tradeoff.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We can probably get faster reads at the expense of slower inserts.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And probably slower writes in general, for just updating a row,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but there's actually a few perverse cases

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
where an index can actually increase the speed of an update.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let me give you a little real demo

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of how indexes can affect things in the real world.
