00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:08.786
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:10.158
Fizzle,

00:00:10.158 --> 00:00:11.766
to end weakly

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.974
or to fail,

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:14.550
to die out.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.161
The definition of fizzle

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.694
likely links back to the Old English word fist,

00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:21.764
which meant stink.

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.613
In the mid-fifteenth century,

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:26.755
fist developed into the verb fisten,

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.451
to break wind,

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.787
which eventually lead to the modern word feisty,

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:33.789
but that's another story.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.203
In its earliest form,

00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:37.042
as a variant of fisten,

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.722
fizzle had a very specific meaning:

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.257
to break wind without noise.

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:45.594
Surprisingly, considering this initial definition,

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:49.544
by the 1800s, the word fizzle referred instead

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:51.643
to a specific sound,

00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:52.830
rather graphically,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.002
to the sputtering or hissing of a gas or liquid

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.083
being forced out of a narrow opening.

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:01.255
The figurative sense of the word,

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:02.680
a weak ending,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.376
is thus understandable within the context

00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:09.182
of a flame consuming the last drops of oil in a lantern

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:11.641
or a valve drawing out the contents

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:13.929
of the bottom of a cask.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.925
Though perhaps not derived directly

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.680
from this subsiding verb,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.263
our modern meaning of fizzle

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:21.850
developed as slang in the 1800s.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.383
Originally used on college campuses

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.064
to describe failure,

00:01:26.064 --> 00:01:27.763
specifically on an exam,

00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:30.098
it wasn't long before the word came to mean

00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:32.198
exactly what it does today

00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:35.116
and was quickly and widely adopted.
