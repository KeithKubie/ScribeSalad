00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:03.008
- [Voiceover] Part b,
write the first four,

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.394
write the first nonzero terms

00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:09.741
of the Maclaurin series for
f prime, the derivative of f.

00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:12.369
Express f prime as a rational function

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.714
for the absolute value
of x being less than R,

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.756
our radius of convergence.

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:19.837
So, if we wanna find f prime,

00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:21.211
we could just take each of,

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:22.327
we could just take the derivative

00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:25.044
of each of these terms with respect to x.

00:00:25.044 --> 00:00:27.119
And so, we could just say,

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.407
if this is f, then f prime,

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:31.489
and I'm not gonna scroll down

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.044
just so I can see this up here.

00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:35.534
We could just say f prime,

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:39.258
f prime of x is going to be,

00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:41.301
or the Maclaurin series for f prime of x,

00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:43.131
maybe I should write it that way,

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:45.035
so let me write it this way.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:46.204
Maclaurin,

00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:49.009
Maclaurin,

00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:51.276
Maclaurin,

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:52.716
that a looked funny,

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:56.856
Maclaurin series

00:00:56.856 --> 00:01:00.414
for f prime,

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:02.913
f prime of x,

00:01:02.913 --> 00:01:04.844
well, it's going to be the sum

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:10.093
from n equals one to infinity,

00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:12.693
and we would just take the derivative

00:01:12.693 --> 00:01:15.517
of this right over here with respect to x.

00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:18.545
And so, this is just
application of the power rule.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.560
Take the exponent right over here,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.334
multiply it by the coefficient,

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:23.997
so if you take n times this,

00:01:23.997 --> 00:01:25.678
it cancels out with this n,

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:28.446
so it's going to be negative three

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:30.591
to the n minus one,

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:32.254
and then decrement your exponent,

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.969
times x to the n minus one.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.957
And so, they want us
to write the first four

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:40.483
nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series,

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:43.465
so that is going to be equal to,

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:45.193
so, I'll write approximately equal to,

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:46.791
because we're one going
to write the first four

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.188
of terms of this infinite series,

00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:50.310
and just to be clear what I did,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.908
I just did the power rule here,

00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:53.737
I looked at this exponent, which is n,

00:01:53.737 --> 00:01:55.576
multiplied by this coefficient,

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:56.756
which had a n in the denominator,

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:59.105
so that n and this n cancel out,

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:01.649
so I'm just left with negative
three to the n minus one,

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.507
and then I decrement that exponent.

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:04.673
That's straight out of the power rule,

00:02:04.673 --> 00:02:06.096
it's one of the first things you'll learn

00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:07.632
about taking derivatives.

00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:10.559
And so, if we want the
first four nonzero terms,

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.233
when n equals one this is going to be

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.657
negative three to the one minus one power,

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:16.446
let me just write it,

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.121
negative three to the one minus one

00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:22.344
times x to the one minus one,

00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:24.137
that's when n equals one,

00:02:24.137 --> 00:02:27.137
plus negative three,

00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:30.459
negative three to the two minus one,

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.879
two minus one,

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.823
times x to the two minus one,

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:36.733
and then,

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:38.136
and actually I could've reassured

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:40.123
this is negative three
x to the n minus one,

00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:42.157
actually let me me do that just for,

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:44.967
so this is, this I could just write,

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.365
because they have the same exponent,

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.739
this will simplify a little bit,

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.047
as negative three x

00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:53.787
to the n minus one,

00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:56.026
and so this going to be approximately,

00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:58.245
when n is equal to one,

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.056
this is gonna be equal to zero,

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:03.892
so negative three x to the zero
power is just gonna be one,

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:08.536
when n is equal to two,

00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:10.264
this is going to be two minus one,

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:11.907
so it's gonna be the first power,

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:14.202
so negative three x to the first power,

00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:17.998
so I could just write
this as negative three x,

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:20.190
and then when n is three,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.552
well, this is going to be
negative three x squared,

00:03:23.552 --> 00:03:26.403
so negative three x
squared is going to be,

00:03:26.403 --> 00:03:30.676
negative three squared is nine x squared,

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.691
and then the fourth term

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.812
is gonna be negative three x
to the four minus one power,

00:03:35.812 --> 00:03:37.317
so to the third power,

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:41.394
so negative three to the
third power is negative 27

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:45.462
times x to the third power.

00:03:45.462 --> 00:03:46.345
So there you have it,

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:49.874
that's the first four nonzero
terms of the Maclaurin series.

00:03:49.874 --> 00:03:51.462
You could've also just looked over here,

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:53.301
and said okay, the derivative of x,

00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:55.447
with respect to x is one,

00:03:55.447 --> 00:03:57.685
derivative of negative
three have x squared,

00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:01.371
with respect to x is negative
three, you could've said,

00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:05.144
the derivative of this is nine
x squared, right over there,

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.252
and then you'd have to
write out the fourth term

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:09.109
and take out the
derivative in the same way,

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.744
and you'd have gotten
this right over here.

00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:11.896
So we did the first part,

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:14.274
we wrote the first four nonzero terms

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:15.973
of the Maclaurin series for f prime,

00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:17.097
the derivative of f,

00:04:17.097 --> 00:04:17.930
and then they said,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.369
express f prime as a rational function

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:24.054
for the absolute value
of x being less than R.

00:04:24.054 --> 00:04:26.313
So this sum,

00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:27.424
if we assume it converges,

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:31.040
and we know the radius of
convergence already, so,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.772
or assuming that we're dealing

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.874
with x that are withing
the radius of convergence.

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:37.406
So this right over here,

00:04:37.406 --> 00:04:39.041
you might recognize this,

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:40.369
so I could write it like that,

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:43.308
or I could also write it,

00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:47.270
if I start at n equals zero,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.513
so I could also write this as

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:51.819
from n equals one to infinity of,

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.831
or actually, from n
equals zero to infinity

00:04:55.831 --> 00:05:00.810
of negative three x to the n minus one,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.845
either, I'm sorry,

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:03.085
to the n,

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:05.500
because now the first term
was to the zero power,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.005
that first term was to zero power,

00:05:07.005 --> 00:05:09.243
so whether you do one minus one,

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:11.565
is where you start, or you just at zero,

00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:13.432
these two things are equivalent.

00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:15.958
You might recognize these
as a geometrix series

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.256
with common ration of negative,

00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:21.681
of negative three x.

00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:24.448
And so, what's the sum
of a geometric series

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:27.076
with common ration, with
a certain common ration?

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.336
Well, it's going to be
equal to the first term,

00:05:30.336 --> 00:05:31.860
and regardless of how you view this,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.181
the first term is going to be one

00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:37.441
divided by one minus the common ratio.

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:39.721
So our common ratio is negative three x,

00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:41.463
one minus negative three x,

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:45.540
well, that's just going
to be one plus three x.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.660
If what I just did here
looks unfamiliar to you,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.257
I encourage you to watch the sum

00:05:50.257 --> 00:05:52.579
of infinite geometric series,

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:53.796
and not only do we show you

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:55.106
this formula and how to apply it,

00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:57.018
but we show how you
can prove this formula,

00:05:57.018 --> 00:05:59.048
it's actually a pretty fun prove.

00:05:59.048 --> 00:05:59.818
But anyway,

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:02.100
regardless of how you view
this Maclaurin series,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.069
it is an infinite geometric series,

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.202
and this assuming that our x

00:06:06.202 --> 00:06:07.771
is in our radius of convergence.

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:09.916
This is what our sum is,

00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:13.148
this is what we are going to converge to.
