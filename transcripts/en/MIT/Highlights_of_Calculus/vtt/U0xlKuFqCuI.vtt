GILBERT STRANG: OK, what I want
to do today is show you

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.735
two different ways that
derivatives are used.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.920
In one of them, the problem is
to find a close approximation

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.110
to the value f at a point x.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.730
f of x.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.830
The second application
is to solve an

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.800
equation, where often--

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.420
and I use a different letter,
capital F, just because it's a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.360
different function and there
will be different

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.890
examples for this one.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.690
So I just chose capital F
to keep them separate.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.420
This is the problem of
solving an equation.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.060
And Newton had an idea and
it's survived all these

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.880
centuries and it's still
the good way.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.690
OK, what's this based
on, both of them?

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.460
That's the point.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.510
They're both based
on the same idea.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.070
Suppose at a point, which is
near the x we want, or near

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.400
the solution to this problem, at
some point, let me call it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.690
a, suppose we know the slope,
the derivative, at that point.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.320
So I'm using f prime
for the derivative.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.160
At that point, well, we know
what the definition is.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.270
But I'm also supposing that
we've got that number.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.850
And now I want to use this
knowledge of the slope at that

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.580
nearby point a to come close to
the solution, the f of x,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.660
or the x there.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.660
OK, well you remember this is
delta f divided by delta x.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.160
You recognize that before we
take the limit this is two

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.509
nearby points, delta x apart.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.570
Their values, the values
of f at those points.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.970
It's the change in f divided
by the change in x--

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.930
that's what the derivative
is--

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.840
as one point approaches
the point a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.740
where we know the slope.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.060
Here's the idea.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.620
I'm just going to erase
that stuff.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.840
Well, now I won't have an
equal sign anymore.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.680
I'll have an approximately
equal.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.850
So the slope--

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.300
this is delta f over delta x--

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.410
is not the same as df
dx, which is this.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.790
But if x is close to a this will
normally be close to the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.930
correct slope, the instant
slope at the point.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.820
I'm just going to use this
approximation to find a good

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.050
approximation for f of x.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.410
So in this application on the
left I know the x and I want

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.090
to find what is f
at that point?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.390
So I look at this.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.140
I multiply up by x minus a.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.380
I move the f of a to
the other side.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.630
And what do I have?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.570
I still have an approximation
sign.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.240
So when I move the f of a to the
other side, there it is.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:52.770
And then, the other part is x
minus a times f prime at a.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.300
That's my formula.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.200
Let me just talk about that
formula for a minute and then

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.190
give examples.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.970
What that says is that if I want
to find the value of f at

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.360
a nearby point, a good thing
to do is use this linear

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.270
approximation.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.320
I use the word "linear"
because the graph

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.480
of that is a line.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.100
I'm following a straight line
instead of following the

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.970
curved graph.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.800
That's the message of
today's lecture.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.510
Follow the line.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.170
So it's a line.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.680
It starts out at the correct
point at x equal a.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.670
It has the corrects slope
f prime of a.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.630
And if I don't go too far
that line won't be too

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.140
far from the curve.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.720
Good.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.040
You'll see it now in examples.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.200
Let me get the corresponding
idea here.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.720
Now I have to remember to use
capital F. So let me create

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.240
the formula that helps to solve,
approximately solves,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.030
this equation.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.480
What's the difference?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.950
Now x is what I'm looking for.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.930
x is what I'm looking for and
F of x is what I know.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.930
I know it's to be 0.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.440
So I'm going to use this with
capital F. I know F of x

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.340
should be 0 and x
is the unknown.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.110
So can I just move that equation
around again to get

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.000
an equation?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.550
I'll bring the x minus
a up as I did before.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.290
And I have to use an
approximation sign as always.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:42.330
The F of x is 0, so I have minus
F of a, and then I'm

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.630
dividing by F prime of a.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.670
There you have it.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.360
That is Newton's insight.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.160
Newton and then somebody named
Raphson helped out, made it

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.600
work for general functions.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.230
And once again, I forgot.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.190
I should be using
capital F there.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.260
Because in the right side of
the board I'm calling the

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:19.220
function capital F. This is the
little movement of x away

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.130
from a, which will bring us
closer to the answer.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.960
You'll see is this formula
work in a picture.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:32.150
So I'm ready for an example
starting with approximation.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.600
So here's my problem.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.850
Here's my example.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.260
Find the square root of--

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.210
so my problem is going to be
find the square root or

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.210
approximate square root of 9.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.120
I'm going to shift away
from 9 a little bit.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.570
9.06.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.150
OK, how does that fit
this example?

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.760
My function is the square root
function, x to the 1/2.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.310
It's derivative, f prime.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.990
I know the derivative of
that is 1/2 x to one

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.100
lower power minus 1/2.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.810
So that's 1 over 2
square root of x.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.590
Good.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.600
I know my function.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.590
I know its derivative.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:36.090
Now I pick a point a, which
is close and easy.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:42.760
So close, I'm looking for a
point a, which is near 9.06

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.880
and has a nice square root.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.200
Well, 9.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:55.230
So I'll choose a to be 9.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.680
The correct value f at
the point a is the

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.730
square root of 9.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.470
3.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.410
That's the point.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.001
We can evaluate the function
easily at 9.

00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:19.620
And f prime at a is 1 over
2 square root of a.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.180
9.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.450
Square root of 9.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.740
So what do I have for that?

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.700
That's the easy number, 3.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.950
That's 1/6.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.799
In other words, I know what's
happening at x equal 9.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.710
And that's a particular point
I'm calling a and I'm working

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.630
from there.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.460
Then what does my approximation
say?

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.000
It says that f at this
nearby point.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.950
So x is 9.06.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:54.040
This is the x where I want
to know the square root.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.010
So this is saying that the
square root of 9.06--

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.560
that's my f of x--

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.120
is approximately f at a.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.970
That's the square root of 9.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.990
That's the 3.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.570
So far reasonable.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.090
That's the approximation I
started with just using the 9.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:20.650
But now I'm improving
it by the difference

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.710
between x minus 3.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.290
Oh, what is x?

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.250
So I'm plugging in x is 9.06.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.090
That's where I really want
the square root.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.120
That's my x.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.150
Minus a, which is the 9.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.390
Times f prime, which we
figured out as 1/6.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.960
That's the linear approximation
following this

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.540
line to this number,
which is what?

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.330
3 plus--

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.880
That's 0.06 divided by 6.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.780
That's 3.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.870
What do I have there?

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.880
This difference is 0.06.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.550
Divided by 6 and its 0.01.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.150
That's the approximation.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.000
Closer than 3.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.920
That comes from following
the line.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.300
Let me draw a graph to show
you what I mean by

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.150
following the line.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.895
Here is my square
root function.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.860
The square root looks
something like that.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:32.430
And here is the point x equals
9, where I know that the

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.680
height is 3.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.350
What else do I know?

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.550
Here is 9.06, a little
further over, and I'm

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.660
looking for that point.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.910
I'm looking for the square
root of 9.06.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:55.290
So this was 9 here and
this was 9.06.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.040
And how am I getting close
to that point?

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.440
Well, I'm not going to follow
the curve to do square root of

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.300
9.06 exactly, any
more than your

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.700
calculator or computer does.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.320
I'm going to follow this line.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.050
So that line is the
tangent line.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:23.300
It's the line that goes through
the right thing at a

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.550
with the right slope.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:30.670
So you can see that by
following the line

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.526
that gave me the 3.

00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:32.776
And then here is the little--
you see what I'm--

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.760
I'm missing by a very small
amount, practically

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.020
too small to see.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:49.185
I'm picking the point on the
line and that was this across,

00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:53.220
this delta x was the 0.06.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.560
The little tiny bit
here is the 0.06.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:03.840
And this delta f is the
little piece that I

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.790
added on the 0.01.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.120
How did that come from?

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.570
It came from the fact that
the correct slope is 1/6.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.330
If I go over 0.06, I
should go up 0.01.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.520
So you see what I'm doing?

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:28.210
I'm taking that point as my
close approximation to the

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:28.760
square root.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.830
Closer than 3 to the square
root of 9.06.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:34.950
OK.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.990
That's a first example.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.870
I'll give a second one.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:44.180
But first, I'd like to give an
example that's like this one

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.430
of Newton's method.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.120
May I change now to
Newton's method?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.030
So I want to create
an equation.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.270
And actually, I want it to
solve the same problem.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.440
So I'm going to take my function
to be x squared minus

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:05.870
9.06 and I'll set that to 0.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.670
I'm just keeping
my two examples

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.775
close because the answer--

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.450
in both problems, I'm looking
for the square root of 9.06.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.300
Of course, that's the solution
to this equation, the square

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.190
root of 9.06.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:34.210
OK again, I pick a point a
close to the solution.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:39.830
And again, I'm going
to take a to be 3.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.070
So 3 is close to the
correct solution.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.370
The correct x is the square
root of 9.06.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:55.100
But I'm starting close to it.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:01.040
OK, at that point I
figure out F of a.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.700
Newton wants to know
F of a, the value.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.740
And Newton also wants
to know the slope.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.360
So the value at a is--

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.200
3 squared is 9.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:20.200
9 minus 9.06 is minus 0.06.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:29.160
F prime of a is-- what's
the derivative of F?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.980
Capital F. Well, the derivative
is certainly 2x.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.710
And at the point a it's 6.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.220
This is the 2x.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.300
2a.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.340
This is the 2a because I'm
evaluating the slope

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.140
at the point a.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.060
Actually, if you want a
picture, it's quite

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.390
interesting to see
the picture.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.610
Let me graph this f of x now.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.170
What does my function
f of x look like?

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.920
x squared.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.150
That's a parabola going up.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.900
It starts below here.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.335
It starts somewhere down here
and it curves up like so.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.270
So this is the point I want.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.370
There is the square
root of 9.06.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:26.060
I've graphed a function
x squared minus 9.06.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.140
That's the point I'd
like to find.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.740
I'm not expecting to
find it exactly.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.200
What I do is I have
a nearby point 3.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:47.130
At 3 I do know the exact value
and I know the slope.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.175
Ha.

00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:57.750
Even my bad art is telling me
what's going to happen.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.980
Let me write that 3 better.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.490
a equals 3.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.770
This is where I know
what's happening.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:11.320
I know the value of F. It's
actually pretty small, but

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.780
it's negative.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.510
I know the value of the slope.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:20.010
So this is like I've blown
up this picture here.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:31.640
This F is the negative 0.06.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:37.550
Is the value of F.
The slope is 6.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.060
And what's the x?

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.160
What is my improved guess
at the solution?

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.610
My improved guess, I don't
follow that curve because that

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.120
would be perfect.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.240
But curves are hard to follow.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:17:01.140
I'll follow the straight line
and that's my next x.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.460
My better x.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.170
You see, that's a lot better.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.089
Let me do the numbers
here and you'll see

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:10.329
that it's a lot better.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.930
What is the x that Newton's
method gives us?

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.109
I'm using Newton's
formula here.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:22.710
So Newton's formula says that
x minus the a is 3.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:27.589
And Newton's formula is going
to take equal to get an

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.440
approximate x.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.920
Minus F of a.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.810
So what's minus F of a?

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.860
That will be plus 0.06.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.250
Divided by F prime of a,
the slope, which was 6.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.010
What do I get?

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.680
I did 0.01.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.270
Actually, the two examples,
of course, are parallel.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.880
In a way, the graph of that
square root function kind of

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.390
got just flipped to this graph
of the x squared function.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.930
The square root function and
the x squared function are

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.980
just sort of inverses
to each other.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:14.370
Their graphs flip and so now the
slope is 6 instead of 1/6.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:22.940
And do you see that that
distance, this is the x minus

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:29.320
a distance that has
to be 0.01.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.930
That's what I concluded.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:38.360
I go across 1 if I'm going
up/down by 6 because

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.910
the slope is 6.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.250
OK, good.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.390
Now, how close am I?

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.440
Well, I can't resist asking.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:58.010
Suppose I multiply
3.01 by 3.01.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:04.450
Am I close to the 9.06 that
was my whole goal?

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.680
And how close?

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.550
Of course, I'm not going
to be exact.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:12.530
If I do that multiplication
I get 301, 903.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:21.810
Combined I get 9 and the decimal
put it in there, 0601.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:28.940
So by that method or by that
method I ended up with 3.01 as

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:34.590
much closer to the square
root of 9.06.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:40.300
You see when I square 3.01,
it slightly overshot.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.800
It slightly overshot the 9.06.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:50.030
This little error there, this
is the overshoot error.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:55.000
And when I square it, it's way
out in the ten thousandths

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.890
place, the fourth
decimal place.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:00.010
OK.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.240
So those are the two
parallel examples.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.700
May I go back to the linear
approximation?

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.370
Because I think another
example's appropriate there.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.450
And then I'll come back and give
another Newton example.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.250
So that's my plan here.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.620
Two examples of each.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.480
So those examples were parallel,
the next two

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.520
examples will be a
little different.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.420
So let me show you
example two.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:42.620
So linear approximation
example two.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.298
So I want--

00:20:49.298 --> 00:20:50.440
OK, I'm going to look
for something that

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.770
I don't know exactly.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:58.980
Let me take e to the 0.01.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:06.160
What's the value of e to
the power of 0.01?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.930
So the function is e to the x.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:24.080
And I'm looking at x is 0.01.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.700
That's what I want.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.550
I am not going to get an
exact number here.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.960
I'm going to follow
the tangent line.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.710
I'm going to get
a close number.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.120
So where shall I start?

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.510
I'll start with a number that's
close to that and where

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.530
I do you know the correct e.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.030
And a number close
to that is take--

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.630
I'll choose a to be 0.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.110
That's close to 0.01.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:00.770
Then f of a is e
to the 0 power.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.790
So that's 1.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.260
Now for the straight line
approximation, I also need the

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.020
correct slope.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.360
Correct slope at a?

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.610
Well, I do know the
slope of this.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.460
f prime at 0.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.970
That's my a.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.410
f prime at 0.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.320
0 is my a.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.640
Well, I know the derivative
of e to the x.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.130
That's one thing I like.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.510
It's e to the x.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:34.500
So at x equals 0, again I get a
1 for the derivative, which

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.410
is the same, I get e to the 0.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.460
I get also a 1.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.620
So now I know what's happening
at a equals 0.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.740
I want to know approximately
what's happening at the nearby

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:53.360
point, 0.01.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.780
e to the 0.01, e to the x.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.940
This is the e to the x.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.070
That's my function.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:06.740
And I'm only going to get it
approximately, is the value at

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.930
this known point.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:18.880
The value at the known point 0,
the exact exponential is 1.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:26.900
Plus x minus a times the slope,
the corrects slope, at

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.640
this not quite perfect
point, 0.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.090
And the correct slope is 1.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.660
And of course, a was 0.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.310
So you see I'm using all the
facts at a to get an

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.720
approximate fact at x.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.340
And what have I got here?

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.590
I've just got 1 plus x.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.310
You know, in a way,
that's perfect.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:58.540
Because it shows what the linear
approximation is doing.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.930
You remember the series
for e to the x?

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.320
My correct function
is e to the x.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.900
My approximate function
is 1 plus x.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.450
What's the connection?

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.750
You remember that e to the x,
the series for e to the x

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:21.290
started out 1 plus x plus 1/2
x squared, 1/6 x cubed.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:25.270
Those are the guys, those are
the higher order corrections

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.440
that following the
line misses.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.510
Those are the parts where the
function, the curve e to the

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.020
x, has left the line.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.410
But if I don't go to far--So
this is 1.01.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.980
x is 0.01.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.240
That's my approximation.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.390
1 plus x.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.320
That's the thing to notice.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.410
That linear approximations and
you could come back to that--

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.200
the formula for any
f and any a.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:11.030
Linear approximations are just
like those power series.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.940
Just like the e to the x equal
1 plus x plus 1/2 x squared

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.110
plus so on.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:22.810
Except we cut them off after
just the constant term and the

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.810
linear term.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.150
That's what this linear
approximation is about.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.000
And you might say, what's
the next term?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.980
And of course we know that the
next term is 1/2 x squared and

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.310
you could ask, what's the
next term in this?

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.430
In the general case, actually
let me tell you the next term.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.630
Next would be--

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.630
but we're not using it.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.660
Would be the 1/2.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:54.200
It would be the x minus a
squared and it would be the

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.950
second derivative at a.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.670
If we kept it that's
what we would keep.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.980
OK, good.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.600
You saw the main point of linear
approximation stop at

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.670
the linear term.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.690
Finally, I go back to an example
of Newton's method.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.900
A second example of
Newton's method.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.990
So I've been thinking,
what should I do?

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.520
Let me use Newton's method
the way it's really used.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.840
The way you use Newton's method
is you do this to come

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.360
close to the solution.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.360
And then, you do it again.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.140
You do it again starting
at 3.01.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.170
So I planned to do just the same
thing for the next step

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:48.135
of Newton's method,
except the a.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:59.810
I'm still aiming to solve this
same equation, but I'm going

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.130
to get closer than 3.01.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.090
I got closer than 3 to 3.01.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.660
Now I'm going to
restart there.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.150
a is now going to be 3.01.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:16.350
I need to compute F of a
for Newton's method.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.900
So I have to do 3.01 squared and
take away that to see how

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.350
wrong I am.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.470
HA.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.980
We did 3.01 squared.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.300
Actually, right there.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.970
So if I take away the 9.06, the
F of a is-- well, that was

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.330
the whole point.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.910
That it was pretty darn close.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.750
But nothing compared to the
closeness we're going to get

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.600
at the second term.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.850
And what's F prime of a?

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.650
Take the derivative 2x.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.350
At the point a it's 2a.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.560
And a is now 3.01.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.030
So the slope is 6.02.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.720
You see what I'm doing.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:05.310
I'm just moving over to this
point, which that has become

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:10.470
now the a in the second try.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.230
a in the second cycle
of Newton's method.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.760
This is how Newton's method
really is used.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.170
And now let's find the new
x, the highly improved

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.470
x, better than 3.01.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.190
So Newton's method says
x, the new x, minus a.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.160
I'm just using Newton's
formula.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.280
x minus the a is supposed
to be minus the F of a.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:47.340
So that's 0.0001 divided
by F prime of a, 6.02.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.330
This is the delta
x you could say.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.000
This is the little correction.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.810
It's negative.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.890
It means that we need to
pull back a little.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.130
And you see that.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:02.260
We slightly, slightly overshot
by following the tangent line.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.050
The curve went up a little
across 0 a little before the

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.020
tangent line.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.770
This is extremely close.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:17.980
So now this gives me the new x
right here, 3.01 minus this

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.360
tiny little bit.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.170
And so that's what the
calculator will do.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.120
I hope you'll do it
on a calculator.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.740
Just make the calculator take
that quantity, then

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.030
make it square it.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.740
Then just go through this.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.910
Find the new x.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:40.530
Square it.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.840
Subtract 9.06.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.560
Let's see how close it is.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.260
I believe that the error--

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.430
I don't know what it is.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:55.930
That's more than I can do in
my head, squaring that 3.01

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.880
minus this little tiny bit.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:07.590
But I am confident that the
error, the x new squared.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:13.010
This is the formula for
x new, the second

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.570
cycle of Newton's method.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:21.340
I think that minus the
9.06, I don't know--

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.915
can I just put a
bunch of zeros?

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.270
Somebody will want me to
put in a 1 here, so

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.410
I'll put in a 1.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.320
I bet it's way out there.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.480
So Newton's method is really
a terrific success.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.370
Follow the line, then follow
the next tangent line.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:46.260
Then follow the next one and you
home in very, very quickly

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.560
on the exact answer.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.400
You get more and more decimal
places correct.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.630
OK, that's two uses
of calculus coming

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.080
from the same idea.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.120
The same idea delta
f over delta x.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.070
In one case, it was f
that we didn't know.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.440
In this case, it was x
that we didn't know.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.390
In both cases that formula
gives a terrific and a

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:18.010
terrifically simple and
close approximation

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.030
to the exact answer.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.210
Good.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.290
