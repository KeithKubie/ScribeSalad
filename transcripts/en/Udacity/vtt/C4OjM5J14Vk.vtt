00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.380
So today, we talked about diagnosis which is a term we're very familiar with

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.180
from our everyday lives. But today, we talked about it specifically in

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.870
a knowledge-based AI sense. We started off by defining diagnosis,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.570
which is finding the fault responsible for the malfunction in some system.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
This can be computers, computer programs, cars or even people and animals.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.990
We then talked about the process of diagnosis, mapping data onto hypotheses and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.750
how we can see this as a form of classification. We discovered though that this

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.350
can be a very complicated process and classification might not get

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.530
us all the way there. So then we talked about diagnosis as a form of abduction.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.560
Given a rule and effect or a symptom, we can abduce the cause of that problem,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.830
like an illness or a software bug. Both configuration and diagnosis have been

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.820
small tasks in the broader process of design. Now that we talk about them,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.990
we can talk about AI agents that can actually do design in the real world,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.010
as well as what it would mean for an AI agent to really be creative.
