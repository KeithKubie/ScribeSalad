00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
[Captions by Y Translator]
Glow sticks have
two chemicals in them,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.402
and when you combine them,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.972
they start putting
off some good light.

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:05.750
Today, we're going to see
if we can activate

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.352
that in a slightly
different way.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.160
[Music]

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.260
In the past, we've done a few pretty
fun experiments with glow sticks,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.480
and we're back at it today,

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:18.782
and we also have what you

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:22.120
may recognize as a very strong,
industrial strength blender.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.276
We're going to see what happens

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:25.617
if we take few different types
of glow sticks,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.560
and throw them
into this blender.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.432
I'm just curious to see
how well it activates,

00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:31.250
how well it chews
through the plastic,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.650
and what this glowing liquid
looks like as it's a swirling around.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.335
We're going to get
some slow-mo footage,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.100
and it's just
gonna be lot of fun.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.960
Here's what we're going to try.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.240
We're going to put
some glow sticks in the blender.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.200
We're going to try heating up
the glow sticks in a microwave,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.640
and putting them in a blender,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.094
and then we're going
to add a little bit

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.320
of our secret ingredient to see

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.140
if we can get
some extra brilliance.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.160
Let's start off with just
a single glow stick,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.980
and see how this works.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.300
Just going to set
that in there,

00:00:56.302 --> 00:00:59.150
make sure my lid is nice
and well attached,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.560
and I think the soup button
looks like the one to go for.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.580
Let's try that.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.060
Okay, here it goes.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.480
3, 2, 1.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:27.640
[Music]

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.082
Man, that is hitting the side
of the jar with a lot of force.

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:35.280
[Music]

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.720
It's just like flinging.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.220
I'm just watching the slow mo,

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:44.750
and it's just like spraying and
flinging the glowing fluid out.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.860
Where it is now,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.705
most of the glow stick

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:47.840
is still intact.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.800
Just got hit and like did
a triple pirouette in the air,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.740
and I'm sure there's
a skating move name for that.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.477
But it's just fun to watch
how exactly it gets beat up.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.320
At normal speed, you can't tell.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.840
It's just lots
of vibrating, shaking,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.400
and then there's green
on the walls,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.600
but it's cool.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.792
So after cleaning
out our blender,

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:09.865
the first blend,

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:13.220
our blender has now
like been stained green,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.154
and I'm pretty sure

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.792
it's actually even
glowing a little bit.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.880
So it glows a little bit,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120
and then if I hit it
with a black light,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.420
this thing is just imbued with
glow stick fluid at this point.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.360
It's actually even brighter
and greener in real life,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.560
than it is on camera,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.520
and it looks pretty
bright on camera.

00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:36.481
We have tried several different
things to clean this off.

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.971
We tried alcohol,
we tried soap,

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:40.571
we've tried cleaning oils,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.202
and so far, nothing
has done anything to it.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.056
Okay, one worked pretty good.

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:46.351
I want to try taking

00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.747
that up to like three
or four at once,

00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:50.172
and see how that goes.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:05.560
[Music]

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.080
I get a kick out of that.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.500
That's a great avatar
looking blue right there.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:30.800
[Music]

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.852
Okay, we've got some
of these glow bracelets,

00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:34.900
and I'm going to try throwing
them in the microwave

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.650
before I toss them
into the blender.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.960
See if we can get a little bit
of extra brightness out of them.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.280
[Music]

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.220
So accidentally bent this one,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.540
and it did break a little bit,
but it hasn't spread everywhere.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.280
So I think we're
still good, to try this out.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:06.200
[Music]

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.132
Nice.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:25.880
[Music]

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.547
It's cool, and it get activated them all
while they're still like stick shaped,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.380
and then after it
activated them,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.540
it just started
tearing them apart.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.060
I think the only solution
now is to just keep doing this,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.980
and see what kind of colors
we can get out of it.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:05:03.080
[Music]

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.040
Once you can't see
anything inside,

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:07.152
it's probably
a good time to stop.

00:05:08.482 --> 00:05:09.452
Oh man.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:29.800
[Music]

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.960
All that is...

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.200
Right. There's like vapor coming out.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.080
I don't wanna breath it.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.112
It might just be atomized
glow stick or something.

00:05:40.112 --> 00:05:41.417
New thing I'm going to try now,

00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.718
as I've been washing out
the blender with hot water.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.937
I've noticed that sometimes

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.760
the hot water is making it glow
a little bit more intensely.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.200
So now, we've filled the blender

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.654
with a little bit
of that hot water.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.280
We're going to try putting
a glow sticks in that,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.880
and then just see what happens.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:38.220
[Music]

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.440
One more thing
we're going to try,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.260
I'm going to see what happens

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.740
if we just drain all
of the liquid out,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.077
and so we just have the liquid
and the glass vials

00:06:46.077 --> 00:06:49.350
in the blender, rather
than the whole glow stick,

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.220
including the plastic.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.739
It will definitely
break more easily,

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:55.142
but I don't know
if it will look cooler.

00:06:55.142 --> 00:07:17.180
[Music]

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.980
Well...

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.000
[Music]

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.220
I think... I think that was it.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.480
I think it's shattered all
of them, instantly.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.800
It should look good...
good in slow mo though.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.580
[Music]

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.740
Holy moly.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.240
We've got a little bit
more time right now.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.780
We're going to do some more Q and A.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.750
You have ask some questions.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.900
We're going to try
and answer some of them for you.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.660
We have a question from
Josh Bailey, @Cornish_boi, saying,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.420
"Would you ever do
a tour of your shop

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:51.492
and video editing area?"

00:07:51.682 --> 00:07:53.550
Yeah, and doing a tour

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.419
of our shop would actually
take very very little time.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:58.205
We've got the main
workbench area,

00:07:58.205 --> 00:07:59.995
and then we've got
the kitchen area,

00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:01.741
and those two areas are about 8,

00:08:01.741 --> 00:08:03.650
maybe 10 feet apart
from each other.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.340
So it's more of just
a swiveling the camera.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.080
[Music]

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.380
The editing is not done
at the same place.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.120
The editing,
we've got several editors.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.520
Our cameraman, Mark,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.380
he does the first edits
of most things.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.040
He takes all of the many
hours of footage

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.893
that will send him
to get through video.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.520
He will condense that down into
just like a half hour version,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.440
taking out all of the times

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.169
where I messed up
what I was trying to say,

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:29.219
or I cut myself off camera
and didn't want to show

00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:30.400
that and stuff like that.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.100
So he'll cut that down
so you can follow the storyline,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.542
and then he'll
take that version,

00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:36.440
and he'll send it off
to one of our other editors,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.220
and we have like a team
of other editors.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.540
We've got editors in multiple
parts of the United States,

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.150
and we also have some editors
in the Philippines,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.050
and so there are several
different editing stations

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.155
and workstations.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.040
But yeah, tour of the studio,

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.820
pretty, pretty quick
to show you all that.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.180
Doesn't take too long.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.260
One room than the other.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.360
All right, we've got
another question here,

00:08:57.364 --> 00:08:58.345
and I'm very sorry,

00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:00.360
I'm probably going
to pronounce your name wrong,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:07.120
Gabriel Fanshteyn,
@GabeFansh, he asks,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.340
"How likely would you
guys make a second channel

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.940
of like bloopers
during the project,

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.302
because in your videos,

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:15.600
you do small versions
of bloopers at the end,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.600
but why not make
a channel full of them?"

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.600
So like a behind the scenes
or blooper Channel.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.650
I don't think that's anything
we've considered doing in the past,

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.320
but it's not a bad idea.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.040
There are often things

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.679
that get cut out
of the final videos,

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:30.850
because we feel
like it would disrupt the flow,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.576
it doesn't really match
the tone that we're going for,

00:09:33.576 --> 00:09:36.107
or it's just not helpful
to the end of the project.

00:09:36.107 --> 00:09:37.907
And I don't think
we've really looked

00:09:37.907 --> 00:09:39.275
into building a second channel.

00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:40.600
One of the main problems is

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.450
that although we
have several editors,

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.155
they're pretty busy as it is.

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:45.941
We put out five videos a week,

00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:49.300
and so, putting together enough
videos to fill a second channel

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.314
on top of that would...

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.500
We'd probably have to hire
new editors just for that,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.180
and so, it would be tricky.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.640
So while I'm not going
to say no for sure,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.450
it's not on the top
of our to-do list.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.200
Guys, that's it for today,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.600
but there's always more
for you to see.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.727
That box at the top will take
you directly to our last video,

00:10:06.727 --> 00:10:07.926
and you should go
check that out.

00:10:07.926 --> 00:10:08.938
The other box will show you

00:10:08.938 --> 00:10:10.700
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.900
and if you haven't subscribed
to our channel,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.102
hit this bomb to join the club,

00:10:14.102 --> 00:10:15.900
and that way you'll
