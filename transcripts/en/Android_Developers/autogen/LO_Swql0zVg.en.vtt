around 220 20 KH that means that we have

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:37.540
around 220 20 KH that means that we have
 

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.199
around 220 20 KH that means that we have
lower throughput the user needs to wait

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:40.209
lower throughput the user needs to wait
 

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:42.660
lower throughput the user needs to wait
longer for the data and it also means

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:42.670
longer for the data and it also means
 

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.000
longer for the data and it also means
that we're spending more time in this

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.010
that we're spending more time in this

first problem is when the app download
 

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.880
first problem is when the app download
something from the server and that

information so the app can't cash it
 

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.660
information so the app can't cash it
let's say the app downloaded me an image

since that exit the app in two seconds
seconds two seconds later he goes back

00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:16.629
seconds two seconds later he goes back
 

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.619
seconds two seconds later he goes back
to the app we go down we go back and

00:13:19.619 --> 00:13:19.629
to the app we go down we go back and
 

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:21.269
to the app we go down we go back and
download the same very image that we

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279
download the same very image that we
 

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:23.729
download the same very image that we
download two seconds ago waste of time

00:13:23.729 --> 00:13:23.739

solution is to use headers the right

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:28.809
solution is to use headers the right
 

00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:31.499
solution is to use headers the right
headers like Max age or expires when you

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:31.509
headers like Max age or expires when you
 

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:33.090
headers like Max age or expires when you
send something to your client and then

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:33.100
send something to your client and then
 

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.030
send something to your client and then
the client can can can use it second

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040
the client can can can use it second
 

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.699
the client can can can use it second
problem is that content with caching

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:38.709
problem is that content with caching
 

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:41.939
problem is that content with caching
information the cache hasn't expired but

00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:41.949
information the cache hasn't expired but
 

00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:43.949
information the cache hasn't expired but
it is being downloaded anyway by the

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959
it is being downloaded anyway by the
 

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:46.530
it is being downloaded anyway by the
client we've seen there happens a lot so

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:46.540
client we've seen there happens a lot so
 

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.289
client we've seen there happens a lot so
when we write some code that goes and

00:13:49.289 --> 00:13:49.299
when we write some code that goes and
 

00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:51.299
when we write some code that goes and
fetches an image of Elena we don't

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:51.309

actually check if if that content has

00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279
actually check if if that content has
 

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.729
actually check if if that content has
expired or not so the solution is simple

00:13:56.729 --> 00:13:56.739
expired or not so the solution is simple
 

00:13:56.739 --> 00:14:00.509
expired or not so the solution is simple
don't do it okay

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519
don't do it okay
 

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:05.509
don't do it okay
I don't believe it you're leaving me

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519
 
 

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:09.720
 
okay friends anyway third problem

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:09.730
okay friends anyway third problem
 

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.449
okay friends anyway third problem
content that has been downloaded cached

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:12.459
content that has been downloaded cached
 

00:14:12.459 --> 00:14:17.400
content that has been downloaded cached
by the client the cache expired okay but

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:17.410
by the client the cache expired okay but
 

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.499
by the client the cache expired okay but
the actual file hasn't been changed on

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:19.509
the actual file hasn't been changed on
 

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:22.439
the actual file hasn't been changed on
the server side it's the same fine so

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:22.449
the server side it's the same fine so
 

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:24.090
the server side it's the same fine so
usually what the client will do it will

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:24.100
usually what the client will do it will
 

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.359
usually what the client will do it will
go in say hey my local cache is expired

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:27.369
go in say hey my local cache is expired
 

00:14:27.369 --> 00:14:29.699
go in say hey my local cache is expired
let's download that content again but

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:29.709
let's download that content again but
 

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:32.160
let's download that content again but
instead the client can use an if

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.170
instead the client can use an if
 

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.859
instead the client can use an if
modified since header and then if the

00:14:34.859 --> 00:14:34.869
modified since header and then if the
 

00:14:34.869 --> 00:14:36.629
modified since header and then if the
content hasn't changed on the server

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639
content hasn't changed on the server
 

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.609
content hasn't changed on the server
side the server instead of sending that

00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:38.619
side the server instead of sending that
 

00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:43.530
side the server instead of sending that
image back we'll send a 304 not modified

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:43.540
image back we'll send a 304 not modified
 

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.650
image back we'll send a 304 not modified
and then the client knows that hey my

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:46.660
and then the client knows that hey my
 

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.600
and then the client knows that hey my
local copy is still valid I can use it

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:48.610
local copy is still valid I can use it
 

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.910
local copy is still valid I can use it
instead of downloading a big chunk of

so I know that most of us are using HTTP

00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:04.299
so I know that most of us are using HTTP
 

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:07.499
so I know that most of us are using HTTP

a library that gives us transport layer
but in some cases we need to actually

00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:14.829
but in some cases we need to actually
 

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:16.499
but in some cases we need to actually
take care of connections ourselves to

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:16.509
take care of connections ourselves to
 

00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:18.869

and we've seen several mistake mistakes

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560
and we've seen several mistake mistakes
 

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.499
and we've seen several mistake mistakes
there the common one is that we open a

00:15:27.499 --> 00:15:27.509
there the common one is that we open a
 

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:29.840
there the common one is that we open a
connection we use it and then we don't

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:29.850
connection we use it and then we don't
 

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.809
connection we use it and then we don't
close it we don't call socket close

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:32.819
close it we don't call socket close
 

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:35.660
close it we don't call socket close
because we think that hey the TCP will

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:35.670
because we think that hey the TCP will
 

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.910
because we think that hey the TCP will
timeout and that this TCP stack will

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920
timeout and that this TCP stack will
 

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.769
timeout and that this TCP stack will
close the connection for us and actually

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779
close the connection for us and actually
 

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:42.439
close the connection for us and actually
it does but what happens is that in

00:15:42.439 --> 00:15:42.449
it does but what happens is that in
 

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:44.059
it does but what happens is that in
order to close the connection we need to

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:44.069
order to close the connection we need to
 

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:47.240
order to close the connection we need to
send TCP reset to the other side and in

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:47.250
send TCP reset to the other side and in
 

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:52.490
send TCP reset to the other side and in
order to send that TCP reset we fire up

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500
order to send that TCP reset we fire up
 

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.939
order to send that TCP reset we fire up
the radio from idle to DCH to FSH and

00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:55.949
the radio from idle to DCH to FSH and
 

00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:58.460
the radio from idle to DCH to FSH and
back to either let's waste of energy

okay

00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579
okay

okay
another common name problem is that when

another common name problem is that when
 

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.400
another common name problem is that when
we open the connection just to have one

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.410
we open the connection just to have one
 

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.369
we open the connection just to have one

about some advanced techniques that will
 

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:39.860
about some advanced techniques that will
help you to become better a new member

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:39.870
help you to become better a new member
 

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.980
help you to become better a new member
our goals are less radio time and less

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:42.990
our goals are less radio time and less
 

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.449
our goals are less radio time and less
data now it's easy to say it's a little

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459
data now it's easy to say it's a little
 

00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:49.490
data now it's easy to say it's a little
bit harder to implement because when you

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:49.500
bit harder to implement because when you
 

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.860
bit harder to implement because when you
think about it in our app we're dealing

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:51.870
think about it in our app we're dealing
 

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.100
think about it in our app we're dealing
with many many many transactions there

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:55.110
with many many many transactions there
 

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.590
with many many many transactions there
are so many code passes that will lead

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600
are so many code passes that will lead
 

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.019
are so many code passes that will lead
to a transaction to a thread that will

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:00.029
to a transaction to a thread that will
 

00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:02.300
to a transaction to a thread that will
fire up a network a transaction it's

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:02.310
fire up a network a transaction it's
 

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.250
fire up a network a transaction it's
very hard for us as developers to say

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260
very hard for us as developers to say
 

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.370
very hard for us as developers to say
which transaction happens when and how

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380
which transaction happens when and how
 

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.120
which transaction happens when and how
to do with it

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.130
to do with it
 

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.980
to do with it
so in order to make things a little bit

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:09.990
so in order to make things a little bit
 

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.699
so in order to make things a little bit
easier I decided let's what we're gonna

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:13.709
easier I decided let's what we're gonna
 

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:16.250
easier I decided let's what we're gonna
do we're gonna categorize network

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260
do we're gonna categorize network
 

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.279
do we're gonna categorize network
requests to three different buckets

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:18.289
requests to three different buckets
 

00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:21.350
requests to three different buckets
first there is the stuff that the user

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360
first there is the stuff that the user
 

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.720
first there is the stuff that the user
asks us now the user clicks on the

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:23.730
asks us now the user clicks on the
 

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.460
asks us now the user clicks on the
article and wants to read that article

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:25.470
article and wants to read that article
 

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.850
article and wants to read that article
he wants to get into that specific post

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860
he wants to get into that specific post
 

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.850
he wants to get into that specific post
or whatever we need data right now for

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:31.860
or whatever we need data right now for
 

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.860
or whatever we need data right now for
the user we need to go now and bring the

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:33.870
the user we need to go now and bring the
 

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.580
the user we need to go now and bring the
data in order

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:34.590
data in order
 

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.480
data in order
display that to the user second type is

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:37.490
display that to the user second type is
 

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.430
display that to the user second type is
those small data updates that we need to

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440
those small data updates that we need to
 

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.060
those small data updates that we need to
send to our servers when or while the

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.070
send to our servers when or while the
 

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.680
send to our servers when or while the
application is running again like

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:45.690
application is running again like
 

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.990
application is running again like
analytics or location updates and

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000
analytics or location updates and
 

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.730
analytics or location updates and
whatnot

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:48.740
whatnot
 

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.490
whatnot
these are usually will be small payloads

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500
these are usually will be small payloads
 

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.039
these are usually will be small payloads
and there will care about them only when

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:55.049
and there will care about them only when
 

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:57.980
and there will care about them only when
the app is actually running the third

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:57.990
the app is actually running the third
 

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.169
the app is actually running the third
type is there is when we want to send a

00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:02.179
type is there is when we want to send a
 

00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:05.299
type is there is when we want to send a
relatively big chunks of data to the

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:05.309
relatively big chunks of data to the
 

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:07.820
relatively big chunks of data to the
server in order to sync let's say

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:07.830
server in order to sync let's say
 

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.600
server in order to sync let's say
uploading a bunch of photos or doing

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:10.610
uploading a bunch of photos or doing
 

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.870
uploading a bunch of photos or doing
email sync like Gmail does or contact

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880
email sync like Gmail does or contact
 

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.010
email sync like Gmail does or contact
address booking contact list things like

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020
address booking contact list things like
 

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.470
address booking contact list things like
what up does okay we don't really care

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480
what up does okay we don't really care
 

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.200
what up does okay we don't really care
about exactly when that transaction will

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.210
about exactly when that transaction will
 

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.480
about exactly when that transaction will
happen it's big chunks and it usually

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:23.490
happen it's big chunks and it usually
 

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.880
happen it's big chunks and it usually
happens in the background now

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:25.890
happens in the background now
 

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.620
happens in the background now
the second and third types we can

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:27.630
the second and third types we can
 

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.360
the second and third types we can
optimize by batching and the first one

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:31.370
optimize by batching and the first one
 

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.760
optimize by batching and the first one
can be optimized by prefetching and

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:34.770
can be optimized by prefetching and
 

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.810
can be optimized by prefetching and
we're going to talk about these two

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820
we're going to talk about these two
 

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.760
we're going to talk about these two
techniques now so let's start with

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:37.770
techniques now so let's start with
 

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.750
techniques now so let's start with
batching batching basically would take a

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760
batching batching basically would take a
 

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.389
batching batching basically would take a
bunch of transactions that happens over

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:44.399
bunch of transactions that happens over
 

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:46.490
bunch of transactions that happens over
time and for every transaction we

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500
time and for every transaction we
 

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.010
time and for every transaction we
actually pay a Radio transition stage

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020
actually pay a Radio transition stage
 

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.220
actually pay a Radio transition stage
okay those transitions from this age to

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.230
okay those transitions from this age to
 

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.630
okay those transitions from this age to
FECA to I they're not gonna say that

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640
FECA to I they're not gonna say that
 

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.610
FECA to I they're not gonna say that
alot today and we batch them together so

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620
alot today and we batch them together so
 

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.049
alot today and we batch them together so
we pay the overhead only once now this

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059
we pay the overhead only once now this
 

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:06.919
we pay the overhead only once now this
is the way to do that is by simply when

00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:06.929
is the way to do that is by simply when
 

00:19:06.929 --> 00:19:08.810
is the way to do that is by simply when
you have a network request don't execute

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820
you have a network request don't execute
 

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.180
you have a network request don't execute
it immediately simply send it to a queue

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.190
it immediately simply send it to a queue
 

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.210
it immediately simply send it to a queue
okay it can be a very simple queue or

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220
okay it can be a very simple queue or
 

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.980
okay it can be a very simple queue or
something more complex like I don't know

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:15.990
something more complex like I don't know
 

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.409
something more complex like I don't know
content provider I can even see realize

00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419
content provider I can even see realize
 

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:21.380
content provider I can even see realize
that transaction to the persistent

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.390
that transaction to the persistent
 

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.240
that transaction to the persistent
storage so you won't lose it if the app

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:23.250
storage so you won't lose it if the app
 

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.350
storage so you won't lose it if the app
gets terminated now you would ask

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360
gets terminated now you would ask
 

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.470
gets terminated now you would ask
yourself when do I put my queue when do

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480
yourself when do I put my queue when do
 

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.720
yourself when do I put my queue when do
I actually go and send that so an easy

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:32.730
I actually go and send that so an easy
 

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.490
I actually go and send that so an easy
answer let's say when we reach treasure

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500
answer let's say when we reach treasure
 

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.669
answer let's say when we reach treasure
let's say I don't know ten transaction

00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679
let's say I don't know ten transaction
 

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:38.840
let's say I don't know ten transaction
in the queue let's bash them together

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:38.850
in the queue let's bash them together
 

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.139
in the queue let's bash them together
and send them out there works but when

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:42.149
and send them out there works but when
 

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:44.630
and send them out there works but when
we think about it actually our phone is

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640
we think about it actually our phone is
 

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.310
we think about it actually our phone is
doing a lot of stuff in the system and

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320
doing a lot of stuff in the system and
 

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.580
doing a lot of stuff in the system and
there is very good chance

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:47.590
there is very good chance
 

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.399
there is very good chance
that another app will use the radio

00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:50.409
that another app will use the radio
 

00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:53.700
that another app will use the radio
before the threshold is reached so we

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:53.710
before the threshold is reached so we
 

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.130
before the threshold is reached so we
would really like to get notified when

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.140
would really like to get notified when
 

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.260
would really like to get notified when
somebody else is using the radio the

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.270
somebody else is using the radio the
 

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.539
somebody else is using the radio the
radio is always already hot it's in this

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:00.549
radio is always already hot it's in this
 

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:03.720
radio is always already hot it's in this
edge mode why don't we piggyback on that

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:03.730
edge mode why don't we piggyback on that
 

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.510
edge mode why don't we piggyback on that
why don't why it's it will be very good

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520
why don't why it's it will be very good
 

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.230
why don't why it's it will be very good
idea for us to piggyback on that and

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240
idea for us to piggyback on that and
 

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.310
idea for us to piggyback on that and
transmit and that's exactly why we

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320
transmit and that's exactly why we
 

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.940
transmit and that's exactly why we
introduced job scheduler in lollipop how

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:14.950
introduced job scheduler in lollipop how
 

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:19.350
introduced job scheduler in lollipop how
many people here use job scheduler okay

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360
many people here use job scheduler okay
 

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.490
many people here use job scheduler okay
you're in the right room okay so how do

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:23.500
you're in the right room okay so how do
 

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.370
you're in the right room okay so how do
we do that basically we specify job ID

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:26.380
we do that basically we specify job ID
 

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.130
we do that basically we specify job ID
the job that needs to be done and some

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.140
the job that needs to be done and some
 

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.470
the job that needs to be done and some
constraints like what network type way

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480
constraints like what network type way
 

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.100
constraints like what network type way
do we want and time and actually we can

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.110
do we want and time and actually we can
 

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.010
do we want and time and actually we can
say hey some extra content constraints I

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.020
say hey some extra content constraints I
 

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.950
say hey some extra content constraints I
want that transaction to happen only

really encourage you to go to analytics
and look how much time users spends in

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.960
then you can optimize specifically for
that time so that's a good that's a good

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:45.970
that time so that's a good that's a good
 

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.600
that time so that's a good that's a good
approach and algorithm but we can

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:48.610
approach and algorithm but we can
 

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.889
approach and algorithm but we can
improve it a little bit and be adaptive

00:24:51.889 --> 00:24:51.899
improve it a little bit and be adaptive
 

00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:54.690
improve it a little bit and be adaptive

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:00.850
are most interested in this is why they
 

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.640
are most interested in this is why they
have download your app at the first

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:02.650
have download your app at the first
 

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.830
have download your app at the first
place if we're talking about the news

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840
place if we're talking about the news
 

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.600
place if we're talking about the news
app there will be the top headline if

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:06.610
app there will be the top headline if
 

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.040
app there will be the top headline if
we're talking about sports app that will

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.050
we're talking about sports app that will
 

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.250
we're talking about sports app that will
be the current scores or you know live

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:11.260
be the current scores or you know live
 

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.190
be the current scores or you know live
updates from the game okay this is the

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200
updates from the game okay this is the
 

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.320
updates from the game okay this is the
data that users care most if you don't

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:16.330
data that users care most if you don't
 

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.390
data that users care most if you don't
know what they what the data D is what

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:18.400
know what they what the data D is what
 

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.470
know what they what the data D is what
most in your app a it's a shame B go to

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480
most in your app a it's a shame B go to
 

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.660
most in your app a it's a shame B go to
analytics and take a look what users are

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:24.670
analytics and take a look what users are
 

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.630
analytics and take a look what users are
doing and then you will find out the

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640
doing and then you will find out the
 

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.090
doing and then you will find out the
second bucket is that interesting stuff

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.100
second bucket is that interesting stuff
 

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.130
second bucket is that interesting stuff
this is stuff it's not in the hot what's

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:32.140
this is stuff it's not in the hot what's
 

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.790
this is stuff it's not in the hot what's
hot but it's stuff that the user told us

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:34.800
hot but it's stuff that the user told us
 

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.740
hot but it's stuff that the user told us
that he's interested in for example if

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:37.750
that he's interested in for example if
 

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.060
that he's interested in for example if
it's a if you're talking about a news

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.070
it's a if you're talking about a news
 

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.940
it's a if you're talking about a news
app maybe we have a user that is very

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:41.950
app maybe we have a user that is very
 

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.730
app maybe we have a user that is very
interested in the final section and

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:44.740
interested in the final section and
 

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.160
interested in the final section and
another user who's very interested in

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.170
another user who's very interested in
 

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.460
another user who's very interested in
the I don't know science section ok or

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:50.470
the I don't know science section ok or
 

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.250
the I don't know science section ok or
political section so these are actually

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:53.260
political section so these are actually
 

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.620
political section so these are actually
told us hey I'm interested in that

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:55.630
told us hey I'm interested in that
 

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.750
told us hey I'm interested in that
information it's not common it's not for

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760
information it's not common it's not for
 

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.430
information it's not common it's not for
all the users but specific users told

00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440
all the users but specific users told
 

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.380
all the users but specific users told
that hey this is interesting for me and

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:01.390
that hey this is interesting for me and
 

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.880
that hey this is interesting for me and
then there is all the rest of this stuff

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:04.890
then there is all the rest of this stuff
 

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.580
then there is all the rest of this stuff
now when I look at background updates

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:07.590
now when I look at background updates
 

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.440
now when I look at background updates
I'm thinking of alright let's take a

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:10.450
I'm thinking of alright let's take a
 

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.710
I'm thinking of alright let's take a
look how we update every each piece of

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720
look how we update every each piece of
 

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.590
look how we update every each piece of
content so for what's hot my server

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600
content so for what's hot my server
 

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.360
content so for what's hot my server
knows that something changed there is no

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:18.370
knows that something changed there is no
 

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.540
knows that something changed there is no
new headline new results form from the

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.590
payload of up to 4k if I'm not mistaken
in every GCM message and actually our

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600
in every GCM message and actually our
 

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.040
in every GCM message and actually our
client the app can get this GCM message

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.050
client the app can get this GCM message

don't pop up notification nothing we
take the data and we store it in our

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:44.770
take the data and we store it in our
 

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.620
take the data and we store it in our
internal database when the user will

it doesn't need to wait if we

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.090
it doesn't need to wait if we
 

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.760
it doesn't need to wait if we
one single millisecond to see that when

one single millisecond to see that when
 

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.399
one single millisecond to see that when
it comes to interesting stuff we can't

00:30:59.399 --> 00:30:59.409
it comes to interesting stuff we can't
 

00:30:59.409 --> 00:31:01.140
it comes to interesting stuff we can't
use the same approach because we can't

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.150
use the same approach because we can't
 

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.140
use the same approach because we can't
send everything to everyone all the time

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:03.150
send everything to everyone all the time
 

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.490
send everything to everyone all the time
we take a different approach basically

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:05.500
we take a different approach basically
 

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.310
we take a different approach basically
the server will tell the users via GCM

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320
the server will tell the users via GCM
 

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.950
the server will tell the users via GCM
that something has changed okay let's

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960
that something has changed okay let's
 

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.870
that something has changed okay let's
say something has changed in the final

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880
say something has changed in the final
 

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.720
say something has changed in the final
section all the users that said let's

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:18.730
section all the users that said let's
 

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.120
section all the users that said let's
start that said final section dates in

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.130
start that said final section dates in
 

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.070
start that said final section dates in
their favoritest will get a message

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080
their favoritest will get a message
 

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.200
their favoritest will get a message
saying hey the app will get a message

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:25.210
saying hey the app will get a message
 

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.389
saying hey the app will get a message
saying hey something there is new data

00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399
saying hey something there is new data
 

00:31:27.399 --> 00:31:30.389
saying hey something there is new data
in the final section and then the app

00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399
in the final section and then the app
 

00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:34.110
in the final section and then the app
will use back off to pull that data and

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120
will use back off to pull that data and
 

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.980
will use back off to pull that data and
it will look let's say and now could be

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:37.990
it will look let's say and now could be
 

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.580
it will look let's say and now could be
it could it can go in two different ways

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:40.590
it could it can go in two different ways
 

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.039
it could it can go in two different ways
option a we get this GCM message

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:44.049
option a we get this GCM message
 

00:31:44.049 --> 00:31:46.289
option a we get this GCM message
something has changed we wait a little

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:46.299
something has changed we wait a little
 

00:31:46.299 --> 00:31:49.080
something has changed we wait a little
we go we fetch the data and then the

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.090
we go we fetch the data and then the
 

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.539
we go we fetch the data and then the
user opens the app perfect we predict

00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:51.549
user opens the app perfect we predict
 

00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:55.080
user opens the app perfect we predict
the future another way that this could

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.090
the future another way that this could
 

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.630
the future another way that this could
end can go it's in the other other other

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:57.640
end can go it's in the other other other
 

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.649
end can go it's in the other other other
way around okay

00:31:58.649 --> 00:31:58.659
way around okay
 

00:31:58.659 --> 00:32:02.130
way around okay
so we get the GCM hey something new we

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.140
so we get the GCM hey something new we
 

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.799
so we get the GCM hey something new we
fetch the data and use it doesn't open

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:04.809
fetch the data and use it doesn't open
 

00:32:04.809 --> 00:32:06.779
fetch the data and use it doesn't open
the app and then we get another GCM

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:06.789
the app and then we get another GCM
 

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:10.260
the app and then we get another GCM
something new happened and we fetch the

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:10.270
something new happened and we fetch the
 

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.380
something new happened and we fetch the
data and then the user opens the app

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:12.390
data and then the user opens the app
 

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.049
data and then the user opens the app
means that we have we've had redundant

00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:16.059
means that we have we've had redundant
 

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:18.539
means that we have we've had redundant
updates we've wasted bandwidth requested

00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:18.549
updates we've wasted bandwidth requested
 

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:20.970
updates we've wasted bandwidth requested
energy in that case when we identified

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:20.980
energy in that case when we identified
 

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.860
energy in that case when we identified
and it's very easy to identify in those

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:22.870
and it's very easy to identify in those
 

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.889
and it's very easy to identify in those
cases we basically increase our back of

00:32:25.889 --> 00:32:25.899
cases we basically increase our back of
 

00:32:25.899 --> 00:32:29.549
cases we basically increase our back of
exponentially until we reach to the

00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559
exponentially until we reach to the
 

00:32:29.559 --> 00:32:30.960
exponentially until we reach to the
right amount so there are users that

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:30.970
right amount so there are users that
 

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.600
right amount so there are users that
will open our up four times data will be

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:33.610
will open our up four times data will be
 

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.519
will open our up four times data will be
used as that opens our up two times a

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:35.529
used as that opens our up two times a
 

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:35.700
used as that opens our up two times a
day

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:35.710
day
 

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.779
day
we will pretty easy we'll find the right

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:38.789
we will pretty easy we'll find the right
 

00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:41.130
we will pretty easy we'll find the right
frequency to those background updates

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:41.140
frequency to those background updates
 

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.870
frequency to those background updates
and all the other stuff we simply update

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880
and all the other stuff we simply update
 

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.760
and all the other stuff we simply update
that when the user opens the app it's

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:47.770
that when the user opens the app it's
 

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.740
that when the user opens the app it's
not really it doesn't really matter we

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:49.750
not really it doesn't really matter we
 

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.180
not really it doesn't really matter we
can't really predict that the user will

talked a lot about reducing radio time

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:02.230
talked a lot about reducing radio time
 

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.820
talked a lot about reducing radio time
now let's talk about

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:03.830
now let's talk about
 

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.400
now let's talk about
reducing payload size here's a test

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:07.410
reducing payload size here's a test
 

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.430

here we have an overview tab which

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:06.990
here we have an overview tab which
 

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.780
here we have an overview tab which
basically tells us how much energy we

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:08.790
basically tells us how much energy we
 

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.770
basically tells us how much energy we
consumed how much energy was wasted on

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:11.780
consumed how much energy was wasted on
 

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:16.280
consumed how much energy was wasted on

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:16.290
on Radio transitions on signaling etc
 

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.890
on Radio transitions on signaling etc
etc but the most interesting part at

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900
etc but the most interesting part at
 

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.590
etc but the most interesting part at
least for me is this screen basically

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:21.600
least for me is this screen basically
 

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.780
least for me is this screen basically
what we see these are the screen shot

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:23.790
what we see these are the screen shot

here the transactions we can see the
 

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.140
here the transactions we can see the
transactions and actually the packets

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:33.150
transactions and actually the packets
 

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.200
transactions and actually the packets
that were sent and if we look into any

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:36.210
that were sent and if we look into any
 

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.760

single point of time we will see on the

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:37.770
single point of time we will see on the
 

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:42.560
single point of time we will see on the
right side the the actual screen and

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:42.570
right side the the actual screen and
 

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.310
right side the the actual screen and
what happened during that time so during

what happened during that time so during
 

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.320
what happened during that time so during
this splash screen we can see here what

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:48.330
this splash screen we can see here what
 

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.840
this splash screen we can see here what
packets have been we've downloaded what

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:50.850
packets have been we've downloaded what
 

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.090
packets have been we've downloaded what
we sent and we can immediately take a

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:53.100
we sent and we can immediately take a
 

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.820
we sent and we can immediately take a
look and see that we were on DCH went

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:55.830
look and see that we were on DCH went
 

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.040
look and see that we were on DCH went

already there is another transaction and
 

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.490
already there is another transaction and
I don't understand why it's there okay

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:48.500
I don't understand why it's there okay
 

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.350
I don't understand why it's there okay
and obviously that I think it should

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:51.360
and obviously that I think it should
 

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.140
and obviously that I think it should
have been patched so let's click on it

all right and then you can actually and
in fact if you only fix very few things

00:39:40.799 --> 00:39:40.809
in fact if you only fix very few things
 

00:39:40.809 --> 00:39:43.279

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:23.180
 
actually yes yeah the question was can I

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:23.190
actually yes yeah the question was can I
 

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:27.260
actually yes yeah the question was can I
see when the radio is hot or what's the

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:27.270
see when the radio is hot or what's the
 

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.780
see when the radio is hot or what's the
state of the radio actually the question

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:29.790
state of the radio actually the question
 

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.550
state of the radio actually the question
is yes and no you can see that in

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560
is yes and no you can see that in
 

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.640
is yes and no you can see that in
Android you can see it in your code

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:33.650
Android you can see it in your code
 

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:37.520
Android you can see it in your code
there is an ADB command if I remember

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:37.530
there is an ADB command if I remember
 

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:44.870
there is an ADB command if I remember
correctly it's ADB - B and then space

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880
correctly it's ADB - B and then space
 

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.450
correctly it's ADB - B and then space
and radio check the documentation you

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460
and radio check the documentation you
 

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.450
and radio check the documentation you
can tell adb you can take the log cut

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460
can tell adb you can take the log cut
 

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.030
can tell adb you can take the log cut
from which buffer to present the log and

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040
from which buffer to present the log and
 

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.890
from which buffer to present the log and
there is a buffer for radio and when

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900
there is a buffer for radio and when
 

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.780
there is a buffer for radio and when
while you're running and your phone is

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:56.790
while you're running and your phone is
 

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.790
while you're running and your phone is
connected to your computer you can

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800
connected to your computer you can
 

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.460
connected to your computer you can
actually see in the log file of the

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:01.470
actually see in the log file of the
 

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.190
actually see in the log file of the
radio when the radio what's the state

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200
radio when the radio what's the state
 

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.620
radio when the radio what's the state
etc etc so if you want that during debug

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:06.630
etc etc so if you want that during debug
 

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:10.370
etc etc so if you want that during debug
to take a look perfect but while running

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380
to take a look perfect but while running
 

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.590
to take a look perfect but while running
and checking in your code what's the

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:12.600
and checking in your code what's the
 

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.120
and checking in your code what's the
status of the radio you don't have

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:14.130
status of the radio you don't have
 

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.100
status of the radio you don't have
access to it that's why you have GCM

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:16.110
access to it that's why you have GCM
 

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.020
access to it that's why you have GCM
network manager and the job scheduler

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:18.030
network manager and the job scheduler
 

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:30.879
network manager and the job scheduler
that will do that for you

00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:30.889
 
 

00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:34.159
 
the question was can I run this tool

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:34.169
the question was can I run this tool
 

00:41:34.169 --> 00:41:37.579
the question was can I run this tool
arrow in continuous integration and

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:37.589
arrow in continuous integration and
 

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:39.739
arrow in continuous integration and
automated testing environment actually I

00:41:39.739 --> 00:41:39.749
automated testing environment actually I
 

00:41:39.749 --> 00:41:43.549
automated testing environment actually I
haven't tried that so I don't really

00:41:43.549 --> 00:41:43.559
haven't tried that so I don't really
 

00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:46.219
haven't tried that so I don't really
have an answer on that there shouldn't

00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:46.229
have an answer on that there shouldn't
 

00:41:46.229 --> 00:41:49.309
have an answer on that there shouldn't
be reason why not - the only problem

00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319
be reason why not - the only problem
 

00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:52.369
be reason why not - the only problem
that it's well actually when I think

00:41:52.369 --> 00:41:52.379
that it's well actually when I think
 

00:41:52.379 --> 00:41:53.299
that it's well actually when I think
about it okay

00:41:53.299 --> 00:41:53.309
about it okay
 

00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:55.669
about it okay
so arrow the way it works you have data

00:41:55.669 --> 00:41:55.679
so arrow the way it works you have data
 

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.019
so arrow the way it works you have data
collector first to collect the data and

00:41:57.019 --> 00:41:57.029
collector first to collect the data and
 

00:41:57.029 --> 00:41:58.729
collector first to collect the data and
then you feed that data into the tool

00:41:58.729 --> 00:41:58.739
then you feed that data into the tool
 

00:41:58.739 --> 00:42:00.109
then you feed that data into the tool
that I just show you which is basically

00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119
that I just show you which is basically
 

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:02.599
that I just show you which is basically
the analyzer now the data can be

00:42:02.599 --> 00:42:02.609
the analyzer now the data can be
 

00:42:02.609 --> 00:42:05.239
the analyzer now the data can be
collected by using a specific apk or you

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:05.249
collected by using a specific apk or you
 

00:42:05.249 --> 00:42:07.659
collected by using a specific apk or you
can actually feel it

00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:07.669
can actually feel it
 

00:42:07.669 --> 00:42:11.749
can actually feel it
Wireshark dumps TCP dump okay so in your

00:42:11.749 --> 00:42:11.759
Wireshark dumps TCP dump okay so in your
 

00:42:11.759 --> 00:42:13.459
Wireshark dumps TCP dump okay so in your
automatic testing environment all you

automatic testing environment all you
need to do is run TCP dump and dump

00:42:16.659 --> 00:42:16.669
need to do is run TCP dump and dump
 

00:42:16.669 --> 00:42:19.399
need to do is run TCP dump and dump
those pickup files and then in the

00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:19.409
those pickup files and then in the
 

00:42:19.409 --> 00:42:21.259
those pickup files and then in the
morning feed them to the analyzer and

00:42:21.259 --> 00:42:21.269
morning feed them to the analyzer and
 

00:42:21.269 --> 00:42:23.719
morning feed them to the analyzer and
you immediately immediately will say if

00:42:23.719 --> 00:42:23.729
you immediately immediately will say if
 

00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:30.379
you immediately immediately will say if
there is a regression or not another one

00:42:30.379 --> 00:42:30.389
there is a regression or not another one
 

00:42:30.389 --> 00:42:36.370
there is a regression or not another one
yeah

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:36.380
 
 

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.049
 
mm-hmm

00:42:40.049 --> 00:42:40.059
 
 

00:42:40.059 --> 00:42:42.940
 
okay so in seller Network every TCP

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:42.950
okay so in seller Network every TCP
 

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.480
okay so in seller Network every TCP
connection is actually encapsulated

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:45.490
connection is actually encapsulated
 

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.999
connection is actually encapsulated
which means that the seller read you

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:49.009
which means that the seller read you
 

00:42:49.009 --> 00:42:50.829
which means that the seller read you
here and in the base station they add

00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839
here and in the base station they add
 

00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:53.799
here and in the base station they add
bits at the beginning at the end of that

00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:53.809
bits at the beginning at the end of that
 

00:42:53.809 --> 00:42:56.740
bits at the beginning at the end of that
of that payload so we actually add more

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:56.750
of that payload so we actually add more
 

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.990
of that payload so we actually add more
bits that we need to transmit back and

00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000
bits that we need to transmit back and
 

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.710
bits that we need to transmit back and
forth therefore we reduce we reduce the

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720
forth therefore we reduce we reduce the
 

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.749
forth therefore we reduce we reduce the
overall throughput the reason for that

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:04.759
overall throughput the reason for that
 

00:43:04.759 --> 00:43:09.940
overall throughput the reason for that
is that seller network we often I don't

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:09.950
is that seller network we often I don't
 

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.069
is that seller network we often I don't
know what the political will to do that

00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079
know what the political will to do that
 

00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:16.299
know what the political will to do that
to say that we often fake the TCP state

00:43:16.299 --> 00:43:16.309
to say that we often fake the TCP state
 

00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:19.329
to say that we often fake the TCP state
alright so think of it think of it this

00:43:19.329 --> 00:43:19.339
alright so think of it think of it this
 

00:43:19.339 --> 00:43:24.220
alright so think of it think of it this
way my phone opens HTTP GET request - I

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:24.230
way my phone opens HTTP GET request - I
 

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:27.999
way my phone opens HTTP GET request - I
don't know - a server or TCP connection

00:43:27.999 --> 00:43:28.009
don't know - a server or TCP connection
 

00:43:28.009 --> 00:43:29.769
don't know - a server or TCP connection
to a server and I want to keep that TCP

00:43:29.769 --> 00:43:29.779
to a server and I want to keep that TCP
 

00:43:29.779 --> 00:43:32.799
to a server and I want to keep that TCP
connection alive that means that the

00:43:32.799 --> 00:43:32.809
connection alive that means that the
 

00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:35.170
connection alive that means that the
phone is to send TCP ack messages back

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:35.180
phone is to send TCP ack messages back
 

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.279
phone is to send TCP ack messages back
and forth now the cell network doesn't

00:43:39.279 --> 00:43:39.289
and forth now the cell network doesn't
 

00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:42.490
and forth now the cell network doesn't
want those TCP acts they don't add any

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:42.500
want those TCP acts they don't add any
 

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.289
want those TCP acts they don't add any
value to the user there are not actual

00:43:44.289 --> 00:43:44.299
value to the user there are not actual
 

00:43:44.299 --> 00:43:47.440
value to the user there are not actual
payload they just waste off frequency as

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:47.450
payload they just waste off frequency as
 

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.450
payload they just waste off frequency as
as I told you frequency is extremely

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:49.460
as I told you frequency is extremely
 

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.370
as I told you frequency is extremely
important to network operators so what

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:51.380
important to network operators so what
 

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.859
important to network operators so what
they do actually behind the base station

00:43:53.859 --> 00:43:53.869
they do actually behind the base station
 

00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:56.109
they do actually behind the base station
some are at the base of the cell tower

00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119
some are at the base of the cell tower
 

00:43:56.119 --> 00:43:58.720
some are at the base of the cell tower
there is a big machine that looks at all

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:58.730
there is a big machine that looks at all
 

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.940
there is a big machine that looks at all
the TCP connections and when that

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:00.950
the TCP connections and when that
 

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.920
the TCP connections and when that
happens when we open the connection that

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:02.930
happens when we open the connection that
 

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.259
happens when we open the connection that
machine will start talking with the

00:44:05.259 --> 00:44:05.269
machine will start talking with the
 

00:44:05.269 --> 00:44:07.900
machine will start talking with the
server and it will send those TPA

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:07.910
server and it will send those TPA
 

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.809
server and it will send those TPA
TCP acts on our behalf so we can shut

00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:10.819
TCP acts on our behalf so we can shut
 

00:44:10.819 --> 00:44:12.670
TCP acts on our behalf so we can shut
down the radio we can stop allocating

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680
down the radio we can stop allocating
 

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.390
down the radio we can stop allocating
frequency that's cellular phone but the

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400
frequency that's cellular phone but the
 

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.549
frequency that's cellular phone but the
TCP connection is still alive and what

00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559
TCP connection is still alive and what
 

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:20.589
TCP connection is still alive and what
that server will want to send something

00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599
that server will want to send something
 

00:44:20.599 --> 00:44:22.210
that server will want to send something
to the to the phone you actually send

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:22.220
to the to the phone you actually send
 

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.400
to the to the phone you actually send
something to that big box that sitter

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:24.410
something to that big box that sitter
 

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.190
something to that big box that sitter
it's called a SM gateway and that box

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200
it's called a SM gateway and that box
 

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.349
it's called a SM gateway and that box
will then tell the base station hey we

00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359
will then tell the base station hey we
 

00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:30.700
will then tell the base station hey we
have data to that phone give him

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:30.710
have data to that phone give him
 

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.390
have data to that phone give him
frequency and transmit that data so

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400
frequency and transmit that data so
 

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.249
frequency and transmit that data so
basically because we needed to do that

00:44:36.249 --> 00:44:36.259
basically because we needed to do that
 

00:44:36.259 --> 00:44:38.109
basically because we needed to do that
there is encapsulation for every TCP

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119
there is encapsulation for every TCP
 

00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:38.650
there is encapsulation for every TCP
connection

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:38.660
connection
 

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.650
connection
thus we reduce the overall throughput

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:41.660
thus we reduce the overall throughput
 

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:51.849
thus we reduce the overall throughput
when we were adding connections

00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:51.859
 
 

00:44:51.859 --> 00:44:54.380
 
it's yeah the best practice is actually

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:54.390
it's yeah the best practice is actually
 

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.470
it's yeah the best practice is actually
moving from it HTTP 1.0 to HTTP 1.1

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480
moving from it HTTP 1.0 to HTTP 1.1
 

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.200
moving from it HTTP 1.0 to HTTP 1.1
which is persistent connection so you

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:00.210
which is persistent connection so you
 

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.820
which is persistent connection so you
open one connection and you run multiple

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:01.830
open one connection and you run multiple
 

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:12.200
open one connection and you run multiple
get requests on top of it so I don't

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:12.210
get requests on top of it so I don't
 

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.480
get requests on top of it so I don't
know what retrofit is using me under the

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:14.490
know what retrofit is using me under the
 

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.370
know what retrofit is using me under the
hood I can tell you that ok HTTP is

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380
hood I can tell you that ok HTTP is
 

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.960
hood I can tell you that ok HTTP is
perfect so I'll catch TP actually use

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:20.970
perfect so I'll catch TP actually use
 

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:22.550
perfect so I'll catch TP actually use
persistent connection by default unless

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560
persistent connection by default unless
 

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.810
persistent connection by default unless
the server doesn't support it which is

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:26.820
the server doesn't support it which is
 

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.940
the server doesn't support it which is
great the only thing that you need to

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:28.950
great the only thing that you need to
 

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:31.280
great the only thing that you need to
make sure is that you don't open several

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:31.290
make sure is that you don't open several
 

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.920
make sure is that you don't open several
or that you minimize the amount of HTTP

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:33.930
or that you minimize the amount of HTTP
 

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.510
or that you minimize the amount of HTTP
connection simultaneous connection that

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520
connection simultaneous connection that
 

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.940
connection simultaneous connection that
you open ok any more questions

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:39.950
you open ok any more questions
 

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.830
you open ok any more questions
all right so I guess we're done here

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:42.840
all right so I guess we're done here
 

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.320
all right so I guess we're done here
thank you
