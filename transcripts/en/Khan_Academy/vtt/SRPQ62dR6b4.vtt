00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.330
What I want to do in this video
is talk about a bunch of

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.190
molecules or classes of
molecules that can be derived

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.220
from carboxylic acid.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.870
And just to show a specific
example I'll show things that

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.250
can be derived from
acetic acid.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.750
And just as a review, acetic
acid looks like this.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.070
The common name, as I just said,
is acetic acid, and if

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.270
you want to use the systematic
name, you look for the longest

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.270
chain, which is right
over there.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.720
There's two carbons.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.490
So we use the eth- prefix, so
it's ethan-, and since this is

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.020
a carboxylic acid, it
is ethanoic acid.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.270
Now, the derivatives of acetic
acid, and we can later

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.560
generalize this to all
carboxylic acids.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.850
We really just have to change
what's going on in this carbon

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.580
chain right here.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.490
It won't have to necessarily
just be two carbons.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.280
It can just keep going.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400
It could have benzene rings,
whatever, and that would

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.330
change the name.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.599
But really, I just want to give
you the gist and the gist

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.750
of the naming.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.600
So if we were to replace this
hydroxyl group with an amine,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.850
and in future videos we'll see
how that is done, so let me

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.660
just draw the acyl group.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.505
So the acyl group is just
that right over there.

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:23.590
And we're just going to keep
changing what's bonded to the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.050
acyl group right over here.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.400
So if this is bonded to an
amine, so let me draw-- well,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.490
this would be the simplest amine
right over here, which

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.200
would be NH2.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.390
This thing right here it's
called an amide, and if we

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.890
were to give this its common
name, it would be acetamide.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.310
This particular example
would be acetamide.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.610
And if we wanted the systematic
name for it, it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.710
would be ethanamide.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.240
You have two carbons right there
so it is ethanamide.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:14.590
Now the natural question is,
all amines won't just be

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.840
primary, you might have other
things other than hydrogens

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.390
attached to it, other radical
groups, other carbon chains,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.910
so how do you name those?

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.570
And so if you had a molecule
that looked like this, and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.980
actually, let me just change
things up a little bit so that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.950
we diverge a little bit
from the ethane route.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.400
So let's say you had three
carbons bonded or part of the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.890
acyl group right there.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.940
And then, we are bonded to a
nitrogen, which is bonded to a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.860
methyl group and then
another hydrogen.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.650
In this case, you start naming
with this methyl group right

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.150
here and to show that that
methyl group is attached to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.040
the nitrogen, you call
this N-methyl.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.370
And then you look at the chain
that forms the acyl group, the

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.140
carbon chain.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.640
We have one, two, three carbons
so it is propanamide.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.430
If you had another methyl here
you would say N comma

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.590
N-dimethyl.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.250
If you had a methyl here and
a propyl group here, you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.580
would've called it
N-methyl-N-propyl-propanamide.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.390
So hopefully that gives
you a sense of amides.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.240
Now, and this is something we've
seen before so it's a

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.810
little bit of review, if you
have something that looks like

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.060
this, I'll have it attached
to a methyl

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.040
group right over here.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.070
We've seen this before.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.660
This is an ester.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.680
And if we have an-- let me
actually make the part that

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.710
makes it an ester in blue
to diferentiate it.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.960
We keep substituting what is
attached to the acyl group.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.740
Let me label it.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.220
This right here is called
an acyl group.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.290
That right there is
an acyl group.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.760
So right over here, for the
ester, if we were to give it

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.570
its common name, and we've
seen this ester

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.170
before, it is acetate.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.890
And if we wanted to give it its
systematic , name you look

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.740
at the longest chain, one, two
carbons so it is ethan-- and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.590
you don't call it ethanoic
acid anymore.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.570
You call it ethanoate,
just like that.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.690
Now, the next one, and we
haven't seen this one before,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.290
and it looks complex, but when
you really break it down into

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.160
its constituents,
it's not so bad.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.080
So let's say we have a molecule
that looks like this.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.400
So we have one acyl group bonded
to an oxygen, which is

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.880
bonded to another acyl group.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.720
So it's almost like you have two
carboxylic acids that have

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.760
been joined together.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.240
And you really do have two
acyl groups joined by an

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.390
oxygen here.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.800
This is called an anhydride.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.260
And they look very complex, but
you just have to realize

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.140
they're two carboxylic acids
attached to each other and

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.700
usually the same one.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.280
Most anhydrides you're going
to see in organic chemistry

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.610
are formed from the same
carboxylic acid, so how ever

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.010
many carbons you have on this
end, you're normally going to

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.670
have on this end.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.210
So the way the name these is you
name it just the same way

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.690
that you would have named the
carboxylic acid, but instead

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.910
of writing the word acid, you
write the word anhydride.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.090
So this right here would
be acetic anhydride.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.480
It's derived from acetic acid.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.160
This right here is
acetic anhydride.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.710
Or the systematic name is, we
have one, two carbons so it's

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.570
ethanoic anhydride.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.160
And just to make things clear,
if this molecule instead of

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.670
that, if we had something that
looked like this, where the

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.280
carbons chains on either
end had three carbons.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.900
One, two, three, one,
two, three.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.950
We would call this propanoic
anhydride.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.540
In the unusual circumstance, and
it is unusual, where you

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.080
would see different carbon
chains here, you would list

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.680
each of them.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.100
So if this had two here and
three here, it would be

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.430
ethanoic propanoic anhydride.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.460
But that is very,
very unusual.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.930
Normally, these carbon chains
on either end of-- or both

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.380
acyl will groups will contain
the same number of carbons.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.980
Now, the last carboxylic acid
derivative that you should

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.640
know about, and we've already
seen it, are the acyl halides,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.085
and, in particular, the
acyl chlorides.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:21.880
So let me draw it
right over here.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.200
So you have your acyl group
right there and then it is

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.325
bonded to a chlorine and this
right here is an acyl

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:38.220
chloride, maybe the most
intuitive name.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.810
This right here is an acyl
group and then you have a

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.210
chlorine, so it's an
acyl chloride.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.580
And we've seen this exact
acyl chloride.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.990
It's derived from acetic acid,
so this is acetyl chloride.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.630
But if you wanted to give it
its systematic name, and we

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.560
haven't seen it's systematic
name before, we have one, two

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.520
carbons so it is ethanoyl.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.920
This tells us that we are
dealing with an acyl group.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:21.340
Ethanoyl chloride is how
we would name this.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.640
And if this had three
carbons, it would

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.760
be propanoyl chloride.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.840
So, hopefully, that gives you
at least a good introduction

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.570
to the differences in structures
of all these groups

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.550
and an introduction
to naming them.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.600
In the next video, we'll talk
a little bit about the

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.110
relative stabilities and then
it'll give you good intuition

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.960
on which direction a
reaction might go.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.169
Are you more likely to go from
amide to an acyl chloride or

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.720
from an acyl chloride to an
amide or anything in between?
