00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.270
This cavernous building was
once an important landmark,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.970
one full of fanfare,
competition, and celebration.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.270
It's a building from
a different era,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.540
not only in its vintage
look, but also in its spirit.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.040
Berkeley Iceland was an
Olympic-sized ice rink

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.670
in Berkeley, California.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.046
It is a unique place,
both in size and location,

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:31.920
sitting in the middle
of a quaint residential

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.290
neighborhood, making it a staple
to both the local community

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.090
and a national audience.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.930
It opened its doors in
1940 and instantly became

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.920
an important destination.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.150
It was a three-time host of
the US National Figure Skating

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.660
Championships, it was the
practice facility for the 1994

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.080
USA men's Olympic hockey
team, and it was also home

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.560
to numerous skating
clubs, birthday parties,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.290
and teenage date nights.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.130
But now, all that is gone.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.000
Only memories are left.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.340
Memories that may
not be replicated,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.060
because places like this
just aren't built it anymore.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.640
Empty lots are no longer
replaced with drive-ins,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.830
roller rinks, or arcades.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.610
These staples of different
eras are not reemerging.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.940
They aren't showing up in new
developments or neighborhoods.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.030
No longer will we see
an entire city block

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.880
dedicated to ice skating.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.010
Instead we've made room for the
more practical or more modern.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.770
These walls heard the voices of
Olympians talking about gold.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.250
This sign glowed invitingly
to an entire community.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.660
This is where people might
have met their future husbands

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.890
or wives.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.270
Today it survives as a
testament to nostalgia,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660
a reminder of that
place where you grew up

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.630
that may have shaped your
life in some small way.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.805
Berkeley Iceland is a fading
memory, but one with a happy

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:55.305
ending.

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:06.380

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.289
city that was built to be
abandoned, click here now.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.130
These walls were never
meant for family photos.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.110
This is an abandoned town that
was built to be abandoned,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.270
except for a few days every year
when it's a literal war zone.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.920
