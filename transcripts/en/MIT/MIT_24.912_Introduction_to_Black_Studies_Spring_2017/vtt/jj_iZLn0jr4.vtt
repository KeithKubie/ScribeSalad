COLIN GODWIN: This
class has shaped

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.270
how I approach communicating
with others in showing me

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.790
how differently languages
that I previously

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.650
understood to be
invalid, including

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.440
Creole, Southern American
English after I hear anything,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.006
I'm like--

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.360
Stereotypical
languages like that

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.330
are actually very
systematic, and should

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.660
be regarded as languages
in and of themselves that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.910
should be given
validity inside the US,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.695
whether that be through court
room interpreters for people

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:37.070
like Rachel Jeantel, who spoke
primarily African-American

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.010
English, or even just inside
of Haiti teaching classes

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.810
in Creole, as a means to
connect with students better.

00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:51.630
ELENA ALBERTI: Yeah.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.260
Also I think how this class
shaped my communication

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.990
is it allowed me to discuss
more difficult topics

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.497
without feeling hindered.

00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:01.080
I didn't have to
feel like I was going

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.430
to offend anyone because it
was in the context of learning.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.410
And I think people were very
open with answering questions

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.560
that might be seen as like,
why don't you know this,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.170
or stuff like that.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.390
And further, also
with the presentations

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.040
and with the essays,
I feel like you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.630
had to develop
your communication

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.420
skills in a bunch of different
ways, not only speaking

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.990
but how we present now, and then
also how do you write an essay.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.870
I think Dr. Nora Jackson
was really great in helping

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.701
me develop my writing style.

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:33.200
And yeah, I thought I was going
to say something else, but--

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.296
[LAUGHING]

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.440
LORRAINE WONG: I think
the conversations

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.900
that we had were really
interesting all the time.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.430
Everyone has some
sort of opinion.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.971
Some people are more willing to
speak about them than others,

00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:49.920
and personally I feel that
oftentimes in conversations I'm

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.580
more reticent.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.440
But this class felt
like such a safe space

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.900
that it was possible to speak
about personal experiences

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.080
or opinions on readings
and all of these things.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.890
And I really appreciated
the presentations

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.590
that we have to do as well,
because as a communication

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.350
intensive course we have to
have some sort of oral component

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.190
and present things, and those
freak me out all the time.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.830
But it's important to
have this type of practice

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.560
and to be able to have a safe
space in order to practice

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.040
and then be able to do it
better and better each time.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.160
DANA VIGUE: Yeah.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.130
And, you know, for me,
starting this summer

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730
I'm going to be beginning
my M.D. PhD in anthropology.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.650
And trained as an
anthropologist,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.690
I've always had this idea
that you don't really

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.060
need interject that much
personal experience into what

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.450
you write, especially if
it's an academic work.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.160
And from the get-go
in this class,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.770
we were expected
to draw equal parts

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.500
from the theory with which
we engaged and equal parts

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.170
from our own
experiences and present

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.860
that in the form of a narrative,
that was in conversation

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.390
with the theory.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.280
And I was uncomfortable
with that.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.600
I thought that-- I had
this notion that doing so

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.680
would make my writing less
professional, less objective,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.440
and perhaps less valuable,
because it wasn't

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.910
primarily rooted in theory.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.360
So much of it was narrative, so
much of it was now subjective.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.480
But I found that interrogating
my own experiences

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.330
as an academic, who's
engaging with the theory,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.980
helped me to kind of deconstruct
stereotypes like the ones

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.100
Colin articulated, and
these preconceived notions

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.890
that we inherently
carry in when we're

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.740
trying to do objective
analyzes in a way

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.789
that I had never had the
opportunity to do before.

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.330
And so getting out
of my comfort zone

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.430
by writing these
academic papers that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.850
were equal parts personal
narrative was something

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.120
that I think will prepare
me well as an anthropologist

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.090
to ensure that, to
a greater extent,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.120
I'm able to understand
where I stand

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.410
in terms of a particular issue
and perhaps do more justice

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.647
when I do produce a work.

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:58.230
ELENA ALBERTI: And
on top of all this,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.688
one way that I would like to
see the course improve-- which

00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:03.270
Colin mentioned in class and
has to do with communication--

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.186
is having difficult
conversations with someone

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:06.505
who doesn't have your view.

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:08.130
Something we talked
about in this class

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.110
was that everyone here
is kind of like-minded.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.190
We all sought out this
class for a reason.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.112
And I think I didn't
get to challenge myself

00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:16.320
in communicating to someone
who didn't agree with me.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.190
And that could be a way
that educators can improve.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.340
LORRAINE WONG: Definitely.
