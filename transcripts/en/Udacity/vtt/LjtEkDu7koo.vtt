00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Looking back at our universe where there's only two positive charges.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll call them q1 and q2 and in this case they're both positive, but they can be negative or one of each.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It turns out that the electric potential energy is equal to some constant K&lt;i&gt;q1&lt;i&gt;q2/r.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now K is just a constant. Its value is 9&lt;i&gt;10⁹&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and maybe you can tell me by doing your dimensional analysis skills

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
what the units are, but that's for the forums.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What this equation tells us is that well if the charge is bigger

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
either this charge is the potential energy increases proportionally.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If the distance of separation is bigger, the potential energy decreases proportionally.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The derivation for this equation is actually really fascinating, something we won't do here,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but it basically comes from the idea that there's a certain amount of work required

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to move these charges from very, very far away into this configuration

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and that work happens to be equal to this.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's do some quick practice, let's imagine that q1 is actually a minus charge

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of -1c and q2 with a +3c, and let's say the separation between them is 2 m.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You need to tell me the potential energy. I've already filled in the x10¹⁰

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
because that's what your exponent is going to want to be when you convert this to scientific notation.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can you just fill in this part here with the potential energy ought to be

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and be very careful with the sign.
