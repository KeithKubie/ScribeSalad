00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.530
Does sex smell?

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.810
Science says yes!

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.750
But not in the way you're thinking, ya perverts.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.860
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - to talk about
everyone's favorite subject, pheromones.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.130
Now we've been told for years and years that
pheromones influence our behavior - and help

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.320
us choose mates - but it's always been kind
of a question mark as to how much of a difference

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.660
they really make.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.520
Humans in particular, have more secretion
and sweat glands than any other primate, and

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.430
the organ we use to detect pheromones is called
the vomeronasal organ, or VNO.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.220
It's a tiny, crescent-shaped bundle of neurons
at the base of each nostril, and almost all

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.050
animals have it - from reptiles, to elephants,
to house cats.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.390
What's surprising, however, is that only 30%
of humans were actually born with this organ.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.780
But we can all smell pheromones, right?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.330
So there's gotta be something else that allows
us to detect them.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.460
Well, there is.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.240
Men secrete something called andro, which
is a metabolite of testosterone, in their

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.620
sweat and semen.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.080
And women, secret estra, a derivative of estrogen,
in their urine.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.140
Both chemicals are known to trigger arousal
in the opposite sex - but in order to be considered

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.030
true pheromones, they have to shape how people
view different genders.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.370
New research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences
in Beijing - confirms that that's exactly

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.400
what happens.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.620
For the study, researchers split men and women
up into groups of 24, and then had them watch

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.080
this video.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.250
Notice the figure on the left, has a decidedly
female strut - with a lot more hip movement

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.430
- while the figure on the right, has a flatter
gait, typical of most males.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.000
The one in the middle - is considered neutral,
meaning it could go either way.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.900
They then asked subjects to inhale either
andro or estra - and judge whether they thought

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.360
the neutral walk was more masculine or more
feminine.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.420
Turns out, their judgments depended entirely
on their own sexual preferences.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.600
After smelling andro, the male hormone, straight
women perceived the walk as being more masculine.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.990
But the pheromone had no effect on straight
men.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.010
In contrast, smelling estra, the female hormone
- made straight men perceive the walk as more

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.050
feminine.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.330
While straight women, weren't affected.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.080
Even more interesting, is the fact that gay
men followed the exact same response pattern

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080
as straight women.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.450
Meaning homosexual men are more likely to
respond to male pheromones than they are to

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.560
female ones.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.140
Oddly enough, homosexual women - fell somewhere
in between.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.739
So neither pheromone made much of a difference.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.969
This supports the classification of andro
and estra as "sex pheromones," but it also

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.340
shows that they can influence our perception
of gender - but only in the genders we're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.379
attracted to.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.920
Like most pheromones, the smell is imperceptible
- so all of these decisions that happen are

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.969
subconscious - but they're still an important
part of how we interact and perceive each

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:36.969
other.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:43.239
More importantly, this study shows that pheromones
aren't gender-specific - but rather, sexuality-specific.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.200
Which gives even less ammo to the argument
that sexuality is a choice.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.999
Personally, I think everyone smells gross.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.040
But, I also live in a city with almost no
air conditioning.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.310
And, I attend a lot of gaming conventions.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.189
So, my experience is probably skewed.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.510
Speaking of smelly things - and terrible segueways
- if you want more facts about smelly stuff

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.439
- go check out Animalist's new show, Best
Breed Ever!

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.180
It tells you everything you wanna know - and
some things you didn't know - about your favorite

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.340
breeds of dogs.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.139
FOR EXAMPLE: Did you know that French bulldogs
are banned from most commercial airplanes?

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.139
It's true.

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.769
And when you hear the reason, it actually
kinda makes sense.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.469
They've got new episodes every Wednesday and
Friday, so go check those out if you're interested.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.249
