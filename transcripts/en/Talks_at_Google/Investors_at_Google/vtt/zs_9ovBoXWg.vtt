FEMALE SPEAKER:
Welcome everybody

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.600
to this TechTalk on
Monday afternoon.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.040
Thank you very much
for coming, and we

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.450
are very happy to host
today John Mihaljevic.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.150
He the author of a very popular
book, "The Manual of Ideas,"

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.690
which introduces you to a
framework of finding, analyzing

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.240
research, and implementing the
best value investing ideas.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.330
And among his great
accomplishments,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:45.250
John is also a member
of the Value Investors,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.380
and the Value Investors Club.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.280
It's a community for
top money managers,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.070
and he also won the
prize for best investment

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.422
idea in that club.

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:08.510
There could be many other
great words said about John,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.550
but you came here
to listen to him.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.530
So welcome, and
the floor is yours.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.530
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Thanks.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.370
Well, thank you so
much, [? Anna, ?]

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.700
for the overly
generous introduction.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.600
I also want to thank
[? Sirabat ?] in the Bay Area

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.180
office for the invitation, which
I was very excited to receive.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.430
And it's such a pleasure
to be here at Google.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.230
I don't think I could have made
it here if applying for a job,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.580
so this is kind of my
entree, if you will.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.410
I want to talk about
idea generation,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.700
and specifically from
an investment angle,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780
so how to find great
investment ideas.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.530
And I put "secret"
in quotation marks

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.650
here because there
really is no secret.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.900
But I'm glad so many
came to hear the talk.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.009
How do we really
think about investing?

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.430
And it has a lot to do with
how we view the stock market.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.670
Because when it comes to
investing in public companies,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.190
you are transacting in
a global stock market.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.670
It's very liquid, you can
buy and sell at any time.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.640
And I think there's
just a lot of confusion

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.435
out there as to what the stock
market really is, and there

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:34.040
are also very many approaches.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.160
And it's actually
in the interest

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.620
of the financial
community and Wall Street

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.580
to make it seem
very complicated,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.030
so that you will just
give your money to them

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.420
and think that they're doing
such a great job for you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.470
that they deserve to
get paid a lot of money.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.640
When in reality, it
isn't that complicated.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.380
The stock market is
a beauty contest,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.020
that's really a criticism
that economist John Maynard

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.350
Keynes levied on the stock
market, or on Wall Street.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.280
And it's really this idea that
a lot of investors, and even

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.380
professional investors,
will choose companies

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.630
based on what they
think other people will

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.870
think of those companies.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.600
So everybody's kind of trying
to play a guessing game, where

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.980
basically you're picking
the prettiest face,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.050
or the prettiest
company-- but it's not

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.170
the one you think
is the prettiest,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.950
it's the one you think others
will think is the prettiest.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.940
And of course, as Keynes
said in this quote,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.550
you can take that to the third
degree, and the fourth degree,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.720
and so on, and so on, and it
becomes very self-referential.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.410
And because a lot of
people invest this way,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.470
this is how the stock market
might act in the short term.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.460
It's very
unpredictable, everybody

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.370
trying to out-guess
everybody else.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.690
But that's really
not how you can

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.480
be successful in the long term.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.670
And by viewing the stock market
as a parimutuel betting system,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.529
we're getting a little bit
closer to the essence of it.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.480
Because really it's not about
guessing the prettiest face,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.030
or the best company, or
what others will think--

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.080
because if there is a company
out there like Google,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.630
that game becomes pretty easy.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.710
What becomes harder is
calibrating that judgment

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.270
versus what you have
to pay to actually buy

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.650
that company in
the stock market.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.400
So as Warren Buffett's partner
Charlie Munger says here

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.440
in this quote, sometimes
it's just really easy

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.420
to see which horse is
most likely to win a race,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.790
but that horse will
have odds that are maybe

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.320
three to two, that
pay three to two,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.540
and some other horse
that doesn't look as fast

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.180
may have odds of 100 to one.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.310
And then it becomes
much more difficult,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.540
because probabilistically,
the best horse

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.260
isn't going to win
100% of the time.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.020
What if the horse that
has the odds of 100 to one

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.560
can win 5% of the time,
or 10% of the time?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.740
It may actually be the better
investment-- or the better bet,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.150
in this case.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.510
And this quote
from Warren Buffett

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.880
kind of fits that paradigm.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.830
He says, we simply
attempt to be fearful

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.030
when others are greedy, and
greedy when others are fearful.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.390
And that really
speaks to those odds.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.440
Because if you have everybody
in the world believing

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.300
that a company will go
bankrupt, the odds on it

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.870
may be so great that if it
just doesn't go bankrupt--

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.940
it may still be a
mediocre company--

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.470
you could actually do very well.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.730
And then finally we really get
to the essence of the stock

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.560
market, and it's just
a conduit to ownership.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.610
So Google would
be a great company

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.660
whether it's publicly
traded or not.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.790
It would still have
the cash flow it has,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.740
it would still have the
customers that it has.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.990
And so you don't
need the stock market

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.900
to make a Google valuable,
or any other company.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.830
And so it's basically
just a place

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.660
to buy and sell
stock in companies.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.780
And what is stock?

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.130
The legal definition
tells you that it's just

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.290
a partial ownership
of a corporation.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.560
That's really what you're buying
when you invest in a stock.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.390
And it may not seem
that way because it's

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.110
so easy to transact online.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.530
You're just looking
at a stock ticker,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.800
and it's easy to forget that
what you're really buying

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.840
is ownership of a
real life business.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:14.210
And so you'll hear of all
kinds of different strategies,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.835
or you'll hear of people trying
to invest based on charts.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.000
They'll look at
different bands and try

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.260
to guess when the stock
is breaking out or not.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.650
But that's basically
removing yourself

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.690
from the essence of
what a stock really is.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.940
And when you do that,
your chances of success

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.570
go down dramatically.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.120
Because let's say you do
invest based on a chart,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.760
and you lose all your money.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.100
There's no recourse.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.390
You can say, well,
the chart looked good,

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.940
and in every other case
when that happened,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.070
the stock did go up.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.180
Well, there's no
connection between that

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.926
and what a stock is legally.

00:07:54.926 --> 00:07:57.490
Legally, it's ownership
of a business.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:02.950
And so if you invest in a
company, and you're right,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.730
you can in the worst
case take the recourse

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.620
and acquire a
majority of the stock,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.960
kick out the board of directors,
put in your own directors,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.090
your own management
team, and take

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.360
full ownership of that company.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.610
So there you are getting to the
essence of what a stock really

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.110
is.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.300
And if you invest
based on that essence,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.300
you'll be much more
successful, because you're just

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.440
as close to the truth
as can possibly be.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.169
I want to talk a little
bit about the mindset

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:44.330
that you need to have to
be a successful investor.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.740
So a lot of investors
will think this way,

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.245
kind of the small fish mindset.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.600
Let's say I have
$100,000 to invest.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.110
Here's a bunch of companies,
and their stock price

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.345
is their market value.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.960
Market value simply is what it
would take at the current stock

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.865
price to buy the whole company.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.090
And if you have the
small fish mindset,

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.590
you might just
say, well, $100,000

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.200
buys a few thousand shares
of any of these companies.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.587
And my $100,000
is insignificant,

00:09:23.587 --> 00:09:29.080
s so it really doesn't move
the needle on these companies,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.210
or the market is a whole.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.250
And the reason it's the
wrong mindset to adopt

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:41.350
is because just because
your portfolio may be small,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.910
your role in the market
is not insignificant.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.630
Because the market is supposed
to function efficiently

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.340
because even small
investors think

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.610
about how well is
company A going

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.725
to do, how much do
I have to pay to buy

00:09:57.725 --> 00:09:59.400
it, et cetera, et cetera.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.530
So you really need to
think about not the scale

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.070
of your portfolio, but
the scale of the companies

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.970
you're investing in.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.830
And so here's kind of the
mindset to be, which is really,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.450
I think, what successful
investors adopt,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.690
no matter how much
money they're investing.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.010
And it's the same
table as before,

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.730
but we're just showing
it in a different way.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.070
By the way, this is
about 10 years old,

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.080
some of these numbers, so
it's changed quite a bit.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.340
But what I'm trying
to illustrate

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.120
here is when you
look at it this way,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.070
you suddenly realize, wow, I
can either buy all of Toyota

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.060
for $99 billion.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.300
Or for the same amount of money,
actually a little bit of less,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.725
I can buy all of these
companies on the left.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.160
And that's 100% of them.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.960
So you can either
own all of Toyota,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.150
or you can own all of Ford,
GM, and the other companies.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.000
And you may still decide
that owning all of Toyota

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.430
is the smarter investment,
but at least you'll

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.120
be aware what that
decision implies.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.260
You're no longer on this
slide, where you're thinking,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.350
oh, well, I can buy a few
thousand shares of Toyota

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.710
or some other company, and it's
kind of all the same thing.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.230
So here you're realizing
what you're really doing.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.170
And that mentality, to really
think of investing as an owner,

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.170
I think is very much in
line with the legal essence

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.070
of stocks.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.740
So here's a very busy
chart, and we're not

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.180
going to get through
all of it, but there

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.170
are few points I'd
like to make here.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:59.990
So one is all the way on the
left you see idea generation.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.650
And there's so
many different ways

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.800
to find potential
investment ideas.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.490
You may hear it from friends,
on message boards, read

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.980
about a company
in the newspaper.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.430
You could do a
quantitative stock screen,

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.860
searching for the cheapest
companies based on some metric.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.480
So idea generation
generally is the easy part.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.630
And we can overload
ourselves with ideas.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:32.360
There's actually about 10,000
publicly traded companies

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.790
in North America
alone, and probably

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.450
20,000 to 30,000
companies worldwide.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.990
So there's a ton of
companies to choose from.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:49.790
So where successful investors
really generate their success--

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.410
or as they call it
in the industry,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.580
their alpha or edge-- is really
in assessing the investment

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.530
opportunities.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.330
So I could give everyone
the same potential company

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.800
to invest in, and someone
will say, wow, that's great,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.490
I want to buy.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.640
Someone will say, no way.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.410
And that's really that decision.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.540
If you can get that
decision right,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.280
you're going to be successful.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.300
So given what we know now
about the right mentality

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.430
to think of a business
as an owner, and would

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.940
I want to buy the whole
company if I could,

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.860
let's walk through
this a little bit.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:35.430
So a company will
usually have real assets,

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.130
especially if it's
kind of an old school

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.726
company that maybe
has factories.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.710
Let's take a General Motors.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.820
They've got
factories, they've got

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.495
all kinds of tangible assets.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:56.800
You would want to ask whether
this company, at the stock

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.190
price it is today, is trading
for more than it would

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.900
take to recreate
it from scratch.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.430
And you're not going to be able
to recreate the company exactly

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.530
the same from
scratch, but the idea

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:17.900
is how much capital would it
take to recreate the earnings

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.340
flow and the basic
business of a company.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.900
So if it's selling for a lot
more in the stock market,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.560
you're not going
to buy that stock.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.160
Because what that's
saying is there's

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.740
an incentive for a
competitor to come in,

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.830
because they can recreate
that same company for less

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.110
money than the
stock price implies.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:44.500
So if the company in the stock
market is worth $2 billion,

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.550
and you could recreate that
business for $1 billion,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.960
there's an incentive for
someone with a lot of money

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.040
to come in, create that
company for $1 billion,

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.360
take it public immediately, and
then basically sell the stock

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.700
for $2 billion in the market.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.450
So that's where we're going to
basically eliminate the company

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.900
from consideration if it's
trading above its replacement

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.730
cost.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:17.830
Now if it's below, then we
go to the other extreme,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.020
which is liquidation value.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.760
And what is liquidation value?

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.300
It basically means what is
this company worth dead today?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.570
So if you were to shut
down the business,

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.800
or sell it, and
liquidate all the assets,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.500
how much money would
you have left over?

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.230
And if a company is
selling below that,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.560
that's usually a low
number, but sometimes

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.529
companies actually
do sell below that.

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:43.570
I'll give you an example.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.670
When the shipping industry--
these big ocean tankers that

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.040
transport crude oil around
the world, and so forth.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.380
When that industry
is doing badly,

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:02.430
it's doing generally so
badly that no one wants

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:07.530
to own these stocks, and
they will sell, on occasion,

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.880
for less than the scrap
value of the metal used

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.500
to build the ships.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:21.160
So you could buy those stocks
for less than the scrap value.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.070
And then, generally, management
of these companies, the CEO,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.070
they'll say, oh, the turnaround
will come next quarter.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.690
OK, maybe in a year.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.700
But after two or
three years, they'll

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.360
start selling the ships
for scrap themselves.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.750
And if they do
that, and the stock

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.430
is trading for less
than scrap, you're

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.460
actually going to make money,
even though the business looks

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.570
like it's going under.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.170
So that's another easy one.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.240
You would take control
of the company,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.600
you would liquidate
it, you'd make money.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.660
Now beyond that-- those are kind
of the two bounds, the upper

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.620
and lower bounds--
you get into where

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.274
you're looking at actual
earning power of the company.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.230
And this is where
most companies end up,

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.790
unless we're in a 2008 financial
crisis-type scenario, where

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.220
there were a lot of
companies selling

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.319
for less than their
liquidation value.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:24.400
And what you would
look at here is

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.710
how much is this company
actually earning,

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.410
and how much do I have to
pay in the stock market

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.790
to acquire the whole business?

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.450
And there's no right
or wrong answer.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:40.370
So you would basically decide,
well, what kind of return

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.410
is good enough for my savings?

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.260
If a company's earning
$1 billion a year,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:51.190
and it takes $10 billion to
buy it in the stock market,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.917
that's a 10% a year return.

00:17:53.917 --> 00:17:55.500
And then maybe you
want to know, well,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.530
are those earnings
growing over time?

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:02.190
So my 10% in year one
will be 11%, and then 12%,

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.960
and so forth.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.870
Or are the earnings declining?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.920
In which case you'll want
a higher initial percentage

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.120
yield.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.990
So maybe even if the earnings
are going to decline,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:20.380
well, if you can acquire it
for two times current earnings,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:25.160
that means you're making
50% return just based on--

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.860
and we have the mindset of a
capital allocator and owner

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.085
here, no longer just
pieces of paper and stocks.

00:18:34.085 --> 00:18:37.240
If you can buy the whole
company and in one year

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.716
get half your money
back in earnings,

00:18:40.716 --> 00:18:42.090
you're probably
going to be fine,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.900
even if those earnings are
going down slowly over time.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.880
Because within two
to three years,

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.930
you've got all your money
back, and then whatever

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.420
comes after that is just gravy.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.560
So here you're making a decision
whether the earnings yield--

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.730
that's the earnings
before interest and tax--

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.680
and these are some
technical terms here,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.270
but I'm telling you
the essence of what's

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:10.100
on here-- if those earnings
divided by what the company's

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.396
worth in the market exceed
whatever return you require--

00:19:14.396 --> 00:19:16.770
because you're going to look
at your alternatives, right?

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.820
You can put money in a
CD, you can buy a bond,

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.960
you can do all kinds of things.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.200
If that exceeds your
return, you move on here.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.409
If it doesn't, you eliminate
this particular company

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:31.200
from consideration.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.580
And now what we're
talking about here

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.440
is we're looking at the
business itself now.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.890
Forget the stock market.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.765
We just want to know how
good is this company.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.640
And because we're
dealing with money here,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.390
we want the company to make
as much money as possible

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:58.630
in earnings or cash flow
relative to the capital it

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.480
takes to build that company.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:08.540
So if I need to have a factory
that costs me $1 billion,

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.860
and that factory is then going
to throw off $10 million a year

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.560
in profit, that's
probably not good enough.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:23.390
Because that's a 1% return,
and a factory is no CD,

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.530
it's not a safe
investment, and so forth.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.716
So you really want to know
how good is the business.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:35.170
Google, for example, doesn't
take a whole lot of capital,

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.130
and it throws off a
lot of free cash flow

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.240
relative to that
capital, so that's

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.172
why it's a great business.

00:20:43.172 --> 00:20:44.630
And that's the kind
of business you

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.750
want to be in, because
when you buy a stock,

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.260
they're not actually going to
pay you out all their earnings

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.320
every year.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.980
Now if they just took their
earnings and paid them out,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.255
you may not even care
how good of a business

00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:02.130
it is, because you're
getting those earnings.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.520
Like I mentioned, if
you're buying a company

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.350
with a 50% earnings yield,
and they paid everything out,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.510
you got your money back in
a little over two years,

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.270
and that's fine.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.780
But because most companies will
actually retain those earnings

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.410
in the business, you
care very much about when

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.860
they retain those earnings.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.480
They're going to invest
them in their business,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.050
and what is the return
on that capital?

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.200
Some companies pay
dividends, so that's

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.990
a portion of the
earnings, usually.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.020
They won't pay out
their whole earnings,

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.435
they'll pay out half,
if you're lucky.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.240
So there you may care
a little bit less,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.090
because you are
getting some cash back.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.310
But where you're not
basically getting cash back,

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.970
you want to know
what kind of return

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.280
is this company getting
on the cash that

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.870
stays in the business.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.530
And if it's a great business,
like Google, the problem

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:12.230
actually becomes that it's very
hard to reinvest that cash,

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.085
because the business doesn't
require a lot of capital.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:23.175
So take one year's worth of
free cash flow for Google.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.040
If it could be reinvested
in the business

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.630
at the kinds of returns
that Google is currently

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.540
getting on its capital,
that would be phenomenal.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:36.230
But because it's not a
capital-intensive business,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.930
that free cash flow just kind of
builds up on the balance sheet,

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.570
and over time
there's tens and tens

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.420
of billions of cash
on the balance sheet.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:53.260
So if we like the
quality of the business,

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.310
as measured by the earnings
divided by the capital employed

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.000
in the business, then it's a
good potential opportunity.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.065
And it still doesn't mean
that it's a great investment.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:12.430
But you've kind of eliminated
all the obvious candidates

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.640
that are just not good enough.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:23.290
And then once you're here, it
becomes really more of an art,

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.895
which company you are going
to invest in versus another.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.415
And we're going to get
into some of that here.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:39.995
So here are some value-oriented
investment approaches.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.740
You might have heard of value
investing and growth investing.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.260
So growth investing,
usually it's

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.960
kind of the other mindset,
or just the mindset

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.000
of which company is
going to grow the fastest

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.530
and that's where
I want to invest.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.120
But you're not really
thinking, well,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.660
what if everyone
else thinks it's

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.840
going to grow the fastest
as you're super expensive.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.330
You may not make any money.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.520
If they have any kind
of disappointment,

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.930
like they missed a
quarter by a penny,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.340
the stock can be
down 20% in a day,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.730
because there was
just no value there.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.650
So we want to buy things that
are more valuable than what

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.320
we're paying for them
in the stock market.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.420
And some of the well-known
approaches in this area--

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.200
there's the Benjamin
Graham style, deep value.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.670
And I start with that because
Benjamin Graham wrote the book

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.440
on value investing.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.900
It's called "The
Intelligent Investor."

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.780
And the style is today
called deep value

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.710
because you focus
mostly on the assets--

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.040
like I mentioned
a shipping company

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.130
with their ships
and the scrap value.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.910
That would be deep
value, if you can

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.755
buy something for
less than the assets.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.600
Question?

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.532
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

00:25:02.532 --> 00:25:03.823
How would you find [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:12.689 --> 00:25:13.730
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Correct.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.610
So really what you're
going to look at

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.740
is the financial
statements of a company,

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.860
and that's where we get kind of
into the language of investing,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.400
which is really accounting.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:31.340
So every company will have
a line item on their balance

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:35.250
sheet called property,
plant, and equipment.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.940
And for a shipping
company, that's

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.000
where their ships might be.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.620
For a hotel company
that owns hotels,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.540
that's where their
hotels would be.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.220
And then they may have a
footnote in their annual report

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.420
that actually lists
out the ships.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.050
It won't necessarily
tell you the market value

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.510
of those ships,
but it might tell

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.650
you what they're
carried on on the books,

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.500
and how much they've depreciated
so far, and some detail.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.830
But you're going to have
to dig a little bit deeper

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.610
if you want to know the market
value of specific ships,

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.017
or specific real estate,
or something like that.

00:26:14.017 --> 00:26:15.850
AUDIENCE: John, can you
repeat the question?

00:26:18.464 --> 00:26:19.380
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Yeah.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.400
The question was,
how do you actually

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.750
find companies that
maybe have those ships

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.300
and trade for less than that.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:34.100
So you could use a
quantitative stock screener

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.760
that looks for companies
that have market

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.980
value less than
tangible book value.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.260
And tangible book
value is once you

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.120
satisfy all the liabilities--
like the debt-- what's

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:55.010
left over for the shareholders,
using this accounting

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.730
language-- which
is standardized,

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:03.380
but it's not really correct
in an economic sense.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.960
But you can use
it for screening,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.610
and then you have to do your
own research to decide, well,

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:13.010
the book value may be high,
but that's not actually

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.780
if I wanted to sell the ships,
so you take it down and do

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:18.735
that kind of analysis.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:25.030
Now Joel Greenblatt is a
very successful investor.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:29.300
He's written a book called
"The Little Book That Beats

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.820
the Market," where he talks
about this magic formula.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.640
It's essentially a way to screen
for companies that, according

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.510
to my previous
schematic, would be

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.230
in that green
portion at the end,

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.700
and then you can invest in them.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.320
And it looks at two factors.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.010
One is the high earnings
yield, how cheap is a business.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.460
And the other is the
high return on capital,

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.140
how good is a business.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.570
And historically, just
a mechanical screen

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.190
of those companies that rank
highly on those two metrics

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:09.100
has outperformed the S&amp;P
500 by several percentage

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.540
points a year.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.120
And over time, due to
compounding, that just

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.970
is a huge number.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.200
Then we have what I call
here Carl Icahn-style,

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.240
sum-of-the-parts investing.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.050
You may have heard
of Carl Icahn,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:31.260
or these activist investors,
who will buy a big chunk

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:37.670
of a company-- maybe 10%-- and
then try to tell the company

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:42.420
what to do so that the stock
would be worth more, or go up.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.750
And usually what
they look for is

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:51.240
where you have a company that
has different parts to it,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.860
and if you add up the
value of all the parts,

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.350
it's materially above
what the whole company

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.715
is trading for in the
stock markets today.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:05.240
And that can happen quite often,
because maybe a company has

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.180
a core business, and that's
what investors are focused on,

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.470
and they value the
company based on that.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.490
But then there may
be something else

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.380
that they own that's totally
unrelated-- like some big piece

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.830
of real estate, or
some other business.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.360
And then there are
some other approaches,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.800
what I call jockey
stocks, which is really

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.860
companies that are
run by a great jockey.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.310
It's again the horse
racing kind of analogy,

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:38.140
where you have a CEO who is
not just great at running

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.194
the business, but also great
at what he does with the cash

00:29:42.194 --> 00:29:43.360
that the business generates.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.330
Because once the cash is there,
there are a lot of options.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.550
And you can destroy a lot
of value is a company,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.040
or create a lot of value, based
on what you do with the cash.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.750
So it's especially
relevant for companies

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.590
that have a ton of cash
on their balance sheet.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.560
You might make an
acquisition, you

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.530
could overpay for
another business,

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.060
just because you
fear you're going

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.510
to miss out on the next trend.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.280
And you take that
hard earned cash

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.270
and you could
basically waste it.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:20.130
Or if your stock
price gets low--

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.480
let's say there's a financial
crisis and the stock gets hit,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.160
and it's trading
way below what it's

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.740
worth-- the company could
actually take the cash hoard

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.560
and buy its own stock
in the stock market,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.390
and create huge value.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.160
Because if it's
just sitting there,

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.830
the cash is maybe
earning 0%, 1%, 2%.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:46.420
But if you're buying your own
stock at yields of 10% or more,

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.070
you're going to
create huge value.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:54.810
So I want to maybe get
into a couple of these

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.240
quickly, and then
take questions.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.420
But these are basically these
buckets we just talked about.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.430
And I'm not a huge
fan of buckets,

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.750
because once you
get into that, then

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.880
it becomes a little
bit more mechanical.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.050
You find a company, and
all of a sudden you're

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.410
thinking, well, what
bucket does it fit in?

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.310
And how do I have to analyze it?

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.940
When really it should
just be common sense.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.820
You should just take
a company, imagine

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.180
you own the whole thing,
and think like an owner,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.100
basically, from scratch.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.700
But nonetheless, let's
just touch on some

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.090
of the key features of some
of these types of companies.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.160
So these deeper
value companies where

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:45.400
you're buying maybe some
factory-type business

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:51.480
for less than it would
cost to create the factory,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.240
these are generally
hated stocks.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.530
And if you look at
it historically,

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.220
people have overreacted on
the negative, generally.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:11.640
So this guy, Jeroen Bos,
he's a successful investor

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.710
who just invests in
these hated companies.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.010
So he says it's kind
of contradictory

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.380
that you buy what no one else
wants, and then you outperform.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.370
And it just takes
a certain mindset

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.300
to be comfortable doing that,
because everyone around you

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.820
will say, oh, you
are not very smart.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.540
And imagine if an
investment doesn't work out,

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.540
you're really going to
not feel very smart.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.550
Because everyone was telling
you all along, and then that's

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.840
what happened.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.330
So even when people
start off like this,

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.430
they can't sustain
it for very long.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.840
Because after a while they
just think, you know what?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.070
It's too hard, and
I can handle it,

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.980
so I'm going to move on to
one of the more comfortable

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.330
approaches, where you
buy great companies,

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.680
and you pay more for them,
but at least no one's

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.480
going to tell you that you're
making an obvious mistake.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.030
But then, they
actually do outperform.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.450
And it's kind of the reward for
the discomfort, if you will.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:27.490
These are some takeaways that
I basically have in the book

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.440
related to this
chapter on deep value.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.530
And I'll just kind of
highlight the first one,

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.420
which is we start with
the price of the stock.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.590
So when you talk to
Jeroen Bos, or one

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:46.050
of the other investors who focus
on these kinds of companies,

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:49.540
the first thing they'll talk
about is wow, this is so cheap.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.120
And then after two minutes,
you ask them, well,

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.260
what does the company do?

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:58.070
So they really just care
that it's really cheap,

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:02.780
kind of the bargain
basement pricing.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.060
And here's an
example of a company

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:13.460
that somebody presented at
one of the online conferences

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.766
we've hosted for investors.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:24.199
And the basic thesis here-- this
is a tire manufacturer in Korea

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.820
that has a few different
types of stock,

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.969
so it gets a little complicated.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:35.070
But basically, you can
invest in this company

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:40.770
in a few different ways, and the
basic way-- the common stock--

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.199
is cheap.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.790
But then there's another way,
through the preferred stock,

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:51.960
where you're getting this
exact same thing 50% cheaper

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.230
than other people are
paying for the other thing.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.440
And the other thing
they're paying more,

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.750
basically because it's a little
bit more well-known, or has

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.810
more trading going on.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:10.390
So sometimes people will
care about liquidity a lot

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:11.170
in a stock.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.790
Oh, can I buy $10 million
of this in one day,

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.010
or does it trade very little?

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.170
When actually,
how much it trades

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.520
has nothing to do with
how much it's worth.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.450
I mean, if you own a
house it trades zero,

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.280
and it's still worth
whatever it's worth.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.720
So the preferreds trade at a
big discount to the common,

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.030
and that's just an example
of a deep value investment.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.300
AUDIENCE: John, can you go
back to the previous slide?

00:35:40.854 --> 00:35:41.770
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Sure.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.978
AUDIENCE: One quick question.

00:35:42.978 --> 00:35:45.790
On point number two, you
said no voting rights,

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.506
but confer some
economic benefits.

00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:49.630
Can you explain that point?

00:35:51.424 --> 00:35:52.340
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Sure.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.670
So depending on
the class of stock,

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.300
the voting rights may be
a little bit different,

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:03.100
which just means do
you get to decide

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.370
who is on the board of
directors, and so forth.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.880
And companies do that
for different reasons.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.410
Actually, Google has,
I think, two or now

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.380
three classes of stock.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:21.720
And the purpose there
is really to make sure

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.620
that the founders
retain operating control

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.890
of the company, and can
make the decisions that

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.230
are needed for the future.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:36.020
Because you wouldn't necessarily
want an outside investor

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.290
to come in and buy
up enough shares

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:43.760
to get voting control of a
company, and then do something

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.810
that may move the stock
in the short term,

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.200
but may destroy value
in the long term.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:54.660
So one way to do that is to
sell non-voting stock, or shares

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.420
that have fewer votes,
to public investors,

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.320
so that they can never gain
a majority of the vote.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.450
And these preferreds
have no voting rights,

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.350
but this is a Korean
tire manufacturer.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.880
Even if you're buying the
stock that has voting rights,

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.350
there's no practical
difference, because you're not

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.240
going to be able to influence
it in any way, either way.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:22.520
So the voting rights
are not worth very much,

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.850
but you're getting the
same economic benefits.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.700
So if the common
shareholders get $1 dividend,

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.460
you'll get $1 dividend, but
you're paying half the price

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.625
for the preferred stock.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:43.750
Sum-of-the-parts, there are
many examples of this kind

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:44.250
of-- Yeah?

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.166
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:55.372 --> 00:37:57.330
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.430
And actually they can stay
cheaper for a very long time.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:05.950
Sometimes a company may, if
the company's smart, or cares

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.810
about the value,
they may actually

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.007
buy that preferred
stock themselves,

00:38:12.007 --> 00:38:14.090
because it's so much cheaper
than the other stock.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:17.410
They could sell the other
stock in the market,

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.810
and then use the money to
buy back the preferred.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:24.555
But absent that, you're right,
the disparity could continue.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:32.040
But would you rather buy
the one at 50% discount,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.880
and maybe it stays at
a discount, maybe not.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.790
The discount could get wider,
but I think probabilistically,

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.360
you're much better off
buying it at a discount.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.610
And it turns out
that over time, they

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:51.160
do tend to work out, because
some large shareholders would

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.250
move in, and they'll just
kind of start putting pressure

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.790
on the management to
eliminate this disparity.

00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:00.192
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:09.624 --> 00:39:10.790
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Absolutely.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.860
And sometimes preferred
stock-- or often-- it's

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.560
a better security because it
ranks ahead of the common.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.555
In case of bankruptcy, it
may have certain preferences.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:26.360
But because a lot of investors
are so focused on liquidity,

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.390
meaning being able to--
if I decide tomorrow,

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:30.930
I want to dump
this stock-- being

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.750
able to dump it in one
day, versus taking a week

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.560
to sell it slowly.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.110
They put such a premium on
that, that the preferred-- even

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.600
though it's a better security--
may trade at a big discount

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.820
to the common.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.710
And to a long-term investor
that makes no sense.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.575
So you can buy that preferred
slowly, you can sell it slowly,

00:39:50.575 --> 00:39:52.775
and over time you're
going to make more money.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.840
There are some examples
of sum-of-the-parts are

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.870
so obvious, they're at
very large companies.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.650
So there was a couple
years ago, Vodafone,

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:13.520
which is a big mobile phone
carrier based in the UK,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.640
owned a large stake in
Verizon Wireless in the US.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.790
And Verizon Wireless
publicly traded so just

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:26.290
that the value of that
stake was so great

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.795
that the rest of Vodafone was
being valued extremely cheaply.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:36.310
But investors didn't see
care to see it for a while,

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.360
and it's hard to
predict these things,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.990
but usually it
works out, and then

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.390
after a couple of years, all
of a sudden it worked out,

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.680
and you actually
make a great return.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.760
Even though you
didn't quite know when

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.815
that disparity would be removed.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.330
And so, sometimes it makes sense
to analyze the different parts

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:08.000
of a company separately, and
then sum up all those values

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.920
to decide what is this
business really worth.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.420
And I'll just make a kind
of a side comment here.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.950
So whether you're adding
up different parts,

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:26.701
or just using an earnings
yield, or what have you,

00:41:26.701 --> 00:41:33.130
you really need to
know-- or basically

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.840
have an estimate
that you believe in--

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.410
that a company's worth
before you can even

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.310
think about investing in it.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:48.890
Because if you don't know what
you think a business is worth,

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.695
then there's no basis to
make an investment decision.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.090
And I think that's
often forgotten.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.550
Sometimes you'll just
hear someone say, oh, you

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.350
should buy Apple
stock, because they're

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.520
going to come up
with a new iPhone.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.490
And there's no reference in
that sentence to how much

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.360
you have to pay for Apple.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.580
Could be $100 billion,
could be $200 billion.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:17.350
So maybe the fact that they're
coming out with a new product

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.970
is already reflected
in that market value--

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:23.550
and actually if the
new product is not

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.220
quite as great, the
stock goes down.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.290
So you really need
to think about what

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.790
is this business worth
in the stock market,

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.900
and what do I value it at.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.320
If I had the money,
how much would

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.030
I want to pay for that
company to own all of it,

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.020
and just make money off the
cash flow of the company.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.340
And here's just kind
of a classic example

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.540
of sum-of-the-parts.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:58.540
Where you have this little
company in India where

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.790
they got $50 million
cash, they have a big plot

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:07.980
of land near Mumbai airport,
and both of those things

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.400
together are already
worth more than

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.970
what the whole company's
trading for in the stock market.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.810
So you're actually getting
the business, whatever

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:22.790
it is that they do-- which
is an exhibition and IT parks

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.450
business-- you're
getting that for free.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:29.230
And that may or may
not be a good deal,

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:32.550
but at least you found something
that looks kind of interesting.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.470
Because if they sold that
land, or gave back that cash

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:41.070
to the shareholders, you get
your investment right back,

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:42.645
and you own this business.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.560
So that's an interesting
type of set up,

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.860
and that would fit into
sum-of-the-parts category.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.430
I'll just touch very
briefly on magic formula,

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.520
and then we'll open
it up for questions.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:05.590
Here we were talking about
the two factors screening,

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.925
looking for cheap stocks
and good companies.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.860
Alon Bochman is an investor
who focuses on that.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:22.150
And an interesting finding
is that if you gave people

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:26.010
the lists of those companies
that rank highly on those two

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:31.040
factors and told them, well, now
that you have these companies,

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.060
choose the best
ones-- or now, use

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.210
your own judgments
to choose which ones

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.290
you want to invest in.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:41.330
What they found is actually,
when people choose their own,

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:46.250
they do worse than the
mechanical screen does.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:50.260
And it's interesting but
it's also kind of intuitive,

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:54.700
because there we go back
to the discomfort of owning

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.200
hated businesses.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.990
If they're that's
cheap, they're usually

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:02.070
companies that have fallen
a little bit on hard times.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.650
And when you're
looking at that list,

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.460
you're going to want to
eliminate any company that

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.410
doesn't feel quite right.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.630
But they're priced so
cheaply that they'll actually

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:11.130
outperform.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:19.010
And so I'll end it there.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.880
There's one more approach
discussed in the slide deck

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.180
that we're going
to skip over now,

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.510
but it deals with the quality
of the management team.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.230
And the point that I just
want to kind of leave

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.290
with all of you is,
there's no secret,

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:40.880
there's no magic to this.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.210
And the only way to do
well in the long term

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:50.010
is to find businesses
where you feel like you're

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:54.750
comfortable with it,
and it's cheap enough

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:58.060
in the stock market that
you feel like the return

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.080
you're getting from
the business itself

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.440
is going to make it worthwhile.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:09.320
Ben Graham, who wrote that
original book on investing,

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.650
he said in the short
term, the stock market

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:15.230
is a voting machine.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:18.290
And in the long term,
it's a weighing machine.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:21.350
So in the short term,
there's the beauty contest,

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.560
there's all this
noise out there.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.570
And when you turn
on CNBC, they're

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:29.460
always talking about this
quarter, or today even,

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.640
or tomorrow, what's
going to happen.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.340
That's just noise.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.780
There's no signal there.

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.260
But in the long term,
there's that mystery.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.270
So how do you go from a voting
machine to a weighing machine?

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:49.170
But I guess over time, the
earnings of the business

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.350
come in, and people
settle down, whatever

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:56.670
emotion they had on
that day dissipates.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:47:01.270
When there was the oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:04.080
BP's stock got
killed, because they

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.950
were operating that
well that had the spill.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.090
And that was the
voting machine, right?

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.880
People were saying
BP is going bankrupt.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.280
And then as people
start to think, well,

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.720
what are the scenarios?

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.660
How much could they have to pay?

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.395
And even in the
worst case scenario,

00:47:22.395 --> 00:47:27.890
if they had to pay $20 billion
to clean up this oil spill,

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:31.130
they'd still be undervalued
because the stock has gone down

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.730
so much.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.230
And over time, the
stock went back up,

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:38.020
because people realized
what BP was actually worth.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:43.680
So with that, I will open
it up to any questions.

00:47:46.141 --> 00:47:46.640
Yeah?

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.904
AUDIENCE: So you always have
to be ahead of the market

00:47:52.904 --> 00:47:57.336
price, which is representative
of the current prediction

00:47:57.336 --> 00:48:01.134
that other people have made
and according to [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:01.134 --> 00:48:04.062
So if you want to find some
investment opportunity that

00:48:04.062 --> 00:48:06.990
is worthwhile, you have to
make a better prediction

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.454
than all those [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:08.454 --> 00:48:10.854
So you have to find
one where others

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:13.640
have made a bad prediction.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.330
This requires
[INAUDIBLE], so is it

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.190
feasible for a small
scale investor who's

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:25.480
going [INAUDIBLE] profit from
it to actually be worth the time

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.362
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:28.320
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.060
So the stock price does reflect
the opinion of the market.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:39.820
And just to be technical, it's
not the actual stock price,

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.640
it's the market capitalization.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.890
So it's stock price times
number of shares outstanding.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:50.740
And it'll have a
prediction built in,

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:56.270
but you don't need to outsmart
the market on the prediction

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.360
necessarily,
because you can just

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.340
decide what you're
comfortable with.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:08.970
So if the company's earning
$1 billion in free cash flow,

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:14.900
or net income per year, and
it's selling for $10 billion,

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.230
that's a 10% yield.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.600
And you can say, well,
I'm comfortable with that.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.440
Because again,
we're getting back

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.330
to the legal essence of a stock.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.950
It's part ownership
of the company.

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:31.350
You're not actually betting--
there was that marketplace that

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:33.570
got shot down online,
where you could back

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.900
from different things,
maybe even things

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.720
like that-- how many iPhones
are going to get sold,

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.590
and if they sold above
a certain number,

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:42.900
you could actually get paid.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.940
Well, that's not
what stocks are.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.340
Stocks are just ownership
in the business.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:51.910
So if you're fine with
10%, and you're fine

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:55.660
with it growing very slowly,
you're going to make money.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.740
The market may expect
it to grow faster,

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.955
but that's not going to
take away your 10% yield.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.950
It does get
dangerous when you're

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.690
buying very expensive
stocks, because there

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:15.460
your yield from the business
is so low that you really

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.370
are betting on something
great happening.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:21.710
And that's where
outsmarting the market

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:23.270
becomes much more important.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.900
But if you're just
sticking with things

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.960
that you're totally
comfortable with,

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.510
you don't need to
worry very much

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.615
about what the
market is predicting.

00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:33.270
Yeah?

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.736
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: What are the
top three to five positions

00:50:35.736 --> 00:50:37.680
in your personal portfolio?

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:46.340
I'm not going to get into
it, just because that

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:51.210
can age fairly rapidly.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:55.110
Although I do view myself
as a long-term investor,

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.200
but circumstances
can change, and I

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.920
don't want to make any
recommendations here.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.350
And you shouldn't accept
recommendations from anyone

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:06.810
really, because they're not
going to necessarily tell you

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:10.110
when they sell the stock
that they told you to buy.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:15.140
And also, we talked
about the discomfort

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.030
of owning stocks that go down.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:20.390
And generally, I want
to only buy a stock

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.690
where I am excited
if it goes down 50%,

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:26.640
because then I
can buy even more.

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:32.580
And if you have
that mindset, you're

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.280
going to be a lot pickier.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.360
Because usually when
a stock goes down 50%,

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.070
you're really scared.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:42.300
You're thinking this
is going to zero.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:52.380
So you need to just know what
you think a company's worth,

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.205
and then be comfortable
with the downside.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.780
So you really need to do
your own work, would be my--

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:06.350
AUDIENCE: John-- since
you're a value investor,

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.330
would you say that
you don't invest

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:14.070
in areas like biotech, where
the company's not public yet,

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:15.390
and there's no revenue?

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:16.890
JOHN MIHALJEVIC:
Yeah, that's right.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.550
And a biotech company
could be worth a lot,

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.320
even if it has no
revenue, but that's

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.900
beyond my capacity to judge.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:29.870
And Warren Buffett
once said, you

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:31.676
need to know your
circle of competence.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:36.180
But what's even more important
is to stay within it.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:40.140
So it can be small, but
if you stay within that,

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.190
you'll do well.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.760
And if you venture
outside of it,

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.140
like would be my case
with a biotech company,

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.610
or many other companies--
and it's OK to say,

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.260
I don't know enough.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.710
Actually, that's what I
would say with most companies

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:54.600
in the stock market.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.410
To use a baseball analogy
again from Buffett,

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.990
it's a no-strike called game.

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:06.820
So you don't need to swing at
every idea that comes your way.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.440
The only thing that matters
is the companies that you do

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.420
buy, you're right on.

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:16.980
And even there, you're not
going to be right on every one.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:22.210
So stay within your
circle of competence

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:26.450
and you'll do much better than
if you venture outside of that.

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.024
Maybe go to San Francisco?

00:53:30.024 --> 00:53:31.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a quick question.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:35.500
Thank you for a great
presentation, and a great book.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:40.580
In the book, you mention about
using American Association

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:45.390
of Individual Investors' data to
be able to [INAUDIBLE] for some

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:46.880
of these buckets.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.860
I wonder if you
have recommendations

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:54.540
on how one uses raw data in
countries outside the US.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.790
So I know you're
based in Europe.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:59.465
How does one do that in Europe,
or any of the other countries,

00:53:59.465 --> 00:54:00.640
if you have recommendations?

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:05.810
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:09.150
The data that exists
for the US stock market

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:12.320
is a lot more robust
than what's available

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.980
out there for Europe
or other markets.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:19.620
So if you're looking at
companies listed on the New

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.130
York Stock Exchange, or NASDAQ--
even foreign companies--

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:26.150
you can screen for
those very cheaply.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:31.870
The subscription you mentioned
is about $300 a year,

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:34.940
and then the databases that
will do a good job on Europe

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:41.470
and the rest of the world may
cost $20,000 or $30,000 a year.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:45.060
So if you want to go
the low-cost route,

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.740
there's really no great
solution for Europe or Asia.

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:52.940
You may just end up
relying a lot more

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:57.000
on the primary documents,
and doing the work yourself.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.935
Which of course makes it hard
to screen across many companies.

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.080
You'll be kind of be
digging one by one,

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.780
unless you're willing to
pay quite a bit of money.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:14.720
AUDIENCE: I know you run a very
well-respected newsletter, also

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.460
by the same name
"Manual of Ideas."

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:20.110
I wonder, how do you go about
looking for these companies?

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.460
You obviously don't
go one at a time.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.250
Do you use a database,
or is this names

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:29.775
that show up through looking
at [INAUDIBLE] equivalent

00:55:29.775 --> 00:55:30.650
in foreign countries?

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:34.770
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Yeah,
so we have developed

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:39.000
a few different idea
generation methods over time,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.170
and we do have an
internal database that's

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:44.320
kind of fills in
some of the holes

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:48.800
that exist in some of the more
widely available databases.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.020
So we'll use that,
and then we'll

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.200
use some of the more
serendipitous ways

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.870
of generating ideas,
like you mentioned,

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:01.710
some of the filings by
well-known investors,

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.350
and looking at what
they own in Europe.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:12.030
So that's really what we do
is we've built that internally

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:12.770
over time.

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.420
But if you want
something off the shelf,

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:20.310
it's probably going to
be fairly pricey to cover

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:22.450
Europe and Asia.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:28.590
AUDIENCE: So would you say
that for an individual investor

00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:32.170
the lowest-cost option after the
databases available in the US

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:38.410
would be to subscribe to
a newsletter like yours,

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:41.350
and that would be
something that's

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:44.110
the lowest-cost next
available option?

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.520
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: I'm not really
sure about the lowest-cost

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.020
option.

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.380
If you're looking to
screen mechanically,

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:57.170
the "Manual of Ideas" really
won't be the right tool,

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:01.430
because we don't allow you to
screen on our whole database.

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:06.240
We actually select ideas
and present them each month.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.620
So I'm not sure what
service you would

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.905
want to go with for screening.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.815
AUDIENCE: Thanks, that's
a great response, though,

00:57:16.815 --> 00:57:19.040
that's a good idea,
thank you so much.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.840
I have one follow-up
question, but maybe I

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.330
can come back after lunch again.

00:57:23.075 --> 00:57:24.325
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: There's one--

00:57:24.325 --> 00:57:26.783
AUDIENCE: There's time for one
more question from the room.

00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:30.190
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask if there's

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.650
a danger in picking stocks
that are very public,

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:39.585
and many people might
be buying as fanboys,

00:57:39.585 --> 00:57:43.822
and I want to take an example,
and not just there's Google

00:57:43.822 --> 00:57:47.330
and there's Microsoft, which
have a somewhat similar market

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:47.830
cap.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:54.342
But the price earnings ratio
of Microsoft is twice more,

00:57:54.342 --> 00:57:58.370
so technically Microsoft makes
twice more money than Google.

00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:02.370
And is there a reason that
Google, just because hey,

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:05.040
Google is cool, they
do everything well,

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.075
is going to attract
a lot of attention

00:58:08.075 --> 00:58:11.714
and people are going to think
oh, they are going to be great.

00:58:11.714 --> 00:58:13.464
And the Microsoft
people don't believe it,

00:58:13.464 --> 00:58:15.088
even though it's
making all that money.

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.580
Is it a good idea
just to collect it

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.365
as an issue or something?

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:25.730
Or is it just the
long term [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:28.657 --> 00:58:30.490
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: So
that's a great question,

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.830
and it kind of goes
back to the parimutuel

00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:35.920
betting system nature of--

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:39.650
AUDIENCE: John, could
you repeat the question?

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:43.780
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: The question is
really Microsoft versus Google

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.990
as potential investment.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:49.240
The questioner says
that Microsoft,

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:54.680
because basically half the price
of Google is measured by PE,

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:59.450
and whether that makes
Microsoft the better investment.

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:04.970
And it's very hard
for me to judge,

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:09.510
so it's really
impossible to say.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:12.950
But it is true that,
as you say, the market

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:15.910
is making a judgment
that Google will

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:18.970
do much better in the
future than Microsoft.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:21.410
Otherwise, you would
want to buy Microsoft,

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:25.830
because you're getting twice the
bang for your buck, in a way.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:31.895
So just to kind of illuminate
that with some sample numbers.

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.690
Basically Google and Microsoft
were the same market value.

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.310
Microsoft right now,
the way they're valued,

00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:44.750
is making twice as
much money as Google.

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.690
Now in absolute
terms it's not true

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:49.350
because Google has a bigger
market value, and so forth.

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:55.780
And that's just a judgment that
every investor needs to make,

00:59:55.780 --> 01:00:00.270
but as I said earlier,
you can actually

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:02.670
just look at other
things if you're not

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:04.960
comfortable making
that judgment.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.920
And generally, that's
not an extreme situation.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.250
Usually you'll find much
more extreme situations

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:16.590
than that, where Research
In Motion is trading

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:20.670
at 1% of the
valuation of Google.

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:28.410
And something that extreme
can be also more rewarding,

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.520
if you are a little bit
right in some aspect.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:39.670
Microsoft and
Google, the judgment

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.790
becomes pretty
difficult to make,

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:44.865
and it also may depend on your
time horizon and other things.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.270
AUDIENCE: John, we won't hate
you if you said Microsoft here.

01:00:51.089 --> 01:00:52.630
JOHN MIHALJEVIC:
Sorry, say it again.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880
AUDIENCE: I said you
could say Microsoft

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.620
if you really believe it.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.716
We wouldn't blame you
for saying that here.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:07.120
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Well,
I don't believe it,

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.250
but I'm not sure
I'd say if I did.

01:01:12.439 --> 01:01:14.230
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
one more question John?

01:01:15.074 --> 01:01:15.990
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Sure.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:21.400
AUDIENCE: When you follow so
many different investors who

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:27.430
are of all different sizes, in
terms of how much capital they

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:32.275
manage and how popularly known
outside the value investing

01:01:32.275 --> 01:01:32.775
circles.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:38.580
Who would you rate as the
top two or three investors,

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.600
not just from a
performance point of view,

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.640
but people you look up
to, and look forward

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.825
to reading their
shareholder letters,

01:01:46.825 --> 01:01:51.670
and who have really meaningful
insights that are not popularly

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:52.385
known otherwise.

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:59.560
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Well, there
are a lot of investors I admire.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.230
If you want people who
are really not well-known,

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:06.530
they're actually
in this slide deck.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.480
Phil Ordway is somebody I
have a little bit later.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:18.030
He manages a fund and does
just extremely good work.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.490
He's kind of an
up-and-coming fund manager,

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:24.130
but I think will do very well.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.650
And then there are fund
managers that are kind of not

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:31.440
as well-known as
Warren Buffett, but I'd

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.520
say Bruce Berkowitz
or David Einhorn,

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.455
definitely among the
folks I respect the most.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.750
There's actually a list
of investors in the book

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:49.780
as well, if you
want to look at it.

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.970
And we kind of update the
list for our monthly edition

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.610
all the time.

01:02:55.990 --> 01:03:00.720
So we want to track people that
have had good track records,

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.550
and that we know do very good
work on the companies they

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:07.250
invest in.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:14.770
AUDIENCE: Are there specific
point managers or shareholder

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:16.734
letters you look forward to?

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.560
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Well,
it's sometimes hard

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.620
to get on some of these
lists, because they

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.770
manage private
partnerships and are not

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:31.150
allowed to mail those
letters out widely.

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:35.400
But Phil Ordway has a letter,
as does Michael Shearn.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:40.835
Seth Klarman's letter is great,
it's sometimes hard to get.

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:47.480
And there are probably a number
of other guys on that list

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.290
that we could
email around maybe.

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:52.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.100
AUDIENCE: OK, so thank
you very much [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.150
JOHN MIHALJEVIC: Thank you.
