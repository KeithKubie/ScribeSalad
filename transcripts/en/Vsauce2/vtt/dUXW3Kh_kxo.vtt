00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.490
Vsauce -- Kevin here, with a game you can
always win.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.180
Grab a friend and take turns counting using
numbers from 1 to 10.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.240
The first person to get to 100 wins.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.830
Which can always be you.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.600
To demonstrate, let’s have a friendly game
between me and uhhh…

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600
I guess..

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.960
I’ll just play with myself.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.230
Hey me!

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.470
It’s good to see me.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.840
Am I ready to play?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.840
Yes.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.020
Yes I am.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.860
Okay, add numbers between 1 and 10 and the
person who gets to 100 first wins.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.090
I’ll write the sum in between mes so you
can follow along.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.840
I’ll start the game.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.960
1

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.070
7

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.190
4

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.300
9

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.420
2

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.530
10

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.649
1

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.130
You’re just picking numbers randomly like
me, right?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.140
Uhh… yeahhh...

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.610
Okay cool, 3

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.730
8

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.850
8

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.969
3

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.089
5

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.219
6

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.460
Seriously, though.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.479
We both have 50/50 odds of getting to 100.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.479
Um.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.479
Sure!

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.479
Alright.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.479
4

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.479
7

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.479
9

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.479
2

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:18.479
Uh.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.479
Wait.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.479
89?

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.149
If I play 1, that’s 90 and you can play
10 and win and… if I play 10 that’s 99

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.850
and you can play 1 and win.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.069
Oh, weird.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.109
I, uh, must’ve gotten lucky.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.329
Yeah, right.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.329
5.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.329
[94]

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.979
6! 100, I WIN!

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:35.979
Every.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:36.979
Time.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:37.979
Here’s how.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.200
Uhh..you can go now, me.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.380
Uh, fine.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.560
Well, I want a rematch later.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.009
I guess I’ll just uhhh...see ya in the mirror?

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.020
Yeahhhhh.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.189
Okay, now let’s play a match between me
and you and I’ll explain along the way how

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.590
it works.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.779
The easiest way for me to know I’m going
to win every time is for me to go first and

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:02.499
start with the number 1.

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:09.540
No matter what number you add next, 5, 3,
8, whatever it is, I just subtract your number

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.060
from 11 to get my next play.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.300
So if I start with 1 and if you say 4, then
our sum is 5.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.990
To get my next number, I do 11 minus 4, which
equals 7, so 7 is my next play: 7 plus 5 gives

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.300
our game a new total of 12.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.170
Then you say...

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.170
8.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.170
Cool.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.110
8 plus 12 gives our game a new total of 20.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.000
I do 11 minus your 8, which is 3.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.850
So, I play 3 and our new total is 23.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.820
As long as I stick to this strategy I’m
guaranteed to be the first to 100.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.320
This is why it works.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.570
Regardless of your number, mine will always
result in a sum that’s part of an arithmetic

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:12.980
series separated by elevens: 1, 12, 23, 34,
45, 56, 67, 78, 89, and… then finally 100.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.970
Since the highest number you can play in the
game is 10 -- if I separate your moves by

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.970
eleven...

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.930
I rule the world!

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.530
Or at least… this simple number game.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.090
Gotta start somewhere.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.890
When you play this with your friend can they
ever win?

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.890
Yes.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.600
If you mess up the series.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.060
While going first, playing 1, and subtracting
every opponent’s number by 11 is the easiest

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.550
way to stick with the series, after a few
rounds you might want to switch things up

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.620
to prevent them from figuring out your strategy.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.100
You could do that by starting with a number
other than 1 and choosing wrong numbers until

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.140
later in the game when you land on a number
in the arithmetic series like 67 or 78.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.150
So if you’re playing with a friend and you
pick random numbers until the sum is 65, then

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.210
you could play 2 to bring your total to 67
and then you’re right on track.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.299
From there just subtract your friend’s numbers
every single time by 11 and you will be the

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.400
first to 100.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.330
To players who don’t realize that the optimal
strategy depends on that series, this game

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.800
seems like a game of chance -- but once you
know the series, you have the secret number

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.639
knowledge.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.830
But if adding up to 100 isn’t your cup of
tea you could try a similar game with matchsticks.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.900
These are Inq’s Durable Match-Like Puzzle
Sticks that come in the new Curiosity Box

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.210
that is out right now.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.279
It’s packed with a booklet that features
22 different puzzles that you can try to solve

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.229
yourself when you get these matchsticks.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.889
But for right now we’ll use the matchsticks
to visualize another game you can always win.

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.120
Alright.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.129
You have eleven matchsticks spread out on
a table.

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.860
You and a friend take turns removing either
1, 2 or 3 matchsticks and the player who picks

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.139
up the last match loses.

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.550
If you go first, you can always win this game.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.870
Since you don’t want to pick up that last
match, let’s work backwards to uncover the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.870
secret.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.830
We’ll play a game between Mr. T and Skeletor
because… why not?.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.309
Alright, let’s skip to the end of the game
to workout the winning strategy.

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:42.809
If it’s Skeletor’s turn and Mr T. leaves
Skeletor with 2, 3, or 4 matches, Skeletor

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.610
can leave T. with the final losing match.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:55.740
So, T. will want to make sure he leaves Skeletor
with 5, to guarantee that Mr. T keeps his

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.740
jewelry.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.339
Here’s why.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:06.460
If there are 2 matches left, then Skeletor
just takes 1 and leaves Mr. T. with the final

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.460
losing match.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.690
If there are 3 matches left, then Skeletor
takes 2, Mr. T. loses.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.430
And if there are 4, then Skeletor takes 3,
then Mr. T loses again.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.250
But if T leaves 5, no matter what Skeletor
plays next -- 3, 2, or 1 -- T can make a winning

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.800
move and pity the fool accordingly.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.710
The arithmetic series that will rig the game
for T is separated by 4’s…

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.940
1, then 5, and then…

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.940
9.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.490
Mr. T. will want to leave Skeletor with 9
matches to make sure that ALL his plays match

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.409
up with the series.

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:50.110
If Skeletor and T start with 11 matches and
T goes first, that means his initial play

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.099
will be to remove 2.

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:57.820
Since each player can only remove a maximum
of 3 matches per turn, you can dominate the

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.969
game every time by going first and making
moves that stick to this series.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:06.710
… which is why the game works with 20 matches,
too.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.779
To guarantee a win with 20 matches on the
table, your first play should be to remove

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.550
3 to land you at 17.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.440
So let’s say T. starts and removes 3 to
get to 17.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.819
No matter what Skeletor does, T just needs
to get to 13 to stay on course to win.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:32.419
So, if Skeletor removes 2 to get to 15, then
Mr. T. just needs to remove 2 to get to 13.

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.409
Now T. needs to get down to 9.

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:43.529
So, if Skeletor removes 3 to get to 10, then
Mr. T. just has to remove 1 match to get to

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:44.529
9.

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:51.289
The next milestone is 5, so if Skeletor removes
1 to get to 8, then Mr. T can remove 3 to

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:52.539
get to 5.

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:54.090
And now it’s officially over.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.849
Skeleton can’t do anything -- 1, 2, 3, it
doesn’t matter.

00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:03.259
Mr. T. is leaving Skeletor with the final
losing match.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:09.569
Let’s see if it’ll fit in his hand.

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:12.129
What about this one?

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.970
Good enough.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.409
Both the counting game and this matchstick
one are referred to as “Nim-like,” because

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:24.069
they’re conceptually similar to a game from
ancient times that evolved into what mathematicians

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:26.139
now call Nim.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:31.259
Players take turns removing objects from heaps
or stacks, and the player to remove the last

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:39.169
object loses… but it gets a lot more complex
than sticking to a basic arithmetic series.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.010
We like complex.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.511
Humans have been inventing brain-teasing games
to pass the time, sharpen their minds, and

00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:51.130
extend collective knowledge for as long as
recorded history shows.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:56.860
One of the oldest games we know about is Senet,
with board pieces from Ancient Egypt dating

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.990
back over 5,000 years.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.310
About the same time humans were inventing
the precursors to our modern written language

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:11.050
systems, we were developing number games to
occupy ourselves and tease out a better understanding

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.020
of the quantifiable world.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.320
Creating artificial challenges -- and then
out-thinking them -- is a way we exercise

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.040
our minds.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.300
By discovering the hidden patterns that govern
reality, whether we’re just practicing with

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:31.540
a matchstick game or unwinding the great scientific
challenges of our times, we’re engaging

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:38.220
in an integral part of what makes us -- us.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.430
Even those of us who use Skeletor to explain
math games.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:48.300
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:57.100

out some of these puzzles.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.760
Alright.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:33.920
Move one match to make a square.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.270
Uhh.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.620
Um.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.970
SQUARE.
