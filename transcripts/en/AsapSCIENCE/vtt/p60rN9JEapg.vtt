00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Time for school

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.120
And it's no surprise that many of us are determined to study smarter instead of longer

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.780
But which study tips and tricks actually work scientifically, and can help you get those perfect grades

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.340
First step, research shows that study sessions are most effective in small short chunks

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.440
Instead of cramming in a ten hour study session, it's much more effective to spread it out

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.620
into twenty thirty-minutes sessions over a few weeks

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.100
This is because your brain is better at encoding information into the synapses

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.740
in short repeated sessions as opposed to one large one

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.700
And this is why even learning different skills, whether it's swimming, tenis, or a singing lesson

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.280
often follows the same format

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.700
and well, cramming an pulling allnighters may be a ritual, it turns out that this is linked to the lowest grades

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.860
after pro-longed study sessions , reasoning and memoring may be negatively effected for after 4 whole days

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.700
instead, setting up specific times in a day, or during the week, just to study

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.200
primes your brain by creating a routine and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.500
overtime studying actually becomes easier, as your brain is trained to learn in those moments

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.240
and well, many of us spend hours passively rereading our notes or highlighting a textbook

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.480
studies have shown this to be inaffective

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.140
it doesn't improve your understanding of topics. nor does it link key concepts together

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.680
it can even be detrimental, as it draws your attention to less important information

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.640
Flashcards, on the other hand, are proven to be excellent memory reinforcement tools

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.560
Whether, during your schedule study times, or during off times  like a bus ride home

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.660
It also helps to have a specific goal for each study session

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.300
pick one aspect you're focused on

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.800
whether it's balancing chemical equations or learning how to conjugate french birds

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.400
if you can't explain it simply, then you don't understand it well enough

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.500
if students in individual, were asked to learn  a passage

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.580
and then half were told they will be tested on the material

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.200
while the other half were told they would have to teach it to other students

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.400
participants expecting to teach it, did much better on understanding

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.240
when you're expected to teach, your brain organizes  the information in a more logical coherent structure

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.000
of course, practice, practice, practice!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.600
not only do practice tests for your brains in your enviroment

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600
but even if you make mistakes, they help identify gaps in your knowledge

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.780
practice test have also been proofed to increase confidence, then by leading to better performance

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.000
so where should you be studying ?

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.100
research shows that having a designated secret spot for studying , that is well equiped with every tool you might need is best

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.680
just like setting times , this primes your brain for studying

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.640
have an awesome study playlist? not so fast

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.740
well some studies have shown that certain types of classical music can help improve concentration

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.100
our recent studies have shown that learning with rhythmic background noise can be detrimental to focus

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.880
and those not using music , very much better

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.140
and if you haven't already, put away your phone!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.000
it decreases concentration

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.380
of course, exams can be extremely stressful

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.180
so if you want some tips on how to deal with exam anxiety

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.240
check out our ASAP videos which brings down some tips for that

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.980
link is in the descripition

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.280
