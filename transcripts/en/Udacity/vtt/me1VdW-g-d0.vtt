00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.940
Great.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.469
You've installed python.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.680
You're ready to start coding
in your own environment now.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.300
To help you get started we will
be giving you downloadable

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.610
files that we call starter code.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.860
And you can use these to follow
along with the instructors.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.270
When you're done with the lesson,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.500
these files will become
handy reference guides.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.890
As you continue on in the Nanodegree.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.520
At key points in your Nanodegree,
you will see pages just like this one.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.110
Each page will have a link for
a download to starter code for

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.060
the upcoming section.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.140
You can find that link
under downloadables

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410
at the bottom of this classroom.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.540
In this case I'll click on
this file called variables.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.820
And will open in a new tab.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.040
Then I can simply copy and paste this
text into my text editor of choice.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.170
For me that's Sublime.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.650
Now if you're using Sublime and
a lot of other text editors.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.330
You'll notice that
when you first copy and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.760
paste it,
it doesn't format the text correctly.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.280
But if I save my file, in this case
I'll just call it variables.py.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.420
Dot py refers to Python to tell
the computer it's a python file.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.440
Then I can see that sublime
formats the text correctly.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.120
We recommend that you open
these files in a sublime window

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.130
next to your browser,
just like I have here.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.230
And just like how Mike keeps his
documentation open next to his code.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.850
You'll notice that every starter code
file begins with the name of a lesson.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.340
A short summary of
the lesson's concepts,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.070
a link to the first video in the lesson.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.720
And some code that illustrates
the lesson's ideas.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.070
As you continue along in the lesson,
you should add to this file.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.320
However you'd like.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.610
You can add code.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.150
You can add notes.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.960
Just whatever makes sense to you.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.370
Whatever would make a good reference.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.670
Now, let's walk through this next lesson
together to see some best practices for

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.530
using starter code.
