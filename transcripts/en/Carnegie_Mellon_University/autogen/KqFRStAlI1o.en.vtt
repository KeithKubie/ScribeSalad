well in our lab at Carnegie Mellon we're

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240
well in our lab at Carnegie Mellon we're
 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.850
well in our lab at Carnegie Mellon we're
developing technologies that improve

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860
developing technologies that improve
 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.100
developing technologies that improve
mobility especially for people with

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110
mobility especially for people with
 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.980
mobility especially for people with
stroke or amputation we're taking on

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990
stroke or amputation we're taking on
 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.900
stroke or amputation we're taking on
what I think is the singular challenge

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910
what I think is the singular challenge
 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.790
what I think is the singular challenge
in the development of prosthesis and

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800
in the development of prosthesis and
 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.189
in the development of prosthesis and
exoskeletons which is that we don't

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199
exoskeletons which is that we don't
 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.840
exoskeletons which is that we don't
really know what they should do to help

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850
really know what they should do to help
 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.490
really know what they should do to help
the human that's using them we're

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500
the human that's using them we're
 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.529
the human that's using them we're
developing versatile exoskeleton or

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539
developing versatile exoskeleton or
 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.050
developing versatile exoskeleton or
prostheses emulator systems there's a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060
prostheses emulator systems there's a
 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.000
prostheses emulator systems there's a
lightweight device worn on your leg

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010
lightweight device worn on your leg
 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.570
lightweight device worn on your leg
flexible tether and powerful off board

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580
flexible tether and powerful off board
 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.880
flexible tether and powerful off board
motor control hardware this means we can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890
motor control hardware this means we can
 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.039
motor control hardware this means we can
test many ideas for assistance without

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:38.049
test many ideas for assistance without
 

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:40.350
test many ideas for assistance without
overhead of designing a new device there

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360
overhead of designing a new device there
 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.119
overhead of designing a new device there
are millions of people in the world who

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129
are millions of people in the world who
 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.719
are millions of people in the world who
experience reduced mobility and a lack

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729
experience reduced mobility and a lack
 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.430
experience reduced mobility and a lack
of social engagement and inability to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440
of social engagement and inability to
 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.430
of social engagement and inability to
work because of disabilities that affect

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440
work because of disabilities that affect
 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.530
work because of disabilities that affect
the lower limbs and we are trying to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540
the lower limbs and we are trying to
 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.789
the lower limbs and we are trying to
develop technologies that help them get

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:53.799
develop technologies that help them get
 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:54.250
develop technologies that help them get
around better

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260
around better
 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.040
around better
