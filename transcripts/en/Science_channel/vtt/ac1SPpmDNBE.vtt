Narrator:
A LATHE TURNS SPHERICAL SHAPES
OUT OF THE WOOD.

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:12.701
SEVERAL BLADES MOVE IN SEQUENCE
TO FORM THE PIECE.

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:14.567
WHEN A NEW LENGTH
OF WOOD COMES THROUGH,

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:16.434
THE FRONT BLADE MOVES IN.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.400
ONCE IT BACKS AWAY,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.067
ANOTHER SET OF BLADES
SHAPES THE PIECE LATERALLY

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:25.701
BEFORE A CUTTER BLADE
SEPARATES IT FROM THE ROD.

00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:28.100
THE PAINTED PARTS
NOW GO TO A PAD PRINTER.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.701
AN AUTOMATED ARM FEEDS THE
PAINTED PARTS TO THE PRINTER,

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:34.667
WHICH STAMPS EACH PIECE
WITH A NONTOXIC PAINT.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.334
A WORKER USES A TABLE SAW

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.934
TO GROOVE ANOTHER SET
OF PAINTED PARTS.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:42.567
THE CUSTOM-MADE JIG ENSURES THAT
THE CUT IS STRAIGHT AND EVEN

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.634
AND THAT THE BLADE
MAKES ONLY A NARROW

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:46.801
AND SHALLOW GROOVE IN THE WOOD.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.033
THE WORKER PLACES
THE GROOVED PART

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.901
ON A JIG AND BORES A HOLE
INTO THE PIECE WITH A DRILL.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.234
THE MACHINED PIECE
GOES TO ANOTHER PAD PRINTER.

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:03.567
THE PAD PICKS UP PAINT
FROM A TRAY

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:05.834
AND TRANSFERS IT TO THE WOOD.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:08.801
THIS PROCESS, CALLED
TAMPOGRAPHY, ALLOWS THE PRINTER

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.634
TO REPRODUCE A DESIGN
ON AN IRREGULAR SURFACE,

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:14.501
SUCH AS THIS WOOD PIECE.

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:18.033
THE PRINTED PARTS
DRY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.601
AS A LAST PAD PRINTER
PAINTS TWO DOTS ON THE WOOD,

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:26.901
THE FACE OF THE ANIMAL RACER
SLOWLY TAKES SHAPE.

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:30.901
THIS RED-COLORED POWDER
IS PROCESSED RUBBERWOOD SAWDUST

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.434
ENTIRELY RECYCLED
FROM THE MACHINING OPERATIONS.

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:37.734
A WORKER FILLS MOLDS
WITH THE REPROCESSED SAWDUST

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:41.934
AND PREPARES THEM FOR CASTING.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:45.534
THE MACHINE COMPRESSES
THE SAWDUST IN A DIE

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:46.968
AND TURNS IT INTO A SOLID

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:51.234
AND COMPACT MATERIAL
CALLED PLANWOOD.

00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:53.734
A WORKER STARTS ASSEMBLING
THE PLANWOOD PIECES

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.701
TO FORM THE BODY OF THE RACERS.

00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:57.968
SHE APPLIES A THIN COAT

00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:00.801
OF NONTOXIC,
FORMALDEHYDE-FREE GLUE

00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:05.267
AND PRESSES TWO CORRESPONDING
PLANWOOD PIECES TOGETHER.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.834
SHE REMOVES THE EXCESS GLUE
WITH HER FINGER

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:09.334
BEFORE SHE HAMMERS A DOWEL

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:13.267
INTO THE ASSEMBLED
PLANWOOD BODY.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:14.968
TO FINISH THE HEAD
OF THE RACER,

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.300
SHE INSERTS A FELT PIECE
INTO THE GROOVE

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.501
MACHINED ON TOP
AND PRESSES THE HEAD

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:24.200
INTO THE RACER'S BODY
USING A PNEUMATIC PRESS.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.334
THE WORKER THEN DRIVES THE AXLES

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:32.968
THROUGH HOLES
IN THE PLANWOOD ASSEMBLY.

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:35.601
SHE TAKES PAINTED
AND PAD-PRINTED WHEELS

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.000
AND APPLIES A DROP
OF FAST-HARDENING GLUE

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.834
INSIDE EACH WHEEL HUB.

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:46.934
SHE THEN HAMMERS THE WHEELS
INTO THE AXLES

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.534
AND TAKES THE ASSEMBLED TOY

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.667
TO A CUSTOMIZED MACHINE DESIGNED

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.434
TO PRESS THE WHEELS
FIRMLY INTO THE AXLES.

00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:59.133
THIS FINISHED CHICKEN RACER
IS ONE OF A WIDE VARIETY

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:00.467
OF RUBBERWOOD TOYS

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:03.367
MANUFACTURED WITH
ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY PROCESSES

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:05.300
AND MATERIALS.
