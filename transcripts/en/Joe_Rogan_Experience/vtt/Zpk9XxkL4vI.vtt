WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.550
There we go.
Now it's,
now we're on ladies and gentlemen,
we're sort of on time.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.490
We try to get it right every week,
but every week we fucked something up.

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.460
And this week I made sure that I turned off the sound on my computer.

4
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.120
The one over there,
I haven't even turned off the sound on this one yet.
So

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.400
you got my mind.
He didn't do yours.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.510
It could have easily been me that just fucked up,
which is,

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.960
that's the reason why I fucked up.

8
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.530
It's cause cause I'm here cause I always fuck it up.
I fuck it up.

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:31.110
Every week we'd done this Goddamn thing like 22 weeks in a row.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
I fuck it up every single time.
This week it was Brian,

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.540
you know,
uh,
I've been thinking about this podcast a lot,
ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.080
and a,
one of the things I've been thinking about is I appreciate the fuck out of

13
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:45.410
everybody listening.
And uh,
we,

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.650
we do try our best to make this as interesting as possible and as smooth and

15
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:50.640
professional as possible.

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.280
But I got to admit that I've been too stressed out about this.

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.480
I've been taking it too seriously.
I mean,
uh,
taking it seriously in a good way.

18
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.990
Whereas we improve the sound.
We've got a real mixer and we got to,
I mean,

19
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:04.530
we're sitting on couches and shit and we're going to get better cameras,

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.670
but that like,
it's not like there's a part of it that's really fun,

21
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.280
but there's a part of it that wasn't fun and I don't think that should exist.

22
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:13.740
I don't think I should ever get too serious about this.

23
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.560
This is for people who are working,

24
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.040
who are being distracted that just wants something because they're doing

25
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.850
mindless shit.
This is for people that are driving in their cars and you know,

26
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.520
want something to listen to.
This is for people on the train.

27
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.400
This is for people at the gym.
Whatever the fuck it's for you guys.
All right.

28
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.020
And if,
if we take it too seriously,
you stop being yourself and it starts,

29
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:37.680
starts being like this professional thing that you're trying real hard to do.

30
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.400
And uh,
I think,
uh,
I think I've fallen prey to that a little bit.

31
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.140
I was thinking about it today.
Have to,

32
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:46.950
it took a little bit of a hit a weed and I was thinking about it and I was like,

33
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.530
you know what man,
this thing,
like I'm,
I'm like,

34
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.580
I paid too much attention to it and she'd just be a weekly fun thing like it or

35
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:56.970
not,
you know,
for,

36
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.360
for anybody who's like minded or anybody who's interested in some sort of a

37
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:03.460
distraction from someone who's not likeminded.
Well knowing you jail,

38
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.170
you do that a lot on a lot of things.
Every kid fucking freak.

39
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:10.800
I got problems pull.
Yeah.
Listen,
this is my number one,

40
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.780
my number one problem in life.
It's like I try very hard to,
to uh,

41
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.660
advance as a human being.
I try to evolve.

42
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.690
I tried to fix whatever issues that I have with myself,

43
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.180
whatever errors that I've made in my life.

44
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.070
I tried to never make them more than once.
You know,

45
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:28.660
I try to constantly be moving,
but if I have a,

46
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.290
an ongoing theme with problems in my life,

47
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.540
the number one thing is with obsessions.

48
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.020
I get obsessed with shit to the point where,
um,

49
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.530
like especially games,
but it doesn't have to be games.

50
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:42.780
It could be we talked about this could be beating off,
it could be,

51
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:45.380
it could be fucking anything.
I just get,
uh,
my,

52
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.290
my head gets super focused on things and it's good in some ways because it

53
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.980
allows you to like put a lot of energy into things and work really hard at

54
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:55.080
things and that can allow you to become successful.
I mean,

55
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:58.440
that's the reason why I got successful with martial arts,
with comedy,

56
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.980
with anything because,
because I became

57
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.140
<v 1>obsessed with it.
But um,</v>

58
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.530
it's good if you're like a mindless person,

59
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.570
it's good to force you to doing something.

60
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.860
You're not even sure why you're doing it.

61
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:10.660
You're just doing it and you're getting good at it.
You know,

62
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.530
you're getting this reward,

63
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:14.500
but you're not really contemplating whether or not you're putting too much

64
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.770
energy and effort into one certain thing.
You know,

65
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.190
you know what I'm talking about.
It becomes like,

66
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.250
it doesn't become like a conscious thing.
It becomes like a,

67
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.910
like this is a positive thing.
I'm,
I'm doing this,
I'm moving in this direction.

68
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.840
It becomes an obsession and it becomes,
you just just have this need.

69
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:33.040
Like with video games,
I had it,
I had a really bad with quake,
really bad with,

70
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.180
I would play eight 10 hours a day and I would be talking to someone and if they

71
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.880
said a fucking single thing that was boring,
I'd be like,

72
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:41.860
why am I even talking to you when I could be playing quake?

73
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.050
That's what I'd be thinking like you,
you know,

74
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.730
I'd be like hanging out with my check.
I'd be,

75
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.970
we'd be having a conversation about something and I would be like nodding my

76
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:50.560
head and I'm thinking,

77
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.200
how much more time do I have to talk to her before I could sneak away and go

78
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:53.840
play quick

79
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.670
<v 2>when the first times I met you online,</v>

80
00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:58.100
we used to play quake and there was one time in particular we've,

81
00:03:58.101 --> 00:04:00.320
I don't know if we've talked about this,
where we played,

82
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.160
I think you killed me 120 times in a row.

83
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.830
I hadn't killed you once and you kept on going and I was like,
ah,
I want to stop.

84
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.130
And you're like,
no,
we're not.
Come on.
It was,
by the way,

85
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.300
I'm obsessing about the fleshlight.
We should say this.
That means we have to,

86
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.300
we have to thank our sponsor.
We have a sponsor.
I was,

87
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:25.280
we're sponsored by the fleshlight fleshlight.com and if you go to Joe Rogan's

88
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:27.860
website and click on his banner on the right side,
you get 15

89
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.810
<v 1>person on.
This is how we say it.
If you beat off,
and I know you do.
Okay.</v>

90
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.100
This is a product that makes beating off way better.
It's really that simple.

91
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.701
You know,

92
00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:42.560
there's a lot of emotional and psychological shit attached to buying a fake

93
00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:45.020
pussy that you're actually gonna stick your Dick in.
It's like a,

94
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:46.250
not a very manly thing.

95
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.430
What did you think about money that you spend on and you tell everybody about

96
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:51.540
like a new loofa sponge?
Dude,
I got this fucking sponge.

97
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.690
It's on the stickers to shit.
Fucking get in the good old,
you know?

98
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.230
I mean people like get all,

99
00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:00.560
like you could talk about pleasurable things as long as it doesn't involve you

100
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.680
doing

101
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.360
<v 2>dick,
that shit changes your life too.</v>

102
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.680
Like I tried to masturbate with my hand cause I was too lazy to bend over and

103
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:10.340
get the reach and get the fleshlight that was on the key thing behind me and I

104
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:12.140
tried to masturbate with my hand and like halfway through I was like,

105
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.800
this is stupid.
I need to go get my flashlight really is good.
Yeah.

106
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.470
It's because first of all,
you can

107
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.980
<v 1>enjoy it fully because no matter how much it feels good to be rubbing on your</v>

108
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:25.700
deck,
that's only half of your brain.
The other half of your brain is going,

109
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:27.290
oh my God,
I have a Dick in my hand.

110
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.800
There's a certain amount of your brain that like knows like you're jerking off a

111
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:37.250
deck.
Even if it's your own Dick.
Even if feels good,
there's still a,
there's,

112
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.330
there's some torment there.
You know,
there's uh,
some,
some conflict.

113
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.750
<v 2>I got it.
I got to show you something,
judge.</v>

114
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:44.370
Something happened to me the other day when I was using it.

115
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:47.580
And I need to warn anybody that has a fleshlight not to do this.

116
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.450
This is not your used one.
Right.
All right.
So like when you pull,

117
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.650
when you pull it out the quake,
you just like pull a fish out of a bucket.

118
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.470
It's crazy.
So anyways,
when you,
when you go to clean it,
I,
the end of it,

119
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.050
when you don't have this little metal thing or the plastic thing in here,

120
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.010
I'll hold up to the camera.
There's like a hole that you attached to your um,

121
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.250
faucet.
Now I've been like attaching it to my faucet,
you know,

122
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.220
the water goes through it and blows out the fuck hole by,

123
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.240
I've been like holding it like a,
uh,
uh,
a hose at the end of it.

124
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.600
So it fills up with water and shoots to come out real fast.
Kind of like,

125
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:22.450
you know,
well,

126
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.360
the problem is I was so stoned when I did it that held it and I was facing

127
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:31.180
myself in,
it's all over my face.
No,
swear to God.
No,

128
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.520
I don't know.
I don't know if the come had already popped out because I,
you know,

129
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.520
I didn't do it right when it did.
You shut your own load,
your mugs.

130
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:41.150
So watch out fleshlight owners if you clean it that way you don't aim for the

131
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.610
face.
How do you stuffed it back in and he just forced it back in.

132
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:44.060
There's been there,

133
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.890
I don't even know if I'm doing it right cause I don't read the directions to

134
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.020
anything.
But I think you just probably the directions to shit.
Isn't that weird?

135
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.230
Was the last time you read directions to anything?
Honestly,

136
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:52.970
I don't remember the last time I read it

137
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.520
<v 0>and for my kids it has to be something where it's not involving me and there's</v>

138
00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:59.980
like danger and I have to make sure everything's set up okay.

139
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.370
I put together a crib recently and I had,
I looked at all the directions.

140
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:06.640
It was kind of complicated.
It was really tricky.
It took like an hour,
you know,

141
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.820
maybe cause I'm a moron,
but it did take an hour,
you know,

142
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.870
back when I was doing construction back in the day I could adopt.

143
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.350
Got done about 50 minutes.
55.
Right.
Um,
but uh,
yeah,

144
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:19.030
I don't look at the directions.
That shit.

145
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.230
<v 2>Yeah,
it's easy.
It's like a challenge.
It's like a Rubik's cube to me.</v>

146
00:07:22.231 --> 00:07:23.640
Like I need to figure everything out myself.

147
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.040
<v 0>Well also one of the things that I love,
I'm in a,</v>

148
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.250
I hate to be a a guy was a windows or a Mac guy.
You know,

149
00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:30.600
cause I think it's a stupid argument.

150
00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:32.630
But if you don't have fucking computer at all,

151
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.220
I've never had a computer and you're a reasonably intelligent person.

152
00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:38.430
You can navigate your way around a Mac,
you know?
You know what I'm saying?

153
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.580
Like someone goes like this,
see this,
this is where the mouse is,
this,

154
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:45.240
this track thing.
And if you go down here,
see that's called a finder.

155
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.940
When you click on that,
see everything opens and there's all right there.

156
00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:49.830
Whatever you want.
What do you need?
Do you need a movie?

157
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:52.650
Do you need to your email,
you know,
do what?
What do,
what do you need?

158
00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:53.484
It's all right there.

159
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.270
I don't like things that are too complicated that are overly pain in the ass.

160
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:00.470
Complicated like this fucking MP,
three player that things a little complicated,

161
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.170
complicated this.
There's shit that we buy like this ms mixer.

162
00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:05.850
What the fuck is all going on in there?

163
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.270
<v 2>I'm so glad that I have a brain though that that wants to figure things out.</v>

164
00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:11.670
So to me like I have,
it's like a challenge.

165
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.320
So luckily I hope that never stops though because I don't want to be like,

166
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.890
you know one of those people that just after a certain age they give up on a

167
00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:23.570
computers or they give up on the cell phones and VCRs,
people

168
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.530
<v 0>that I've ever met.</v>

169
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:29.531
You are the number one best at figuring out like computer type shit and figuring

170
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:34.460
out like software shit and like you got a weird mind for it dude.

171
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.910
Like someone can give you a cell phone,
like a new cell phone.
You're like,
oh gee.

172
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:38.721
Even know that you could do this.

173
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:40.380
You can get ringtone sent to your house and then could,

174
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.130
you can call somebody with this and it's fine.
You can eat it immediately.

175
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:43.970
As soon as you get up in the morning,

176
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:46.520
it'll go to an internet connection and it'll show you what your emails for the

177
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.170
day.
Like you just press this part right here.
If people like,

178
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:50.030
what the fuck are you talking about?
And even know it did that.

179
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.470
Like you find like weird shit on phones,
that weird things that they can do.
Like,

180
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.870
you know,
there's,
there's a certain part of your brain,
man that uh,

181
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.400
it just goes right to like weird fucking like secret shit.

182
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.510
<v 3>Yeah.
The problem with that though,</v>

183
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.270
everything's so fucking complicated that when something goes wrong at my

184
00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:11.530
household,
it's like fucking nuclear war.
I mean,
it's,
it's like,
okay,

185
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:12.730
the movie stopped streaming.

186
00:09:12.731 --> 00:09:14.890
I gotta go to the computer in the living room that's broadcasting into my

187
00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:17.710
slingbox that's now,
but going over my wifi connection.
All right.
So you know,

188
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.530
it's like that.
It's not just like,
oh no,

189
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.910
just hit the power button on and off and blow into it.
Yeah.

190
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.810
<v 0>Yeah.
When I was at your place here the day just being in your office,
it's like,</v>

191
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.440
dude,
what are you doing?
You controlling some fucking,
you know,
some,

192
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:31.620
some hidden cameras somewhere am operating an empire.

193
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.520
It's like there's so much electronic shit in your,
your office,
if you were like,

194
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.890
like,
it's like a scene in the matrix,
you know,

195
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:40.710
you go into the dude's dusty basement and he's got these fucking computers,

196
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:45.530
Rick debates have,
you've got like all sorts of them,
all kinds of nutty shit.
You,

197
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.480
you're the only one that I know that's even thought about getting a fucking

198
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.790
three D TV.
You have a three d TV man

199
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.790
<v 3>bedroom.
That's a weird thing.
You know what's crazy though,
is that uh,</v>

200
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.340
this person I know,
unfortunately their house burned down a,

201
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.620
their alarm clock caught on fire and shorty,

202
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.860
<v 0>I've heard of that happening more than once.
Right.</v>

203
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.200
<v 3>And W W scares the fuck out of me that an alarm clock did that.</v>

204
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.950
But then you go into my office and there was more wires and fucking shit

205
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.820
everywhere and dust balls in freeing me up.
You know,
it's crazy.

206
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.520
<v 0>Yeah,
it is.
Electricity.
It just as itself is fucking crazy.</v>

207
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.680
I mean we don't think about it because we have it,

208
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.520
but if electricity didn't exist and someone all of a sudden came along with an

209
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.390
infinite source of energy,
not infinite,
but like infinitely powerful,

210
00:10:28.391 --> 00:10:31.750
like you can fucking power fucking cities.
Okay.
And you,

211
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.100
it's running through your house all the time and you just stick something and

212
00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:40.450
it's got a little tiny piece of plastics that's protecting you from sure death

213
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.870
and there's just two metal prongs and you're going to insert them into the

214
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:45.040
fucking source.

215
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.810
And this source is plugged into a grid that powers the whole Goddamn fucking

216
00:10:49.811 --> 00:10:54.000
city.
It's that powerful and it's all running through there and you just,

217
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.400
you just plug into it and you're constantly attached to it.

218
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.520
You'll leave the lights on all night,
you fucking don't even think about it.

219
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.750
You go to sleep with the TV on and there's just this fucking mad about of energy

220
00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:06.280
surging through your house.

221
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.300
<v 3>Do you remember a lector sets?
Is that what they're called?
Where they were like,</v>

222
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.450
yeah.
I don't know.
When you're a kid you could like build like robots,
you know,

223
00:11:13.451 --> 00:11:15.530
they had like batteries and stuff like that and it was,

224
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.820
it was like Lincoln logs but with like kind of remember this,

225
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.430
I think that's what it was called,
but there was a,
uh,

226
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.340
I had a wire when I think it was like four years old,

227
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.720
had a wire and I had this bright idea to take the wire I want what my idea was,

228
00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:32.260
I wanted to take electricity from the top outlet and move it to the bottom

229
00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:32.860
outlet.

230
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.600
So I put a wire in the top outlet and a water in the bottom outlet and it blew

231
00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:41.260
up like sparks and I flew across the room and I'm like,

232
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.870
that is amazing that that shit happened can happen so easily.
Like to,

233
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.060
that shit is so scary.
Yeah.
You have kids.

234
00:11:49.061 --> 00:11:50.650
Do you have all that shit on all your outlets?

235
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.000
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And a little clips that go with outlets.
Yeah.
Most of</v>

236
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.550
<v 1>them right there.
No,
she comes into my office when I'm not here.</v>

237
00:11:56.551 --> 00:11:58.860
She can start pulling on shit.
Yeah,
it's scary.

238
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.100
You know when you have little kids too,
it's like they don't know.

239
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.490
Like you can't just tell them something to go,
hey stupid,
why didn't you listen?

240
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.410
Like they don't know that they have to listen.

241
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.690
They don't understand that there's consequences.

242
00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:12.600
You know when you have a two year old you have to like there's,
there's,

243
00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:14.040
you can never be upset at them.

244
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.210
You always have to just be correcting them and then giving them like a affection

245
00:12:18.211 --> 00:12:21.060
and positive energy.
Like when they do something wrong,
you got to say no,

246
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:23.550
you shouldn't do that.
Should always be nice.

247
00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:26.280
She could be nice if you're nice and everybody's happy,

248
00:12:26.281 --> 00:12:29.580
but if you're not nice and people get sad,
right?
So why should we be nice?

249
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.870
Cause you know what?
Make everybody sad.
Yes.
And you give him a hug.

250
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.260
It's like you can,
you develop a human being.
You can't be upset at them.

251
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.350
But if they're fucking adults,
you know,
you're like,
hey stupid,

252
00:12:40.351 --> 00:12:44.100
don't stick your fucking fork in the thing.
You'll die.
But you're sure,

253
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.490
go ahead dickhead.
You want to stick your fork in there?
Go ahead.
You know?

254
00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:49.170
But with babies,
man,
you,

255
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.200
you have like a little you that you love as much if not more than yourself and

256
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.440
you,
they don't know anything,

257
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.440
so you have to make sure they don't run down a flight of stairs.

258
00:12:58.441 --> 00:13:00.990
They fall all the time.
You have to be real careful,

259
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.770
but they have enough energy to talk to you but they don't understand yet.

260
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.110
<v 4>But then why are some babies completely like,</v>

261
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.920
did you see that video of a baby smoking two packs of cigarettes at j two year

262
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:14.010
old baby?
So many people were trying to tell me that that was fake.
It was,

263
00:13:14.011 --> 00:13:18.960
it was so disturbing that I put it up on Twitter and I got hundreds of fucking

264
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:22.080
people on Facebook.
People did it on the message board.
People did.

265
00:13:22.081 --> 00:13:24.390
A bunch of people were saying that it's fake.
How is it fake?

266
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.770
It's not fake CTI on a carrot,
but like dues were angry.

267
00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:30.360
One guy was like,
you know on Twitter was like,

268
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:33.900
don't fucking post up that dump fake shit.
Don't support trolls.
I'm like,
dude,

269
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.990
that's a baby smoking cigarettes.
This shit is real.

270
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.870
This really is a fucking two year old.
It's funny because I,

271
00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:44.871
on my website I had used to collect baby videos and photos and videos of babies

272
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:46.950
smoking cigarettes cause it's just a ridiculous,

273
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.030
and now it's like that's a common,
it's really common.

274
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.690
Overseas babies will have cigarettes overseas.

275
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.800
<v 1>How crazy is that?</v>

276
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.880
That you can take a little tiny little baby that you love and you're,

277
00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:01.490
you're teaching at the world and you let it smoke a cigarette

278
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.710
<v 4>and if they're so good at it too,
like I was watching that video and I'm like,</v>

279
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:08.290
man,
that baby was better than smoking cigarettes than I was.

280
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.960
I mean he was just like flipping it around.
He was acting cool with it.

281
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.431
<v 1>Two packs a day.</v>

282
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:16.350
Every day they say the baby doesn't have any energy to play with his friends and

283
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.060
if you don't give the baby cigarettes,
he goes fucking crazy.

284
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.360
He goes crazy and starts screaming.
That's so crazy.

285
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:26.530
That's the problem with human beings,
man,
is that there's,
there's,

286
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:31.330
there's a broad spectrum of us and the broad spectrum is necessary in order to

287
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:33.370
have this sort of a complex society.

288
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.850
Until we invent robots that are going to do shitty jobs,

289
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.480
we're going to need monkeys.
We're going to need dumb fucking people.

290
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.290
We're going to need idiots.
You know,
that's a terrible way to look at the world.

291
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:47.230
And it doesn't necessarily mean that anybody born into the idiot family has to

292
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:48.064
be an idiot.

293
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.230
That doesn't necessarily mean that the idiots can't like snap out of it if

294
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:55.310
somehow they do mushrooms or take a yoga class or try to look at their life in a

295
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.200
different way.
But for many people,

296
00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:01.040
the reason why they're idiots is not necessarily that their brain doesn't work

297
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:03.620
that well.
So they got in a terrible pattern,

298
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:08.830
like really early in life and they have become a dumb fuck and they're stuck and

299
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:10.820
they're,
they live with a bunch of other dumped fox,

300
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.090
so they get all this negative energy all the time.

301
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.270
They're constantly dealing with conflicts at home that are meaningless but

302
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.410
distract them from from getting good at anything in life or from getting your

303
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:24.680
own personal shit together because all your energy is being diverted towards

304
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:28.130
conflicts like that's why it's so important to not have negative people in your

305
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:32.540
life because if you're trying to evolve and I think I know you are and I am and

306
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.510
all of our friends are,
everyone's trying to improve as a person,

307
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:38.480
it's very difficult to fucking figure out how to be a person.

308
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.840
It's very difficult to figure out how to manage your energy and they know when

309
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:46.490
you're wrong and know when you're being upset for no reason.
It's a tricky thing,

310
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.620
you know,
and you,

311
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.560
one of the most important things about it is you need to pay attention.

312
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.380
You need to have time to,
to think about your own,

313
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.000
your own interactions with other people,
to think about like the way you behave,

314
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.350
to think about the way you think,

315
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:03.260
to think about like the direction that you're moving in the,
in the world.

316
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.400
It takes a long time.

317
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.930
It takes a lot of energy and if your energy is being spent constantly dealing

318
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:09.860
with bullshit,

319
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.330
constantly dealing with fucking stupid fights that are over nothing with your

320
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:18.740
girlfriend or with a buddy who's a shithead and always apologizes.

321
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:20.660
But then as a shithead again,
you know,

322
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:23.780
if you ever have a friend like that that does like shitty things to,
you know,

323
00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:24.020
like,

324
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.280
like fuck's this guy's ex girlfriend or something and does it in some sort of a

325
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:30.890
creepy way and doesn't tell them or you know,

326
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.610
fucking steal some of your shit and doesn't bring it back or you'll lend them

327
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:35.770
money and he doesn't pay you back.
Yeah,

328
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:39.890
let's just do shit that sort of piles on like as soon as something like that

329
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:41.840
happens in a relationship with a friend,

330
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.860
like you automatically start paying too much attention to it.

331
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.020
It automatically becomes like,
okay,

332
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:51.740
now this isn't an enhancing relationship anymore.
This isn't,
you know,

333
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:54.890
I hang around with you and we have a great time.
You know,
you,
you say funny shit.

334
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:55.700
I laugh.

335
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.250
I think about things differently cause I think about it from your point of view.

336
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.720
You think about things from my point of view,

337
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:02.900
because we're totally different human beings.
It's an enhancing experience.

338
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.860
But when you have shitheads in your life and people that aren't thinking about

339
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.960
evolving and people that aren't they,
they're not,

340
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:12.320
they haven't subscribed to the right,
the,
the,
the right energy.

341
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:14.960
They haven't subscribed to the right direction in their life.
So they're,

342
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.540
they're not,
they're not,
they don't have their shit together.

343
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.540
So you're constantly like dealing with conflict when you're around them.

344
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.690
When you do that and you put yourself in those sorts of situations,

345
00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.570
you will fuck yourself.
You those,
that,

346
00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:29.840
that is an energy vampire.

347
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.040
And there's so many people that get locked into relationships and friendships

348
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.930
and work situations.
I mean,

349
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:39.830
how many people just fucking hate the people they work with because you're with

350
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.830
the people you work with even more than you're with your spouse.
You know,

351
00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:44.900
most people,
you get home at night,
it's six o'clock.

352
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.990
How long are you going to be awake?

353
00:17:45.991 --> 00:17:47.300
You're going to be away for another four hours.

354
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:50.340
You're going to go to sleep at 10 probably you're going to crash.

355
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:52.650
You gotta be at work in the morning,
you know,
you've got your fucking tired.

356
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.110
So if you think about it,
how much time you're spending with your spouse,

357
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.990
your spouse,
and your kids,
you know,
between commuting and all that shit.

358
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.840
It's like you're dealing with like three hours a night,
but you're working,

359
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:04.080
you're dealing with people eight hours a day working for the weekends.

360
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:06.660
And you know,
that song was a real man,
their song in Israel.

361
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.200
So I was working nine to five.
Yeah,
I watched that movie the other day.

362
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.050
There's two songs about working.
That's great.

363
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.050
Dolly Parton always seem to me to be this kind of sexy chick put that if you

364
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:23.090
fucked her,
you wouldn't be happy with it.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
You don't,

365
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:26.410
I'm talking about like,
even back then was,
she was undeniably hot,
you know,

366
00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:29.180
and the nine to five days that are big titties and her blonde hair and that's

367
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.620
Texas accent.
Dude's love Dolly Parton.

368
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:34.470
It's one of the reasons why she was in all these movies.
She was so attractive.

369
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.240
You know,
her whole persona.

370
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.340
But it just seems to me that she's one of those checks.

371
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.600
You fuck her and then the,

372
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.150
the mystery is gone and then you find out what's really going on behind the

373
00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:45.390
scenes and you get all sad.
A couple of days later you walk in your bedroom,

374
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:47.370
it's humidity and perfume.

375
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.180
Old perfumed smelled like Avon was in there and somebody had an assistant.

376
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.040
I do not like perfume,
dude.
I hate perfume.
I hate perfume and makeup.
I mean,

377
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.590
I don't mind a teeny bit of makeup on a girl,

378
00:18:58.591 --> 00:19:02.640
but when girls are all dolled out to me,
that just creeps me out.

379
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.700
There's something weird about it for sure,
especially if they need to do it.

380
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:09.510
When you leave the house,
you know,
it's like,
you know,
like you need to,
you can't,

381
00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:11.730
you can't go out until you put your face on.
That's like a,

382
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:12.930
that's a creepy thing man.

383
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.460
The worst is when their lips are sticky because of lip gloss or lipstick and you

384
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:22.461
kiss them and sticks to the weird thing that we just accept the fact that people

385
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:25.920
put stuff on their face to change the color of their face.

386
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.530
I mean it's not a bizarre fucking thing.

387
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.540
I mean we know that human beings are attracted to certain things and so they

388
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:37.320
figured out how to make someone more attractive.
You know,

389
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:40.350
like when they figured out how to put makeup around the eyes to make you center

390
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:42.700
on the eyes,
you know like smokey and low.

391
00:19:42.701 --> 00:19:47.220
She's mysterious cries or smoky.
Like what does that supposed to represent?

392
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:48.630
I never understood the smoky color.

393
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.840
Like if you're going to get crazy and pretend that the top of your eyes are
blue.

394
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.440
Okay.
I've dealt with,
I was at the Improv last night.

395
00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.270
Mexican girl came up and she had like blue huge things and was just like,

396
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:03.450
what are at,
it's like almost like you're a bit trying to be a superhero or,

397
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.330
yeah,
there's a weird thing,
man.
It's a weird thing.

398
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.250
I know Chris Rock had a really funny joke about that about women are untruthful

399
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:17.640
just by being there and she's like,
that's easy.
It was really wearing makeup.

400
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:20.490
That's not what your face looks like.
Why are you wearing those heels?

401
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:25.260
You ain't that tall.
I mean really it is.
It is so true.

402
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:29.780
It's a strange thing and the,
the biggest strange one to me is the fake tit.
Yeah,

403
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.690
fake tit is the weirdest thing ever because it works.
I know it works with me.

404
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.670
It makes me excited.
But meanwhile,
what is it?
It's a fucking bag of water.

405
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.480
It's based in a chicks chest,

406
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.300
but it's not even boobs are real boob Ma is much sexier because you're grabbing

407
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:49.810
a gland,
like you feel like the woman's like there's,
it's a sexual organ.

408
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.630
Like if,
if,
if a girl has like big real tits,

409
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:56.500
even if she has small real tits and they're sensitive,
like when you grab them,

410
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:58.330
they get excited.
Like you feel like you're,

411
00:20:58.331 --> 00:20:59.740
it's like you're grabbing their pussy.

412
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.730
It's like you're grabbing a sexual affectionate part of their body.

413
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.570
A part that's very sensitive,
but when you grab a bag of water,
man,

414
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:08.620
that's just trippy,

415
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.590
<v 2>right?
Well,
you know,
I,
I've only touched like a fake boob like once or twice,</v>

416
00:21:13.591 --> 00:21:17.460
you know,
luckily I've only dated girls with real boobs.
You've been very lucky.

417
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.730
But the thing is,
even if they're failing,

418
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.660
<v 1>it's still attractive.
You know,
that's the nuttiest thing about human beings.</v>

419
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:25.590
Just like we know that the eye makeup is eye makeup.

420
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.230
We know you don't really have avatar eyes right at the top of your eyes aren't

421
00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:33.460
fucking blue.
Right?
But,
but somehow or another,
it's attractive.
You know,

422
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:36.460
that bright red lipstick that you have on somehow or another that's attractive.

423
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.490
The fact that I know those aren't even really your eyelashes.
I don't care.

424
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.600
It's attractive.

425
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.970
<v 2>Why they shouldn't be boobs on their face.
And then instead of makeup,
you know,</v>

426
00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:46.850
like lipstick,
just draw boobs and make it look like your cheeks are boom,

427
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.210
<v 1>will you silly goose what they're trying to look,</v>

428
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:51.670
they don't want to look like a freak.
Anything.
It's like the,

429
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.680
there's like there's a evolutionary line between something that stands out and

430
00:21:57.491 --> 00:21:58.630
something that has like,

431
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.920
there's certain things that obviously genetically we look for.
We look for eyes,

432
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.490
we look for like the connection,
the energy inside someone's eyes.

433
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.180
And that's why people who have a wonky eye or something like that or a trip to

434
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:12.500
look at,
it's cause you know,
you're always going to,

435
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.570
there's in the back of your head,

436
00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:16.650
you're always gonna think the part of the conversation is going to be this.

437
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.280
There's a wonky eye,
you know,
try not to freak out,
try not to,

438
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.000
you know,

439
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.260
ask questions wit to which one to look at and try not to switch eyes and look at

440
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:30.760
the left one,
the right one.
Just focus on one.
Right.
And stick with it.
There's,

441
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:32.950
there's something evolutionary about that.

442
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.880
And when you add shit like a tit to a face,
like that's not cool anymore.

443
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.050
Now cause now you're,
you have something that's in the wrong place and you want,

444
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.210
everything has to be,
I know I'm being serious,

445
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.260
I'm just saying that everything has to be in the right order.
You know,

446
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.640
you can't have three hot eyes,
you know,
and for girls,
really sexy smokey eyes.

447
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:52.500
She can't have one of your

448
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.610
<v 2>fucking for what though?</v>

449
00:22:53.611 --> 00:22:57.810
That seemed from what total recall with the third boob chick that was still hot

450
00:22:57.811 --> 00:23:02.100
to me.
Really?
Yeah.
I think I masturbated about that when I was younger.
Wow.

451
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.143
You didn't think that was hot?

452
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.490
<v 1>No.
My instincts are like,
oh,
okay.</v>

453
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.930
<v 2>But when you see a cat that's already had babies,</v>

454
00:23:08.931 --> 00:23:11.260
you know how they're in their nipples are hanging after the babies.

455
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.430
That's still hotter to me then not having those nipples.

456
00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:18.380
Then you know there's fake three tip porn on the Internet to Dick Porn Porn.

457
00:23:18.381 --> 00:23:21.050
Yeah,
there is.
I've seen it before.
There's fake Dick porn too.

458
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.580
There's tentacle porn,
my favorite.

459
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.910
<v 1>There's one where there's this black dude who is always,</v>

460
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.400
he always keeps his pants on it.
That's how he know he's got a fake Dick.

461
00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:31.730
He's got like some sort of a strap on thing and he pulls his dick out of his

462
00:23:31.731 --> 00:23:35.560
pants and it's ridiculous.
It's literally like as long as your arm.
Oh yeah.

463
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.900
It's ridiculous.
And the girls were like,
oh my God,
they start sucking on it.

464
00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.550
But rubber,
Dick's looked so good today.
It's hard to tell that it's rubber deck,

465
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.530
you know?
So he like fucks all these girls with his giant and

466
00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.280
<v 3>yeah,
it's weird because when I used to first see those videos,</v>

467
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.690
I never thought it was fake.

468
00:23:49.691 --> 00:23:52.540
I just thought that black guys had core sticks and I was like,
wow,

469
00:23:52.541 --> 00:23:53.830
that guy has some crazy horse stick.

470
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.230
But then you start noticing like the fucking,

471
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.060
they're always holding it down by the base to make it,
you know?
So you know,

472
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.460
well let me ask you this.

473
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.380
<v 1>Here's a hypothetical.</v>

474
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:07.150
Say you were dating a girl and she decided she was going to start doing girl on

475
00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:10.590
girl a porno films.
Okay.
You know,
you'd be like,
all right,
that's cool.

476
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.920
Just checks.
It wouldn't bother me at all.
Right,
right.

477
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.030
But how would you feel about a dude fucking or with a fake dick

478
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.630
<v 3>if they're dudes in the room?
That's what would bother me.
Right.</v>

479
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.870
You know what I mean?
Snaking not as fake rubber debt.

480
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.980
Even if there's a guy camera,
man,
that doesn't bother me.

481
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:27.590
But the guy in sexual poses,
the guys like

482
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.210
<v 1>buddy and like they're married to other people and it's all just for work.</v>

483
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.550
You don't have to worry about it.
It's all you fucking her with his real dick.

484
00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:34.384
He wouldn't do that

485
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.150
<v 3>Spec for his wife.
He used to just big fat black Dick.</v>

486
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.870
Yeah,
that's still different to me.
I don't know.

487
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.460
Maybe they grew up together and then they're like,
totally like

488
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.690
<v 1>brothers and sisters,
man.
Then they're not even,</v>

489
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.230
they don't even think about each other sexually.
It's disgusting.
Okay.

490
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:53.170
But you know they have mouths to feed.
Okay.

491
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.680
Why are you asking me the guy with the fake rubber Dick as a family?
Okay.

492
00:24:56.681 --> 00:24:57.940
Why don't you think about him,
Brian.

493
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.300
We've got with the fake rubber Dick needs to feed his children.
Okay.

494
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.250
Now why am I bringing this up?
Yeah.
I don't know,
man,

495
00:25:06.251 --> 00:25:10.690
because I'm a fascinated by fake tit porn.
Fake that you know,
there's only,

496
00:25:10.691 --> 00:25:13.240
you know,
there was a Guy Max hardcore.
Do you know who that Guy Max?

497
00:25:13.241 --> 00:25:15.880
So of course I do.
You know that guy's in jail,
right?
Yes.

498
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.560
He's the only God that I can think of in recent memory that has not just been

499
00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:23.950
arrested for pornography,
but tried for,
um,

500
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.990
for obscenity and convicted in 2009,
you know,

501
00:25:28.991 --> 00:25:32.080
and he's in jail.
And um,
when I first heard about it,

502
00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:34.240
it was really disturbing because I was like,
Whoa,
okay,

503
00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:37.570
this guy is just making pornography like what he's doing,

504
00:25:37.571 --> 00:25:41.110
like extra dirty pornography.
What is he doing?
What the fuck would he be doing?

505
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:43.810
I mean,
there's anybody getting hurt.
No.
So what the fuck are they doing?

506
00:25:43.811 --> 00:25:45.970
They're locking this guy in jail.
That's,
this is crazy.

507
00:25:45.971 --> 00:25:48.910
Why isn't everybody up in arms until I saw one of his movies.

508
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.020
<v 3>Exactly.
I was going to say,
don't you know dude,</v>

509
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.730
I've actually talked to porn stars about him,

510
00:25:53.731 --> 00:25:57.960
like many porn stars about him and they all say the exact same thing.
Good.

511
00:25:57.961 --> 00:26:01.410
I fucking hate that guy.
That guy needs to rot in hell.
Every like,
I mean,

512
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.260
I've literally talked about it maybe to 10 porn stars.
I lost him.
What

513
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.460
<v 1>he was doing to this chick.</v>

514
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:12.140
He was fucking this girl's mouth and pissing in her mouth and he kept doing it

515
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.480
and it was really disturbing.

516
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.770
He would like shove his dick in her mouth that she would be like in pain and

517
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:23.360
gagging and then he would start pissing in it and he would make her talk while

518
00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:25.070
he was pissing in her mouth.
I mean,

519
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:29.630
I dunno how he must've just drank water all day for this,
this scene.

520
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.480
And I don't know how he's pissing with a hard on either,
but he's doing it,

521
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:32.991
you know,

522
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:37.070
I guess I guess he just drank so much that he has to pass and he took so much

523
00:26:37.071 --> 00:26:40.430
Viagara that is Dick won't go down and so he's fucking this girl's mouth and

524
00:26:40.431 --> 00:26:44.910
it's like so sadistic.
It was so disturbing to watch.

525
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:49.050
It was like that someone would do this,
you know,
to some other human being.

526
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.380
And like before that he's like teasing her and playing around with her and then

527
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:53.214
it like,
you know,

528
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.750
it escalates as he's doing shit to her to this point where he's fucking her

529
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.430
mouth and pissing in it.
I'm like,
whoa.

530
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.460
I was listening to the Howard Stern show and they said that,

531
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:04.890
I don't know if this is,
this is actually a scene,

532
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:08.130
but that guy sal was saying that there was one where um,

533
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.750
this guy pried open this chick's butthole Max hardcore did,

534
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:18.000
and then he pissed in her butthole while he pried it open with like a,
you know,

535
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:23.350
an a medical instrument and then he attached a straw to her butthole and made

536
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.790
her drink his piss at of her butthole.
Ah,
yeah.
Yeah.

537
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:31.440
Dad fucking dude should probably be in jail.
What could shit right.

538
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.940
Don't you think?
I mean that's,
that's not a healthy human being.
Yeah.

539
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:41.140
That's not good.
It's not good to have that guy around.
No,
that's scary man.
Yeah.

540
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.440
[inaudible] no one else is scary that somebody likes that shit.

541
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.310
<v 2>No doubt that there's actually a website,</v>

542
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.350
there's so many fucking weird porn websites.

543
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.070
I forget the name of this one website I was shown the other day where it's just

544
00:27:51.071 --> 00:27:55.240
this big fat guy and he just pays these porn stars to come over to his house and

545
00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:58.960
just fucking hit him and shit on them and make them Joyce drink pee.

546
00:27:58.961 --> 00:28:00.880
And then they'd give him blow jobs and fuck them though.

547
00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.490
But I think it's like the gimp or some,
I forget what the website,

548
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.300
it's one of the most popular websites ever.
It's just this ugly,

549
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.550
nasty one of the most popular everyone.
I mean,
you know what I mean?

550
00:28:09.551 --> 00:28:13.210
It's pretty fine.
Let's find it.
Good.
Going to hit Google.
Fuck.

551
00:28:13.211 --> 00:28:14.770
This is all about if my baby's listening,

552
00:28:14.771 --> 00:28:16.270
please texted me the name of that website.

553
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.800
<v 1>Just um,
Joe,
why just Google it?
I don't know.
I don't,</v>

554
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.830
you literally don't know some weird ass name.
Somebody in the chat,

555
00:28:23.831 --> 00:28:27.730
I'll know the name of it.
It's like the,
the something,

556
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.640
the gimp or something the fuck.

557
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.880
I'll often use a fat guy and it's a super popular website.

558
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.770
Girls Shit all over him,
right?

559
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.100
Some dudes are into that and for whatever reason that does not disturb me.

560
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.300
I don't,
it doesn't bother me.
The guy wants to grow to shit on them.
You know?

561
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:43.660
It's like,

562
00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:48.060
like when Jimmy Norton talks about like a girls pissing and how we'll tell him

563
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.570
that he talks about an opion Anthony,

564
00:28:49.571 --> 00:28:52.270
how he'll tell a girl when she's gone to the bathroom,
don't call yourself,

565
00:28:52.271 --> 00:28:54.580
let me clean you.
And after she pisses,

566
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.770
she comes over and sits on his face and he licks her pests.

567
00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.350
<v 2>The mini in it.
That's what it's going in the minion m I</v>

568
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.273
<v 1>and I own</v>

569
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:08.060
[inaudible] dot com like men,
onion.com oh,

570
00:29:08.061 --> 00:29:12.480
that's it.
Hi.
Yes,
I am over 18 oh my God.
What are we getting in to see?

571
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.730
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,
and it's,
this is a man in charge.

572
00:29:16.731 --> 00:29:21.110
You're nobody until you've been fucked by him.
Oh my God.

573
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.190
And he's fat and disgusting.
Guys covered in shit.
He's got shit all over.

574
00:29:25.191 --> 00:29:29.990
His face was his ass.
It's like Joey Diaz Times 50 if your sexual evil,

575
00:29:29.991 --> 00:29:33.110
I guess his giant ass,
his mouth fucking this girl,

576
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:33.761
<v 2>by the way.</v>

577
00:29:33.761 --> 00:29:38.680
It's sponsored by dog fark.com which I don't even want to lick on dog.

578
00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:41.940
Fuck.
All right,
let's go back.
It's

579
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.500
<v 4>sponsored by dog fart.com oh my God.</v>

580
00:29:46.501 --> 00:29:50.820
My opening up a new tab,
son.
What are you doing man?
Dog.

581
00:29:50.821 --> 00:29:55.680
firt.com Doug,
why Inter here for Interracial Porn?

582
00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.180
Oh,
isn't that dog farts?
It's just black guys.
Fucking sad.

583
00:30:00.181 --> 00:30:02.040
Girls here are so

584
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.250
<v 1>the numbers are for porn stars.</v>

585
00:30:04.251 --> 00:30:07.580
Now that there's all this internet porn and girls can like do shit out of their

586
00:30:07.581 --> 00:30:09.500
house,
the numbers have to be much,

587
00:30:09.501 --> 00:30:11.660
much higher than they were like say in the heyday of the eight.

588
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.870
<v 4>That's what it all is going towards.
I,</v>

589
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:17.980
I heard from a big company that they were saying like how it's dead.

590
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.520
Dvds are dead.
They are man,
the Internet,

591
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.180
the Internet killed music.
Right?
If the Internet killed the music business,

592
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.430
not killed it,
but completely changed the whole dynamic of it.

593
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.080
<v 1>Artists make the most money now off of their live performances.</v>

594
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:34.570
That's where they make the majority of their money,
except for iTunes.

595
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:37.120
They make money off of iTunes.
But if it did that for,

596
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:41.170
for the fucking music businessman,
what is it gonna do for the porn business?

597
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:44.050
This is going to crush it because nobody wants to admit they're buying porn.

598
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.280
And when you could just go to Ustream or go to youporn or any of those sites in

599
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:48.480
it

600
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.720
<v 4>instantly get something to jerk off to.
Why don't you go to a store?</v>

601
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.560
I guess the only thing that's popular right now is like things like,
uh,
you know,

602
00:30:55.561 --> 00:30:57.010
like the Cosby show porn,
you know,

603
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.120
you to heritage heritage and stuff or comedy stuff.

604
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.800
<v 1>You know,
one of the dudes is in that and the dude,</v>

605
00:31:01.801 --> 00:31:04.920
it's also in the ATM thing is uh,
this guy Tyler night.

606
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.320
And I don't want to say his real name cause I don't know if he likes to be an

607
00:31:07.321 --> 00:31:12.110
undercover,
but he's uh,
a buddy of mine,
he a trains it a Eddie school.
Yeah,

608
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.580
it does Jujitsu at legends.
Really Nice Guy.

609
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.110
Like super friendly and a really good writer.
He's a,
he,
he writes like a,

610
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.951
like nonfiction.

611
00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:23.550
Like he writes like some hilarious stories about the porn business.

612
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.600
I forget what is,
uh,
if you just find Tyler night blog,

613
00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:28.620
I bet you could find it online.

614
00:31:28.621 --> 00:31:31.530
But he's a really talented writer and he's kind of really funny story about

615
00:31:31.531 --> 00:31:33.740
doing an anal scene with a chick and,
and,

616
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.330
and he's got shit on his deck and he's trying to stay hard.

617
00:31:36.331 --> 00:31:37.230
And it's really funny.

618
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.770
It's like really well written and intelligent and really funny.
But he's in a,

619
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.760
he's in both those,
he's in the 18 one that comes out.
He plays Ba,

620
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.930
he pays the Mr t character.
Uh,
but,
oh,
what is this?

621
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.310
We're looking at the minion again.

622
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.690
<v 4>Okay.
This is not,
this guy's pretty smart though because I mean,
look,
he's,</v>

623
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.770
he's fucking pretty attractive girls here.
We'll listen dude.

624
00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.230
<v 1>The bottom line is there's a lot of dumb whores out there and I have to do is</v>

625
00:32:00.231 --> 00:32:02.930
give them money.
There's a lot of sad women out there.
You know,

626
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.470
there's a lot of people that suck and people that suck raise kids that suck,

627
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.530
you know,
or people that suck do a shitty job of raising kids.

628
00:32:09.531 --> 00:32:11.480
And they raised fucked up kids,
you know,

629
00:32:11.481 --> 00:32:15.110
and then these fucked up kids get to a situation where they need a lot of money

630
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.720
and they don't have it.
And someone comes along and says,
Hey,

631
00:32:17.721 --> 00:32:19.170
do you want to fuck this fat guy in the Internet?

632
00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:21.950
And no one's gonna see it and next thing you know they'll doing it and they have

633
00:32:21.951 --> 00:32:23.240
that sad look on their face.

634
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.930
I don't mind porn when the girl seems like she's into it,

635
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.410
but there's nothing sadder than watching a porn where it girls like reluctantly

636
00:32:30.411 --> 00:32:34.100
sucking a dick and you can tell like she really doesn't want to be there and

637
00:32:34.101 --> 00:32:35.330
she's giving off that energy.

638
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.910
<v 4>Well most of them don't.
Most of it.
It's all fake.</v>

639
00:32:37.911 --> 00:32:40.200
Most girls don't come a the in porn

640
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.560
<v 3>movies and stuff like that.
This seems like that.
Oh yeah,
of course.
Right.</v>

641
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.520
What do you think the odds are?
Not many.
Like,

642
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.120
like there's a few girls where you can go,
oh that girl legit,

643
00:32:48.121 --> 00:32:50.400
but for the most part,
from what I understand is a lie.

644
00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:52.740
Don't just do it and it's almost fake.
And they,
there's like,

645
00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.680
there's even like parts where like,
uh,

646
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.410
they're getting sprayed to make it look more wetter,
you know,

647
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.560
in there they're stopping the cam camera,
you know,

648
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.810
changing the camera around and you know,
it's like all,
you know,

649
00:33:03.811 --> 00:33:04.950
it's not what it is.

650
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.830
<v 0>I was calling about the Max hardcore thing that bugs me to get back to that.</v>

651
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.260
It is disturbing all the shit this God does.

652
00:33:11.261 --> 00:33:14.290
It's really disturbing because it's like sadistic and evil.

653
00:33:14.291 --> 00:33:16.240
It's almost like a snuff porn,
but you know,

654
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.450
you're killing her dignity for life instead of killing her life.
You know,

655
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.370
there's like when when someone does a porn,

656
00:33:21.371 --> 00:33:24.340
like say if you date a girl and she used to do porn,
oh you know,
I was young,

657
00:33:24.341 --> 00:33:27.250
I got hooked on Coke and next thing I'm doing porn.
Who Cares?

658
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.000
What's the big deal?
You know,
it's like,
well we have,
we fuck if you,
you know,

659
00:33:31.001 --> 00:33:34.240
you fuck on cameras that make you any different.
It's really,
it's no big deal.

660
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:39.160
But that's not porn.
That's like humiliation,
like sadistic type shit.

661
00:33:39.161 --> 00:33:44.140
Like somebody didn't just fuck your girl.
He held her ass hole open,
pissed in it,

662
00:33:44.141 --> 00:33:47.160
and then made her drink out of her asshole.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Well,

663
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.710
you know what I'm saying?
Like that guy,
he took a piece of our humanity.

664
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.080
She will always be humiliated by that experience.

665
00:33:53.081 --> 00:33:55.300
That's always going to fuck with her head.
You know?

666
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.450
It's like he killed a little bit of her.
It's really like what he did was like,

667
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.560
I mean even if it's,
even if it's consensual,
you know,

668
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.920
to still to put that shit on a video,
it's,

669
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.530
if it's one thing of a chick likes to get pissing her ass and she's crazy,

670
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.320
but really how many girls want that on the Internet?

671
00:34:11.321 --> 00:34:15.540
How many girls want that on a DVD?
Is it possible?
Is it even possible?

672
00:34:15.541 --> 00:34:17.650
And that's what you're into.
I mean,

673
00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:20.180
could you be me ever heard that argument that the,
I've,

674
00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:23.140
I've always heard there's always like one or two girls they'll bring up that's

675
00:34:23.141 --> 00:34:25.510
like comes from a healthy household and you know,

676
00:34:25.511 --> 00:34:27.910
she does hardcore porn just because she's into it.

677
00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.340
That's what she likes and she doesn't have any problems at all.

678
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:34.240
I've heard that pitched before and they always pretend the girls really smart

679
00:34:34.241 --> 00:34:38.290
and she reads a lot of books.
[inaudible] what happened?

680
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.820
I don't know what happened.

681
00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:43.720
Why is that guy fucking your asshole and then shoving in your mouth until you

682
00:34:43.721 --> 00:34:47.650
gag and then stuffing it back in your ass on slapping you in the face and then

683
00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:52.030
slapping you in the face with his Dick and then making you go while he's fucking

684
00:34:52.031 --> 00:34:55.090
your mouth is,
is that,
is this all fun cause it's all what you were,

685
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.640
<v 3>well I guess we want to do in life.
What is that?
I guess what it also is is that,</v>

686
00:34:59.641 --> 00:35:00.031
you know,

687
00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:03.810
we're born thinking that we have to wear clothes were born right in that you're

688
00:35:03.811 --> 00:35:06.390
not supposed to look at my butthole.
They were born thing that you're not,

689
00:35:06.391 --> 00:35:06.601
you know,

690
00:35:06.601 --> 00:35:10.140
sex is supposed to be a private thing and I guess it's just like anything else.

691
00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:13.710
Like you know you just born into growing up that way.
But sometimes you,
you know,

692
00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:14.410
if you think

693
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.160
<v 0>that's a side effect of moving to climates that aren't like the jungle,</v>

694
00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.900
I don't have no idea what that think about this human being started out now for

695
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:26.840
car.
Right.
And even though Africa's dangerous as fuck,
and there's,
you know,

696
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.870
all sorts of shit that could bite you and kill you.

697
00:35:28.871 --> 00:35:31.570
There's ants that eat elephants,
bro.
There's these fucking ants.

698
00:35:31.571 --> 00:35:34.450
You know the massive ants I found this on.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

699
00:35:34.451 --> 00:35:37.650
facts.com I think it is.
Whatever it is.
It's on Twitter.
Oh God.
Facts.

700
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.260
<v 1>The mass of ants in this world,</v>

701
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:43.410
like the weight of all the ants in the world is roughly the same as the weight

702
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:47.640
of all the people in the world.
Hmm.
What the fuck?

703
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.090
Yes.
Yes.
That's how many answers are too.
They're everywhere.

704
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:55.080
These fucks and they are the number one killers in the world in Africa.

705
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:56.400
They're the number one killers and

706
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.320
<v 4>it's,
whoa,
wait,
wait.</v>

707
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.070
So you're saying if you took all the ants and then wait and wait,

708
00:36:01.071 --> 00:36:03.780
it's all the people on the road.
The ants would way more.
Yes.

709
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.480
I read this on the Internet,
it must be true.
You know what?

710
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:10.770
That is the most untrue thing ever.
Let's find out.
It might be true.
Oh my God,

711
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:12.330
Google.
Let's Google this.

712
00:36:12.331 --> 00:36:16.230
This is where in 2010 we should not be having a conversation where we were like

713
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:18.600
in 1993 okay,
you hit,

714
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.390
you hit fucking tab t go ahead gun there.

715
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.650
But the problem with [inaudible] suffer news.
That is what?

716
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:30.690
Insanely impossible.
Well,
how's it insanely impossible cause you can take,

717
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:33.680
well come on man.
Come on man.
Type Shit in.
You don't know that.

718
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:38.610
That's way more people butthole.

719
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.720
No,
don't tell [inaudible] hold on.
Why don't you just write,

720
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.180
did they answer in the road way more than all the people in the road.
Okay,

721
00:36:46.181 --> 00:36:47.340
here we answer.
No.

722
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:48.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

723
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.340
<v 4>answers.com answers.com they don't weigh more.</v>

724
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.670
Do all the ants in then spent way more than what people are up the answer.

725
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.860
That's the wrong question.
Cause I said roughly the same.
Oh,
roughly the same.

726
00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.720
What I said is that the weight of ants and what is the sense in the world they

727
00:37:01.721 --> 00:37:06.130
way an average of 0.01 Jesus.
Dude,
that's the weight of an aunt.

728
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.940
That's so stupid to answer way more than people you.

729
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.010
You asked the wrong God damn question.
No,

730
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:17.360
that's not what you want either more than the number of the Jesus Christ.

731
00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:23.080
<v 1>The ants way more than people know.
Does put put the put in the,</v>

732
00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.180
in the Google search,
right?

733
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.260
Put does the total mass is the total total mass of ants.

734
00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.240
Ants on earth,
on earth way the same or roughly

735
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.520
<v 4>who taught you how to Google?
I just how I do it,</v>

736
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.480
but mom [inaudible] way the same as the total mass of humans.

737
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:50.180
Not the same.
The has an h in it.
So same

738
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.690
<v 1>as the total mass of humans.
Mass.
Uh,
yeah man.</v>

739
00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:00.000
Holy Shit.
How much does the Earth Way,

740
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:04.300
why?
You know what your Google skills,
okay.

741
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.420
Oh wait.

742
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:10.200
Of all the ants in the world versus weight of all the humans in the world and

743
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.520
rural versus humans.
Here we go.
I'll try that one.

744
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.860
Facts about ants as compared to humans?
No.
Okay.
Listen,

745
00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:22.530
we're not going to find this out that quickly and still be entertaining on the

746
00:38:22.531 --> 00:38:23.364
radio.

747
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.960
<v 4>Wait of all the ants in the roads combined is much lighter than the weight of</v>

748
00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:30.320
all animals combined.
The answer,
the combined weight of all the ants in the road,

749
00:38:30.321 --> 00:38:32.870
it's approximately the same or greater than the combined weight of all human

750
00:38:32.871 --> 00:38:36.490
beings.
There you go.
[inaudible] dot com so we got an affirmative

751
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.790
<v 1>that that is it.
I do not believe it.
You don't believe it will?</v>

752
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:43.030
I believe it because you think about how many more,
you know,
answer everywhere,

753
00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:45.850
dude.
I mean the,
they literally are everywhere.
Everywhere there's dirt,

754
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:46.590
there's ants.

755
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.221
<v 3>Yeah,
but would you,</v>

756
00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:52.221
if you had a truck like a bulldozer and a huge bulldozer filled to the top of

757
00:38:52.531 --> 00:38:57.030
ants,
just,
I mean packed of ants and all those aunts fell on you,

758
00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.190
do you think you'd just be like,
oh,
gross.
Or do you think by I'm dead,
I'm,

759
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.820
you'd be dead?
What kind of questions you're asking.
Really?
Yeah,
Dude.
No,
I mean,

760
00:39:05.821 --> 00:39:07.410
just from the impact of them.

761
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.060
<v 1>Yeah,
they would crush her.
They'll kill you.
Yeah,
I think,</v>

762
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.490
I think there's way more ants in your thinking,
I think.
I think you're wrong.

763
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.430
I think they're everywhere,
dude.
Look,
that's,

764
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:20.770
we just found out on answers.com it must be true,
right?

765
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:23.290
We don't know if it's true or not,
but that's a problem at the Internet.
Look,

766
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:26.650
but the point is in,
in Africa,
answer a huge,
huge fucking problem.

767
00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:29.590
This is getting back to the original thought.
The point is in Africa,

768
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:34.570
aunts kill everything dude.
They kill elephants.
They crawl up elephant's legs,

769
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.530
they get in their ear and they start eating them alive from the fucking ear and

770
00:39:38.531 --> 00:39:40.710
they have swarms of them that do it in the ants can't.

771
00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.330
The elephants can't stop them.
There's nothing they can do.

772
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.030
You can't shake them off and they get eaten alive.

773
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:50.260
Like the ants kill more things in Africa than any other animal.

774
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.870
They kill everything there.
They're fucking scary shit.

775
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.450
And these people that live in Africa or running around naked,

776
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.020
the run around naked without it.
We would have hazard suits on,

777
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.320
we would have armor,
you know,
in 2010 if we lived in Africa,

778
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.480
if you had to live in a part of the world where the ants,

779
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.090
one ant bites you and it sends a signal to all his buddies.

780
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:10.630
I found something we can eat and they all fucking swarm on you and there's no

781
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:13.780
way you can stop them cause there's trillions of them and they're climbing up

782
00:40:13.781 --> 00:40:17.800
your legs and eat in your asshole alive.
How would you live in a place like that?

783
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:20.320
You would have some sort of a mesh suit that was impenetrable.

784
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:23.500
It would be sprayed with toxins on the outside.
You have a fucking helmet on,

785
00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:25.660
like you're on Mars.
That's how he'd walk around.
Yes.

786
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.750
<v 3>Crazy about insects and stuff like that is that the other day I was just laying</v>

787
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:31.120
in bed in this huge fucking spider,

788
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:34.840
just as crawling on my bed and it had like a red stripe on it and it just looked

789
00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:37.840
like death spider.
And I'm just like,
you know,

790
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.100
if I was not awake or if I was sleeping and I happened to rollover and this guy

791
00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:43.990
bit me,
would I die?
Is that how

792
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.610
<v 1>right.
You know that Brown recluse is a scary motherfucker.</v>

793
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.130
Have you ever seen pictures of people that got bitten by a brown recluse,

794
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.080
like burns,
like folds through you?

795
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.170
Especially if you don't get it taken care of like right away,

796
00:40:56.171 --> 00:41:00.100
like eight to hold to your fucking body.
It's terrifying.
Shit man.

797
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.680
So my point is these people live in Africa.

798
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.610
This is where like humanity supposedly was created or a evolved,

799
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:07.510
I mean our roots,

800
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.500
all our roots of all human beings go back to Africa and in Africa is hot as fuck

801
00:41:11.501 --> 00:41:12.334
and they're all naked.

802
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:17.260
So do you think that like when these people branched out to climates that they

803
00:41:17.261 --> 00:41:20.530
couldn't control and they had to change their environment rather than they

804
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:23.410
couldn't live in,
um,
uh,
without doing something,

805
00:41:23.411 --> 00:41:25.840
without trying to control their temperature,

806
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:29.620
without covering themselves and building houses that are sheltered and insulated

807
00:41:29.621 --> 00:41:32.710
and starting fires and stuff,
all this stuff they didn't have to do in Africa.

808
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.930
Then they started having to wear clothes and when they started wearing clothes,

809
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.840
then it wasn't like a common thing to see someone's genitals.

810
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.230
It was like very rare.
Like you gotta get this bitch out of his fucking first.

811
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:45.380
I don't,
I get this pitch out of these first,
it's zero degrees out.
Okay.

812
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:47.450
You don't even have a fucking house to live in.
You live in,

813
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:50.450
in a hole in the snow and you're trying to get laid and you've got to try and

814
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:53.240
get this chicken out of it for,
you know,
what the fuck you gonna do,
man.

815
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.220
It's a grind,
you know?

816
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.790
So that's when people became fucked up sexually because like,
you know,

817
00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:01.790
back then they still probably didn't even have a fucking language.
So they,

818
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:05.240
you know,
they couldn't say,
listen,
how about I eat your pussy?
It's like my it,

819
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.260
let's have a party.
You know?

820
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.080
They couldn't even like talk their way into it because they probably,

821
00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:11.270
when they first started doing that and moving to other climates,

822
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.580
they probably didn't even have a language yet.
They're just grunting.

823
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:16.340
It's certain Shit,
you know?
So they,
they just,

824
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.270
they just got all fucked up about sex because they couldn't fuck anymore.

825
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.940
Like they used to in the jungle and the jungle,
they were naked.

826
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:25.910
They would get horny and they just fuck.
But now it's like,

827
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:27.780
it becomes a huge hassle because why?

828
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.980
It's often used to hide when you live in a jungle.
Yeah.

829
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.730
People want you to have sex.
Nobody cares.
That's how monkeys are monkeys.

830
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.600
Fuck right in front of everybody.
They don't worry about shit.

831
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.660
I saw some good monkey sex the last week when I was at the zoo.
Yeah.
Monkeys,

832
00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:41.870
you fuck right in front of whole crowds of people.
They like it.
Well,
you know,

833
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:44.060
why not?
Why wouldn't they?
What do you do?
You give a shit.

834
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.820
You do other things that are pleasurable in front of people,
right.
You know,

835
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.420
you get a massage in front of people.
It doesn't bother you that much.
Right.

836
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:53.120
You know,
you know,
thinking about if you lie on your back and you know,

837
00:42:53.121 --> 00:42:55.720
you could be in a park and someone's got awesome massages,

838
00:42:55.721 --> 00:42:58.640
they give out the park like,
oh,
we do deep tissue.
It's only 10 bucks,

839
00:42:58.641 --> 00:42:59.410
like damn pen box.

840
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.780
Oh I'm gonna get a massage and you'll lie face down on the massage table and let

841
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:06.770
people rub you in front of people.
But if you know,
she was given head,

842
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.550
you know,
or hand jobs,
just hand jobs,
you know,

843
00:43:10.551 --> 00:43:12.620
you don't want anybody to see your,
your calm come out.

844
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.300
He couldn't just sit there with all those people at the park and just let

845
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:19.880
someone jerk you off.
You know,
you wouldn't enjoy it.

846
00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.040
Do you think we're going to go back to that letting like it seems like you know

847
00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:23.874
the,
you know,

848
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.840
the more that we're getting used to sacs in the more Regan regained and used to

849
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:29.180
seeing girls butt holes and stuff like that because of the Internet and stuff.

850
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.520
You think we're going to get back to the state if soon.

851
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:34.600
We're all just going to be having orgies all over the place and kids are gonna

852
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:39.020
be smoking cigarettes.
The no,
the cigarettes are definitely know.
I don't know.

853
00:43:39.021 --> 00:43:41.930
It's possible we'd have to get past a lot of hurdles.
You know,

854
00:43:41.931 --> 00:43:44.930
I think it's pretty obvious that if you look at human sexuality,

855
00:43:44.931 --> 00:43:48.440
especially the way we treat sex in America,
you know,
we're,
we're very,

856
00:43:48.441 --> 00:43:51.980
very uptight about it.
And I think that one of the reasons why we're very,

857
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:55.160
very uptight about it is because we're imbalanced.
You know,

858
00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:59.570
we're in imbalanced by the fact that we grew up and moved to new environments

859
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:01.730
and invented clothes.
You know,

860
00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:04.280
inventing close allowed us to live in a bunch of different places,

861
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:08.900
but it also allowed us to,
we fucked up the natural sexual cycle.

862
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.740
You know,
the natural,
a way of looking at each other and,
and behaving.

863
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.580
When you add suppression to anything,
be the reason why priests are fucked up.

864
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:20.690
It's not just because religion is ridiculous and to live your whole life by some

865
00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:22.910
shit that was written thousands of years ago.
That makes no sense.

866
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.210
That's ridiculous.
And abstaining from sex is ridiculous.

867
00:44:26.211 --> 00:44:28.910
All that stuff is completely ridiculous.
But the real,

868
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.110
real problem with being a priest,
one of reasons why they're so

869
00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.980
<v 0>fucked up is because there's a massive amount of suppression about your own</v>

870
00:44:35.981 --> 00:44:38.680
natural drives,
your all natural things.

871
00:44:38.681 --> 00:44:42.310
There's a natural cycle living inside of your body,
you know,
or,

872
00:44:42.311 --> 00:44:43.780
or operating your body rather.

873
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.710
And it's existed for millions of years and it's the reason why human beings

874
00:44:47.711 --> 00:44:50.170
procreate and it's the reason why animals procreate.

875
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:54.310
And when you put a stopper to that shit and you label all that shit is evil and

876
00:44:54.311 --> 00:44:55.870
bad,
you're going to create issues.

877
00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.340
And just just interrupting the natural cycle of things.

878
00:45:00.341 --> 00:45:04.180
It's like you're putting on the brakes of like something that you can't control

879
00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:04.331
your,

880
00:45:04.331 --> 00:45:06.730
you putting on the brakes for something that you're not supposed to control.

881
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.550
It's supposed to be a natural part of your life.
You know?

882
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.040
It's one of the things that makes us,
you know,

883
00:45:12.041 --> 00:45:13.630
and this is what I've found from having kids.

884
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:15.760
One of the things that makes you a different person,

885
00:45:15.761 --> 00:45:18.730
one of the things that takes you to another place is the development of other

886
00:45:18.731 --> 00:45:20.920
new human beings.
It's like you,

887
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.860
you lose a lot of your selfless selfishness.

888
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.250
And I think that that's a natural part of a progression as a human being.

889
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:32.670
And so that shit doesn't exist for priests and it doesn't really exist for us.

890
00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.980
If we,
if we wear clothes,
you know,

891
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:38.110
if we were close and cover each other up and all suppressed about sex and

892
00:45:38.111 --> 00:45:38.800
worried about it,

893
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.050
I mean eventually you're going to realize that a certain point in your life

894
00:45:41.051 --> 00:45:45.160
you're gonna be like,
fuck,
what did I waste all this time tweaking about sex for,

895
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:46.450
you know,
what is it?

896
00:45:46.451 --> 00:45:49.810
It's just two people touch on their buys together and enjoying it.
You know?

897
00:45:49.811 --> 00:45:53.800
Why is it such a fucking a big Goddamn deal to people?
What is it?
Well,

898
00:45:53.801 --> 00:45:56.230
it's because we,
we suppress it because we've covered up,

899
00:45:56.231 --> 00:45:58.690
that's why magazine ads at show girls in bikinis,

900
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.310
just like the pussy is almost there.

901
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.410
It's like you can almost see it's so attractive to sell cars or self fucking

902
00:46:05.411 --> 00:46:08.440
water.
You could tell anything with pussy.
You know,

903
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.100
just a girl in a little wet bikini come out of the water,

904
00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.710
bending over to pick up her sunglasses.
She's on her knees.

905
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.590
She'd turn around and look towards the camera.
Oh,

906
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.550
you might just start checking off right now.
And whenever,
fuck she's selling gum.

907
00:46:21.551 --> 00:46:25.690
What did she sell in breath wash?
What'd she selling?
You know,
sunscreen.

908
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.100
I'll buy it.
I'll think of that hot bitch and I'll buy their product.

909
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.450
<v 2>Yeah.
I just saw as sex in the city too.</v>

910
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:37.630
I was forced to go sound dare you forced to go see that,
you know,
I mean I got,

911
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.440
I got rewarded nicely.
Dang backwards.
Calgary.
A couple other things.

912
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.340
It was awesome.
But uh,
it's funny how they,
they,

913
00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.750
they took place in Abi Dhabi and you had been there?
Yeah,

914
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.210
<v 0>but to buy right?
To buy,
I think it's to buy.
Oh,
Dubai.
Yeah,</v>

915
00:46:50.211 --> 00:46:52.780
I thought it was Abu Dhabi.
Dubai.
Dubai is supposedly the,

916
00:46:52.781 --> 00:46:55.370
like the big attraction over the Middle East.

917
00:46:55.371 --> 00:46:58.670
That's where everybody goes to [inaudible] he's a lot like it.

918
00:46:58.671 --> 00:46:59.810
But Dubai is the more popular,

919
00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.870
<v 2>no,
no,
no,
no.
I think that's what the whole point in the movie was.</v>

920
00:47:01.871 --> 00:47:05.890
Cause they talk about how the buy is like popular and trying to build up Abi

921
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:09.640
Dhabi.
They talk.
Oh okay.
So am I arguing about the pro,

922
00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.090
the plot and premise of a fucking sex and the city movie or you're acting like

923
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:17.650
you don't know.
And so one thing,
one thing off the bat,

924
00:47:17.651 --> 00:47:19.920
it's amazing how much that plays some of like periods in there.

925
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:24.340
Like you know that smell that tampon smelled like,

926
00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:28.600
that's kind of like a flower perfume smell that whiffed everywhere combined with

927
00:47:28.601 --> 00:47:32.800
popcorn.
It was the most disgusting smell ever.
It was pretty bad.
But anyway,

928
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:36.870
<v 1>how many chicks go to sea sex in the city?
Oh crazy.</v>

929
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.350
I'll put how many of them are like those girls.
Oh

930
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.610
<v 2>did,
they were all taken the girls next to us.</v>

931
00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:44.280
We're taking pictures of their shoes together while we're waiting for the

932
00:47:44.281 --> 00:47:46.130
previews.
They were like,
Dang,
she used together.

933
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.880
Let's take a picture on my Twitter,
our shoes.

934
00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.490
You know what the thing knows?
Chicks are so happy about that shit.

935
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:57.360
Oh you gotta love that Shit.
Yeah it is.
It's so funny because like,

936
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:02.160
like in it every time,
like Carrie,
I mean,
I mean the,
the main character.
Yeah,

937
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:07.400
she would.
Yeah.
What was the test?
You knew who it was?
Well,

938
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.290
I've seen the show care yet.
Brian cows on it once I washed it.
Oh yeah,

939
00:48:10.291 --> 00:48:11.760
that was great.
I think I've watched it a couple times,

940
00:48:11.761 --> 00:48:14.060
but every time like she would like wear a new outfit or the x,

941
00:48:14.061 --> 00:48:15.240
she would show her closet.

942
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.990
That was a big thing when they showed her closet again,
they were like,
oh,

943
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:23.150
the whole crowd together.
It was awesome.
It was great.

944
00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.220
<v 1>A bunch of aliens.
Oh you're around a bunch of checks.
That's a hot aliens,
aliens.</v>

945
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.960
And the more you get to know them,

946
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.270
the more you realize how many of them I like that.

947
00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:36.300
And the ones that aren't like that are really just pretending for us.

948
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.310
<v 2>[inaudible] you know.
But by the way,
that movie though was,
it was kind of,</v>

949
00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.530
I don't know,
I wouldn't say racist,
but it was kind of weird how they,
they,

950
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.180
they were talking about the Abu Dhabi thing where they can even allowed to like

951
00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:50.300
hold hands in public or to kiss in public and stuff.

952
00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.060
And it was like this tension throughout the movie about that.

953
00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:57.590
Then I don't want to give it away to all the ladies.
So you guys know.

954
00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:02.860
Spoiler,
spoiler alert.
Uh,
so in your near the end of the movie,
uh,

955
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:06.290
they just,
one of the characters just went off like I liked the fuck.

956
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.190
I am like throwing condoms everywhere.
I like the older check.
Yeah.

957
00:49:10.191 --> 00:49:13.380
The older chick.
Yeah.
In front of everyone.
Abi Dhabi.
Dude.

958
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:17.340
They would lock her in a hole in the dirt so fast.
Oh,
I know.
I know they would,

959
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:18.860
they would put her in jail.

960
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:22.160
They put a couple in jail for kissing on the beach there.
Yeah.

961
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.450
That was a part in the movie too.

962
00:49:23.451 --> 00:49:26.330
They were kissing on the beach and she got locked up and was thrown out there.

963
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.990
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's based on

964
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.900
<v 1>real life.
They actually did that to a woman or a woman and a man,
uh,</v>

965
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.770
in Dubai for making out there were a couple and they're making,
I mean,

966
00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:35.791
I don't know what they were doing.

967
00:49:35.791 --> 00:49:37.560
They might've been like fingering each other or something,
you know,

968
00:49:37.561 --> 00:49:39.780
it might have been calling it making out,
but it got a little crazy.

969
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.310
But apparently it's,
you know,
it's super,
super illegal over there.
Yeah,

970
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:48.330
it's crazy.
It's crazy.
It's not a bad movie.
Jail.
I loved it.
Huh?

971
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.590
It's better than the first one.

972
00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.630
I haven't seen either one of them and I only intend to,
how dare you.

973
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:58.830
I'm keeping my balls and tax.
So you got to do things like that.
No,
I would do it.

974
00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.770
I would do it if it was like a date night or something stupid like that,

975
00:50:01.771 --> 00:50:04.380
I would do it just cause I would think it was ridiculous and I probably get some

976
00:50:04.381 --> 00:50:05.214
material out of it.

977
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.120
All that great sex I got in response for doing that was worth every penny.

978
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.930
Shouldn't have to barter for sex side.

979
00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.120
I know things that go take that pussy chores yet.

980
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.020
I imagine being able to take it wherever you want to.

981
00:50:16.021 --> 00:50:19.860
Like we're at toys or run shit.
The one two should be able to anyway.
Fuck you.

982
00:50:19.861 --> 00:50:22.860
I think you could.
You just gotta force it on her.
Not forcing our physically.

983
00:50:22.861 --> 00:50:27.650
Just bring up the idea with urgency like you like with real a real sense focus

984
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:30.530
and urgency.
We're not talking right here.
We're just talking like a lot of,

985
00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:33.890
a lot of energy,
you know,
and just get excited about I one.
Fuck you right now.

986
00:50:33.891 --> 00:50:38.120
Right here.
Shop,
shop please pass down.
What?
No,
you can't shut up.
Let me,

987
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:39.590
I'm just going to stick it in.
I'm just gonna stick it in.

988
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.320
You're not even hard feeling them hard.
Oh my God.
You are art.
Yeah.
Shop shop.

989
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.710
Believe his town.
This camera's,
who cares?
They got a photo.

990
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.370
Video me fucking you real quick.
All right.
I'm gonna stop right now.

991
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.530
You could do that dude.
Don't look at me when you do that shit.

992
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:59.160
I'm just trying to make Brian uncomfortable.

993
00:50:59.161 --> 00:51:01.400
[inaudible] it's so creepy,
dude.

994
00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.760
There's nothing more fun though than the beginning of a relationship when you

995
00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:06.860
just get comfortable with each other.

996
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.220
Like you haven't gotten sick of fucking each other yet and you're just getting

997
00:51:10.221 --> 00:51:12.850
comfortable with each other and you're starting to have fun.
You know,

998
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.620
you're starting to talk dirty to each other.
I starting to get excited.

999
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:19.520
He sent each other some nasty texts and shit like that.
Those are the good days.

1000
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.230
There's a different level of excitement and really it's just your body trying to

1001
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:26.360
ensure that you breed with this person.
Really.

1002
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:29.900
It's just a bunch of chemicals flowing through your brain that your body is

1003
00:51:29.901 --> 00:51:33.800
trying to give you to ensure that you breed.
It's incredible,
man.

1004
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.080
It's incredible that they haven't figured out how to pocket.

1005
00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:40.370
That's to how the pill it package it,
you know,
put that shit in a pill form.

1006
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.340
He takes something that makes you feel like when you're,
you're horny and,

1007
00:51:43.341 --> 00:51:47.240
and love,
you know that feeling when you want to fuck her.

1008
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:49.430
And she went to fuck you and you can't wait to see her.

1009
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:53.150
And as soon as you see her,
you get excited and you,
you,
you're and you feel good.

1010
00:51:53.151 --> 00:51:56.570
You get all this big charge of energy.
We don't even realize what we're doing.

1011
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.570
You know,
we think,
wow,
I just admit of new relationship.
Things are fun.

1012
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:01.040
When it's new,
that's not what it is.

1013
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.400
You're getting all these extra chemicals because your brain is trying to ensure

1014
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:07.250
that you make with this freak.
That's what it is.

1015
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.020
Your brain is getting all this extra juice.

1016
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.170
Why haven't they figured out how a package that I don't know,
but they need to,

1017
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:16.070
dude,
how good would the world be?
There's your antidepressants.

1018
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:18.740
You know how come dudes that are in depressed always in Sucky,

1019
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.230
sucky relationships are sucky situations.

1020
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.350
Nobody's depressed in an awesome relationship when everything's going great,

1021
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.060
because that's your little juice.
That's,

1022
00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:28.940
that's where your antidepressants are coming from.

1023
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:34.250
We're all junkies for brain chemicals.
You know what I'm saying,
son doing that.

1024
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.770
What you're saying,
did you see that fucking hole in the ground in Guatemala?
Boy,

1025
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.970
what dude?
My friend.
Listen,

1026
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:45.110
you gotta look at the hole in the ground and Guatemala.
Is it the sinkhole?
Oh,

1027
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:46.970
Jesus.
Google right now,

1028
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.290
Guatemala sinkhole and be prepared to freak out and call fake.

1029
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:52.910
You're going to freak out and call fake.

1030
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:57.330
I might type in Guacamole sinkhole and see if this is a glock.
That's it.
See,
see,

1031
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:02.180
it's the fucking second one.
Look No.
Go Guatemala,
Guatemala,
dummy.
Look at that.

1032
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:05.170
Look when you watching you,
you age.
Do you a lie?

1033
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:10.140
See who that see sinkhole right away.
It's the first search.
Look at Dow.
Do.

1034
00:53:10.141 --> 00:53:14.360
Look how deep that fucking thing is.
It's crazy.
It's like Oh hell.

1035
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:20.210
Up out of nowhere and swallowed a building that's swallowed a whole building.

1036
00:53:20.211 --> 00:53:23.750
Easy Dude.
There's so many pictures of it online.
If you haven't seen it,

1037
00:53:23.751 --> 00:53:28.030
ladies and gentlemen,
Google,
you don't even just type in Google Eua,

1038
00:53:28.031 --> 00:53:33.031
G U A and it'll Guatemala sinkhole will be the first search or the second search

1039
00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.260
option.
It's incredible.

1040
00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:39.280
It is literally a perfect circle and it's huge.

1041
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:44.310
It's gigantic and it's in the middle of this intersection and ate a whole house.

1042
00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:49.450
The house just fell down and disappeared and it's super,
super deep.

1043
00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:54.040
The image that we're looking at.
There's a helicopter shadow on the wall of the,

1044
00:53:54.041 --> 00:53:57.370
uh,
of the,
of the circle.
But it's,
it's giant.

1045
00:53:57.371 --> 00:53:59.080
It's like a half a block wide

1046
00:53:59.310 --> 00:53:59.870
<v 3>it.
Alright.</v>

1047
00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:03.190
You know what it reminds me of immediately is they like something from district

1048
00:54:03.191 --> 00:54:04.180
nine.
Yeah.

1049
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:09.540
<v 1>It doesn't even look real.
It's like,
well how is that happening?
How is,</v>

1050
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.050
how have we never seen anything even remotely that crazy before?

1051
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.490
And how often could that happen?
Is it possible that can happen in Los Angeles?

1052
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:19.680
I mean,
I guess it has to be running water.

1053
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:21.090
We don't really have running water here.

1054
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:25.310
How many cities do it says after a devastating tropical storm?
So it was,

1055
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.153
it just water,

1056
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:31.230
the water ran through and somehow or another created a giant spherical hole.

1057
00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.570
It's like a,
it's like a tube.

1058
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:37.260
It looks like somebody took an apple core to the world.
Wow.

1059
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:39.180
I mean it doesn't look natural,
right?

1060
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:43.620
It looks like something somebody created Guatemala stink whole asshole.

1061
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.700
I just wanna see if it brings up,
yep.
Bright point.
Cool.
Look,

1062
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.460
somebody's tagged their photo Guatemala sinkhole.

1063
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.640
And if you just type an asshole,
it comes up.
Yeah.
And it says,
look,

1064
00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:56.370
when you click on it,
it gives you some sort of a warning.
Yeah.

1065
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.770
Visiting this site may harm your computer.
Hilarious.

1066
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.910
These guys that are doing these hacks and shit,
like that kind of stuff.

1067
00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.610
Who is that?
Is it Chinese or Russian?

1068
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:08.600
It's just something that occurs all over the world.
Nigeria.
Yeah.

1069
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:11.400
Cause they always tag.
They always name it to a country.
Yeah.

1070
00:55:11.401 --> 00:55:12.500
If you just Google switched.
Yeah.

1071
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.720
<v 0>From a Microsoft operating systems,</v>

1072
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.680
they made an announcement that they're going to merge to a using a Linux and

1073
00:55:18.681 --> 00:55:21.860
using Mac because uh,
the Chinese,
uh,

1074
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:25.730
fellows hacked them and fucked with their whole website and they say there's too

1075
00:55:25.731 --> 00:55:28.520
many security issues.
Yeah.
And Windows.

1076
00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.740
<v 3>Why did you hear it happening here?
Any of that?
Steve jobs talk the other day.</v>

1077
00:55:32.741 --> 00:55:36.280
He did this long talk at all things digital 2010.
No,

1078
00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:40.450
he was talking about through everything.
Uh,
if you go to Gizmodo GIC,

1079
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.470
<v 1>that's where I saw this whole,
the sinkhole.
Real Gizmodo too.</v>

1080
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:46.560
<v 3>Yeah.
He,
uh,
there's always videos or are up there.
And I,</v>

1081
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:49.720
it's kind of interesting hearing like a really intelligent person talk about the

1082
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:52.300
future of the Internet and stuff.
It's really interesting,

1083
00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:54.730
<v 0>you know,
I agree with him on a lot of things,</v>

1084
00:55:54.731 --> 00:55:56.350
but a lot of things I agree with his,

1085
00:55:56.410 --> 00:56:00.970
his detractors when it comes to open source things and it comes to,
uh,

1086
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.300
you know,
allowing people to create more applications and have things more,

1087
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:08.340
more open for the Mac and you know,
clones and things,
things of that nature.

1088
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.300
The ability to just,
by the operating system,

1089
00:56:10.301 --> 00:56:12.700
why do you have to buy the hardware and the operating system?
You know,

1090
00:56:12.701 --> 00:56:15.370
that's kind of,
I agree with that to a certain extent.

1091
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.180
But I also agree with like lookout when he controls everything.

1092
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:24.100
Look how great everything works,
you know,
when you,
yeah,
exactly.
I mean,
it's like,

1093
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:28.720
it's definitely cheaper to go to a store and buy,
you know,

1094
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:33.370
a hard drive and buy a motherboard and all that shit and put together your own

1095
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:37.030
box.
It's way cheaper.
I've done it a couple of times.
It's fun too,

1096
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.270
but you're going to have all sorts of issues.
The sound cards,

1097
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:43.420
not gonna want to work with tr tr certain motherboard that you have.

1098
00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:47.080
It's going to fuck up the video card fucks up.
You got to replace things.

1099
00:56:47.081 --> 00:56:49.810
You can't get the right drivers cause you got to do a lot of tweaking.

1100
00:56:49.811 --> 00:56:53.710
A lot of shit,
you know,
with a Mac.
All you have to just turn it on,
you know?

1101
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:57.260
That's why people don't like it.
It's people who could forgive.

1102
00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:02.170
Will you Fergie forgive.
No Idiots fucking Mac losers.

1103
00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:06.310
Just cause you don't know how to work at PC.
I've never got a virus.
Okay.

1104
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.690
I've been using a PC for 10 years.
I've never got a virus.
Yeah,
I started,

1105
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.480
I started with a windows 98 okay.

1106
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.810
And then they'll go off on you and they'll let you know they've never got a

1107
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:20.320
virus.
You know why?
Well,
I scan,
I'm not stupid.
I don't click random blinks,

1108
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.310
you know?

1109
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:24.970
<v 3>Yeah.
You know all these people,
if they had a Mac laptop I think,</v>

1110
00:57:24.971 --> 00:57:26.830
and a windows laptop,

1111
00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:29.620
I think if they have both of them don't end up using the Mac laptop after
awhile.

1112
00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.080
<v 0>Well it becomes a team thing.
We've discussed this before,
it becomes a,
you know,</v>

1113
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.470
a fucking Raiders versus the dolphins.
You know,

1114
00:57:36.471 --> 00:57:39.530
just people get crazy about teams and they get on team windows.

1115
00:57:39.531 --> 00:57:43.240
They never want to admit that they made horrible mistakes.
You know,

1116
00:57:43.241 --> 00:57:44.660
I was watching this documentary,

1117
00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:49.220
speaking of that on this Graham Hancock interview and I put it on my message

1118
00:57:49.221 --> 00:57:53.320
board.
You know,
Graham Hancock says no,
Graham Hancock is the guy that,
uh,

1119
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:56.950
he's this his duty wrote fingerprints of the Gods and uh,

1120
00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.010
he's done a bunch of underwater dives where he's found all this evidence of

1121
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:04.280
previous civilizations.
Pretty,
pretty interesting shit man.

1122
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:07.780
But one of the things in the videos,
they talk about the Sphinx.
You know,

1123
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:12.350
there's a whole bunch of geologists led by this Guy Ron shock at a Boston

1124
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:14.660
University that believed that the Sphinx is way,

1125
00:58:14.661 --> 00:58:18.160
way older than conventional Egyptologists have dated it.

1126
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.600
And they've dated it to 2,500 BC.

1127
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.710
And he says it's way older than that because he shows the geologist shows all

1128
00:58:24.711 --> 00:58:28.250
this water erosion,
all of the Sphinx.
And he said,
see this,

1129
00:58:28.251 --> 00:58:32.120
what you're looking at is clearly water erosion from thousands of years of

1130
00:58:32.121 --> 00:58:33.140
rainfall.
Well,

1131
00:58:33.141 --> 00:58:37.160
the last time there was rain fall in that area of the world was 7,000 BC.

1132
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.020
So you're looking at something that like,

1133
00:58:39.021 --> 00:58:42.250
it's gotta be a couple thousand years older than that because a couple thousand

1134
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:46.400
years of rainfall.
So you're talking about like at least 9,000 BC,
which is,

1135
00:58:46.401 --> 00:58:46.940
you know,

1136
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:51.290
that's like you're talking about like 7,000 years older than they think it is.

1137
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:54.400
That's longer between them and the age of the roof.

1138
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.920
The true age of the construction is spanx than it is between them and us.
I mean,

1139
00:58:57.921 --> 00:58:59.270
when you really put it into perspective,

1140
00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:04.010
it's 2000 years longer than the distance between the pharaohs of like two tongue

1141
00:59:04.011 --> 00:59:08.090
comment and us.
I mean,
that's pretty nutty shit when you think about it.
Well,

1142
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:12.260
he brought all this geological evidence to these conventional a Egyptologists

1143
00:59:12.261 --> 00:59:15.560
and archeologists and they wanted to dismiss it right away.
They wanted to say,

1144
00:59:15.561 --> 00:59:16.920
well,
this doesn't make no,
you,

1145
00:59:16.921 --> 00:59:19.670
you have no evidence of a culture that could build this.
You know?

1146
00:59:19.671 --> 00:59:20.900
So where's your evidence?
Show me some.

1147
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.650
Show me something that it comes from this area and so they say,
well,

1148
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:27.560
we're showing you all that would be left.
We're showing you some construction.

1149
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:29.760
There's not 10,000 years from now,
there's,

1150
00:59:29.761 --> 00:59:31.920
there's not going to be anything of us.
You know the,
the,

1151
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.090
you ever seen the pictures of Detroit where you see Detroit getting swallowed up

1152
00:59:35.091 --> 00:59:35.924
by the city?

1153
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.840
Like there's abandoned houses in Detroit where trees are grown out of the middle

1154
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.520
of the house.
It's crazy.

1155
00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:44.630
The earth is slowly starting to eat up all these abandoned buildings.

1156
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:45.200
That's awesome.

1157
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.560
There's a site that's dedicated to that in the Soviet Union to we're up like

1158
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:52.250
total towns had been like evacuated and left where trees are just like growing

1159
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:56.410
through houses now.
They just,
nature starts to retake things.
Well he,

1160
00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.080
he brought all this stuff to these Egyptologists and they just dug their hand

1161
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:03.320
head in the sand.
They didn't want to see the truth.
They didn't want to,

1162
01:00:03.321 --> 01:00:06.650
they didn't want to admit that they have been,
you know,

1163
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:11.330
doing things or teaching things that were not totally correct or wasn't the full

1164
01:00:11.331 --> 01:00:12.200
picture of the earth.

1165
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:17.000
And it's really crazy shit because this guy proposes that things like this

1166
01:00:17.001 --> 01:00:19.790
Guatemala Sinkhole,
like that's a little tiny one that's a little,

1167
01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:23.330
nothing happened.
You know,
a little thing opened up in a house,
fell through.

1168
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.150
But there's a bunch of different things that the earth can do like that.

1169
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.310
There's a bunch of different really insane thing like super volcanoes or you

1170
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.150
know,
tsunamis.
There's a m in the Canary Islands,
there's a volcanic rock,

1171
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.390
there's like a volcanic mountain sign that they know eventually it's going to

1172
01:00:38.391 --> 01:00:41.600
break off.
They know it's going to break off and slide into the ocean.

1173
01:00:41.601 --> 01:00:42.500
And when it does,

1174
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.980
they think that it's going to create a tsunami that will cover the entire

1175
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.650
eastern seaboard of the United States of America.

1176
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:53.030
Like miles in kills everyone.
Everyone's fucked.
I mean,

1177
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.690
there's so much rock there and there's a bunch of evidence that this kind of

1178
01:00:56.691 --> 01:00:57.800
shit has happened in the past.

1179
01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:00.020
There's going to be some other underwater earthquake,

1180
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.490
it's going to break off and it's going to head towards the United States at 500

1181
01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:08.990
feet high and a fucking hundred and 50 miles an hour and just smush everything.

1182
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:13.970
Wow.
Do probably more than 150 miles now.
I just pulled that number out of my ass.

1183
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.043
How do you like that?

1184
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:18.450
<v 3>Okay.
Have you just them,
have you been following that Foxcom Shit,</v>

1185
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.410
<v 0>dude,
you turned me on to that.</v>

1186
01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.900
And for the folks out there listening that don't know about this,

1187
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.540
Foxconn is a company,
well,
why don't you describe it?

1188
01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:30.510
<v 3>Foxconn is like a huge company and uh,
was it China?
Uh,
that,</v>

1189
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.050
that makes like most of the technology,
uh,
like,
you know,
like,
like the build,

1190
01:01:35.051 --> 01:01:39.280
like Nintendo's,
they build like psps that build apple computers.
They build,

1191
01:01:39.281 --> 01:01:43.540
you know,
iPods and stuff.
They're just really cheap,
almost like slave labor,

1192
01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:46.570
but they're not.
Uh,
and I think they get paid what was that?

1193
01:01:46.571 --> 01:01:51.340
$130 a month or something like that.
And there's like tons and tons of workers.

1194
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:55.990
But lately there's been all these suicides and it's almost daily.

1195
01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:00.340
If you follow gizmodo.com it's almost daily.
You'll see,
you know,

1196
01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:03.670
another suicide and another person jumps off a building.
I forget.

1197
01:02:03.671 --> 01:02:07.390
There's like been like 13 or something like that in the last this year or

1198
01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:09.070
something.
Well,
uh,

1199
01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.490
lately it's almost every day they'd been freaking out.

1200
01:02:12.491 --> 01:02:16.120
Like Nintendo's getting pissed and Steve Jobs has said he's going to get to the

1201
01:02:16.121 --> 01:02:19.000
bottom of it and figure out why all these people are committing suicide.

1202
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:23.280
They had to sign a contract saying that you will not commit suicide.

1203
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.400
And if you do,
they're not held responsible in any way.

1204
01:02:26.401 --> 01:02:30.160
So their families and stuff can't sue and stuff like that.
Then,
uh,

1205
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:35.130
about four days ago or a week ago,
they raise the pay 20%.

1206
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.330
They raised their whole entire pay 20% because they're trying to make everyone

1207
01:02:39.331 --> 01:02:43.470
happy and stuff.
Three days later they raised it to 30%.

1208
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.510
That's how fucking crazy it's getting.

1209
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.440
And then today they're scattered reports of a fire and they're like trying,

1210
01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:51.510
Foxcom is trying to keep this all hush hush.

1211
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.950
But I guess there might be a dozen workers ever either injured or dead.
Uh,

1212
01:02:55.951 --> 01:02:57.630
and it's,
it's getting out of control.

1213
01:02:57.631 --> 01:03:00.900
I'm not really sure what the fuck's going on here,
but it's starting to get like,

1214
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:01.171
all right,

1215
01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:04.320
there's something crazy going on in this factory that all these people are

1216
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:06.800
killing themselves and that there's,
you know,
I mean,

1217
01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.840
hasn't there been video released of a worker's getting beaten?
Yeah.

1218
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:12.510
That security guards are security guards from the plant.

1219
01:03:12.511 --> 01:03:15.740
There's a video of him them like beating up,
uh,

1220
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:19.680
the workers and uh,
you know,
and it's crazy when you think about it,

1221
01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:22.890
cause you were saying something about this earlier,
like how we expect like,

1222
01:03:22.891 --> 01:03:23.370
you know,

1223
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.880
iPhones to be a certain price and iPods to be a certain price and the only way

1224
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:30.820
that they're,
that certain prices because of these workers,
this slave labor,

1225
01:03:30.821 --> 01:03:31.230
right?

1226
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:33.830
<v 4>Yeah.
So they make about,
you said about a hundred dollars a month.</v>

1227
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:38.840
$130 a month is what I heard that they start at a pay wise and they live there

1228
01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.890
and I,
yeah,
it happened when it gets kind of like,
it's kind of like a community,

1229
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.880
like you live there like a,

1230
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:49.350
like a dorm room almost or something like that or it's,
I don't quite get it.

1231
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.610
So they sleep in like these dorms?
Yeah,
they live on,
on the,

1232
01:03:53.611 --> 01:03:55.020
on the factory.
Right.

1233
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:57.660
And they make shit money and they probably never get to leave.

1234
01:03:57.661 --> 01:04:01.120
Do they even get days off?
Uh,
I,
I don't know.
I,

1235
01:04:01.121 --> 01:04:02.800
I heard that they were pretty much work.

1236
01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:06.990
I'm nonstop day and night and they signed something in the contract saying that

1237
01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:10.770
they're going to be working overtime and stuff like that.
And I don't know,

1238
01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:11.850
but that's the only way.

1239
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:16.170
It's the only way you're going to get all these Goddamn iPhones for 500 bucks.

1240
01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.670
I mean,
that's,
uh,
that things should be like probably like $2,000,
you know,

1241
01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:24.630
if you had like workers that were paid correctly.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,

1242
01:04:24.631 --> 01:04:25.830
how much more money would it cost?

1243
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:29.790
Labor's a big part of the operations for any big business like that.
Right?
Yeah.

1244
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.120
<v 3>Yeah.
But you know,
it's,
it's funny cause like Steve Jobs was saying,
you know,</v>

1245
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:38.040
well look how many,
uh,
Walmart workers there are in the United States,
you know,

1246
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:40.890
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people and stuff like that.
And you know,

1247
01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:43.320
there's people you know,
dying,
you know,

1248
01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:46.650
kick suiciding all the time that worked for Walmart,
you know?
Yeah.

1249
01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:48.030
But that's a poor analogy.

1250
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.060
It's a poor analogy because you don't see people jumping off the top of

1251
01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:53.400
Walmart's buildings that,
you know,
you don't see that in the news.

1252
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.450
Another Walmart.

1253
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.400
<v 4>What are dead,
you know?
Well not only that,
it's voluntary.
Yeah.</v>

1254
01:04:57.410 --> 01:05:00.410
You could call Walmart tomorrow and go suck my dick or quit.
Right.

1255
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.960
And they'll go,
who cares?
You know,

1256
01:05:01.961 --> 01:05:03.820
they're not gonna come to your house and beat you up.
You know,

1257
01:05:03.821 --> 01:05:06.430
they're not going to wake you out of bed and stun you or something,
you know,

1258
01:05:06.431 --> 01:05:08.110
I don't know what they're doing people,
I'm just making shit up.

1259
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:12.530
<v 3>It's crazy.
Cause all the photos.
If you,
again,
the website's gives Giz,
m o,</v>

1260
01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:16.370
d o Gizmodo,
and just type in Foxconn or just look through it.
You'll see it.

1261
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:17.800
It's like on that first couple of pages.

1262
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.300
<v 1>But look at all the employees.
You just feel so it's so depressing.</v>

1263
01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:27.010
Very depressing.
It looks like almost like a jail.
Yeah,
it does.

1264
01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:31.300
Another Fox common employee dies after working 34 hours straight.

1265
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:34.960
This just happened today,
I guess.
Oh my God.
Yep.
June 2nd.

1266
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:39.850
This 28 year old man,
20 year old man married his wife for only three months ago.

1267
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:44.980
Died from exhaustion.
Oh my God.
34 hours.
Okay.

1268
01:05:44.981 --> 01:05:47.320
It says that's what his family is claiming anyway.
Yeah.

1269
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:51.250
No official statement that's been issued.
Well,
you know what,
I believe it.
Yeah.

1270
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.780
Well,
you know,
look,
it's possible.
Um,
uh,
I wouldn't be surprised,
you know,
I mean,

1271
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:59.320
it saddens you,
but it doesn't surprise you.
You know,
it's,
it's,
uh,

1272
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.820
it's really a sick thing,
you know,
that we have,
um,
this,
uh,

1273
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.620
this desire in this country to have new things.
And I mean,
it's not,

1274
01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:09.610
that's not the sick part of it,

1275
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:12.970
but the sick part of it is the only way to get these iPhones for 500 bucks is

1276
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:16.420
someone has to suffer.
Someone has to do something that they don't want to do.

1277
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:20.740
There's only one reason why companies move their factories to Guatemala or all

1278
01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:23.590
these impoverished places,
and they say,
look,
we're helping these people.

1279
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.110
It's because they're taking advantage of a different situation.

1280
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:29.380
They're taking advantage of a different economic situation at different

1281
01:06:29.381 --> 01:06:31.350
situations,
far as resources.
You know,

1282
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:34.210
if you go to China and there's a fucking billion people,
all right,

1283
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.720
they've got to do something.
You know,
when there's a billion fucking people,

1284
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.060
you're going to have a lot of people that are just laying around that needs

1285
01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:42.460
something to do.
You know,
they have to figure out a way to survive.

1286
01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:43.990
They have to figure out a way to feed themselves.

1287
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:46.030
You know what's weird is that when I've talked about this last week,

1288
01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:51.031
it was 12 people and I just read to hear that since last podcast a week ago,

1289
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.900
that number is now 16 whoa.
And they,
so fifth,
uh,

1290
01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.400
suicides have reached 15 potential 16 spotted on the roof right now.

1291
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:02.620
So they're actually writing this article and go,
wait and wait,

1292
01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:05.980
and here's the 16th one on the roof right now.
So they're just jumping every day.

1293
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:10.000
Yeah.
A couple of day,
someone's out there four and a week to two.
Uh,
I mean,

1294
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:12.430
salary increases in a week to salary increases.

1295
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:15.520
There's a fire and another person died today.
Well,
what good is having any money.

1296
01:07:15.521 --> 01:07:17.780
If you can't use it,
you can't even spend it,
you know,

1297
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:22.330
pumping their salary up 30%.
It's not going to shit.
Yeah.
It doesn't mean amazing.

1298
01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:25.210
These people need back rubs and fless lights.
Yeah.
What does that mean?

1299
01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:29.590
They get 150 bucks a month?
I mean,
that's crazy.
That's a sick,
sick thing.

1300
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:32.800
It's just,
it's fucking sad.
It's sad that this is the only way to do it.

1301
01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.340
And it's also sad that if these people weren't doing this,

1302
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:39.370
if you talk about like third world countries or countries that are all fucked
up,

1303
01:07:39.371 --> 01:07:40.380
that you know,
uh,

1304
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.400
the United States exploits or United States corporations rather exploiting.

1305
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:47.110
And go over there and start businesses and w what would these people be doing if

1306
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:49.690
the United States wasn't there?
That's the thing.
It's like,

1307
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:52.720
why are they living so badly?
Why they saw impoverished?

1308
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:57.370
Would it benefit us to have them rise up to our level?
Would it benefit us?

1309
01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:57.641
You know,

1310
01:07:57.641 --> 01:08:01.420
to instead of exporting them to go over there and educate these people and try

1311
01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:04.870
to get them to start producing their own,
you know,
democratic society with,

1312
01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.291
you know,

1313
01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:08.920
good businesses and trade goods and services and get everything to go pump in

1314
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:11.020
and introduce them to new technology and shit.

1315
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.610
Would it benefit us to have them or would they just become competition?
You know?

1316
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.520
I mean,
why is it that the United States

1317
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:19.130
<v 0>corporations,
these big corporations just do that?
I mean,</v>

1318
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:21.770
they go over there and help these people a little bit to give them money and

1319
01:08:21.771 --> 01:08:25.070
shit and you know,
they give people jobs and solve them.

1320
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.630
Some of them might be happy with that,

1321
01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:29.450
but for the most part they're taking advantage of people that are willing to

1322
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:31.820
work for pennies on the dollar compared to Americans.
Right.

1323
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.400
Would it benefit them to like really build up a country would have benefit the

1324
01:08:35.401 --> 01:08:39.170
United States if there was no third world,
you know?
Is that possible?

1325
01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.220
Is it possible that we're ever going to come to a time where there is no worry

1326
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:47.390
about like there's no Mexico,
there's no place where you go,
where it sucks.

1327
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.810
There's no place where you go,
where everything's,
you know all your fuck now.

1328
01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.770
<v 3>No,
it's just getting worse.
I think it's just getting,</v>

1329
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:55.910
there's more places getting that you don't want to go to.
I'm just not,

1330
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.870
you know what I mean?
It's getting worse and worse.

1331
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.240
<v 0>Right.
Is that possible to recover from though?
I don't.
I don't know.</v>

1332
01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:05.080
What would it be like if instead of,
I mean this is all totally hypothetical,

1333
01:09:05.081 --> 01:09:09.220
but do you think it's possible as a human being to instead of doing what we're

1334
01:09:09.221 --> 01:09:10.220
doing,
you know,

1335
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.120
certain corporations would go to different countries and exploit the people

1336
01:09:13.121 --> 01:09:17.440
instead of doing that?
What if they decided to try to,
as much as possible,

1337
01:09:17.441 --> 01:09:20.320
like on a whole,
instead of controlling the resources of the world,

1338
01:09:20.321 --> 01:09:22.150
we try to make everything a level.

1339
01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:25.930
We try to bring everybody up as far as like the,
you know,
the,

1340
01:09:25.931 --> 01:09:28.960
the quality of their society and the quality of their culture,
you know,

1341
01:09:28.961 --> 01:09:31.780
the quality of their,
their information and,
you know,

1342
01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:34.570
the Internet and all that shit and give it to everybody and try to pump them up.

1343
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.750
Will that benefit us?
Would that benefit human beings as a whole?

1344
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:40.180
They wouldn't it?
Yeah,
but no,

1345
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.510
because then how the fuck you going to get an iPhone for 500 bucks?
You know,

1346
01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:46.190
because unless you've got a robot that knows how to make an iPhone swim,

1347
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:50.740
<v 3>I think [inaudible] slave laborers that are just going to die off because of</v>

1348
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.530
robots in factory lines or the housing complex.

1349
01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:56.800
I was going to die off because the robots do it.
Well,
I mean there's,

1350
01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.070
they're going to be factories to build robots,
I guess.
But,
uh,
you know,

1351
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:04.900
like just factory,
like,
you know,
when you look at cars,
how cars are manufactured,

1352
01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:06.890
you know,
half of it's done by robots,
right?

1353
01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:09.220
<v 0>The person who's willing to work for $100 a week,</v>

1354
01:10:09.221 --> 01:10:11.740
it's probably way cheaper than a robot that's going to do his job.

1355
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.590
So I think they're always going to have robots for certain things just because

1356
01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:17.140
you can get a lot of people that work fucking cheapest shit.

1357
01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:22.000
Robots are expensive,
dude.
Unless robot technology gets like super mainstream,

1358
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:24.720
<v 3>it's going to get mainstream and robots are going to be mainstreamed or I'm</v>

1359
01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.960
already fucking,
I have an alarm clock that can watch movies on now.
You know,

1360
01:10:27.961 --> 01:10:31.120
it's,
you know,
it's,
it's the more to computers grow,
technology grows.

1361
01:10:31.121 --> 01:10:33.400
There's going to be more robots and the robots are definitely

1362
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:35.810
<v 0>calming,
but the world is going to be like your own house,</v>

1363
01:10:35.811 --> 01:10:39.980
then we're one thing fucks up and the whole thing just goes to the Goddamn

1364
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.990
Haywire.
Totally going to be like that is going to be like that.
Right?
Yeah,

1365
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.750
absolutely.
That's the big,

1366
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.940
<v 3>there was,
yeah.
What there's a shit.
I don't know if we,
I don't know.</v>

1367
01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:47.571
We did not talk about,

1368
01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:51.140
this I talked to about with a couple of long time ago in these podcasts,

1369
01:10:51.141 --> 01:10:53.030
I talked about how people are hacking.

1370
01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.450
How'd the idea that you could hack into somebody's car and like slam on the

1371
01:10:56.451 --> 01:10:56.711
brakes.

1372
01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:59.750
So actually there was a report a couple of weeks ago where people will actually

1373
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:02.090
start doing that to onstar.
Where that you could,

1374
01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.090
they could hack into people's Onstar's and like stop their cars and there was

1375
01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:08.380
hackers,
I think Mexico,
Mexican gangs or something like that.

1376
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:12.980
We're starting to do that where they're hacking into peoples onstar.
Uh,

1377
01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:17.920
and like fucking with your shit and finding out where they're at.
Finding,
yeah.

1378
01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.650
I guess Onstar has a security hole in it right now.

1379
01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:24.560
<v 1>Oh my God,
I've never heard of that.
Yeah,
sure.
You better fucking Google this son.</v>

1380
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:29.030
I don't get sued.
No,
totally Google this onstar hack.

1381
01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:31.140
Yeah.
We need to find out the songs.

1382
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:36.210
<v 3>Onstar GPS Hakka Day.
Uh,
let's go to news onstar.</v>

1383
01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:38.090
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1384
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:42.410
<v 3>Modern automobile.
Super Vulnerable to hacking.
Researchers say</v>

1385
01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:47.330
<v 1>so.
It's not Mexicans.
I forget.
[inaudible] Mexicans all the time.</v>

1386
01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:50.150
No,
but there was something,
yeah,
offend all the Mexicans out there.

1387
01:11:50.151 --> 01:11:54.950
We have Mexican listeners,
so people from Mexico.
Okay.
So I want you to be nice.

1388
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.980
I got people from Mexico.

1389
01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:56.873
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1390
01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.310
<v 3>So anyways,
yeah,</v>

1391
01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:02.480
I guess whatever thing I saw was something about the Onstar had a security hole

1392
01:12:02.481 --> 01:12:04.120
in it and people were uh,

1393
01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:09.170
hackers tapping the ECU to kill engine brakes in more blah blah.
Here we go.

1394
01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.870
This is it auto blog.com.

1395
01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.240
<v 1>Yeah.
But is that as Onstar and Ecu the same thing?
I don't think so.</v>

1396
01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.530
Now they're starting to

1397
01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:19.410
<v 3>moving into the age of connected vehicles.</v>

1398
01:12:19.411 --> 01:12:23.790
The risk of rapidly increasing onstar already has the ability to remotely slow a

1399
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:25.180
stolen car.
Ford is current.

1400
01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:29.540
<v 1>Yeah,
I saw that in the ad for the new corvette.
There's a,
um,</v>

1401
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:32.400
I was looking at this,
uh,
this is a corvette grand sport.

1402
01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:36.380
It's a pretty cool looking convertible.
And I was looking at it online and uh,

1403
01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.370
one of the benefits was this onstar thing and so they showed it or this guy

1404
01:12:40.371 --> 01:12:44.420
fucking calls Onstar is friends driving his car and he says the vehicle stolen

1405
01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:47.390
our,
I'll start,
shuts the car down while,
while you're driving.
Yeah.

1406
01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:47.851
<v 3>It,</v>

1407
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:51.760
this research that the universities of California and Washington will present a

1408
01:12:51.761 --> 01:12:53.590
paper at a security conference in Oakland,

1409
01:12:53.591 --> 01:12:56.620
California next week outlining how they were able to hack into a vehicle's

1410
01:12:56.621 --> 01:12:57.454
computer system.

1411
01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.760
<v 1>Wow.
It only makes sense,
especially the government man.</v>

1412
01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.880
<v 3>It like our,
right,
I threw in Mexicans.
I don't know why I thought that.</v>

1413
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:09.080
<v 1>Dude,
how crazy is that?
You're running from the cops.
Even your fucking corvette.</v>

1414
01:13:09.081 --> 01:13:10.940
You're looking at God damn 1970s movie

1415
01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.710
and all of a sudden onstar kills your vet.
Yeah.

1416
01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.150
What kind of gay on American Shit is that?
Yeah.
You know,

1417
01:13:20.151 --> 01:13:23.750
I'm not saying you should be allowed to have a car chase everywhere,

1418
01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:28.610
but I'm saying maybe sometimes you run from the cops cause you're right.
Okay.

1419
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.210
Maybe they're wrong and you're right and you've got to prove them that the one

1420
01:13:32.211 --> 01:13:34.460
armed man killed your wife and you know,

1421
01:13:34.461 --> 01:13:36.770
and they don't understand you're innocent.
You're just,

1422
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:39.380
you just try to bring those who are responsible to justice.

1423
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.120
You know that the cops are gonna let you talk.

1424
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.620
They're going to fucking lock you in a,

1425
01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.530
in a cell when you really need to be out there doing the investigative work to

1426
01:13:45.531 --> 01:13:48.500
find out where that killer is.
And you're in the middle of doing this.

1427
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:50.030
Like you're in a goddamn movie.

1428
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:57.320
Fucking cops can't keep up with your vet.
Okay?
You're a fucking faggot.

1429
01:13:57.321 --> 01:13:58.340
He asks caprice,

1430
01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:02.660
your Shitty old 200,000 mile on caprice with,

1431
01:14:02.661 --> 01:14:04.850
with fucking shitty suspension.

1432
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.600
It smells like shit when you hit the gas that can't compete with a Goddamn

1433
01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.160
American corvette.

1434
01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.970
<v 3>Not to mention there was a case looks like 2002</v>

1435
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.260
<v 4>that,
uh,</v>

1436
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:18.820
the Scott Peterson case where they got a search warrant to check his vehicles

1437
01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:23.821
gps information because he was a for a murder and they got to know where exactly

1438
01:14:24.521 --> 01:14:29.140
where he was on that date and stuff like that.
My goodness.
Yeah.

1439
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.650
So at,
so it's tracking you and you,

1440
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:36.850
you're sending information to Onstar and if you ever get fucked in like putting

1441
01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:39.490
in a weird situation.
I don't even think that's Onstar.

1442
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.950
I think that's just his gps,
which is like what we all have.
Oh,

1443
01:14:44.951 --> 01:14:49.810
it is audacious onstar.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.

1444
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:55.510
That's crazy.
Yeah.
So I,
you know,
I always thought for some scary shit.

1445
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.650
I don't like that.
Yeah,

1446
01:14:56.770 --> 01:15:00.580
but that's what [inaudible] are in your fucking wife either asshole.
Yeah.

1447
01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.910
That is with every cell phone ping where your phone is.
Yeah.

1448
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:07.270
Some I've heard that it can ping on your phone is with some phones.

1449
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.780
Even if your phone isn't on,
like they can ping it.
I heard that too.

1450
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:12.160
How's that possible?
I don't know.

1451
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:16.180
Is there some sort of perpetual power source inside of your phone?

1452
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.420
Like a little tiny one?
I think what they're saying is if it,
if,

1453
01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:23.170
I mean if there's a battery in it,
you know what I mean?
But it's not on,

1454
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.560
if it's not on,
it's shit's never all the way off.
I don't think.

1455
01:15:26.561 --> 01:15:28.450
You know what I mean?
Like,
yeah,

1456
01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:31.690
like when you turn off like a computer,

1457
01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:35.290
there's still power in the computer.
Right?
Yeah,
I've heard that before,

1458
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:38.920
but I don't understand it and know how the fuck is that happening now with your

1459
01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:42.070
phone though,
because the phones are pretty much like computers,
you know,

1460
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.500
I mean to know that that's true.
That's something nonsense.
No,

1461
01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:46.720
I mean if you think about it,
there's,
there's,

1462
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.410
there's of course there's shit's always going to be on,
you know,

1463
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.430
you always hear weird creepy dudes that put like gps on their wife's car fall

1464
01:15:54.431 --> 01:15:54.880
around,

1465
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.740
but they sell six cars best buy the other day and they had in the clearance
rack,

1466
01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:04.510
they had this thing that was for kids that uh,
anytime you want to,

1467
01:16:04.511 --> 01:16:08.200
if you know,
you put this thing on your kids,
you know,
kid in anytime you want,

1468
01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:11.050
you can go on this computer website and find out exactly where they're at and

1469
01:16:11.051 --> 01:16:14.290
track them life.
And it was like 69 bucks or something like that.

1470
01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.290
I'm thinking like you could easily just buy one of these things and throw it in

1471
01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:21.080
somebody's back of their car.
It's,
yeah,
easily.
It's so great.
Yeah,

1472
01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.710
just glue it to the back of their car somewhere.

1473
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.140
Stick it under their bumper or something.
Yeah,
for sure.

1474
01:16:26.141 --> 01:16:28.990
They would never find it totally.
How the fuck would,
you know,
dude,

1475
01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:32.140
that's a scary ass thing when you think about it.
How many stalkers,

1476
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.250
especially if you're a chick,

1477
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.200
how many fucking creepy dudes out there that could be,

1478
01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:37.900
that's how popper razzies get their shit.
I bet you know.
But they have,

1479
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:43.020
I bet you if you're a high end celebrity that I bet you get tracked all the
time.

1480
01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:47.320
Step Holloway Story.
The girl who was,
she was on vacation,

1481
01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:51.840
some dudes murder and I remember that they couldn't figure out who killed her.

1482
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:56.170
Right?
So there's a bunch of people that question one of the kids that they had a

1483
01:16:56.171 --> 01:16:59.590
question.
He's on the run right now in Chile.

1484
01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:02.410
He's running because he killed a woman in Peru,
right?

1485
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:05.500
He killed some chick a in our or hotel room.

1486
01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:10.100
Like I guess this dude just likes killing checks.
Okay.
Yeah.
Dexter,
how scary

1487
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.210
<v 1>is that,
man?
This guy's out there running free.
If you have kids,
man,</v>

1488
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.300
if you have girls,
especially that stuff really trips you out.

1489
01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:20.360
It really trips you out when you start having little people that you care about

1490
01:17:20.361 --> 01:17:23.120
or eat,
you know,
wife that you care about or your sister that you care about.

1491
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.500
You really start thinking about how fucked up the idea that someone out there

1492
01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:29.840
would,
would harm someone weaker than them like that.

1493
01:17:29.841 --> 01:17:31.820
Someone would do that and pray off that and that.

1494
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:33.860
That would be the thing all the fucking time,
man.

1495
01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.130
Especially I just finished watching season two of text or now I'm like really

1496
01:17:37.131 --> 01:17:40.190
paranoid about everything.
Well,
there's real people like that out there.
I know.

1497
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:43.400
Like we were talking about the MMA guy that cut his fucking friends heart out.

1498
01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.700
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.
Some,

1499
01:17:45.701 --> 01:17:50.630
some dude in northern California drank some mushrooms with his friend.

1500
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:56.360
He's putting to two things in a terrible light.
MMA and mushrooms.

1501
01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.280
Drank some mushrooms with his friend and then decided that there was some sort

1502
01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:06.281
of a war going on between good and evil and that he had a fucking kill Satan by

1503
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:11.780
cutting his friend's heart out and cooking it.
What the fuck,

1504
01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.300
son?
Yeah,
and I have never thought to ever do that with mushrooms.

1505
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:20.180
I guess I've never had that kind of mushroom trip where I've gotten violent.

1506
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:24.110
Mine's more like an everything's beautiful life.
Not well,

1507
01:18:24.111 --> 01:18:28.280
that's the worry with everything,
man.
It's what are you coming to the table with?

1508
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:31.570
The worry with everything is not,
you know,
what mushrooms do you install?

1509
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:35.080
How fucked up are you before you get the mushrooms in you,
you know,

1510
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.140
was it mushrooms that fucked you up or are you just fucking crazy and it was

1511
01:18:39.141 --> 01:18:40.640
going to happen anyway?
You know?

1512
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:43.730
I mean if you take a dude who's completely loony and you give a mushrooms,

1513
01:18:43.731 --> 01:18:47.120
that's not a good call.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you ask,

1514
01:18:47.121 --> 01:18:49.370
speaking of know the reason why,
sorry.

1515
01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.490
You know the reason why that that even exists,
why it happens like that?

1516
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:55.280
It's because mushrooms are illegal.
If mushrooms are illegal,

1517
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:59.150
we would find out what the dosages we would find out like,
oh,
this contains,

1518
01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.930
you know,
x milligrams of Siliciden,
you know,
don't take more than two.

1519
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.620
Do not drive.
You know,
it would say some shit on the label,
you know,

1520
01:19:06.621 --> 01:19:11.240
and you could say,
Oh hey doctor,
I'm on the antidepressants and,

1521
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:14.540
and I'm on bipolar medication.
Some add shit.

1522
01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:17.450
Should I be taking mushrooms and doctor go,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1523
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:18.320
If you're going to take mushrooms,

1524
01:19:18.321 --> 01:19:21.080
you've got to get off all that other stuff because that'll fuck with the way

1525
01:19:21.081 --> 01:19:22.700
your brain chemistry,
you'll totally,

1526
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:26.300
totally misinterpret the world is this guy was probably on some antidepressants

1527
01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:27.980
or some shit too.
You know,

1528
01:19:27.981 --> 01:19:30.620
I knew some people that are on antidepressants when they would drink,

1529
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.470
they would drink and they would get this dude.
I know he gets crazy,

1530
01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:37.310
like he's not even there anymore.
It's like he gets like glossy eyed and a,

1531
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:40.010
and he starts saying stupid shit in front of his wife.

1532
01:19:40.011 --> 01:19:42.800
He'll say stupid shit and like,
he's like,
like trying to be funny,

1533
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:45.650
but it's not like he's nuts normally.
He's a great guy,

1534
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:49.550
but he has a couple of drinks in him and this fucking loon comes out.

1535
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:53.480
This Weirdo loony guy who doesn't know what he's doing.
He can't control himself.

1536
01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:58.400
God bless alcohol.
Crazy,
right?
Yeah.
It's fucking amazing.

1537
01:19:58.401 --> 01:20:01.970
Then in 2010 that's the easiest shit to get ahold of.
You know,

1538
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:04.910
but you can't change it.
How are you going to change it?

1539
01:20:04.911 --> 01:20:07.040
You're going to deny people there were alcohol after they already have it.

1540
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.160
How the fuck you got to do that?

1541
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:10.530
<v 0>He'd have to get the mushrooms legal.</v>

1542
01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:12.570
<v 2>We spend on drugs and illegal.</v>

1543
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:15.390
We should talk about going to the weed doctor the other day cause we had it as

1544
01:20:15.391 --> 01:20:17.220
an interesting thing came up when we were there,

1545
01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:21.660
we were talking to our doctor about legalizing marijuana.

1546
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.230
It was for or against it and he,

1547
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:28.140
you could see in his eyes he was not,

1548
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.830
he was kind of like taken by the question like,
ah,

1549
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:35.100
do I tell him the truth or not?
He's like,
I'm,
he's like,
I'm kind of on the fence.

1550
01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.100
Tricky

1551
01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:36.830
<v 0>position.
Yeah.</v>

1552
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:40.390
You're a guy who makes a living by giving people a prescriptions and he's not

1553
01:20:40.391 --> 01:20:43.200
cheap.
No,
no.
He's a,
he's got an office in Hollywood.

1554
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:46.690
It's probably very expensive to maintain and he just charges some money.
Yeah.

1555
01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:50.500
And a,
I give the guy slack because I know that he,
uh,
went to jail.

1556
01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:54.760
He was one of the earliest guys who was involved with the medical marijuana

1557
01:20:54.761 --> 01:20:58.240
community and a,
he's a real nice guy.
So I like him.

1558
01:20:58.330 --> 01:21:01.750
I respect his sacrifice.
So,
you know,

1559
01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:05.050
we don't go doctor shopping for someone who's cheaper to get a recommendation.

1560
01:21:05.051 --> 01:21:05.884
I just go to him.

1561
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.270
<v 2>But it's weird though,
if you think about it like you,</v>

1562
01:21:08.271 --> 01:21:12.060
you want to think these medical marijuana guys that are trying to get,
you know,

1563
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.040
Lee,
we'd legalized and stuff.

1564
01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:16.680
You want to think they're in it for the right reasons.

1565
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:18.330
But then when you really come down,

1566
01:21:18.331 --> 01:21:22.230
and pretty much what he was saying is he's not really happy about it because

1567
01:21:22.231 --> 01:21:24.030
he's going to be losing money.

1568
01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:26.770
<v 0>Well,
he's going to be out of a business.
You're going to be out of business,</v>

1569
01:21:26.771 --> 01:21:28.480
not just losing money is going to be losing all of his,
yeah.

1570
01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:32.010
<v 2>Right.
So he's not really in it.
So,
you know,
it's weird</v>

1571
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.450
<v 0>afflicted.
He was honest about that.
Yeah.
He was honest about,
well,
you know,</v>

1572
01:21:35.451 --> 01:21:38.390
it puts me in a tricky situation and so I was like,
yeah,
what would you do?

1573
01:21:38.391 --> 01:21:38.931
And you know,

1574
01:21:38.931 --> 01:21:41.450
he started talking about vitamin therapy in a couple of other things that it

1575
01:21:41.451 --> 01:21:44.840
does.
Right.
You know,
so yeah.
I mean,
if you look at it from his point of view,

1576
01:21:44.841 --> 01:21:49.060
I mean,
think about it.
The guy gets locked up in jail so that he can,
uh,

1577
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:51.110
keep serving people.

1578
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:54.470
This natural medicine that helps them with all their ailments and he's a doctor.

1579
01:21:54.471 --> 01:21:54.711
Okay.

1580
01:21:54.711 --> 01:21:58.430
So he's working with cancer patients and he's working with people with glaucoma

1581
01:21:58.431 --> 01:22:02.090
and all sorts of different issues that can be assisted by cannabis.

1582
01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.060
As long as these people can get ahold of good quality stuff.

1583
01:22:05.061 --> 01:22:07.070
And he not only fights for that,

1584
01:22:07.071 --> 01:22:09.740
believes in that tries to enforce the letter of the law,

1585
01:22:09.741 --> 01:22:12.380
which is or tries to operate within the letter of the law,

1586
01:22:12.381 --> 01:22:16.340
which was like in 1996 the law was passed in California for medical marijuana

1587
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:19.460
and they want to blocking them in jail.
So you know,

1588
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:23.090
and to have like that kind of sacrifice for something you believe in and

1589
01:22:23.091 --> 01:22:26.630
ultimately have it like pulled out from under you with progress.

1590
01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:30.560
Well he needs to diversify as fucking business.

1591
01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.780
He needs to move on to something else with weed.
You know,

1592
01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:36.170
you need to start cooking it,
dude.
You know,
that's what you need to do.
Okay.

1593
01:22:36.171 --> 01:22:39.410
You're a doctor.
How about you know doctor,
let's call them Johnson.

1594
01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.550
Dr Johnson's pot cookies.
Have your big smiling face on them.

1595
01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.490
Make some super fucking badass cookies.

1596
01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.370
<v 2>I heard stuff from somebody the other day that they heard from their guys that</v>

1597
01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:51.960
they're going to stop edibles

1598
01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:54.240
<v 0>in California.
Edibles are spooky.
You know,</v>

1599
01:22:54.241 --> 01:22:56.570
they stopped at a bolts in Holland today.
Yeah,

1600
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:59.220
you can't get an edibles in Holland.
The reason why,

1601
01:22:59.230 --> 01:23:02.160
we've talked about this on the show before,
but for the folks that don't know,

1602
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.160
when you eat marijuana,
it creates a totally different chemical that is

1603
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:10.420
<v 1>present when you smoke marijuana but not in psychoactive doses.</v>

1604
01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:13.480
And what that means is when you eat it,
when you eat pot,

1605
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:17.170
the THC as it goes through your liver is processing.

1606
01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:22.230
There's something that's called 11 hydroxy metabolite and this 11 hydroxy is

1607
01:23:22.721 --> 01:23:26.770
four times more psychoactive than THC,
four times stronger,
you know,

1608
01:23:26.771 --> 01:23:31.630
per weight of the dose,
but a totally different effect.
It's not the same effect.

1609
01:23:31.631 --> 01:23:34.690
Like you know how it is when you get high,
if you just smoke some weed,

1610
01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:38.740
you know you get,
you get a certain,
there's a certain sensation,

1611
01:23:38.741 --> 01:23:42.670
there's a certain way you see things,
there's a certain door that gets opened,

1612
01:23:42.671 --> 01:23:45.730
a certain frequency that gets turned on.
Well,
when you eat it,

1613
01:23:45.731 --> 01:23:48.760
it's not the same frequency.
Right.
Don't you feel it?
I mean,
it's fun,

1614
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:52.600
but it's a totally different thing.
It's a totally different drug.
Yeah,
totally.

1615
01:23:52.601 --> 01:23:55.870
I don't like actually like edibles at all.
It freaks a lot of people out.

1616
01:23:55.990 --> 01:24:00.130
We know people that have had like massive crying fits because they,

1617
01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:03.040
they smoked pot and then thought about some shit that they did.
I've done that.

1618
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:07.000
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
That always happens on edibles.
Whenever,

1619
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:11.500
whenever I waterfall it,
I always find that,
um,
the,

1620
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:16.180
the edibles make me the most introspective makes me make me the most conscious

1621
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:20.890
about my own personal decisions,
my own personal behavior,
you know,

1622
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.220
and it's like they correct me the most,
you know,

1623
01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:28.480
I get the most corrections from being super high on edibles.
Really.

1624
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.200
I feel like I'm tripping,
I think,
and I don't know,
it's just not,

1625
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.910
not the right frame of mind at all.

1626
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.020
It's so overwhelming and it's so powerful that when,

1627
01:24:37.050 --> 01:24:39.220
and this is what happens when you get super,
super high.

1628
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:41.530
When it's so overwhelming and so powerful,

1629
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:46.390
anything negative that's in your mind is going to be brought to the surface and

1630
01:24:46.391 --> 01:24:50.500
highlighted.
So it's like this drug or this chemical,

1631
01:24:50.501 --> 01:24:51.400
whatever it is,

1632
01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:56.730
is this unstoppable force that's in your brain and just wants to run free.

1633
01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.260
It just wants to spin around and create and the your imagination when you're

1634
01:25:02.261 --> 01:25:06.130
super high,
especially if on edibles is really shocking.

1635
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.690
Like sometimes I write things and I swear I can't take credit for these ideas

1636
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:11.590
and thoughts because they're just,

1637
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.170
they're just being pulled out of the ether by this weed.

1638
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:15.550
I mean that's really what it is,

1639
01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:20.590
but it has to have a free track to drive around on.

1640
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.770
It has to have free range of your thought.

1641
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:27.310
If there's something that's fucking with you in your head,
you know,

1642
01:25:27.311 --> 01:25:29.890
like a relationship that you're trying to get out of or you know,

1643
01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:33.520
some argument that you had with your parents that's like really fucking

1644
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.400
bothering you.
Something that's really eating away at you,

1645
01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:40.390
something you did when you regret doing it,
anything like that.

1646
01:25:40.391 --> 01:25:44.470
Any speed bumps are going to be highlighted and you're just going to put

1647
01:25:44.471 --> 01:25:46.740
spotlights all over this fucking area of your,

1648
01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:49.930
your thought process and it's going to make it very uncomfortable.

1649
01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:53.710
So in one way that very uncomfortable feeling,
that paranoia,

1650
01:25:53.711 --> 01:25:57.700
that shit is good because it makes you come to grips with some things that maybe

1651
01:25:57.701 --> 01:26:00.790
you weren't thinking about correctly or some things that maybe you weren't

1652
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:03.800
giving them your full attention and maybe you had a distorted perception of what

1653
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:07.790
they really are and you know,
the,
the,
the high is going to illuminate it for you.

1654
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:10.040
You know?
So to me it's like,
it's almost like,

1655
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.790
like someone yelling at you to clean your room,
you know,
hey,

1656
01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:16.760
clean your mind shithead.
He got this stuff that's bugging you,
clean your mind.

1657
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.920
But it's not easy.
It's like some high level black belts,
shit,

1658
01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:26.960
that's what edibles are.
Edibles are like,
that's like some Shaolin Monk Fucking,

1659
01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:30.350
you know,
top of the Temple Dodge and arrows.
Shit.
You know,

1660
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:34.640
you can't just go right into a pot cookie when you know you're not really,

1661
01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:35.350
you're,
you,
you,

1662
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:37.850
you're not the type of person that's been exploring their consciousness.

1663
01:26:37.851 --> 01:26:40.820
You're not taking yoga,
you're not trying to clean yourself out.

1664
01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:43.900
You're just a regular dude with a bunch of fucking problems.
And you know,

1665
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:46.790
some creepy memories in your past and you need a puck cookie,

1666
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:48.740
you could wind up crying yourself to death.

1667
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.530
<v 2>I don't know,
man.
I,
I don't get that feeling from pockets at all.</v>

1668
01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:59.720
<v 1>Did you can get a strong way.
Oh fuck you.
Every now and then you get one.
Yet</v>

1669
01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.860
<v 2>to me it's not like I'm learning anything about anything.
It's more of like,
man,</v>

1670
01:27:02.861 --> 01:27:03.760
I'm fucked up

1671
01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.100
<v 1>and my heart is,
but you don't,</v>

1672
01:27:05.101 --> 01:27:07.770
you don't have like an introspective thing where it makes you start thinking

1673
01:27:07.771 --> 01:27:12.150
about you yourself and then how you,
how you stand in the world at all.
Wow.

1674
01:27:12.151 --> 01:27:13.440
That's weird.
Maybe with me,

1675
01:27:13.441 --> 01:27:16.230
it's just triggering some natural responses that already have,

1676
01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.800
that are always going on anyway.

1677
01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.610
<v 2>It's probably what it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
so yeah,</v>

1678
01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:26.430
the people are saying that the pot edible things in Hollins bullshit that,
that,

1679
01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.370
that they still saw him there.

1680
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:28.440
<v 1>You know what?
I think they're right.</v>

1681
01:27:28.441 --> 01:27:31.890
I think I'm thinking of mushrooms now that I think about it.

1682
01:27:31.891 --> 01:27:36.150
I think the argument was the,
the um,
the edible things was America.
No,

1683
01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:39.720
you know what?
I think somebody told me that.
But you know what,

1684
01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.490
I didn't do any Google search on the Internet,

1685
01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:45.720
but I have heard about the edibles thing and California that there's some

1686
01:27:45.721 --> 01:27:49.350
concern and you know it's because it's some really potent shit.

1687
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:51.650
What there's not concerned about those.
This Scott,

1688
01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.700
and I hate to say this cause I don't want to make it illegal.

1689
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.050
Salvia is available and fucking head shops.
Yeah,
he can go get Salvia.

1690
01:27:58.051 --> 01:27:59.820
And for those folks who don't know,

1691
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:02.240
there's some shit that you can buy in head shops like yeah,

1692
01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:05.670
we get like a high times magazine and there's that page when you open it up and

1693
01:28:05.671 --> 01:28:10.350
it's like near bud fake bud,
you know?
No,

1694
01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.490
it's not real.
It doesn't do anything.
It's disgusting.
Yeah.

1695
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.750
I talked to one of the dudes from high times and he was telling me that they

1696
01:28:15.751 --> 01:28:19.140
make a ton of money off that stuff and I was like,
that makes me sad.

1697
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.980
<v 2>I think I remember as a kid buying shit that was fake just just in case if it</v>

1698
01:28:23.981 --> 01:28:27.680
works,
you know like I remember doing,
I don't know if it was fake weed or why,

1699
01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:29.200
but it was like,
I remember it was a lot of money.

1700
01:28:29.201 --> 01:28:33.420
It was like 30 40 bucks and I feel like one of those things that we were 18 we

1701
01:28:33.421 --> 01:28:35.480
were like,
oh yeah,
I could feel it.
I can feel it.
Yeah,

1702
01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:38.620
<v 1>yeah,
no and I was when I was like 12 we used to smoke everything.</v>

1703
01:28:38.621 --> 01:28:41.740
We just smoked bamboo leaves bananas.
You smoked banana?

1704
01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:44.780
<v 2>Yeah.
Have you ever done that banana?
Because yeah,
you can smoke banana peels.</v>

1705
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.033
It's bananas.

1706
01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:49.890
<v 1>We tried smoking,
all sorts of stuff.
We've got cigars.
I tried chewing tobacco.</v>

1707
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.570
Kids are stupid.
They try all sorts of stupid shit.
But snuff,
snuff is that stuff.

1708
01:28:54.571 --> 01:28:59.571
It's like ground up tobacco and it's like got all sorts of shit and mental and

1709
01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:03.750
it's probably like this filled with chemicals and you stuff it in between your

1710
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:06.600
cheek and your gum and it gives you this mad nicotine rush.

1711
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:10.200
How great is it that Lindsay Lohan found a loophole to get her drugs during this

1712
01:29:10.201 --> 01:29:13.420
probation time?
Did you hear about this?
No,
I didn't hear about this.

1713
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:18.020
You were just talking about though,
cause I had a point snuff.
But before that,
uh,

1714
01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:21.050
uh,
you can go to head shops and get anything else Salvia,

1715
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:25.110
but people are trying to make,
um,
at a bull's illegal dude.

1716
01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:29.070
Salvia is like a major psychedelic drug.
And for people who don't know,

1717
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:32.370
it's an a really intense experience.
You've done it a bunch of times,
right?

1718
01:29:32.371 --> 01:29:36.090
How many times do you done like seven,
six?
That's some out of body Shit,

1719
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:40.190
<v 3>right?
Yeah,
it's like mushrooms.
But the thing about Salvia is,</v>

1720
01:29:40.191 --> 01:29:44.010
is that it takes you to,
it opens up your brain into like a rural,
if you're,

1721
01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:47.610
especially if you're used to psychedelics,
you,
it's,
it's a familiar world.

1722
01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:52.410
Like it's,
it's a,
it's crazy.
It's like doing a whippet of mushrooms.
But,

1723
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.130
uh,

1724
01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:58.110
I had to stop doing it because I was doing it maybe once every couple of weeks,

1725
01:29:58.290 --> 01:30:01.800
but I started thinking like,
all right,
this is not,
this is not good.

1726
01:30:01.801 --> 01:30:04.920
This is opening up something that's probably never going to be able to be

1727
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:08.300
completely shut.
And that's what a lot people that d DMT,
I,

1728
01:30:08.301 --> 01:30:10.640
I don't think it's a good idea.
Uh,

1729
01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:13.590
I think there's certain things of the brain that once it's opened,

1730
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:16.020
you're going to be thinking about that shit forever.
Kind of like,

1731
01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.250
do you know what I mean?

1732
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:19.740
<v 0>That's one of the reasons why I haven't done DMT in years.</v>

1733
01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:23.310
I haven't done DMT in three years at least.
And that's when the,

1734
01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:25.890
one of the reasons why it's because the last time I did it,
it made,

1735
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:27.470
it was like an,

1736
01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.920
an undeniable alteration of my view of reality that I had to become comfortable

1737
01:30:33.631 --> 01:30:37.920
with.
Right.
It's like you have a certain reality that you live in,
you know,

1738
01:30:37.921 --> 01:30:41.040
and then you smoke a little pot and that reality shifts and like,
Whoa,

1739
01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:44.190
now I'm in the pot reality.
You know?
It's like I'm still in the same place.

1740
01:30:44.191 --> 01:30:46.650
I'm still drunk,
but I'm in a different frequency.

1741
01:30:46.651 --> 01:30:48.240
I'm like tuning into a different frequency.

1742
01:30:48.241 --> 01:30:51.600
That's how I always describe any sort of psychedelic experience,

1743
01:30:51.601 --> 01:30:55.290
whether it's mild,
like you know,
pot or intense like DMT,

1744
01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:59.880
but the DMT one,
when I came back to sobriety,
you know,

1745
01:30:59.881 --> 01:31:02.700
when the pot one comes back to sober,
then I'm always the same.
You know,

1746
01:31:02.701 --> 01:31:05.160
I'm driving down the same street.
I see the same people,
I wave.

1747
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:09.150
It all feels the same to me.
Whereas when I'm high and I,
I,
you know,

1748
01:31:09.151 --> 01:31:13.680
run into somebody or I'm out doing my thing,
it feels weird.
It feels weird.

1749
01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:17.250
But then when I sober up,
it's all normal again.
Well,
with the DMT thing,

1750
01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:20.520
once I sobered up,
it wasn't normal again.
It didn't get normal.

1751
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.260
It didn't get normal for weeks.
Yeah.
When I came back,
I was the same person.

1752
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:27.840
I was living in the same house.
I had the same life,

1753
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:31.710
but I had seen something that there was no way I was ever gonna Forget.

1754
01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:36.990
And my whole view of reality completely shifted.
So I had to think,

1755
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:39.870
now I just have to get comfortable with this new view.

1756
01:31:39.871 --> 01:31:44.700
So it took like two weeks before my new view of reality before I felt like a

1757
01:31:44.701 --> 01:31:48.700
normal person during normal days,
but for two whole weeks,
man,
I remember I,

1758
01:31:48.701 --> 01:31:51.000
the way I describe it as that reality felt very slippery.

1759
01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:55.720
<v 1>So you don't think that happens at least in a micro kind of way with a smoking</v>

1760
01:31:55.721 --> 01:32:00.250
weed or eating wheat?
Um,
I think is if you don't give recovery period,

1761
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:04.180
<v 0>I think it certainly alters the way you look at the world and perhaps</v>

1762
01:32:04.181 --> 01:32:08.020
permanently,
you know,
I think,
you know,
potheads in general have a,

1763
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:11.950
a completely different way of looking at things then people don't smoke pot.

1764
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.120
I don't think that's a coincidence.

1765
01:32:13.121 --> 01:32:15.970
And I think one of the reasons that's one of the reasons why pots here in the

1766
01:32:15.971 --> 01:32:16.804
first place.

1767
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.010
I think the reason why we have these reactions to these plants and these plants

1768
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:22.000
give us these,
uh,

1769
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:25.210
these reactions and give us this different way of looking at things and seeing

1770
01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:26.800
things.
I think that's what they're there for.

1771
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:30.490
I think there's a symbiotic relationship that we have between us and those

1772
01:32:30.491 --> 01:32:34.450
plants.
And those plants are there to assist in our evolution.

1773
01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.330
I think they're there to assist in our changing of our thinking.

1774
01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.840
And I think that's what they do.
They shape our thinking,
they round things out,

1775
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:44.920
they take away a lot of the sharp,
jagged,
retarded edges of normal thinking,

1776
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.670
you know,
and I think the introspective minus,
uh,

1777
01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.330
that they bring is one of the big parts about it.
The,

1778
01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:53.980
the ability to step back and objectively kind of assess your life and look at it

1779
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:58.990
and the squashing of your ego.
I mean the,
the intimidation and the,

1780
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:02.770
uh,
the feeling of paranoia that you get when you smoke pot.
Part of that is,

1781
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.030
you know,
the,
the ego,
uh,
gets exposed and you don't,
you,

1782
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:10.930
your defense mechanisms drop and you a,
you'd lighten it all up.

1783
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:15.160
You start to look at things for what they really are,
you know,
I mean,
that's,

1784
01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:18.310
that's why I think it's there.
I don't think it's for everybody,
you know,

1785
01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.370
I don't think,
uh,
I don't think it should be done.

1786
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:22.720
If you don't know what you're doing.

1787
01:33:22.721 --> 01:33:25.540
I think the problem with everything being illegal is that we don't have any

1788
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:28.420
shama anymore.
You know,
it's a,
it's a goofy name for it,

1789
01:33:28.421 --> 01:33:31.780
but maybe there could be sort of a psychedelic consultant that you go to,

1790
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:34.510
you know,
and the psychedelic consultant is a professional,

1791
01:33:34.511 --> 01:33:37.990
a guy who's professionally adept at navigating psychedelic world.

1792
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.880
<v 1>So maybe that's what our pot doctor should turn into.
Yeah,</v>

1793
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:43.610
that's what he should turn into.
But that Shit's illegal too.
You know,

1794
01:33:43.611 --> 01:33:45.260
you can't just potheads aren't gonna pay.

1795
01:33:45.261 --> 01:33:48.410
So you could tell them how to get high with it.
You know,
pot busts too easy,

1796
01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.440
but like mushrooms,
but whatever,
you're getting massaged by an Asian chick.

1797
01:33:51.441 --> 01:33:56.270
Why he's doing it.
Oh,
so you should have like a combo business now you thinking,

1798
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:59.330
see if you were that doctor,
you wouldn't have to worry about the future.

1799
01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.180
You'd be all pro pot because you've got some backup plans.
Right.

1800
01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.790
That's pretty dope move,
Dude.
Uh,

1801
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:08.120
you smoke some weed and get a massage by a really hot Asian check and they read,

1802
01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:10.400
read like inspirational quotes to you.
Yeah.

1803
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:16.010
Why not?
Man.
Why can't that be a real business?
Think of it.

1804
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:18.900
<v 0>That's how it has actually sounds pretty promising,
man.</v>

1805
01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.780
You'd start a chain of those.
Hmm.
Well,
what would you call them?

1806
01:34:22.150 --> 01:34:25.150
<v 7>Uh,
hello</v>

1807
01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:29.630
<v 1>titty.
Pretty girl.
Rub.
Rub To enlightenment.
Too many words.</v>

1808
01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.910
Too many words,
right?
Uh,
is this real pretty girl massage too in la?
Maybe.

1809
01:34:34.911 --> 01:34:39.050
Is this real life?
Who would call it that?
That's it.
Like the kid that dentists,

1810
01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.080
yeah,
they came back from the dentist.
This real life.
It's real life.
Hey Dude,

1811
01:34:42.081 --> 01:34:44.900
I went to,
it's rural life.
They have this new girl.
You got it.
Got It.

1812
01:34:44.901 --> 01:34:47.650
Smoke the train wreck and have her talk about it.
This is how funny.

1813
01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.390
<v 0>Dana White's,
um,
his uh,</v>

1814
01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.930
birthday party for his 40th birthday was this awesome bash that they threw.

1815
01:34:53.931 --> 01:34:57.980
Fram total surprise.
It was in Vegas at a,
of the big hotels.

1816
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.400
This whole fucking conference room and everything.
They had it all set up.

1817
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:04.880
He had no idea.
He goes down there and he walks in the door.
Everybody's waiting.

1818
01:35:04.881 --> 01:35:08.270
Surprise.
So this is how craziest party was.

1819
01:35:08.450 --> 01:35:10.860
Fucking stone temple pilots played.
Oh Wow.

1820
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:13.880
The stone temple pilots got up and they weren't the,

1821
01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:17.710
that Guy Scott Wieland is that his name is the one who's always on heroin.
Yeah,

1822
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.630
he's,
he's talented as fuck.
Dude.

1823
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:24.350
That guy was inspirationally talented but crazy as all fuck.

1824
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:27.580
Like it was taking a while to get the party started to get everybody see and

1825
01:35:27.581 --> 01:35:30.140
everything like that.
And they wanted more money.
They're threatening,

1826
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:32.370
they wanted to fucking leave.
They were going to quit.
Like,
yeah,

1827
01:35:32.410 --> 01:35:33.470
there was all sorts of,
I mean,

1828
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:36.050
I'm getting this all third hand so it could be total bullshit,
but you know,

1829
01:35:36.051 --> 01:35:40.280
I didn't actually talk to him,
but uh,
we did like bring them up,
you know,

1830
01:35:40.281 --> 01:35:43.640
I introduced them.
I,
I,
you know,
said happy birthday to Dana.
And then I said,

1831
01:35:43.641 --> 01:35:46.100
Ladies Gentlemen,
without further ado,
stone temple pilots,

1832
01:35:46.101 --> 01:35:47.090
everybody went fucking crazy.

1833
01:35:47.091 --> 01:35:50.450
Like he couldn't believe the actual stone temple pilots were there.
So anyway,

1834
01:35:50.451 --> 01:35:54.080
they play this intense concert.
I mean,
that mother fucker is so good.

1835
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.790
He's so tight and so professional and nails,
every fucking single movement.

1836
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:02.050
He just,
it was really one of the best live performances I've ever seen.

1837
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:06.110
Was it all the same old songs.
That's why.
Yeah.
That's why it was so tight.

1838
01:36:06.190 --> 01:36:10.700
It doesn't matter.
I don't give a fuck.
That's true.
But God damn it was good.

1839
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:15.800
I understand that.
But I love those songs.
So God damn.
Anyway,
and it's over.
Uh,

1840
01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:19.910
Dana goes on stairs stage takes,
the microphone goes.
That just happened.

1841
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:23.540
That's cool.
Like that just happened and you know,
they want to get out of there.

1842
01:36:23.541 --> 01:36:26.210
They want to get their check and [inaudible] just stand there looking at all his

1843
01:36:26.211 --> 01:36:29.410
friends,
talking to them like that just happened,
you know.

1844
01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:32.450
I mean it was like one of those moments where you're like,
wow,

1845
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:35.720
that motherfucker just had stone temple pilots play his birthday party.

1846
01:36:36.210 --> 01:36:39.380
That's awesome.
Could you imagine coming out to your backyard and you know,

1847
01:36:39.381 --> 01:36:41.900
who would be your band ween?
Would it be weaned?

1848
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:43.780
<v 2>You know,
Wean?
Probably Navy.</v>

1849
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.840
<v 0>Yeah.
If you had like Mc Chris show up at your house and he's playing in your</v>

1850
01:36:47.841 --> 01:36:51.170
backyard,
he'd be,
you know,
it's surprised you is Mc Chris,

1851
01:36:51.171 --> 01:36:52.070
your stone temple pilots?

1852
01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:56.850
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no.
I know,
I know.
Mc Christ.
That's a problem.
Cool.
That's gay.
That's gay.</v>

1853
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:00.900
They do can be.
Who would be your,
uh,
your stone temple pilots?

1854
01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:04.550
Nine snails back in the day.
Maybe.
I don't know.
For me,
sound

1855
01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:08.930
<v 0>garden when they were at their peak,
blow up the outside world,
those songs,
man,</v>

1856
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.620
that was when I first started smoking weed when I first started getting into

1857
01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:17.570
sound garden.
And I remember I was at the comedy store ones and uh,

1858
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.370
you know,
we're hanging out all night,
having a good time.

1859
01:37:19.371 --> 01:37:21.290
And I was leaving and in my car on the way home,

1860
01:37:21.291 --> 01:37:26.060
I listened to spoon man and it was so fucking good.
I played it all the way home.

1861
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:27.320
I just kept repeating it.

1862
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:30.800
Every time we'd go to the next song I go right back to it.
I listened to spoon,

1863
01:37:30.801 --> 01:37:33.710
man,
I don't know how many times it takes me 20 minutes drive home.

1864
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:36.890
I was this spoon man,
at least five times.
Wow.

1865
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:39.770
Cause it's just so good.
You know,

1866
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.040
you don't even know what music sounds like until you start smoking pot.

1867
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:45.350
You don't even know what you're missing.
There's,

1868
01:37:45.351 --> 01:37:48.890
there's certain sounds that you're not going to feel.

1869
01:37:48.891 --> 01:37:51.260
There's certain the F or at least I'm not going to,

1870
01:37:51.261 --> 01:37:54.170
I don't know how music affects you,
but for me,
when I smoked pot,

1871
01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:58.840
it makes me way more connected to music.
Eddie says the same shit.

1872
01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.080
Like,
like when he listens to music and when he does music,

1873
01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:06.130
<v 4>well,
we just intensifies everything.
Obviously if you will see a movie on weed,</v>

1874
01:38:06.131 --> 01:38:08.570
it's going to be more intense and awesome than it is without,
you know,

1875
01:38:08.650 --> 01:38:12.730
everything.
Sex Too.
People don't realize that.
And emotions.
Emotions.
Yeah.

1876
01:38:12.731 --> 01:38:16.150
Waterfalls.
Tell stall.
Tell us all waterfalls.

1877
01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:20.040
You know what I was just thinking who would be my personal view?
Benfold

1878
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:25.060
<v 0>den folds five.
Yeah.
Ben Folds.
What about John Mayer?</v>

1879
01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.850
Don't you think he'd be jealous?
What?

1880
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:32.080
John Marriage just had to cancel his European tour.
Oh,
him and Carlos.
No,

1881
01:38:32.530 --> 01:38:37.070
don't be mean to kick him,
man.
Wise down that.

1882
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:42.280
Um,
yeah.
So for like modern bands,
man,
shit,
I don't know.

1883
01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:45.520
I think house of pain would be fucking Badass.

1884
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:46.810
<v 4>Yeah.
I miss that.</v>

1885
01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:50.650
Dana had a concert in Boston for Saint Patrick's day and yet house of Payne play

1886
01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:56.110
Everlast is the coolest.
I love that.
Dude,
my drug dealer was in Ohio,

1887
01:38:56.111 --> 01:38:59.580
was so addicted to house of Payne.
Come over and be like,
what's up Brandon?

1888
01:38:59.581 --> 01:39:01.290
He turns on jump around or whatever that

1889
01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:04.970
<v 0>I like when Marcus Davis fights,
but one of the main reasons why it's just,</v>

1890
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:08.090
I love Marcus Davis,
but also so I could hear that fucking song.

1891
01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:13.070
That's one of the best walkout songs ever.
Yeah.
That fucking song is the shit,

1892
01:39:13.071 --> 01:39:15.980
man.
They just smashed that one,
you know?

1893
01:39:15.981 --> 01:39:18.770
And then they had a hard time coming up with anything that could top that.

1894
01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:22.760
That song was just such an out of the ballpark smash hit.
You know?

1895
01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:26.030
It wasn't until Everlast got on his own like that.
What?
It's like song,

1896
01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:29.840
but that's another,
that's a fucking classic.
That's an all time classic.

1897
01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:30.350
<v 4>Wait,</v>

1898
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:35.190
every class I'm thinking of taking a swim past the breakers and left my,

1899
01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:39.610
the world die.
No,
that,
oh my God,
you faggot.
That's slightly different band.

1900
01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.350
Our clear is jump around,
jump up,
jump up again.
Down jump.

1901
01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:47.110
I'm the king of that.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I thought you were talking about some else,

1902
01:39:47.111 --> 01:39:50.890
their mind.
I thought you were talking about Everlast the band.
No,

1903
01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:56.380
never last.
The lead singer,
right?
You faggot.
I know you were thinking of,

1904
01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:01.040
is that the other band called Everlast?
Oh No,
never cleared.
Ever clear.

1905
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.230
Total polar homosexual opposite of house and paid.
I know.
I was just like,

1906
01:40:08.231 --> 01:40:11.120
but by the way,
I'm a bad ass band still.
I love that song.

1907
01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:15.410
You do these on access Hollywood now it's an e or something like that.
No,

1908
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:19.450
that's my just fucking Tyler.
Everybody together.

1909
01:40:19.451 --> 01:40:24.170
Ben Hur.
Chief Simmons just died.
Oh No,
it was Ronnie James Dio.
You're just,

1910
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.750
you just fucking connecting people,
man.
You know that was the weirdest

1911
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:30.640
<v 0>ever any show that I ever did.</v>

1912
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:34.540
The New Year's show when when Gene Simmons showed up for the new year's show,

1913
01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:37.000
like to watch my new year's show,
I freaked out.

1914
01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:39.370
I've never freaked out at people coming to see my show before,

1915
01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.670
but I legitimately freaked out.
I was like nervous.
You know,

1916
01:40:42.671 --> 01:40:45.820
I've had famous people come to see the show and talk to me before they see it

1917
01:40:45.821 --> 01:40:49.060
and you know,
and like,
you know,
it doesn't,
it doesn't freak me out.

1918
01:40:49.061 --> 01:40:51.760
Like once I got a little nervous when Penn was in the audience because I was

1919
01:40:51.761 --> 01:40:53.110
hanging out with pen from Penn and teller.

1920
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:55.300
He's cause I respect him and he's a cool guy.

1921
01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.270
So I got a little weirded out and I was like,
Oh shut it off.
Can't bomb bomb.

1922
01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.100
I got to my rights.
And that's the worst state of mind to get into for comedy.

1923
01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.780
But when,
when Gene Simmons was in the audience and the New Year's show,

1924
01:41:05.781 --> 01:41:09.190
I was like,
Holy Shit,
that's fucking Gene Simmons.
Like to me,

1925
01:41:09.191 --> 01:41:11.710
when I was a little kid,
you know,
when I was a kiss fan,

1926
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:14.230
when I was like fucking 12 and shit,

1927
01:41:14.231 --> 01:41:16.660
I had kissed posters on my wall and you know,

1928
01:41:16.661 --> 01:41:19.690
I get in arguments with kids at school because they would say kisses for fags.

1929
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.760
So I had to hide my kiss collection.

1930
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:25.570
I had to hide my love for kiss when dudes would come over my house.

1931
01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:26.830
Like the first time if I didn't know them,

1932
01:41:26.831 --> 01:41:29.890
I hid my kiss stuff just like makeup Joe.
I too,

1933
01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:34.560
I don't do it like a little like Megan attrical like high heels and I looked at

1934
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:38.350
makeup.
I just loved the whole thing where they had,
you know,

1935
01:41:38.351 --> 01:41:41.020
they had like the whole pageantry of the fucking show.
You know,

1936
01:41:41.021 --> 01:41:44.830
they had the demon,
the Star Child,
the fucking lover,
the whole thing.
Man,

1937
01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:49.690
I was a fucking huge kiss fan.
I still am.
I still love some of their jams.

1938
01:41:49.691 --> 01:41:53.650
I like fucking throwing them on driving.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was made for loving you.

1939
01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:55.930
Yeah.

1940
01:41:55.930 --> 01:41:58.680
<v 3>There's a good video of you doing a Karaoke version of love guns.</v>

1941
01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:01.170
If Google search kiss carry over

1942
01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:06.560
<v 0>Joe Rogan.
That was fun,
man.
That was fun as shit.
That was a,</v>

1943
01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:10.250
that was a fun radio show that show a Sarah and no name.
Yeah,

1944
01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.130
but they're not together anymore.
Yeah,
no names.

1945
01:42:13.131 --> 01:42:17.570
Got his own Gig and she's got her own gig.
Radio is a grind man.
It's hard.

1946
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:22.220
It's hard.
You know,
the Missus Rogan had to get something fixed on her car,

1947
01:42:22.221 --> 01:42:25.160
so she got a rental car and she was telling me,
she was like,

1948
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:27.860
when you don't listen to satellite radio for awhile,

1949
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:30.210
you realize how much regular radio stuff.

1950
01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.940
<v 3>You know what those satellite radio is starting to suck now too.</v>

1951
01:42:32.941 --> 01:42:37.410
Because I mean the,
they're now getting censored by the,
uh,
you know,

1952
01:42:37.411 --> 01:42:41.000
like I think opie and Anthony were talking about it the other day where they are

1953
01:42:41.001 --> 01:42:45.330
in an allowed to puke anymore or do sounds of puking or anything leaving the

1954
01:42:45.331 --> 01:42:48.930
body.
Like they can't talk about shitty.
That's like that.

1955
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:51.360
Their baby bird bit,
they did it back in the day.

1956
01:42:51.361 --> 01:42:52.710
They went and been able to do that anymore.

1957
01:42:52.730 --> 01:42:54.290
<v 0>Well,
they just aired it though,
did they?</v>

1958
01:42:55.110 --> 01:42:58.220
Other day I was driving home and I was listening to Opie and Anthony and I

1959
01:42:58.221 --> 01:43:01.970
wasn't really paying attention,
but I heard screams and cheers and I was like,

1960
01:43:01.971 --> 01:43:05.780
what could fucking possibly be eliciting this kind of reaction?
And then I said,

1961
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:08.060
oh my God,
this is the baby bird.
And I turned it off.

1962
01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.860
So I had just gotten in the car,
you know,

1963
01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:11.390
and I turned it up and you hear it like everything.

1964
01:43:11.391 --> 01:43:14.570
I heard bill burrs voice and then I heard my own voice and I was like,
oh wow.

1965
01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.920
<v 3>But yeah that's weird though cause like it's satellite radio is now turning into</v>

1966
01:43:17.921 --> 01:43:21.700
regular radio in some ways and also a lot of these music channels that almost

1967
01:43:21.701 --> 01:43:22.720
seems like they,

1968
01:43:22.721 --> 01:43:26.080
like I was talking about this last night with some dude how he was saying like

1969
01:43:26.081 --> 01:43:30.280
how satellite radio to him sounds like they just like they're playing like

1970
01:43:30.281 --> 01:43:32.560
looped cds.
Like they have a CD,

1971
01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.870
like a mixed tape and they're just looping the same,

1972
01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.170
you know like he's like I don't need to hear music channels.
Yeah.

1973
01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:39.430
Like I don't need to hear Bush five times a day.

1974
01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:40.933
<v 0>You for real.</v>

1975
01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.830
They should have real DJ's take the opportunity to go back to real DJ's.

1976
01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:46.901
One Guy,

1977
01:43:46.901 --> 01:43:50.740
no we haven't talked about this now we're one guy is like some fucking Ku Wolf

1978
01:43:50.741 --> 01:43:51.980
Man Jack type character.

1979
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:55.160
He talks some shit in between the songs and he plays what he likes.

1980
01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:57.280
<v 3>That's the future is just rhapsody and,
and,</v>

1981
01:43:57.281 --> 01:44:02.281
and are not rhapsody a fuck about Pandora and like all those like blips and

1982
01:44:02.681 --> 01:44:05.710
stuff like that because that's what the future is.
Like if you like what you,

1983
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:09.070
I don't know if you ever used Pandora,
if you like Pandora a,
if you like,

1984
01:44:09.071 --> 01:44:12.100
say like Ben Folds,
you type in Ben folds or wean.

1985
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:16.120
And then what it does is it makes a radio station based on what other users who

1986
01:44:16.121 --> 01:44:20.710
liked that band.
Like also.
And so what happens is like they'll play ween,

1987
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:24.280
then they'll play another band that's like other people that like wing like and

1988
01:44:24.281 --> 01:44:25.330
either say yes or no.

1989
01:44:25.331 --> 01:44:29.650
You voted up and down and it just kind of starts building the perfect radio

1990
01:44:29.651 --> 01:44:30.410
station.

1991
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:32.110
<v 0>Yeah,
that's brilliant.
That's brilliant.</v>

1992
01:44:32.111 --> 01:44:35.980
And what that's missing now is the camaraderie of a Dj.

1993
01:44:36.190 --> 01:44:39.070
I remember when I used to do construction and um,

1994
01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:42.640
I used to listen to Charles Laquidara in the morning,
uh,
the,

1995
01:44:42.641 --> 01:44:46.480
the morning blanket or the morning mattress.
He,
uh,
the big mattress,

1996
01:44:46.481 --> 01:44:50.770
that's what it was called.
It was this cool comedy radio show that was on,
uh,

1997
01:44:50.771 --> 01:44:54.310
in Boston.
And like,
you know,
this is like the early eighties,
you know,

1998
01:44:54.311 --> 01:44:57.580
like 1981 or some shit like that.
And uh,
you,

1999
01:44:57.581 --> 01:45:00.790
you felt like you had a connection with this dude.
You know,

2000
01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.000
like you would hear him like talk and then he would play a song or you know,

2001
01:45:04.001 --> 01:45:06.160
all the other Djs to mark Parenteau is in the afternoon.

2002
01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:07.990
He would talk and they would play a song.

2003
01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.320
Like that guy became a part of your afternoon,
you know,

2004
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:13.300
it's like he would play the shit that he wanted to play.

2005
01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:17.730
Like I remember I was listening to this one station knows WC cozy that'd be coc

2006
01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.430
back in Boston was called kick ass rock and roll.
And the Dj said,
you know what,

2007
01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:26.080
I'm going to play a guy something just because it's good and it's not even rock.

2008
01:45:26.170 --> 01:45:29.650
It's a Michael Jackson Song.
I'm gonna play this just because it's good.

2009
01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:33.810
And he played Billy Jean and I remember like,
like at this crazy motherfucker,

2010
01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:35.800
he decided to not even play a rock song.

2011
01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:39.310
He's like playing a Michael Jackson Song.
But it was so fucking good.

2012
01:45:39.311 --> 01:45:44.260
Nobody gave a shit.
You know,
but it was like those chances you can't take today,

2013
01:45:44.410 --> 01:45:44.940
you,
you,

2014
01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.630
<v 3>you got to still not allowed demand that.
Yeah.</v>

2015
01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.040
Cause it's all based on money like advertising and all that stuff.

2016
01:45:50.041 --> 01:45:52.830
In order for them to be able to have jobs so they are not allowed to play

2017
01:45:52.831 --> 01:45:56.010
certain songs because the music industry or record labels won't let them play

2018
01:45:56.011 --> 01:45:57.880
those songs,
you know,
etc.

2019
01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:02.080
<v 0>That's what sucks man.
The old days of a real DJ,</v>

2020
01:46:02.081 --> 01:46:03.910
I think if satellite radio was smart,

2021
01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:07.270
they would concentrate on hiring like really interesting personality.

2022
01:46:07.271 --> 01:46:08.560
It's just be djs.

2023
01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:12.730
Just some do that you get used to listening to some dude who says some

2024
01:46:12.731 --> 01:46:15.040
interesting shit in between the songs.
You know,

2025
01:46:15.041 --> 01:46:17.650
some guy has got an interesting point of view,
gives you some,

2026
01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.050
some trivia about the band or something.

2027
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:22.110
<v 3>Then will you liked the guy and you're like his taste in music.</v>

2028
01:46:22.111 --> 01:46:25.020
You know who it should be.
Is that guy from opn?
Anthony?

2029
01:46:25.021 --> 01:46:29.700
I'm the guy who did a guest host once a member and we listened to it last time

2030
01:46:29.701 --> 01:46:33.780
we were on the show.
Uh,
Rich Vos.
No,
no,
no.
The guy that works for them that,

2031
01:46:33.781 --> 01:46:38.280
that's like their bodyguard or Steve,
the manager member.
He did a guest,
uh,

2032
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:42.420
hour on radio where he deejayed and we all listened to it last time we were

2033
01:46:42.421 --> 01:46:44.910
there,
the big tall guy,
Kenny Kenny.

2034
01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:49.800
<v 0>Oh,
exactly.
Club Soda Cap.
So to Kinda know where going with this,</v>

2035
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:53.910
<v 1>I don't know why I have clubs on a and just in the back of my head at all times.</v>

2036
01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:57.960
Um,
he did that disco thing.
He was,
uh,

2037
01:46:57.990 --> 01:47:01.170
he was as a Dj on that,
uh,
the disco channel.
Any,

2038
01:47:01.171 --> 01:47:02.700
I don't think have they ever aired this,

2039
01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:06.000
but he was just swearing and saying all kinds of crude shit and was really

2040
01:47:06.001 --> 01:47:10.410
hilarious and playing like a character,
like a DJ character.
And it was awesome.

2041
01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.440
It made you look forward to the end of the song so you could hear them talk some

2042
01:47:13.441 --> 01:47:16.040
more shit.
It was like fun,
you know?
Yeah.

2043
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.110
The problem is for every person who loves club Soda,
Kenny,

2044
01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:21.410
there's going to be another person probably somewhere who hates.

2045
01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:23.970
That's the good thing about satellite radio.
It's like cable.

2046
01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:26.760
They can have a million radio stations,
but then,

2047
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:28.440
but they're not willing to do that.

2048
01:47:28.530 --> 01:47:31.380
It's the same reason why they're telling them not to make poopy sounds.

2049
01:47:31.610 --> 01:47:33.840
So like they're worried about any negative.

2050
01:47:33.841 --> 01:47:35.070
They're not worried about the positive.

2051
01:47:35.071 --> 01:47:37.230
No one's going to pay extra for poopy sounds,

2052
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:40.350
but there's going to be some people that they hear them talk about shit and

2053
01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:43.110
diarrhea and they just tune out and just like,
that's it.
I don't even want,

2054
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:45.390
and they're worried about advertisers,
you know,

2055
01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:48.870
like not wanting to be associated with poopy talk.

2056
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:53.160
You know that they're going to lose something.
So that's why,
you know,
like a,

2057
01:47:53.161 --> 01:47:57.120
a guy who's like a real crazy Dj,
like a club Soda Kenny,
that Shit,

2058
01:47:57.121 --> 01:47:59.700
it's not going to fly because he's going to offend too many people.

2059
01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.720
We live in a pussy ass world.
I think the Internet,

2060
01:48:03.721 --> 01:48:06.690
is this going to be the radio?
Like this shit right here,
like podcasts.

2061
01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:09.570
But the problem is that now they're going to fuck with this.
You know,

2062
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.920
how's it going to fuck with this?
They're finished.

2063
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.860
They're going to find a way to edit it or sensory,
you know,
they're going to,

2064
01:48:13.930 --> 01:48:16.950
well,
eventually you'll be able to do this from your own computer.

2065
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.480
You don't have to worry about that.
Eventually,

2066
01:48:18.481 --> 01:48:21.030
you're gonna be able to do something like Ustream.
You won't need to use to them.

2067
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:23.880
Not that we don't love Ustream,
they're all very cool with us and everything,

2068
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:26.670
but you're gonna be able to do this kind of shit from your home computer.

2069
01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:29.100
You're gonna be able to do this shit on your home network.
What do you mean?

2070
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:32.340
You're going to be able to like have your own Ustream set up on your own

2071
01:48:32.341 --> 01:48:33.174
computer?

2072
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:36.780
You're not going to have to have some crazy server and the server handles all

2073
01:48:36.781 --> 01:48:38.790
this video.
There's going to become some,

2074
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.660
some new innovations can allow people to do this kind of shit right from their

2075
01:48:42.661 --> 01:48:45.840
own complete.
Didn't already do that.
Yeah.
But not with these kinds of numbers.

2076
01:48:45.841 --> 01:48:47.580
Like how many people are tuned into this thing,
right?
Oh,

2077
01:48:47.581 --> 01:48:48.211
I see what you're saying.

2078
01:48:48.211 --> 01:48:51.600
So you're all sort of 1300 year old here and that's kind of a bandwidth thing.

2079
01:48:51.601 --> 01:48:55.140
So,
yeah.
So yeah,
you'd be able to serve it eventually.
That won't be an issue.

2080
01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.190
Just like 14 four baud modems could never even download pictures took forever.

2081
01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:01.440
You know,
you'd never be able to do this on the old school

2082
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:05.550
<v 8>[inaudible] name.</v>

2083
01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:10.900
<v 1>I remember the first time I clicked on an ISD in line,
I didn't make that noise.</v>

2084
01:49:10.901 --> 01:49:14.020
I was like,
this is incredible.
He just get online.
There's no noise.

2085
01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:16.620
How do you know when it's on cut out?
That's a ringtone.

2086
01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:20.440
I want just that sound of dialing up.
I bet you can get it.
Oh,
I bet that's it.

2087
01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:23.290
If not somebody make it.
That is a credit to ring tone.
Yeah.

2088
01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:27.700
Throw that shit up on Twitter.
Homeys makeup ring tone.
Yeah,
please do.
Yeah,

2089
01:49:27.701 --> 01:49:31.720
that sound man,
that,
that,
that getting on the phone and dialing up modem sound.

2090
01:49:31.721 --> 01:49:33.700
Somebody make a ringtone for iPhone,
please.

2091
01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:36.970
There was a time when that was the way to get online and you couldn't get online

2092
01:49:36.971 --> 01:49:39.010
if you had your phone on.
If you were like,

2093
01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:41.140
if someone couldn't use the phone while you were online,

2094
01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:44.390
my mom still has that Internet,
you know?
It's a,
uh,

2095
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:48.100
I don't know if you've ever had AOL and back in the,
they used

2096
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.120
<v 3>to when private messaging first came out,
like instant message.</v>

2097
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:56.380
Every time you get an instant message it would say this voice,

2098
01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.120
the same guy that did you got Moodle would say instant message and then you get

2099
01:50:01.121 --> 01:50:03.130
like a window that pops up and goes hi,
how are you doing?

2100
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:07.000
Then you'd write back and then they write back and goes instant message.

2101
01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.430
And I remember that that was really cool.

2102
01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.680
It was like wow there's this voice telling me they have a message.

2103
01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:16.770
But then it got so popular that like for a good couple months AOL was must have

2104
01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:20.410
been freaking out because that cause it would just go in an instant,
instant,

2105
01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.180
instant message cause everyone was a messaging back and forth cause it just like

2106
01:50:25.210 --> 01:50:28.030
it became Twitter overnight.
So everyone was instant messaging.

2107
01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:30.610
So it was just the most annoying shit ever.

2108
01:50:30.611 --> 01:50:33.370
Like you're just walking to your house and you just,
your instant,
instant,

2109
01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:34.820
instant miss.
Oh

2110
01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:39.570
<v 0>I remember when you got mail was cool.
You got mail,
you've gotten mail,</v>

2111
01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:42.390
you've got mail.
Remember when that was cool.
Yeah.

2112
01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:43.980
You should have that for your text messages.

2113
01:50:43.981 --> 01:50:47.390
You've got mail every time a text comes in that that should be your sound.
Okay.

2114
01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.310
<v 3>The guy that did that voice,</v>

2115
01:50:48.311 --> 01:50:51.610
I think was this is the same that you used to do some Disney advertisements or

2116
01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:53.620
something like this was coming soon.
Get Tuesday.

2117
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:55.330
<v 0>That shouldn't be available.</v>

2118
01:50:55.630 --> 01:50:58.510
That you've got mail should be available as a ringtone.
Yeah.

2119
01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:01.930
Shouldn't it be okay if I can take,
I'm sure it is somewhere.
It better be.

2120
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:05.130
I'll be very disappointed that I used to love that sound me too.

2121
01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:08.440
Until I had it for like a couple months and then after awhile you're like,

2122
01:51:08.441 --> 01:51:12.040
what the shot is that,
was there an option to shut that noise out?

2123
01:51:12.210 --> 01:51:14.670
<v 3>I remember,
but I remember on the instant messaging,
I don't think there was,</v>

2124
01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:18.420
that's why it was so annoying cause like AOL had to update it so they,
they turn,

2125
01:51:18.450 --> 01:51:19.283
they got rid of it.
Yeah.

2126
01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:24.230
<v 0>You know,
so I remember um,
w what was the other,
there was another type of,
uh,</v>

2127
01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:28.750
uh,
chat like that,
uh,
Iq.
Yeah,
ICQ.
Exactly.

2128
01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:33.300
<v 3>I still have my ICQ number.
You really,
it's like 512 or something.
That's crazy.</v>

2129
01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:37.240
Do people still use that shit?
Uh,
I don't know.
Yeah,
they do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2130
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.830
I see accused like only the elite and Meredy.

2131
01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:43.540
<v 0>The Super League nerds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was back of my quick plane days.</v>

2132
01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.020
Everybody in quake had ICQ I knew would get online and quick clan,

2133
01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:49.120
like my Icq name was my quake name,

2134
01:51:49.121 --> 01:51:53.980
crime eight XD and I'd get online and all the other quick clan members would go

2135
01:51:53.981 --> 01:51:56.920
on and we had messaged each other about what server you are going to be on and

2136
01:51:56.921 --> 01:51:59.050
there was a,
a way that you could click on the link.

2137
01:51:59.051 --> 01:52:00.460
They would send you a link to the server,

2138
01:52:00.610 --> 01:52:04.530
you click on it from ICQ and it would fire up your quake game and take your

2139
01:52:04.531 --> 01:52:08.590
right to that server to,
those were the days,
man.

2140
01:52:08.890 --> 01:52:13.030
Those are the days I,
all I wanted to do was get home and fucking play quick.

2141
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:15.310
That's the baby screaming in the hallway.

2142
01:52:16.130 --> 01:52:19.070
That's what happens when you live with kids.
They start screaming and shit.
Yeah.

2143
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:20.650
God Damn.
Little Banshee.

2144
01:52:21.130 --> 01:52:22.320
<v 9>Woo.
Woo.</v>

2145
01:52:22.530 --> 01:52:24.870
<v 0>We have seven more minutes and then we're going to call it this time we're going</v>

2146
01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:26.710
to do it at two,
two hours.
Yeah.

2147
01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:29.950
I feel like we started petering out about 10 minutes ago.
Yeah,

2148
01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:35.050
<v 3>I agree.
Not really fired it back then,
a long podcast,
but it's pretty amazing.</v>

2149
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:37.220
<v 0>But it's,
it's,
you know what I think is the way to do it.</v>

2150
01:52:37.221 --> 01:52:39.740
Cause then you get deep into conversations.
Yeah.
You know,

2151
01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.830
and in an hour sometimes we just touch on things right when we touch on them.

2152
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:47.290
Yeah.
You know,
at the end,
uh,
you know,
we've run out of time.
Um,

2153
01:52:47.590 --> 01:52:51.400
what else did I want to talk to you about?
Oh,
the fucking oil spell thing,
man.

2154
01:52:51.610 --> 01:52:54.910
The latest thing on the oil spill was that they're not going to be able to stop

2155
01:52:54.911 --> 01:52:58.990
it until they dig into these extra wells to make these relief wells,

2156
01:52:58.991 --> 01:53:00.940
they're going to have to relief wells.
They wanted to make one,

2157
01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:04.720
but the government forced them to drill to relief wells because the area they're

2158
01:53:04.721 --> 01:53:09.130
trying to hit to intersect these two wells is like seven and a half inches.

2159
01:53:09.490 --> 01:53:13.210
And they have to go like a fucking mile underwater and underground to hit this

2160
01:53:13.211 --> 01:53:17.170
well a mile and it's going to take them until August.

2161
01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.940
And even that is not guaranteed,

2162
01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:22.120
but until then it's just going to keep poor and oil.

2163
01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:26.500
And there was a thing on Rachel Maddow where they showed the same company that

2164
01:53:26.501 --> 01:53:27.334
built this,

2165
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.460
this well also built a well that in 1979 did the same fucking thing in 1979 in

2166
01:53:33.581 --> 01:53:35.650
the Gulf of Mexico.
It's spilled out for sure.

2167
01:53:35.710 --> 01:53:40.210
<v 4>Nine months.
Wow.
Really?
For nine months until they figured out how to stop it.</v>

2168
01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:42.790
Nine fucking months.
I think it's gonna be crazy.

2169
01:53:42.791 --> 01:53:45.220
Like I know everyone made fun of the CNN for doing this,

2170
01:53:45.221 --> 01:53:49.090
but I just think it's gonna be crazy hurricane season during all mixing in with

2171
01:53:49.091 --> 01:53:51.610
all this,
you know,
dude,
it's terrifying.

2172
01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:55.480
What if it just becomes like fire tornadoes and it's,
it really,

2173
01:53:56.590 --> 01:53:57.423
it really could be.

2174
01:53:57.670 --> 01:53:59.500
<v 0>I mean,
people don't know how dangerous that is.</v>

2175
01:53:59.501 --> 01:54:02.170
If you get hurricanes and they start taking that oil,

2176
01:54:02.290 --> 01:54:04.630
which is literally the size of Maryland.

2177
01:54:04.631 --> 01:54:09.631
Now there's an oil slick that's a size of a state and it takes that shit and

2178
01:54:09.791 --> 01:54:13.570
flies it through the fucking air and it's going to whip it up and like tornadoes

2179
01:54:13.571 --> 01:54:16.060
and shit and fly it through the fucking air.
I mean,

2180
01:54:16.061 --> 01:54:19.660
it's literally going to take that,
that oil and throw it all over everything.

2181
01:54:19.661 --> 01:54:22.050
People's houses and cars and trees and,

2182
01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:26.260
and if something happens and a fire starts,
dude,

2183
01:54:26.410 --> 01:54:29.500
that is like some biblical Shit.
Yeah.
That's about 2012.

2184
01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:34.210
That's some biblical Shit.
A state on fire.
Wow.

2185
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:38.510
<v 4>Fire tornadoes.
Yeah.
That's so cool.
Dude.
How's anybody that sucks.
That sucks.</v>

2186
01:54:38.511 --> 01:54:42.080
It does suck the fire.
I want to see a fire tornado though.

2187
01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.350
I want to see it in a lab.
May contain a movie into the road movie.

2188
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:48.030
Did I watch some one,
um,

2189
01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.930
<v 0>one documentary where they showed this very specific geographic feature of the</v>

2190
01:54:51.931 --> 01:54:55.410
earth when they were having a hard time figuring out how it was created and they

2191
01:54:55.411 --> 01:54:55.800
uh,

2192
01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.800
they chalked it off to some insane like instantaneous superstorm that like

2193
01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:04.320
literally destroyed like half of this mountain side and,

2194
01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:06.180
and read cut through this,
you know,

2195
01:55:06.181 --> 01:55:09.210
like tornado is all kinds of crazy shit caught this landscape.

2196
01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.640
He started looking at shit like that and you,

2197
01:55:11.641 --> 01:55:14.460
you start thinking of what the possibilities actually are,

2198
01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:16.590
what could happen at any moment.

2199
01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:21.540
Some nutty shit could happen any day,
any time,
any minute of any day.

2200
01:55:21.930 --> 01:55:24.660
Some of the things that have happened to this earth like over the past make that

2201
01:55:24.661 --> 01:55:29.620
sink hole in Guatemala look like nothing.
This is one of them,
man.
Yeah.

2202
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:33.180
This oil spill thing is pretty crazy because there's a lot of God damn oil.

2203
01:55:33.450 --> 01:55:34.920
There's a lot of goddamn tankers out there.

2204
01:55:34.921 --> 01:55:38.100
There's a lot of God damn oil rigs out there in the ocean.
You know,

2205
01:55:38.101 --> 01:55:41.490
if somebody was a real anarchist instead of trying to fuck up the world by

2206
01:55:41.970 --> 01:55:46.080
blowing up a building,
they would start blowing those fucking things up.
Yeah.

2207
01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.470
I think they try a lot.
I bet.
Do you,
I bet they do.

2208
01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:53.310
They should have warships that are around those things at all times,
you know,

2209
01:55:53.311 --> 01:55:56.820
but then they'd probably fuck up and blow it up accidentally.
Some suicidal,

2210
01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.320
crazy sailor type dude.
Yeah.
Accidentally suck this first deck.
Can't take it.

2211
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:04.410
It's problem.
Sure.
There's some fail safes to keep them from doing that.
Right.

2212
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:04.950
Yeah,

2213
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:09.020
totally different having access to missiles and she states that this shit there

2214
01:56:09.021 --> 01:56:13.190
and happen.
Well,
the crazy thing is that the,
they made this a,

2215
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:15.300
not even to their own safety specifications.

2216
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.460
They got a waiver on it because it was taking too long to make,

2217
01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:22.590
so the valve that they used or the whatever they use to to cap this oil well
off,

2218
01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:25.890
it was not the best shit.
They did not use the,
the,
uh,

2219
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.910
the recommended and required shit.
They got some sort of a,

2220
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:35.050
some sort of a break because they were a like way behind and budget and so they,

2221
01:56:35.051 --> 01:56:38.690
they spent less money and put this thing up quicker.
And the,

2222
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:41.340
the real hazard with those,
that sometimes gaskets inside of him,

2223
01:56:41.341 --> 01:56:44.430
that's what causes explosions and it's exactly what fucking happened.

2224
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:48.240
That's what happened in 1979 same goddamn thing happen.

2225
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:50.270
And still from then to now,
they,

2226
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:53.790
they literally have it come up with any new ways of stopping the oil.

2227
01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:57.030
They don't have any backup plans.
They just figured it happens.

2228
01:56:57.031 --> 01:57:00.990
So rarely we're just going to suck as much money out as humanly possible.

2229
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:05.100
Fuck everybody else.
And then,
you know,
if something happens we'll deal with it.

2230
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:06.390
But hopefully nothing will happen

2231
01:57:08.610 --> 01:57:10.470
I guess to please the UFC fans,

2232
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:13.230
which you think about the restorative rain page recap.
Oh,

2233
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:16.560
or there's are a lot of UFC fans.
Are you asking him about the Rashad?

2234
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:20.310
So interesting fight,
you know,
I think rampage came into that fight too heavy.
Um,

2235
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:22.230
I think he was aware of that.
Yeah,

2236
01:57:22.231 --> 01:57:25.500
he was 250 pounds and the weight class is two oh five.

2237
01:57:25.530 --> 01:57:27.740
So he had 45 pounds to lose.
Not really,
you know,

2238
01:57:28.410 --> 01:57:31.950
35 really is going to cut some weight,
cut about 10 pounds.
Um,

2239
01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.770
but that's a lot of weight to lose in a training camp.

2240
01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:37.530
It's a tremendous amount of weight.
So he had to think about that,

2241
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:42.370
I think more than he should have.
And uh,
Rashad was coming off of,
uh,

2242
01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:44.970
the fight with Thiago Silva,
so he's in excellent shape.

2243
01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.740
And so he came right from one fight,

2244
01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.860
jumped back and training and gotten training camp for the next fight with,

2245
01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:53.310
you know,
a good amount of downtime to recover,
but not too much.

2246
01:57:53.311 --> 01:57:56.970
So it was really optimum for him,
for Rashad.
And he made the most of it.
I mean,

2247
01:57:56.971 --> 01:57:58.920
if you saw the prime time shows,
they're really good.

2248
01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:01.050
Those primetime shows get you fucking fired up,
man.

2249
01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:04.410
They're really like in depth on the training and show all the preparations,

2250
01:58:04.411 --> 01:58:08.400
everything.
And Rashad was throwing it down,
man,
his training was insane.

2251
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.450
He was doing all these crazy sprints and uh,
like with a parachute on,

2252
01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:15.480
they put a parachute on his back and he's doing sprints and he's doing all these

2253
01:58:15.481 --> 01:58:20.460
things where he's like pushing sleds and all his explosive energy shit.
And uh,

2254
01:58:20.461 --> 01:58:21.840
it really showed in the fight.
Man,

2255
01:58:21.841 --> 01:58:25.620
he moves so fast when he charged out like right at the opening bell and crack

2256
01:58:25.621 --> 01:58:29.280
rampage in the jaw,
I was like really shocked at how fast he moved.
You know,

2257
01:58:29.281 --> 01:58:32.760
it was really,
really intense.
And he executed a perfect game plan.

2258
01:58:32.761 --> 01:58:36.530
He kept away from the danger,
which is rampage power shots.
And uh,

2259
01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:40.080
he implemented his strategy controlling him and taking him down and beating him

2260
01:58:40.081 --> 01:58:40.920
up when he's,
you know,

2261
01:58:40.921 --> 01:58:43.390
when on the outside and getting away from Rampage's counters.

2262
01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:44.830
But he did get clipped once.

2263
01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:48.340
That was the most interesting part of the fight besides the opening seconds when

2264
01:58:48.341 --> 01:58:51.340
he cracked him.
The most interesting part of the fight was when rampage hit him.

2265
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:54.910
He hurt him bad.
His legs gave out.
It was flat on his ass.
Yeah.

2266
01:58:54.911 --> 01:58:58.810
And the third round he got hurt bad,
but he kept his composure.

2267
01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:02.320
Got Ahold of rampage and even reverse the position.
So it was,

2268
01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:07.120
it was a huge round for him just as far as like being able to overcome the worst

2269
01:59:07.121 --> 01:59:10.240
case scenario,
the worst case scenarios.
Rampage clips you,

2270
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:12.640
he hurts you and he's on top of you and you're on the bottom.

2271
01:59:12.850 --> 01:59:16.180
That's the worst position you could ever be in with a guy like rampage because

2272
01:59:16.181 --> 01:59:17.440
he's so fucking powerful.

2273
01:59:17.441 --> 01:59:22.000
He hits so hard and Rashad kept his shit together and kept a hold of them and

2274
01:59:22.150 --> 01:59:26.200
got out of the situation.
You know,
I was,
I was impressed,
man.
I thought it was a,

2275
01:59:26.201 --> 01:59:29.770
an entertaining fight.
I,
I enjoyed the fuck out of it.
Some people criticized him.

2276
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:33.130
<v 4>I didn't even see that UFC,
but I heard that everyone,
uh,</v>

2277
01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:36.530
was really upset about it.
Really?
Yeah.
Who's everyone?

2278
01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:39.440
Every person I talked to who you're talking to a bunch of faggots.

2279
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:41.960
Something about it.
It just,
uh,
it was,
well,

2280
01:59:41.961 --> 01:59:43.750
people sometimes assume it was just poking

2281
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.730
<v 0>wall installed them.
That's what they're saying.</v>

2282
01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:49.090
A lot of people say that we'll just fucking wall installed,
man.
It totally dude,

2283
01:59:49.091 --> 01:59:50.750
wall install.
No,
no.

2284
01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:55.240
What he did was he dealt with a very dangerous challenger and a very intelligent

2285
01:59:55.241 --> 01:59:58.150
way.
I don't think there's anything wrong with what he did.
I think he did.

2286
01:59:58.151 --> 01:59:59.350
What he did is what you have to do.

2287
01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:01.460
You can't just go in there and banging out with rampage,

2288
02:00:01.470 --> 02:00:04.210
just going to clip you and you're going to go to sleep.
That's just fact.

2289
02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:06.070
I was just the way it goes.
You know,

2290
02:00:06.071 --> 02:00:09.100
rampage has a distinct advantage with most people.

2291
02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:11.770
If most dudes want to stand there and trade with rampage,

2292
02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:13.210
rampage is going to fuck them up.

2293
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.960
The only guy that I've ever seen go after rampage and Stan,

2294
02:00:15.961 --> 02:00:18.640
a trade with them was Vandelay and the first two fights,

2295
02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:22.630
and that was when rampage was not that well trained.
He wasn't,
uh,

2296
02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:26.650
he wasn't nearly as good a shape as he is now as it wasn't nearly as technical,

2297
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:28.720
didn't have nearly as good at training partners.

2298
02:00:29.050 --> 02:00:32.170
It was those fights and in those fights,
you know,

2299
02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.980
Vandelay fucking chased after him.
That was,
that was pretty exciting shit.

2300
02:00:35.981 --> 02:00:39.760
Vandelay a slugged it out with them.
He really went after him and the chocolate,

2301
02:00:39.761 --> 02:00:43.480
I'll fight.
That's another one.
Chuck.
Uh,
especially the first one in pride.

2302
02:00:43.690 --> 02:00:47.710
They really slugged it out,
but it's hard to come out on top with it.
With,

2303
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:50.260
with Quintin like that.
He's just so powerful,
man.

2304
02:00:50.590 --> 02:00:53.590
Dudes get get in brawls with him.
He just blast them.

2305
02:00:53.591 --> 02:00:57.130
You've got to fight that guy.
Smart.
You know?
Vandelay got away with it,

2306
02:00:57.131 --> 02:01:01.000
but Vandelay was in his prime back then and he caught rampage when grand page

2307
02:01:01.001 --> 02:01:04.660
wasn't quite prepared.
He wasn't the same rampage that is now.
You know,

2308
02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:07.060
patients has a lot of power.
So I think we were shot.

2309
02:01:07.061 --> 02:01:10.660
There was a very smart thing.
I think he fought real good.
It was exciting.

2310
02:01:10.690 --> 02:01:12.450
I enjoy the shit out of it.
The big,

2311
02:01:12.451 --> 02:01:15.220
the highlight to me though of the whole night was that Mike Russell,

2312
02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:19.840
Todd Duffy fight.
Did you see that?
Okay,
we got to,

2313
02:01:19.841 --> 02:01:22.900
you got to see that because it's the craziest fucking thing you'll ever see in

2314
02:01:22.901 --> 02:01:25.690
your life.
You see a guy who's built like you,
okay,

2315
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:28.540
he's built like he's got a gun.
Okay,
I'm not,
I'm not being mean.

2316
02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:33.130
He's built worse than you.
How about that?
You are more sexy than him.

2317
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:36.190
How about that?
Feel better.
Anyway,

2318
02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:41.130
this guy is getting his ass kicked by Todd Duffy character who looks like he was

2319
02:01:41.131 --> 02:01:44.160
made in a lab like literally.

2320
02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:49.090
If you just just do me a favor and Google.
Google Mike Russ,

2321
02:01:49.091 --> 02:01:49.924
so,

2322
02:01:50.630 --> 02:01:50.820
<v 6>okay.</v>

2323
02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:51.960
<v 0>Todd Duffy.</v>

2324
02:01:52.810 --> 02:01:53.370
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

2325
02:01:53.370 --> 02:01:57.250
<v 0>chaos.
You got to put a no,
no,
no.
Duffy is d.
U f.
F.
E.
That's it.</v>

2326
02:01:57.330 --> 02:02:01.580
<v 4>There you go.
I know how Google works.
She,
yeah,
but you clicked on the wrong link.</v>

2327
02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:04.010
You just clicked on the wrong line.
She,
you want me to do video?

2328
02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:07.300
<v 0>Yeah,
you got to go with the video.
You got to see this because anyway,
this,</v>

2329
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:08.183
that's it right there.

2330
02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:11.760
It's the most ridiculous thing ever because now that's not it.

2331
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:13.010
That's the wrong one.
That's the first.

2332
02:02:13.110 --> 02:02:18.000
That's the first fight that Todd Duffy ever had.
No,

2333
02:02:18.001 --> 02:02:21.960
those are all Todd Duffy.
Tim Hag.
Anyway,
not important.
Okay.

2334
02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:26.760
This guy is getting his ass kicked for for three rounds for two and a half

2335
02:02:26.761 --> 02:02:29.850
rounds and he's fat and he's like really out of shape.

2336
02:02:29.851 --> 02:02:33.480
It looks like he's got like this belly that hangs over his gut and his Todd

2337
02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:36.450
Duffy character looks like fucking Gi Joe.
Man.
He looks ridiculous.

2338
02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:39.360
He's got this square iron looking jaw.

2339
02:02:39.570 --> 02:02:43.890
His whole body's chiseled out of granite and he'd just teeing off on this Mike

2340
02:02:43.890 --> 02:02:47.190
Russell Guy.
It looks like the worst mismatch you've ever seen in a fight.

2341
02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:51.780
Like one guy,
old school,
no,
even worse because this God,

2342
02:02:51.781 --> 02:02:53.940
they're there because they're both,
they both have modern skills.

2343
02:02:53.941 --> 02:02:57.210
Just one of them is so much faster,
so much more athletic.
Okay,

2344
02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:59.600
so this Todd Duffy is teeing off on Mike Ross,

2345
02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:02.850
just fucking them up where you can't believe the shots Russell's taking.

2346
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:04.380
You're like,
this is just a matter of time.

2347
02:03:04.590 --> 02:03:07.380
And after getting his ass kicked for two fucking rounds,

2348
02:03:07.530 --> 02:03:10.050
he goes into the third round out of nowhere,

2349
02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:15.240
catches Mike Todd Duffy with one punch and flatten them out cold.

2350
02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:19.650
So this fat guy is getting his ass kicked for the entire fight and lands one

2351
02:03:19.651 --> 02:03:20.100
shot.

2352
02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:23.490
And this Adonis who looks like he could get hit in the head by a fucking media

2353
02:03:23.491 --> 02:03:24.324
and he'd be fine.

2354
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:28.380
He gets clipped with one shot and goes unconscious arms behind his head and the

2355
02:03:28.381 --> 02:03:32.070
whole place goes fucking insane.
People were standing up.

2356
02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:35.220
People were pissed because they weren't watching because it was getting boring

2357
02:03:35.370 --> 02:03:38.760
because the one guy was just teeing off on the other guy.
Dude,

2358
02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:42.930
the craziest Shit I've ever seen in a thousand years of fighting thousand fights

2359
02:03:42.931 --> 02:03:46.650
rather a thousand years.
How old am I?
1,000 fights over 10 years.

2360
02:03:46.651 --> 02:03:49.000
The craziest Shit I've seen by far was this knockout.
Huh?

2361
02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:52.260
<v 4>Have to find it.
You got to see it.
I think you need to see,</v>

2362
02:03:52.261 --> 02:03:55.800
check it out with doctor Steve Berle.
What does that is a new show.
Uh,

2363
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:58.290
based off our,
is the spin off of Tim and Eric Show.

2364
02:03:58.291 --> 02:04:01.830
It just started off adult swim.
It's every Sunday night at midnight,

2365
02:04:01.831 --> 02:04:04.650
but check it out.
Tivo that it's only 15 minutes long,

2366
02:04:04.651 --> 02:04:08.400
but it's so ridiculously awesome.
It's called check it out with doctor.

2367
02:04:08.401 --> 02:04:09.600
Steve Rule will love it.

2368
02:04:11.130 --> 02:04:12.270
<v 6>I'm looking out for it.</v>

2369
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:17.490
<v 4>Uh,
so we should talk about the flash light at the end too.
If you guys,
uh,</v>

2370
02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:21.740
could have fleshlight.com or go to Joe's Rogan's website and click on the banner

2371
02:04:21.741 --> 02:04:25.010
on the right side.
They are official sponsor of the podcast.

2372
02:04:25.011 --> 02:04:27.260
And if you click on their banner,
you get 15% off your order.

2373
02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:32.740
And I highly recommend getting some of the flesh light lotion or oil.

2374
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:37.040
It's the best stuff even to use without a flashlight.
Oh,
here,
look at this.

2375
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:38.520
flashlight.com

2376
02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:40.530
<v 1>one punch.
This is the fight.</v>

2377
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.980
Did the other guy out of nowhere,

2378
02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:47.070
the other guy is a fucking a monster or a destroyer.

2379
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:50.740
The owner of the fastest Kao in UFC history and this fat guy clips on with one.

2380
02:04:50.741 --> 02:04:53.970
We'll hit this one punch of bang out of nowhere.
Boom.
That's it.
I'll cold.

2381
02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:58.350
It was like you shut off.
It was crazy fights,
dude.

2382
02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:01.410
There's nothing more unpredictable than an MMA fight.

2383
02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:06.210
You could be watching a soccer game and a team together getting fucked up for

2384
02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:09.120
the entire,
you know,
most of the,
most of the game,

2385
02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:13.500
a team can't come back and the final four seconds and when you know,

2386
02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:17.340
but in an MMA fight,
you're always in danger.
You can always lose it.

2387
02:05:17.490 --> 02:05:19.680
A soccer match,
they can get a basketball match.

2388
02:05:19.681 --> 02:05:21.570
You can get 50 points ahead and there's no way you can lose.

2389
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:26.550
But in a fight he could always lose.
It doesn't matter.
Accumulated scoring,

2390
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:27.081
you get,

2391
02:05:27.081 --> 02:05:30.540
you gotta be fucking somebody out for three rounds for four minutes and 50

2392
02:05:30.541 --> 02:05:33.540
seconds and in the last 10 seconds they punch you and you go to sleep and they

2393
02:05:33.541 --> 02:05:38.110
win.
That's fucking nuts.
It's one of the reasons why it's so exciting.

2394
02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:40.720
It's also one of the reasons why we're never going to embrace soccer.

2395
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:47.500
I embrace it.
Do you embrace it?
Yeah,
that's my penis.

2396
02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:49.030
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

2397
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:52.780
How funny would it be if the US won the World Cup and nobody gave a fuck?

2398
02:05:52.781 --> 02:05:55.660
Who Cares?
No one does give a fuck that you're crazy.

2399
02:05:55.661 --> 02:05:58.720
And other countries is gigantic.
Okay.
You're getting negative.

2400
02:05:58.721 --> 02:06:02.260
We're going to end the podcast.
I feel your,
your blood sugar dropping.

2401
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:04.330
I'm going to give you candy in the middle of the podcast.

2402
02:06:04.331 --> 02:06:08.110
Now scales you getting measurably less focused towards the end son.

2403
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:13.120
You need a candy bar stun gun.
That was a good fight to Nick Diaz.
All right.

2404
02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:16.710
There's a lot of catch wrestling.
Yeah,
there's a lot of a,

2405
02:06:16.730 --> 02:06:19.660
I need to bring Mrs Rogan on.
Fuck you faggot.
Get your own wife.

2406
02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:23.950
Just staring at my wife.
Um,
the,
uh,

2407
02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:28.980
heard your wife's not doing transformers three.
Now shut up.
I got it.
Hold on.

2408
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:31.900
You know,
I donate data actresses.
I have no head shots policy.

2409
02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:37.000
Very strict.
Usually till we all should in life.

2410
02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:40.150
Everyone should have a new head shots policy coming from the point of view of

2411
02:06:40.151 --> 02:06:42.490
someone with a headshot.
I guess I have one out there,
some somewhere.

2412
02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:44.590
But anybody who wants to be in the entertainment business,

2413
02:06:44.591 --> 02:06:48.070
who wants that kind of an exorbitant amount of attention?
You gotta be fucked up.

2414
02:06:48.370 --> 02:06:50.980
I'm fucked up.
Everybody else's.
It's a comic as fucked up.

2415
02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:54.250
Every actor's fucked up.
Every singer fucked up.
They're fucked up.

2416
02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.600
You're managing it.
You know,

2417
02:06:55.601 --> 02:06:58.330
you're trying to do your best with whatever fucked up energy habit.

2418
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:59.800
The only reason why you're doing the first place,

2419
02:06:59.801 --> 02:07:01.300
cause you fucked up when you agree.

2420
02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:04.300
[inaudible] have you ever met a performance not fucked up in some way.

2421
02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:08.320
[inaudible] no,
it's possible.
Right?
That's the balance though,
my friend.

2422
02:07:08.321 --> 02:07:09.550
That is the balance of life.

2423
02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:14.080
You have to have some sort of a void in your life to be able to provide other

2424
02:07:14.081 --> 02:07:17.350
people with this sort of entertainment joy.
That's the engine.

2425
02:07:17.351 --> 02:07:21.070
That's the motivation behind that shit.
You know,
just like porn stars,

2426
02:07:21.071 --> 02:07:23.980
you have to be,
have a,
a,
you know,
a bad childhood.

2427
02:07:23.981 --> 02:07:26.770
If you want to let guys fuck you on,
on camera,
right?

2428
02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:29.380
There's gotta be something wrong there.
Right?

2429
02:07:29.410 --> 02:07:31.510
Or are you just totally love money or he took,

2430
02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:35.360
I guess you've got to really love money.
You know,
I think a,

2431
02:07:35.361 --> 02:07:38.750
there's a crazy balance to all life.
We've talked about this before,
but you know,

2432
02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:40.880
it's like what we were talking about when we're talking about third world

2433
02:07:40.881 --> 02:07:44.160
countries like and and idiots in America,
even you,
you,

2434
02:07:44.161 --> 02:07:48.470
you need a certain amount of unenlightened fools in this world to keep the world

2435
02:07:48.471 --> 02:07:49.330
operating on,

2436
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:52.400
on the level that it's operating now you need a certain amount of people that

2437
02:07:52.401 --> 02:07:53.840
live in places where it's socks,
you know,

2438
02:07:53.841 --> 02:07:56.780
certain amount of people that live in impoverished countries and you need

2439
02:07:56.781 --> 02:07:58.550
corporations to exploit them in order to,

2440
02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:01.460
to keep this thing going the way it's going right now.
You know,

2441
02:08:01.461 --> 02:08:03.560
I'm not saying this is the only model that would function,

2442
02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.870
but this is the model that we currently operate under.

2443
02:08:05.871 --> 02:08:08.600
And in order to keep this model going,
you know,

2444
02:08:08.690 --> 02:08:11.570
I think what's happening is exactly what has to happen.

2445
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:15.350
It really does seem like the more you pay attention to life,

2446
02:08:15.351 --> 02:08:18.020
that life is a program,
you know,
the more you,

2447
02:08:18.021 --> 02:08:21.230
you look at it all and look at the temporary nature of it all and you realize

2448
02:08:21.231 --> 02:08:23.330
that this really is some sort of a program we're following.

2449
02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:24.650
Don't you feel that all the time.

2450
02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:25.613
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

2451
02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:29.380
<v 1>and it doesn't feel real.
Right?
It feels,
it feels orchestrated.</v>

2452
02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:32.613
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

2453
02:08:34.150 --> 02:08:37.930
<v 1>Doesn't it?
[inaudible] I agree.
Oh my God,
you useless.</v>

2454
02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:42.770
This is what I saw it this way.
So that's what made me,
why does,

2455
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:44.260
what does I always talk about porn stars?

2456
02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.970
I guess cause I'm always beating off cause we love porn.
No,
I'm,

2457
02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:51.110
because I'm fascinated by that.
The world of it.
You know,
I'm,

2458
02:08:51.111 --> 02:08:54.850
I'm fascinated by all unusual human behavior.

2459
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:57.610
I'm fascinated by strippers.
I'm fascinated by fighters.

2460
02:08:57.910 --> 02:09:01.600
I'm fascinated by Comedians,
entertainers,
performers,
all the,

2461
02:09:01.601 --> 02:09:04.900
the outskirts of,
of normal behavior.
Whether it's,

2462
02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:08.650
I don't mean none of it's bad.
It's all good.
I mean,
we all fuck.
Who Cares?

2463
02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:11.740
Fucking on camera.
There's nothing wrong with it.
We've all watched it.

2464
02:09:11.741 --> 02:09:14.730
We all benefit from it.
But this to me,
I'm,

2465
02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:19.150
I'm always fascinated by extreme types of behavior,
you know,

2466
02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:21.430
especially if they're not disturbing.
If it's not negative,
like,
you know,

2467
02:09:21.431 --> 02:09:23.830
we talked about the Max hardcore thing,
don't like that,

2468
02:09:24.130 --> 02:09:27.000
but I'm fascinated by all sorts of weird behavior.

2469
02:09:27.001 --> 02:09:29.430
I think it helps you understand your own,
don't you?
All right,
great.

2470
02:09:30.450 --> 02:09:35.160
After fucking two hours,
that's all Brian's sizes.
Yup.
Yup.
I agree.
And I'm like,

2471
02:09:35.161 --> 02:09:36.190
listen,
you faggot.

2472
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:39.670
<v 3>Well I was thinking if I should even get into something because I don't want to</v>

2473
02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:41.830
go any longer.
You know what I mean?
And I just had,

2474
02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:45.220
it's kind of scary to get to a point where you're like,
okay,
we need to end this,

2475
02:09:45.221 --> 02:09:46.140
but if I bring some,

2476
02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:49.490
<v 1>we can talk for 20 minutes.
I was ready to bail at any moment.</v>

2477
02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:53.090
I'm looking for a good moment to hell after two hours we looking for a good

2478
02:09:53.091 --> 02:09:55.500
moment to bail.
But if you have something interesting to talk about,
just talk.

2479
02:09:55.670 --> 02:09:57.320
<v 3>All right.
Is there a proper way to,</v>

2480
02:09:57.321 --> 02:10:00.840
when you know where you see porns where girls are giving blow jobs in,
right?

2481
02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:04.460
You're choking or gagging,
right?
Uh,

2482
02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:07.670
is there a proper way to do it in a not a proper way to do it?

2483
02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:09.950
Like is there like a secret to it like you?

2484
02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:13.490
<v 1>No,
I think it's the girl.
Some girls like that shit dude.
Right?</v>

2485
02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:18.200
They're lucky to stuff it in or out.
They like to choke.
It's weird,
you know.
Um,

2486
02:10:18.230 --> 02:10:21.710
I don't think there's a secret way to do it.
I think mom is a total liar.

2487
02:10:21.711 --> 02:10:25.370
Then your mom told you something about porn?
Yeah.
What'd you say,
Brian?
Nothing.

2488
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:27.500
Okay,
Brian,
now I know you're useless.

2489
02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:30.590
You were doing real good for about two hours there fella.

2490
02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:33.080
And there's nothing else to talk about.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2491
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.130
give us another half an hour.

2492
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.740
<v 0>Listen,
the last half an hour it will suck.
Okay.</v>

2493
02:10:36.741 --> 02:10:40.130
It'll be me talking to Brian and Brian checking his watch and looking at his

2494
02:10:40.131 --> 02:10:42.290
text messages.
He's right though.

2495
02:10:42.291 --> 02:10:46.160
You can't really do more than two hours and be interesting.
So,
uh,

2496
02:10:46.190 --> 02:10:49.160
and I think we're not interesting right now.
I think there's at the end of it,
um,

2497
02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:50.653
please stop doing that.

2498
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:56.630
Get a penny next week.
I'm going to try to bring some other guests,

2499
02:10:56.631 --> 02:10:58.760
maybe some comics and see if I can gather anybody.

2500
02:10:58.761 --> 02:11:01.520
I'm a going to be a at the end part of this week,

2501
02:11:01.521 --> 02:11:04.670
so I'll come by and see if I grabbed somebody and bring some guys back here.

2502
02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:09.080
Make it interesting.
Um,
but let's say you get fucking tired fellow.

2503
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:12.770
You're not thinking about the fact there's 1200 people listeners right now.

2504
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:16.210
10,000 to go listen to it on Ustream.
Honestly,

2505
02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:18.700
I'm thinking about pissing my pants,
right?
Oh,
really?
Why don't you go up,

2506
02:11:18.701 --> 02:11:21.590
get up and take a leak?
You fucking freak.
All right.

2507
02:11:21.591 --> 02:11:26.030
You hanging in there hanging tough little kid.
But that's why he's so talented,

2508
02:11:26.031 --> 02:11:29.090
ladies and gentleman,
because he thinks like a child.
We all have.

2509
02:11:29.150 --> 02:11:31.940
We're all replaced in this world,
right,
Brian?
That's right,
Daddy.
All right.

2510
02:11:31.941 --> 02:11:34.280
Thank you ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much for tuning in.

2511
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:37.380
We appreciate it.
As always,
we will come back next week.
Uh,

2512
02:11:37.381 --> 02:11:42.020
I don't have any gigs until a couple of weeks.
I'm in Canada.
Go to Joe rogan.net.

2513
02:11:42.021 --> 02:11:43.160
You can see it all.
