00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.630
I'll mention one other project too.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.680
Jen Lowe is an artist and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.330
data visualizer based in New York, and she has this project called One,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.230
I think it's called One Human Heartbeat and she has a device I forget if it's,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.650
you know, I don't remember if it's something she puts on her wrist or

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.990
something, but it's a device that like measures, tracks your heartbeat.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.100
And if you go to this website,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.390
you can see your heartbeat visualized with a 24 hour delay.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.200
So, like every night, she plugs the device in and it syncs up, and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.170
it cuts the data off, and all you see is just this, like, pulsing, but it's like

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.950
an ac, it's, it's a really intense, because it's an actual representation of her

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.680
actual heartbeat, and so if it's going faster or going slower.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.860
And I think it's such a beautiful visualization.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.690
It's more like conceptual art than, you know,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.560
it does, doesn't give you this history, like this histogram over time.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.140
It just gives you here's my heart beating.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.160
This is like a real person that you're seeing translated on to your screen
