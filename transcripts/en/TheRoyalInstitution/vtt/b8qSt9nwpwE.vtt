00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.850
Here we have a walking device just to remind
you of how something walks.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.080
This is an artificial limb.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.460
And we've loaded it a little bit to make it
look a little more real.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.060
And now if I walk I make the limb swing, but
I don't press hard.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.460
That's what a walking gait is.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.440
I just let the leg fall back into place, so to speak,
without any special drive.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.420
That's not at all the same as running and
we'll talk about running later.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.850
But I think if you think to yourself when
you're walking or running next,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.890
try to see how it is you're moving. It's a
complicated action

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.820
but the essential feature is that it moves
slower and fall back,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.060
move forward and fall back in just that fashion.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.060
Now that... Thank you, Bill.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.739
That gives rise to the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.140
notion that the principal determiner of the
speed of walking is not at all the,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.540
as one might think, the complicated mechanics
of the muscles and the bones.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.550
In fact it is very simple. The main determiner,
perhaps not the only thing,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.020
because we're trying to simplify a rather
complicated kind of motion,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.030
the main determiner is the swing as the swing
of a pendulum.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.060
A very stratightforward matter.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.880
And that swing, as you know with a pendulum,
takes longer,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.660
the bigger the pendulum length.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.400
The greater the pendulum length, the more
the swing of the pendulum.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.740
Therefore, we can say that the time for the
swing

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.359
is proportional to the square root of the
length of the pendulum.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.480
In this case the length of a characteristic
bone or characteristic typical size of the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.240
animal.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.920
Any size you want to choose, any dimension,
let's say his leg length.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.660
I can write that of course that's the same
as the fractional exponent L to the one half.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.200
If you prefer this notation, why very good.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.620
Now then notice what that says, that says
the time for a pace

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.600
is longer the bigger the animal.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.200
Let us try that a little bit, to see if there
is any reality in that picture.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.740
I don't think we need those, well, alright.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.749
Alright, we shall look at them then very quickly.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.720
Just to remind you what a pendulum looks like.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.960
Here is a long pendulum.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.740
And here a short one.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.420
Notice many more beats in the same interval
of time.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.800
That's quite familiar and if we were to measure
it you would find

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.819
it would go very tolerably like the square
root of L.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.660
Thank you, Bill.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.980
Now let us do that for a few animals to see
what they look like.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.420
And their appearance is as follows.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840
Can we have again some of our boy walking
schemes.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.720
Now, the idea is to walk, Martin, and not
to hurry.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.040
You're sauntering down past the park in the
summer time and not very busy,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.969
and not late for school, and just walking
along.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.420
Go ahead and I'll give a start to Bill to
start, you just walk along peacefully.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.900
And start. One. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.680
What did we get?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.440
Six seconds.
- Six seconds!

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.040
Well that seems pretty good.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.840
And six seconds for a boy walk.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.960
Now let us try a smaller animal. I think we
have a performer here again.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.260
Tessa, a member of the Coates family as I
recall.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.800
This is a complete Coates performance here.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.780
And let's see how Tessa walks. Let's start
her off and I'll try to count.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.960
Start. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.240
Three seconds? Very interesting.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.280
And now you see quite well that the smaller
animal has taken much less time for a pace.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.920
Let us look now at a larger animal.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.689
Again we have our same problem, hard to bring
in the large animal,

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.480
but not so difficult with the splendid effect
of film.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.680
So let us look in a film a large animal and
try again to count with me her paces once

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.320
I begin.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.540
Start.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.040
Splendid.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.260
8.5 seconds.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.580
There's certainly no question about the time
increasing from 8.5,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.940
from three seconds to eight and a half seconds
for ten paces.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.100
We may... that's a factor of about two something,
2.4 or so.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.700
If I were to square that I would get about
six or eight,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.650
and it seems reasonable that dog's leg height
is about a foot or a little more than a foot.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.979
And the giraffe's leg height is about six
or seven times that, six or seven feet,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.740
and that comes tolerably close to the square
root of L.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.400
But notice something. Does that mean that
a giraffe walks slower?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.960
Her paces are slower, but does she walk slower
than Tessa?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.980
Who would win in a race?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.600
A walking race.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.700
What do you think?

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.040
The giraffe, yes.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.660
Why?

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.420
Paces are slower but... but what everybody?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.080
Takes longer per pace, that's exactly right.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.500
The speed after all is found this way.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.880
The speed is the distance over the time.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.360
But the distance per step surely is proportional
to the size of the animal's leg.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.030
He makes a long step. So proportional to L
divided by the time,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.840
which goes like L to the one half.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.560
The overall effect then is like L to the 1/2
and the speed is greater

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.259
the walking speed for the bigger animal.

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.140
I recommend you to try that on boys of different
heights,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.330
on girls, on horses, men, women, dogs, squirrels
anything you can find.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.580
See if this rule really works for walking.
I think that it does.
