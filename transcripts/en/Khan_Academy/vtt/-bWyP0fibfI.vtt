00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.660
Hey everybody! Rocco T. Mole here

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.660
to wish you a Happy Mole Day

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.680
from all of us at Khan Academy!

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:09.360
Yes, moles!

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.749
The chemistry concept, not the critter.

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.900
Now, in case you’ve been living under a rock (like me)

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.700
a mole is another name for Avogadro’s number

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.700
which is (approximately) 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.740
Kinda like how a “dozen” is another name for 12.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.980
So why do we need a name for such a big number?!

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.540
Well, we could write it like this: 602,214,129,000,000,000,000,000

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.840
(Thank you)

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.380
But that would take a while!

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.820
Moles make counting easier for chemists,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.800
particularly when talking about atoms or molecules.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.520
So for the number of molecules in a cup of water,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.340
you could write an 8 with 24 zeros after it...

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.280
OR you could just call it 13 moles of water instead!

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.920
(Thank you Yuki)

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.260
Isn't that easier?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
Now, the moral of this story is: moles are the best!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.680
And if you want to learn more about chemistry,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.770
or anything, really, head to our website: khanacademy.org

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.740
That's Khan as in Ghenghis, no relation; and Academy, as in academy.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.240
Happy Mole Day everyone!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.800
You can learn anything!

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.300
Are we still–we're not recording, right?
