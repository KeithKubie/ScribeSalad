00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:05.475
Let's learn to control our dreams!

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:06.515
And other people's minds.

00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:10.705
But we'll start with dreams.

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:18.335
Anthony here for DNews and you guys have been
asking a LOT about Lucid Dreaming lately.

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:23.565
I've been able to do it fairly consistently
since I was about 13, so I thought sure- I

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:24.735
can talk about that.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:27.525
A lucid dream is one where you know you're
dreaming.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:32.096
You can also potentially control it- you can
turn a nightmare into a good dream, fly, go

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:37.834
places you've never been, do some sexy things-
a lot of my teenage ones were about sexy things.

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:39.904
So how does it work and how can you do it?

00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:41.105
The how of it is complicated.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:45.494
We're not even entirely sure why we dream,
which is what makes lucid dreaming so valuable

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:46.494
to scientists.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:50.654
Studying the brain of someone who can dream
about exactly what they're told to can help

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:54.775
create a sort of control group so researchers
can see just what's happening in different

00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:59.485
brains during similar dreams, and maybe finally
figure out just why it happens.

00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:02.535
We do know this - dreaming is sort of a whole
brain activity.

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:07.274
The pons system of your brain stem initiates
it, your limbic system adds emotions, and

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:09.925
your prefrontal cortex puts it all together.

00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:14.635
But the parts of your brain associated with
self-awareness are are turned off.

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:18.575
In a study run by the Max Planck Institutes
of Psychiatry, they found that people who

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:25.375
can have lucid dreams can switch those parts
of their brain on- be self-aware AND dreaming

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:26.654
at the same time.

00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:31.194
So, if you want to make yourself a flying
robot sex god in your dreams, how do you do

00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:32.194
it?

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:33.654
Step one: keep a dream journal.

00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:37.654
Whenever you wake up, write down as much about
your dreams as you remember- you'll start

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:39.715
to recognize certain patterns in them.

00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:43.205
That'll make you more likely to notice them
when you're dreaming.

00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.055
You should also start reality testing.

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:48.785
Throughout the day, stop and ask yourself:
"Am I dreaming?"

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:51.014
Then test things around you to make sure you
aren't.

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:52.294
Flip a lightswitch.

00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:53.955
Look at your watch a couple times.

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:59.325
If you're dreaming, the switch won't do anything
and your watch will be keeping really, really

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:01.535
strange time.

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:07.074
Once you're lucid, it's hard to stay lucid
and sleeping.

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:10.684
Your body either wants to wake up or keep
dreaming as usual.

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:13.935
People who are new to it tend to wake up right
after they notice they're dreaming.

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:18.695
If you feel like you're waking up, you're
supposed to look at the ground and spin around

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:19.695
in your dream.

00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:24.475
The technique was discovered by Stephen LaBerge,
a psychiatrist who studies lucid dreams- his

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:29.795
theory is that familiar motion like that engages
your senses and makes your brain focus on

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:30.795
the dream.

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:31.795
So there you go.

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:34.825
Go forth, you dream explorers, and report
your results back to me.

00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:36.315
Unless it's sexy stuff.

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:38.515
That sort of dream is just for you, okay?

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:41.295
If there's anything else that you want us
to make a video about, definitely leave it
