hung up in whether it's open or not I

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959
hung up in whether it's open or not I
 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.650
hung up in whether it's open or not I
need the data and you you do things to

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
need the data and you you do things to
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.210
need the data and you you do things to
do that and I think a lot of scientists

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
do that and I think a lot of scientists
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.270
do that and I think a lot of scientists
are that so so we do have to keep I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280
are that so so we do have to keep I

think the perspective that the goal of
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.440
think the perspective that the goal of
science is I think as was mentioned

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
science is I think as was mentioned
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.449

ago and the the space scientists in
 

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.660
ago and the the space scientists in
particular were making the claim that

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:58.670
particular were making the claim that

NASA an agency invented about 50 years

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:03.630
NASA an agency invented about 50 years
 

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.889
NASA an agency invented about 50 years
ago was going to keep data on the

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899
ago was going to keep data on the
 

00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:11.600

history of the universe forever

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:11.610
 

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.949
how many people what's the age of the

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959
how many people what's the age of the
 

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:18.239
how many people what's the age of the
universe you know thirteen point seven

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:18.249
universe you know thirteen point seven
 

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:21.840
universe you know thirteen point seven
seven billion years and these guys in

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:21.850
seven billion years and these guys in
 

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.350

the same sentence said NASA a

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360
the same sentence said NASA a
 

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.489

fifty-year-old organization is going to

00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:26.499
fifty-year-old organization is going to
 

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:31.290
fifty-year-old organization is going to
keep data forever when you know their

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:31.300
keep data forever when you know their
 

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.929
keep data forever when you know their
other definition are forever is more

00:09:33.929 --> 00:09:33.939
other definition are forever is more
 

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:35.879
other definition are forever is more
than 13 billion years so this doesn't

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:35.889
than 13 billion years so this doesn't
 

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:38.160
than 13 billion years so this doesn't
even come close but what it was making a

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.170
even come close but what it was making a
 

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.100

useful you know in the short term may be
 

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.890
useful you know in the short term may be
very valuable to science but on the

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:28.900
very valuable to science but on the
 

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.110
very valuable to science but on the
other hand there's also the need to have

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120
other hand there's also the need to have
 

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.180
other hand there's also the need to have
a mechanism by which those become part

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.190
a mechanism by which those become part
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.340

think about okay that was great when it
 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.650
think about okay that was great when it
was great and it's past its time but we

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:49.660
was great and it's past its time but we
 

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.720
was great and it's past its time but we
still need some parts of that knowledge

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:51.730
still need some parts of that knowledge
 

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.280

passing or the graduation or whatever of

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:01.060
passing or the graduation or whatever of
 

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.510
passing or the graduation or whatever of
the individual people involved so that's

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:03.520
the individual people involved so that's
 

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.540
the individual people involved so that's
sort of one little thing I think that

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:06.550
sort of one little thing I think that
 

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.030

kind of underpins some of the discussion

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040
kind of underpins some of the discussion
 

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.340
kind of underpins some of the discussion
we had today and obviously there's no

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:11.350
we had today and obviously there's no
 

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.640
we had today and obviously there's no
solution but i think you know as a

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:14.650
solution but i think you know as a
 

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.440
solution but i think you know as a
scientist I think we have to step back

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:16.450
scientist I think we have to step back
 

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.520
scientist I think we have to step back
and think about how those pieces fit

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:20.530
and think about how those pieces fit
 

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.580
and think about how those pieces fit
together and think about the

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:23.590
together and think about the
 

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.190
together and think about the
institutional design that will make us

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:26.200
institutional design that will make us
 

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:40.340
institutional design that will make us
all well live virtually forever Thanks
