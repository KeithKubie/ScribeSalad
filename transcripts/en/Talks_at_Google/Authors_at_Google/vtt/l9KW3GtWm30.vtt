[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:06.760
MICHAEL: It's a great pleasure.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.640
And really, I'm extremely
personally excited today

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.590
to welcome Derek to Google.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.900
He's both a lifelong
friend of mine,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.140
as well as being a senior editor
at "The Atlantic" magazine

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.760
where he writes about economics,
labor markets, and the media.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.910
Derek is a regular contributor
on NPR'S "Here and Now."

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.870
And you may have
also seen him on TV

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.920
where he is currently a regular
contributor to CNBC and MSNBC.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.920
He's appeared on
numerous lists, including

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.170
Forbes and "Ink Magazine's"
30 under 30, as well

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.510
as being one of the top
Twitter feeds to follow,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.060
as he's received praise from
"Time Magazine" in that regard.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.600
His new book, "Hit Makers--
the Science of Popularity

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.140
in an Age of Distraction," hit
bookshelves and audio books

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.390
in February.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.880
And Derek is now in the midst
of a nationwide book tour.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.599
So without further ado, it is
my great pleasure and honor

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.844
to welcome Derek Thompson.

00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:09.229
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.197
DEREK THOMPSON:
Thank you, Michael.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:16.780
I also want to thank my friend
Robbie Depicciotto sitting here

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.490
in the front row,
also a lifelong friend

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.870
since kindergarten.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.210
I also want to
thank this, which is

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.010
going to type every single
word that I said as I say it,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.980
which is such an awesome thing
to have right in front of me.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.520
I know the technology exists
and I know that screens exist,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.940
but I've never quite had the
experience of having a screen

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.400
read back to me
exactly my words.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.240
So if I say something
extremely stupid,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.380
I'll know just to
look right up there,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.838
in order to edit it, which
would be helpful for my day job,

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:42.220
actually.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.410
So day job-- I'm a senior
editor at "The Atlantic."

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.200
I write about economics
in the media mostly.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.420
And this is my first book.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.690
I wanted to write what I
called an unsentimental book

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.370
about a sentimental subject.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.380
People feel very
emotionally about hits,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.900
their favorite movies,
their favorite songs.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.700
Even the favorite
means can sometimes

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.820
draw, elicit an emotional
response, I suppose.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.130
And I wanted to write an
unsentimental book about this.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.509
Why do we like some
things and not others?

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.660
Why do things go,
quote unquote, "viral"

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.640
or, as I"ll soon explain, not.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.900
So the seven-word thesis of
the book, to kick us off,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.160
is familiarity over novelty
and distribution over content.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.410
And I'll say it one more time.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.820
Familiarity over novelty and
distribution over content.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.400
And that means that I
think we live in a world

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.770
that I call a cult of the new.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.900
We are told that we need
to listen to new music

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.120
and watch new movies
and consume new articles

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.810
and buy new clothes and stay
up with the new fashion cycle.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.739
But in fact, if you
go to human psychology

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.530
and you talk to
psychologists, particularly

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.660
evolutionary psychologists,
what you'll discover

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.325
is that people actually
don't like new things at all.

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:50.200
They hate new things.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.990
They particularly hate things
that are extremely new.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.170
If anything, what we
like in particular

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.270
are familiar surprises.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.850
We love new products
that secretly remind us

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.780
of old products.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.150
We love new songs with
old chord structures,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.120
new movies that are sequels
and adaptations and reboots.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.920
And even in my line
of work, people

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.070
love to read and
pass along articles

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.530
that provide a new joke, a new
frame, a new simile or metaphor

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.770
to explain that which the
reader has already intuited

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.350
and sort of serve their
biases back to them.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.500
In many ways, journalism is
essentially a business of--

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.980
or opinion journalism,
going by popularity,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.370
is a confirmation bias industry.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.540
Distribution over content
is also really important.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.050
And that's where I'm going
to start to dive right in.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.020
One of the most controversial
ideas from the book

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.960
is something that I
call the viral myth.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.040
I think that when something
becomes popular out of nowhere

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.660
now, it's become casual and it's
become the patois to say, oh,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.430
that thing went viral.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.250
In epidemiology, viral means
something very specific.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.610
It means an idea that is sort
of passed along organically

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.290
between people,
and it grows over

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
many, many, many generations
to become a pandemic.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.670
And there, I think, has grown
up in the world in the last 15

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.560
years, particularly
since the tipping point,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.590
a sense that ideas do the same
and that the way that ideas

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.140
go big is that they go viral.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.019
They have a million
one-to-one moments.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.210
For a long period of
time, it was practically

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.090
impossible to analyze
whether or not ideas actually

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.930
spread in this way.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.440
There was no way to
scientifically study,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.800
for example, the spread of
bell-bottoms in the 1970s--

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.330
very, very difficult to do.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.120
Online, however, information
leaves a data trail,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.870
as people in this audience
are probably extremely aware.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.150
You can trace the
flow of information

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.340
from the original
sender to the sendee,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.220
watch how something like
a Tweet or a YouTube video

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.040
spreads over generations
and becomes a hit.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.280
And when data scientists look
at the information cascade--

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.140
the map of that idea or video or
article sort of coming alive--

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.450
it doesn't, in fact, look like
the map of a disease spreading.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.870
It looks much more like
diffuse broadcasts.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.800
So if you sort of imagine a
spectrum of how information

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.320
spreads, on the one hand,
you have typhus, which

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.170
only spreads between people.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.460
And on the other hand,
you have the Super Bowl--

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.030
a single broadcast to 150
million people all at once.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.840
And nobody says that an
advertisement in the Super Bowl

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.690
goes viral.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.610
That's sort of
on-its-face absurd to say.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.230
It clearly infected 115
million people all at once.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.150
But online, what
seems to be happening

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.970
is that there are many, many
broadcast moments, which

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.580
are obfuscated to
the ultimate reader

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.180
or consumer of that information
so that the end consumer thinks

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.460
that something has gone
viral when, in fact, the most

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.740
important reason
why it was spread

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.600
is through a
broadcast mechanism.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.250
So let me take a
very easy example.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.920
Let's take an article that
I write for "The Atlantic"

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.750
magazine, for the Atlantic.com.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.760
I post it online.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.830
And Drudge picks it up.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.560
Drudge is read by millions
and millions of people

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.160
all over the world.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.380
Let's say two of them read
that article on Drudge,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.510
and then they Gchat me about it.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.950
Well, it might be
sort of seductive

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.830
for me to say, this article
is clearly going viral,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.020
because two people
Gchatted it to me.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.580
That's a social mechanism.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.340
But the most important
way that this idea spread

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.280
is through the broadcast
mechanism that was Drudge.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.420
And it turns out that across in
Twitter and YouTube studies--

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.830
that's where these data
scientists at Microsoft

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.316
and Yahoo, particularly
Duncan Watts, who I think

00:06:36.316 --> 00:06:37.940
might have spoken
here a few years ago.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.390
He's a data scientist.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.910
When they study the spread of
these pieces of information,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.430
what they've said is that they
most likely spread through

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.550
broadcast mechanisms, rather
than social mechanisms,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.460
that it's not, in other words,
about a million one-to-one

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.580
moments, but rather about a
handful of one-to-one-million

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.510
moments.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.510
Some people say, OK, I
guess that's interesting,

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.280
but it just sounds like
an academic discussion

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.390
of information cascades.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.400
Why could it possibly be
relevant to my purposes?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.400
And I think it's relevant
for both producers

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.680
and consumers of information.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.200
For producers of information,
I think sometimes we

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.960
get caught up in a cult
of virality where we say,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.690
there are certain
ingredients to content

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.090
that can make something
automatically go viral.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.580
And if I make content that
includes those ingredients,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.710
I can just dump it
anywhere on the internet,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.830
and it will spread organically
and automatically, the same way

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.410
that if you have
typhus in a population,

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.970
it will just
automatically spread,

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.680
because it is inherently viral.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.420
And what we've
essentially discovered

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.210
in a lot of these studies is
that that's just not the case.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.130
Of course, there
are some things that

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.990
are more likely to be
shared than other things.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.540
An incredibly emotional video of
a tiger reuniting with someone

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.360
who used to raise him
when he was six months old

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.590
is going to spread further than
some article about the Canadian

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.410
Parliament.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.820
High arousal emotions clearly
get people to click and then

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.000
share more than something that's
an article about a topic they

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.020
know nothing about.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.350
Emotionality and
familiarity are incredibly

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.540
potent when it comes
to popularizing

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.710
a piece of content.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.300
But they're not enough.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.060
The distribution strategy,
the distribution mechanism,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.160
the sources that
these places hit

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.020
is more important
than the qualities

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.332
of the content itself.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.290
The second reason that
the viral myth, I think,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.380
is really important to know
about is on the consumer side.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.330
I think at a time of declining
trust in establishment media,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.559
a lot of readers equate
volume with veracity.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.350
That is, they say, well,
I saw this article shared

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.179
by five people on Facebook.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.570
Therefore, it must be true,
even though I distrust

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.880
all of these right wing
and maybe even left wing

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.080
sources of news.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.380
But in fact, if
that reader searched

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.880
for the provenance of that
piece of information--

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.150
searched for the
broadcast moment

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.670
when it spread to millions
and millions of people,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.980
five of whom shared it
with them on Facebook,

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.040
they might realize that it was
coming from propaganda, that it

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.010
was coming from Macedonian
teenagers or some far

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.520
left or far right web blog.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.100
And so it's really
important, I think,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.250
for consumers to seek out
the provenance of information

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.400
and, again, not
trust the viral myth.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.380
As I've gone around the country
and talked about this issue,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.040
I've confronted what I call
two degrees of Trump, which

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.140
is to say that I tell
one story and then

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.285
I open it up to questions.

00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:27.410
And the first question is
always about Donald Trump

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.360
and how does your book
explain Donald Trump.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.610
And the short answer
is that my book

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.740
was finished in September 2016.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.990
So like everyone in
this room, I would

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.740
guess I did not think that
what happened would happen.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.090
But there really is
an interesting story.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.590
Well, Donald Trump
is in the book

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.580
in chapters one, two, and
three, because he's just

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.520
such an unbelievably
fascinating character.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.220
And there is, I
think, a story that

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.870
goes really deeply at explaining
how a creature like Donald

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.610
Trump could at least
get to where he

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.270
did in the presidential race.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.870
And the best way to
tell the story actually

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.810
starts in the pop
music industry.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.890
The Billboard Hot 100 is
the most famous register

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.750
of popular music in America.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.410
It's been registering the 100
most popular songs in the US

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.930
every week since 1958.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.200
But for a long time--

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.570
most people don't know this--

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.230
the Billboard Hot 100 was
essentially lying to you.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.540
It was a register of lies.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.370
And the reason why
is that it relied

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.600
on two sources of information.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.220
First, they would
survey radio deejays.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.850
And second, they would
ask record store owners,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.800
what's selling?

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.340
The problem with
this strategy is

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.430
that the deejays were
often being paid directly

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.104
by the labels.

00:10:44.104 --> 00:10:45.770
So what you were
hearing was essentially

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.110
a game of telephone
from the labels

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.052
when you asked the
deejays what was popular.

00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:52.010
And when you talked to
the record store owners,

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.990
they had reason to lie, too,
because when music was a scarce

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.390
resource-- when it wasn't
digitized and it was just vinyl

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.310
records that you had to store--

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.280
if you had sold
out of ACDC, there

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.500
was no incentive for
the record store owner

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.380
to say that ACDC was selling
well, because they had nothing

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.430
left to sell.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.640
So instead, they would
say that something

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.880
that they still had some
records of was popular-- say,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.770
Def Leppard or
Bruce Springsteen.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.110
So not only was
the Billboard Hot

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.320
100 biased toward
the labels tastes,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.660
it was also biased toward churn.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.500
So the song would
hit number one,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.200
and it would fall right off.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.060
In 1991, Billboard
ditched this honor system.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.390
And they changed the way that
they measured the charts.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.920
First, they measured
airplay using SoundScan.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.950
And second, they registered
point of sales data

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.840
at record stores that
the record store owners

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.580
couldn't lie to Billboard.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.620
And almost immediately--
almost overnight--

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.830
literally within the next month,
two incredibly important things

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.960
changed in American music taste.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.550
First, music taste became
a lot more repetitive.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.770
When you looked at what
people were actually buying,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.849
rather than what record stores
were telling people to buy,

00:12:05.849 --> 00:12:07.390
it turned out that
people just wanted

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.420
to hear the same songs over
and over and over again.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.970
The 20 songs that have been
on the Billboard Hot 100

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:18.100
for the longest period of
time all came out after 1991.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.080
It's not because the
music got better.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.410
It's because the
methodology changed.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:28.150
Second, rock collapsed on the
charts in the early 1990s.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.082
And two other genres
soared up the charts.

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:32.290
You can probably guess what
at least one of them are,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.220
maybe both.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.380
They are hip hop and country--

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.360
both genres preferred by lower
class, lower income citizens

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.760
whose tastes might not
have been reflected

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.400
by the white men in
the suits on the coast.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.920
Their favorite kind
of music, rock, faded.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.650
The people's favorite kind of
music, country and hip hop,

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.340
soared.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.880
And hip hop remains today
the dominant genre of music.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.270
In sum, taste in music
used to be dictated

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.820
top to bottom from
the taste makers

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.730
through scarce distribution
channels to the public.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.870
And now tastes are much more
likely to bubble up, bottom up.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.400
And what does this have
to do with Donald Trump?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.760
Well, in the early
2000s, there was

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.510
a theory about how information
got passed on to voters.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.061
It was called the party decides.

00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:21.060
Maybe some of you are
familiar with this theory.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.880
It got a lot of play early in
the primaries this past cycle.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.760
The party decides theory will
sound very familiar to you

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.980
since I just told you
the Billboard story.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.230
A handful of taste
makers or influencers,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.560
who are party elites settled
on their favorite candidate--

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.540
let's call him Jeb Bush--

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.080
decided to distribute their
favoritism of Jeb Bush

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.150
through scarce media channels,
like FM stations and television

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.950
stations, and the public would
necessarily and obediently

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.340
come to believe them and vote
for the preferred candidate.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.030
Again, the familiarity--
familiarity breeds popularity.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.860
The more they heard
that Jeb Bush was

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.650
wonderful from the taste
makers on TV and on the radio,

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.140
the more likely they were
to hold that position

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.289
as their own.

00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:07.330
But what did we just see?

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.400
Jeb Bush had $100
million to spend,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.830
and he topped out at about
five percentage points.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.490
Marco Rubio got the second
most amount of money

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.240
from the establishment from the
elites, and he also flamed out.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.630
It was Donald Trump-- someone
who spent basically nothing

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.230
on paid media-- got a
lot of earned media,

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.300
spent very little
on paid media--

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.410
who absolutely trumped
through the Republican primary

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.140
on his way to
winning the election.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.240
So in many ways,
what we saw in music,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.860
I think is happening in
lots of other markets.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.830
We are used to, in all
of these industries,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.750
taste being dictated
by a handful of elites

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.020
to scarce distribution
channels to the public.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.770
And now tastes in markets
are much more chaotic, much

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.050
harder to predict, because
they are bubbling up

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.780
and they are harder to control.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.670
Throughout this book, I
talk a lot about music.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.020
I'm fascinated by the concept
of popularity in music

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.710
and why we like what we like
from genres to earworms.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.480
And I began my
investigation of music

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.390
at the very most elemental
question of, what is music?

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.210
Why does the brain
hear some sounds

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.500
as cacophony and other
sounds as musical?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.650
And there is a musicologist--
a detective of musical

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.850
illusions--

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.080
at the University of California
San Diego named Diana Deutsch.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.100
And Diana Deutsch, she
is famous for discovering

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.040
that particular illusion called
the speech to song illusion.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.090
And speech to song
illusion works like this.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.720
You take about any
sliver of human speaking,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.210
and you start
repeating it again,

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.170
start repeating it again,
start repeating it again,

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.630
start repeating it again.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.210
And the brain just starts
to process it as a rhythm

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.440
and starts to hear a melody in
what was previously just speech

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.850
stream.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.850
So what Diana would
say is that repetition

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.970
is the god particle of music.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.220
It is the thing
that distinguishes

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.200
the cacophony of
the ordinary world

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.050
from that which the
brain processes as song.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.460
This is true for speech stream.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.740
It's true for me
drumming on this podium.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.900
It's true for
animals in the wild.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.080
Biologists reserve the
term song for any animal

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.730
that repeats a certain trill or
sound over a common interval.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.150
Repetition is the god
particle of music.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.530
So that's interesting,
I thought,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.930
but it doesn't quite
give you the formula

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.400
for a hit, because if I go to a
music label just up the street

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.350
and I say, I have this
great idea for a song,

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.540
it goes, start
repeating it again,

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.120
start repeating it again,
they'll laugh me out

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.930
of that office.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.550
So obviously, you
need a bit of both.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.450
You need repetition, but
you also need variety.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.519
So what is the right way to
layer repetition and variety?

00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:58.060
And to answer this
question, you have

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.240
to travel to Columbus, Ohio
at Ohio State University

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.770
where a musicologist named David
Huron has another amazing study

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.300
where he'll play a note--

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.940
say it's a B note-- for
a mouse and the mouse

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.557
will turn its head like that.

00:17:11.557 --> 00:17:13.390
And he'll play the note
again for the mouse,

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.818
and the mouse will
turn its head.

00:17:14.818 --> 00:17:16.359
And he'll play B,
B, B, and the mouse

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.829
will just turn, turn, turn.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.790
But eventually, the
mouse will habituate.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.849
It will learn to
ignore the stimulus.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:27.280
But if at that very
moment, the mouse

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.100
was about to habituate,
instead of playing a B note,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.020
you play a C note.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.230
The mouse will not only
turn its head at the C,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.985
it'll also dishabituate
the mouse from the B note.

00:17:38.985 --> 00:17:40.360
So now you can go
back to playing

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.230
the B note to scare the mouse.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.750
And it turns out
that if you want

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.600
to scare a mouse for the
longest period of time

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.670
with the fewest number
of notes, there's

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.220
a very specific pattern in
which you play those notes.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:59.650
And it goes, BBBC, BBC,
BC, and then a D note

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:03.580
to dishabituate from both
the B and the C notes.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.640
And if you take a sliver
of that rondo sequence,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.270
it goes BBC, BC, D. And
if you replace the letter

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.780
B with the word verse and
you replace the letter

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.260
C with the word chorus
and you place the letter

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.310
D with the word bridge, then
you get the following song

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.420
structure.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.762
Verse, verse, chorus,
verse, chorus, bridge,

00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:30.720
which is essentially the
structure of every pop

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.190
song for the last 50 years.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.940
So Huron's conclusion
is not so much

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.460
that we are all living in this
weird mouse dishabituation

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.190
study or that music
is so unbelievably

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.980
formulaic and derivative,
but that actually the best

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.380
kinds of music play on the part
of the mammalian brain which

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.250
is so ready to hear
repetition and variety

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.890
in a certain sequence
that the same thing that

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.250
works for us in a Weekend
or Maroon 5 or Drake song

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.390
also seems to work in the
same way for a mouse--

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.010
that repetition and
variety play ideally

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.370
within certain patterns.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.480
So I love this idea.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.030
It was one of my
favorite studies

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.960
to have discovered in
the process of reporting.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.190
But I wanted to take
it one level deeper.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.200
I said I always wanted
throughout the book

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.830
to highlight what the
most important lessons

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.870
of these ideas would be.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.750
And so thinking back
to the first job

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.960
that I ever wanted, which
was to be a speech writer,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.310
I thought to myself,
it's kind of funny

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.060
how repetitive human
speech can be as well,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.780
even when it's not
trying to be musical.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.000
We still repeat
ourselves all the time

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.690
in public speaking settings.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.950
And if you go back to
Greek rhetorical history,

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.730
it turns out that almost
every Greek rhetorical device

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.880
is essentially a
form of repetition.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.859
There's anaphora,
which is repetition

00:19:55.859 --> 00:19:57.150
at the beginning of a sentence.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.430
Winston Churchill-- "We
shall fight them in the air,

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.430
we shall fight them on
the landing fields."

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.130
There's tricolon, which is
repetition in short triplicate.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.080
Abraham Lincoln-- "government
of the people, by the people,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.120
for the people."

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.710
There's something
called epizeuxis,

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.530
which is the same word repeated
over and over and over again.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.690
Donald Trump does
this all the time,

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.540
but the example in the
book is from Nancy Pelosi.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.330
"Just remember what this
legislation is for--

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.050
jobs, jobs, jobs, and jobs."

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.840
And most catchily,
there is something

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.377
called antimetabole, which is
an impossible word to spell

00:20:31.377 --> 00:20:32.460
and very difficult to say.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.670
So instead, just think
of it as ABBA, A-B-B-A.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.130
"Ask not what your
country can do for you.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.800
Ask what you can do
for your country."

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.810
"It's not the size of
the dog in the fight.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.510
It's the size of the
fight in the dog."

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.940
Hillary Clinton-- "Human
rights are women's rights,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.160
and women's rights
are human rights."

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.330
ABBA, antimetabole.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.880
In fact, antimetabole
is so endemic

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.830
to modern American
political rhetoric

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.200
that if you go through
JFK's first inaugural

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.170
and you take out all
the antimetabole,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.760
you are basically left with
a series of conjunctions.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.150
The entirety of the most
famous inaugural address

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.330
of the 20th century is
the same rhetorical device

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.410
over and over and over.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.767
So why does it work?

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:20.850
Well, I think it works
because of something called

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.480
rhyme to reason effect, which
is sort of like a cousin

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.790
of a speech to song effect.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.040
Rhyme to reason effect says
that we are weirdly more

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.310
likely to believe ideas
and slogans if they

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.624
contain an element of rhyme,
an element of musicality.

00:21:35.624 --> 00:21:37.290
People are more likely,
in some studies,

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.020
to believe that birds of
a feather flock together,

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.700
for example, than
if you rephrase

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.350
that in a non-rhyming way.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.020
But this works very, very
clearly in political rhetoric,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.840
I think, because
it takes ideas that

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.690
might be complicated
and difficult to express

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.910
and it delivers
them to people not

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.270
through the capsule of
a public policy plan,

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.720
but rather through
the capsule of music.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.470
So you think about
something like "Ask not

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.150
what your country
can do for you.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.860
Ask what you can do
for your country."

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.870
It was JFK's attempt
to popularize

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.450
the idea of the Peace Corps.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.270
But if you take the first
half of that, "Ask not

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.920
what your country
can do for you,"

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.820
that's a really weird
summary of modern liberalism.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.740
In fact, it's an
incredibly strange thing

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.960
for someone to say
whose vice president is

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.620
about to pass the Great Society
Program, Medicaid, Medicare,

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.340
expansion of immigration rights,
expansion of Social Security.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.230
"Ask not what your
country can do for you"

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.510
is the opposite of
the sort of liberalism

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.360
that JFK ended up
presenting to the world

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.980
through his administration.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.890
But we repeat the idea
over and over again,

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.620
because we don't
hear the policy.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.899
We hear the music.

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:49.190
And so I think it's very
important throughout the book,

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.810
as I'm trying to
give people ways

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.490
of using some of this science
to popularize their own ideas,

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.200
that I also give them
as audience members,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.360
as consumers, ways to resist
some of the popularity

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.120
and some of the tricks
that can be played on them.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.250
And in many ways, I
think that antimetabole

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.170
is one of the most
efficient tricks,

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.990
precisely because the
brain hears the music

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:16.010
and then wants to believe
the underlying policy.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.680
The last story
that I have to tell

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.030
before we do a little bit of Q&amp;A
and then I take your questions

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.150
may be one of my favorite
stories in the book.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.580
I was very interested in
understanding fashions,

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.140
understanding what some
people call hype cycles--

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.840
why something comes
out of nowhere

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.229
and then becomes this
enormous hit and then fades.

00:23:36.229 --> 00:23:38.270
And typically, there are
sort of three categories

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.700
of explanation for what
might drive these trends.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.700
The first could be prices.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.510
You could say that Abercrombie
was incredibly popular in 2005

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.579
among teenagers.

00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:50.120
And then the great
recession strikes,

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.970
and the embroidered A logo
becomes way too expensive

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.230
for a lot of these families.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.840
And so Abercrombie becomes,
as "Time Magazine" called them

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.470
in 2009, the worst
recession brand in America.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:05.090
The look of the zippy
hoodies didn't change.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.990
Prices changed.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.010
And prices changed fashion.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.380
So you could say it's prices.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.760
You could say it's economics.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.968
You could say it's marketing.

00:24:11.968 --> 00:24:17.210
Maybe some color of skirt
is popular, you could say,

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.450
because J. Crew wanted
it to be popular.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.440
So they blasted out a
bunch of advertising

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.730
to force people to like a very
specific shade of sapphire.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.010
But there is one market
in the world that

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:33.620
is a cultural market that
has no prices and no scarcity

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.180
and no market.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.030
And that market is first names.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.100
First names are a
cultural market.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.690
They have hype cycles.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.150
Ethel is an unpopular name in
the middle of the 19th century,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.810
a very popular name toward
the turn of the 20th century,

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.290
and is now a very unpopular
name for baby girls.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.270
It followed the
precise same hype cycle

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.950
as any other fashion.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.700
But names all exist.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.980
They're infinite.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.710
They are all free,
all the same price,

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.570
and there is no marketing.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:09.121
Nike is not trying to get
you to name your kid Nike.

00:25:09.121 --> 00:25:11.120
Of course, there are
sometimes exogenous events.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.540
Like in the 1930s,
Adolf Hitler obviously

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.920
became this terrible figure.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.560
And the name Adolf mysteriously
dropped in popularity

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.045
while the named Franklin
soared in popularity, again,

00:25:21.045 --> 00:25:22.400
unmysteriously.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.190
But for the most part, there
is no direct marketing.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.860
So the really interesting
question for me was,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.980
why are there hype
cycles in first names

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.970
if first names are unlike
any other marketplace

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.919
in which culture applies?

00:25:36.919 --> 00:25:38.210
And there are two answers here.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.876
And they both come
from a wonderful book

00:25:39.876 --> 00:25:42.740
by Stanley Lieberson,
a famous sociologist,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.045
called "A Matter of Taste."

00:25:44.045 --> 00:25:45.920
So if you want to dig
deeper into that story,

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.115
you should check out that
book, "A Matter of Taste."

00:25:48.115 --> 00:25:49.740
And he makes two very
important points.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.540
The first point is that for the
vast majority of human history,

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.660
first names were not a fashion.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.230
They were a custom.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:03.070
Between 1550 and 1800,
half of all English men

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.130
were named William,
John, or Thomas.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.550
Half of all English women were
named Elizabeth, Mary, or Anne.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.619
This is for 500 years.

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:12.160
And the trend wasn't
just in England.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.330
Sao Paolo baptismal
records from the 1700s show

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:20.521
that half of all the women were
named Maria, Anna, or Gertrude.

00:26:20.521 --> 00:26:22.270
So for the vast majority
of human history,

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.310
you have a scenario where the
turnover rate of first names

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.660
sort of resembles a flat plane.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.110
And then suddenly, in the
middle of the 19th century,

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:35.050
it takes off all over the
world-- in Hungary and Denmark,

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.900
in Canada and the US,
in France and England.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.400
All over the Western world, the
turnover rate of first names

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.400
takes off.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.300
And the only thing that
clearly affected all of them

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.360
at the same time is the
Industrial Revolution.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.740
And the theory is that you
have an agrarian family-based

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.580
economy, formerly in the
1500s and 1600s, where

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.440
families were living essentially
with extended family.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.574
So the name Thomas was a way
to highlight your lineage.

00:27:03.574 --> 00:27:04.990
The grandfather's
name was Thomas,

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.230
so the son's name was Thomas,
so the baby's name was Thomas.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:12.130
But suddenly, in the
1800s, 100,000 Thomases

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.750
move into the London
metropolitan area

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.620
at the same time.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.690
And it's unbelievably
confusing, not only

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.270
because when someone wants to
hand out the coffee and says,

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.310
Thomas, 1,000 people
turn their head,

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.150
but also because
people need identities.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.190
And identity is antagonistic.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:31.030
Identity is how I am not like
everybody else around me,

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.100
but how I and my
group are different.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.360
And so if you are one of 100,000
Thomases moving to London

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.399
at the same time and some of
you are Catholic and some of you

00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:42.940
are Protestant and some of you
are attractive and some of you

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.481
are terribly hideous and some
of you are rich and some of you

00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:47.650
are poor, Thomas
doesn't do it for you.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.780
Thomas doesn't accomplish what
you need to have accomplished.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.650
And so first, so economics--
the Industrial Revolution--

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:57.250
turns first names into
identity markers, which means

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.700
there has to be a hype cycle.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.000
In the 1300s-- well, before
the 1300s, fashion was similar.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.670
Fashion was not a hype cycle.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.940
Clothing fashion was not
essentially a fashion.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.910
The Romans wore the same
tunics for thousands of years,

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.010
very similar to the tunics
that the Greeks wore.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.660
And it never occurred to anybody
living in 100 AD or 100 BC

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.540
that their tunic looked weird
because their grandfather wore

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.677
the exact same one with
a knot in the same place,

00:28:23.677 --> 00:28:26.010
so maybe I should move the
knot a little bit to be cool.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.360
It just never occurred to them.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.030
It took until the 1300s
when you had global trading

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.510
patterns for the merchants
to be able to dress

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.430
like the aristocrats.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.040
But the aristocrats, looking
at the merchants, said, wait,

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.960
now we just look like
poor, old merchants.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.670
We can't do that.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.410
We have to change the
way that we dress.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.730
So aristocrats
changed their fashion,

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.680
which meant the
merchants had to change

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.330
the way they dressed as well.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.390
And so once again, we
think in clothing history

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.870
that global trading patterns
created the concept of fashion.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.490
But the second really
interesting idea

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.000
about why we change our names
comes down to this theory

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
called popularity as a taste.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.540
And popularity as a taste
says that in addition to all

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.480
the qualities that we know exist
in a cultural product-- say,

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.380
in a song--

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.870
who sings it, what it
sounds like, how loud it is,

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.470
what the chord structure is--

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.910
there is a signal that
hovers above those qualities.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.880
And that signal is
the song's popularity.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.610
And some people interpret
that signal positively.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:27.180
They like Taylor Swift,
because she's popular.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.920
And some people
look at that signal,

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.980
and they interpret it in
the entirely opposite way.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.430
I hate Taylor Swift,
because she's popular.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.730
So the signal of
popularity is the same.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.610
But it creates a range
of different responses.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.970
Essentially, you can think of
this as mainstream to hipster.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.770
I like it, because it's popular.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.404
I hate it, because it's popular.

00:29:49.404 --> 00:29:51.320
So what does this have
to do with first names?

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.890
Well, most people have
a taste for popularity

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.720
that exists in the middle.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.560
They like, what I call in
the book, familiar surprises.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.530
They like ideas that are
new, but not too new--

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.960
the song that sounds like
the song you liked before,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.180
the sequel of your
favorite movie franchise,

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.830
that political
essay that expresses

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.080
in a new and profound way
that which you've already

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.600
intuited-- familiar surprises.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.300
So if most parents
like names that

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.180
have sort of a
little bit of newness

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.920
but aren't that
familiar, that it

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.500
would predict that a lot of
parents in the late 1980s

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.540
would settle on a
name like Samantha,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.106
which is the 50th or 60th most
popular name in the 1980s.

00:30:30.106 --> 00:30:31.730
But the problem is
that so many of them

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.400
will have a similar taste
for the familiar surprise--

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.290
so many of them will
have a similar taste

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.020
for that name which is
popular but not too popular--

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.920
in the early 1900s, 224,000
parents in the same year

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.594
will name their
baby girl Samantha,

00:30:44.594 --> 00:30:46.760
which means it's inevitable
that they will introduce

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.101
their child into
pre-K, kindergarten,

00:30:49.101 --> 00:30:50.600
and that Samantha
will be surrounded

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.160
by 17 other Samanthas.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.550
And it will be
very embarrassing.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.190
And you'll the exact same
Thomas problem all over again,

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.250
which means that those
parents' friends who

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.400
are about to have their new
kid looks at the name Samantha,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.280
decides it's way too ubiquitous,
and decide to not name

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.570
their daughter Samantha.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.970
And so again, this
market without prices,

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.810
with sheer abundance and without
marketing, individual families

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.120
collectively making
individual decisions

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.870
drive a hype cycle
for baby girl names.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.020
And one way that we know
for sure that this is true

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.910
that parents do have a
sturdy taste for popularity

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:27.490
is that siblings tend to
have similarly popular names

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.330
in the decade of their birth.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.250
So for example, this
is sort of intuitive.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:36.380
If you meet the siblings
Robert, Sarah, and Samantha,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.770
it's very strange if the fourth
child's name is Zanthopy.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.170
But if you meet the children
Zanthopy and Prairie

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.480
Rose and Esmerelda,
it's very weird

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.670
to have the fourth
child named Gary.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.870
There's just intuitively--
siblings have equally weird

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.916
names, mostly, obviously.

00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:55.540
For every single time
I tell the story,

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.990
there's always someone who's
like, well, my name is Thor,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.490
and my sister's name is Sarah.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.220
And it's like, well, I don't
know why your parents like

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.810
Thor, but obviously, they do.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:04.770
And that's great.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.950
And this is not
going to disprove it.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:12.150
Anyway, so to conclude,
one of the lessons

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:13.900
throughout the book,
which really tries to

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:19.350
range widely from music
to movies to digital media

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.920
and the future of
entertainment--

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.210
these two lessons
that keep cropping up

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.030
are the power of
familiar surprises--

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.270
the power of ideas that
are new but not too new--

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:33.866
and the underrated
power of distribution--

00:32:33.866 --> 00:32:35.490
that people like me
who are journalists

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.580
want to think that
cultural products either

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.210
have the inherent qualities
of being good or bad,

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.580
but the story of that
product's ultimate success

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.520
often has much more to do with
the distribution behind it

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.960
than its inherent qualities.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.736
Thank you, guys, very much.

00:32:50.736 --> 00:32:53.226
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:55.537 --> 00:32:57.120
MICHAEL: We're going
to transition now

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.360
into just opening up the
Q&amp;A with a couple thoughts

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.010
that I have, having
watched this book

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.650
come together over the
past three to five years

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.150
and watched Derek's
career progress.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:08.160
So I'll kick things off.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.550
And then in the
interest of time,

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.230
we'll open things up
to any of you guys

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.660
that would like
to ask a question.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:18.160
And if you would, go to the mics
for that, that would be great.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.550
So I had a bunch of things
I wanted to ask you.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.484
But one of the central
figures of the book

00:33:23.484 --> 00:33:25.150
that you talk about
that I learned about

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.660
for the first time--

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.560
is fascinating--
was Raymond Loewy

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.710
and would love to hear
how you discovered him

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.520
and how his theories of design
relate to some of the topics

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.295
that you bring up.

00:33:37.295 --> 00:33:38.170
DEREK THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.590
I discovered Raymond
Loewy on just one

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:47.320
of those weird Wikipedia rabbit
holes, just opening new tab,

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.630
new tab, new tab, new tab.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:54.610
And this is someone who you
either have heard of him

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:58.240
and you revere him more
than almost anyone you know,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.060
or you haven't heard of him.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.470
And the vast majority of
people that I have encountered

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:03.370
have not.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.830
Raymond Loewy is the father
of industrial design.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:10.739
He is a French orphan who came
over to the US the 19-teens.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:13.690
In the 1940s and
1950s, designed what

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.060
we've come to think of
as mid-century America.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.929
Imagine Don Draper, a
genius of human psychology,

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.960
meeting Steve Jobs,
a genius of design,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.040
coming together, having a baby.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.500
That baby is Raymond Loewy.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.520
This guy designed the
1950s Studebaker coupe,

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.070
one of the famous automotive
designs of the 20th century.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.429
He designed the modern train
for Pennsylvania Railroad.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:37.908
He designed the modern tractor.

00:34:37.908 --> 00:34:39.449
He designed the
pencil sharpener that

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:42.730
looks like an egg with a spindle
that you guys have surely seen.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:47.020
He designed the logos
for Exxon, Shell, and BP.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.360
He designed the
Lucky Strike package,

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.580
made famously ironic
by Madmen itself.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:58.030
When NASA was making
its first spaceship,

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:01.639
they asked Raymond Loewy to
design its interior habitat,

00:35:01.639 --> 00:35:03.430
because he was this
genius in understanding

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.500
what people wanted.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:11.290
And it was his idea to
install the viewing portal.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.021
So every time in a movie,
when you're in outer space

00:35:14.021 --> 00:35:15.520
and you can look
through that window

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.274
back at the pale
blue Earth, that

00:35:17.274 --> 00:35:18.940
is Raymond Loewy that
you're looking at.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.490
It was his idea to put
a window in a spaceship.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:24.137
So the great question
for anybody, I think,

00:35:24.137 --> 00:35:25.720
who understands
Raymond Loewy's career

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.150
is, how the heck did this
guy know what people liked,

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:30.670
from pencil sharpeners
to spaceships?

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:35.020
And his theory was
called MAYA, M-A-Y-A--

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.680
Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.950
And it was his thesis
that every consumer is

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.690
torn between opposing forces.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:49.940
Neophilia, a love of new things,
a need to discover new things--

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.940
sorry, neophilia,
love of new things,

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.900
and neophobia, a deep fear
of anything that is too new.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.790
And he was just
absolutely brilliant

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.270
at using anthropology to
study consumers and understand

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:04.200
their habits and understand
exactly how they live

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.700
and then build new products
that essentially piggybacked off

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.570
of them.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.150
And so again, this
concept of MAYA

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.680
and familiar surprises
just so beautifully

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.680
clicks into Hollywood's
franchise strategy,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.090
ESPN SportsCenter strategy,
the strategy of Buzzfeed

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.520
for creating shareable
videos, and just

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.100
across the entertainment
and media landscape--

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.710
this power of familiar
surprises and MAYA,

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.100
for giving people
what they want.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.600
MICHAEL: That's
interesting to think

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.079
about how that relates to
some of the big tech companies

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:34.120
and how we release products
all the time as well.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:34.430
DEREK THOMPSON: Right.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.410
And so one of the
ways I summarize

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.390
MAYA is I say, to sell something
surprising, make it familiar.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.700
But to sell something
familiar, make it surprising.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.380
And so in technology,
the challenge

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.710
is often how to make something
that is surprising familiar.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.490
But the best technologists
do this all the time.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.836
When Steve Jobs was designing
one of the first Macs,

00:36:54.836 --> 00:36:56.210
there's that famous
line that you

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.850
see Michael Fassbender say
in the movie "Steve Jobs"

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.680
where he's looking at the
computer and he says--

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.460
at the monitor and he says,
it has to look like a face.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.160
It has to literally say hello.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.110
To sell a new
consumer product, he

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.910
had to make it
seem like a friend.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.460
The modern incarnation
of that is clearly Alexa.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.950
It is the hottest
new technology, AI.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.055
How do how do we use it?

00:37:17.055 --> 00:37:18.180
How do we interact with it?

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.110
It's incredibly new
and potentially scary.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.420
But Alexis sounds
like a lilting woman.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.030
It sounds like an
ordinary assistant.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.710
It sounds like a kind friend.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.210
And so again, to
sell something that

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.370
is inherently surprising
and confusing,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.500
the challenge and
ultimate success

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.099
is often in those who can
make it really familiar.

00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:38.140
MICHAEL: Thanks for that.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.450
I think with the
Google audience,

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:42.900
I think we're constantly
aware of the rise of big data

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.030
and machine learning
and algorithms,

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.590
helping us predict things.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:51.150
How do you think that big
data and machine learning play

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.300
in with the ability to
predict hits potentially?

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.420
DEREK THOMPSON: So I think that
every media and entertainment

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.060
company is trying to
get into big data.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:06.510
And I think that the results
have been disappointing

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.690
for the following reason.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:10.700
I think that when
a company, trying

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:15.440
to discover human
tastes, uses or begins

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.470
to use a new technology
to uncover them,

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.700
they want to learn
something new.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.480
They want to learn something
that's counterintuitive.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.210
And I think that
what seems to me

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.330
to have happened in the music
and movie industry specifically

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.940
is that the smarter these
industries have gotten

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.210
at discerning audience
tastes, the more it

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:40.630
turns out that audience tastes
are incredibly derivative.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.310
Pop music now is more
repetitive than it used to be.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.219
Hollywood sequels
are a bigger part

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:47.760
of the business than
they used to be.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.670
In 1996, none of
the top 10 films--

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.860
"Independence Day," "Twister,"
"First Wives Club"--

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.490
none of the top 10 films
were adaptations, sequels,

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:57.120
or reboots.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.710
None of them were
comic book movies.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:05.040
20 years later, by 2016,
every year this century,

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.130
a majority of the top
10 films in the US

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.170
have been sequels,
adaptations, and reboots.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.060
As the industry
has gotten smarter,

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.140
the product has become
more derivative.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.594
And so the irony here is that
the use of big data seems

00:39:17.594 --> 00:39:20.010
to me-- this is my read, and
other people might definitely

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:25.410
disagree-- but my read of it is
that the employment of this new

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:30.300
technology has ironically
taught hit makers and cultural

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.610
producers the first lesson--

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.620
literally, the first lesson--

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.470
of human psychology, which
was probably the mere exposure

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.250
effect--

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.010
the idea that the mere
exposure of a stimulus

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.430
to us over and over and
over again biases us

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.960
toward that stimulus--

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.480
that we have a strong
preference for the familiar,

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.400
specifically when
we can't see where

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.760
that stimulus is coming from,
when it's sort of furtive.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.760
So first discovery in
psychology history--

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.440
familiarity breeds liking.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.170
Last discovery of this
whip-smart new technology--

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.450
familiarity breeds liking.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.450
And I think that for a
lot of culture producers,

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.632
that's been a
disappointing finding.

00:40:06.632 --> 00:40:08.490
MICHAEL: Well, thank you, Derek.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.480
I want to open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.600
AUDIENCE: Hi, Derek.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.030
Thank you very much.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.460
I have a question about the
very first-- sorry, I'm cold.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.140
So that's why I
have my big jacket.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.370
I have a question about
the very first iPhone.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:28.080
I'd like to know your point of
view on how it fits in this not

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.520
too new-- like people prefer
familiarity over novelty--

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.780
because to me, and I might be
wrong, it was very, very new,

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.810
this first concept with
application, smartphone,

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.010
and everything.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.070
And yet, it was a big success.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.560
So did they compensate
with distribution?

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.540
How would you
position the iPhone?

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.543
DEREK THOMPSON: So if
you turn to page 231--

00:40:52.543 --> 00:40:53.919
AUDIENCE: I didn't
read the book.

00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:54.918
DEREK THOMPSON: It's OK.

00:40:54.918 --> 00:40:56.350
There are books
right behind you.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.266
I actually tell the story
of the first iPhone.

00:40:58.266 --> 00:41:01.970
So just to briefly summarize
that which all of you

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:06.680
can read, first of all,
I don't think the iPhone

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.660
was all that new in look.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:13.810
In many ways, it was promised
as a wide-screen iPod--

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:17.750
that essentially you could
think of the iPhone as sort

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.170
of evolving almost
Darwinistically-- not a word,

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:22.700
but we'll use it here--

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.250
from the earliest
models of the iPod--

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:29.345
that you had developed
a square with a screen.

00:41:29.345 --> 00:41:31.220
Then the screen got
bigger and bigger.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.410
And the dial got
smaller and smaller

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.560
until it was ultimately all
touch with a single button.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.020
Here's the interesting thing
about the iPhone as a hit is

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:45.020
that when Universal McCann,
the marketing company,

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.840
did a 10,000-person poll all
over the world to ask people

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.660
if they wanted the iPhone, not
only did most people in the US

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.500
say they did not, because it
was an all-in-one device--

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.475
it was a jack-of-all-trades,
master of none--

00:41:56.475 --> 00:41:58.100
that was the idea of
the first iPhone--

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.440
all those jokes about how
the call quality is terrible,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.610
the internet's terrible.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.165
It's a cool new phone, but
it doesn't do anything well.

00:42:04.165 --> 00:42:05.540
They said, this
is actually going

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.120
to be most popular in
developing countries

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.280
where they don't already
have expensive cameras

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.680
and expensive iPods and
expensive computers.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.180
And in many ways, what's
fascinating is how unbelievably

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.590
wrong that prediction was--

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:26.830
that the iPhone was only
supposed to work in Malaysia

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.760
and was supposed to be uniquely
unpopular in Germany, Japan,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.530
and the US.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.060
And then Germany,
Japan, and the US

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.552
ultimately served to
be its singular market.

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:37.010
But as a matter
familiar surprises,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.070
I think that Jobs
introduced the iPhone--

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.500
if it was his ultimate
goal to make the iPhones--

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.790
a lot of people say it was--

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.490
he introduced it brilliantly--

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.570
that you don't go from 0 to 60.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.709
You introduce an iPod.

00:42:48.709 --> 00:42:50.750
And the screen gets bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:54.620
And you lead people
into the new product.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.010
So for many people, I think
they looked at the iPod itself

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:02.330
and they said, oh, this is
the obvious next iteration

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.038
of the iPod.

00:43:03.038 --> 00:43:06.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:10.240
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
earlier an increase in mistrust

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.180
in the big established media.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.320
And assuming that we can
measure that and that it's true,

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.120
what do you attribute that to?

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:23.500
Big media still have
big distribution power.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.525
So what do you think
are the causes of that?

00:43:25.525 --> 00:43:28.150
DEREK THOMPSON: This is a really
good and complicated question.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:32.550
And in one way--

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.530
so several things--
first, there's

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.890
been macro, across
the board, collapse

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.190
in trust since the
1960s, 1970s, not just

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.050
for politics or Congress
or the White House,

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.780
but basically across
all institutions.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.720
And the media, I think,
has been sort of brought

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.476
into that undertow of distrust.

00:43:52.476 --> 00:43:53.850
But specifically,
what's happened

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:57.120
to the press is that, as you've
had this sort of Cambrian

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.710
explosion of media sources--

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:06.870
first with the rise
of cable news and then

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:10.460
with the rise of the internet--

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.520
there are so many
news sources now

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.550
that can appeal to
a specific niche

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.580
that there is always a news
source that A, can tell you

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.430
that that which you think
is already true, and B,

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:25.880
can tell you that the
mainstream is wrong.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.910
And in sociology, this
is very, very similar

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.320
to the technical
definition of culting.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.270
The sociological
definition of a cult

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:39.860
is a positive rebellion
against the mainstream, which

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.560
is ironically the same as
the cultural sociological

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.230
definition of coolness,
which tells you something

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:48.560
about the blurring of the lines
between coolness and culting--

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.302
that cults are
essentially cool kids that

00:44:50.302 --> 00:44:52.010
are too far outside
the mainstream for us

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.639
to accept them.

00:44:54.639 --> 00:44:56.180
But what's clearly
happened, I think,

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.340
is that the abundance
of media sources

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.250
have given rise to a kind of
media culting, in which case,

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.990
you can always find
a media source that

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.330
says that you're right and
the mainstream is wrong.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:08.056
This is clearly a
destroyed trust.

00:45:08.056 --> 00:45:09.680
But I think the last
thing to point out

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.400
is that as you've had this
Cambrian explosion of media

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:18.380
options, the media,
as a collective noun,

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:22.280
no longer makes sense
to apply adjectives to.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.560
When people say, the
media is liberal,

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.970
or the media is
too conservative,

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.430
or the media's too
corporatist, it's like saying,

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.690
food is too spicy, or
shirts are too blue.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:32.630
It's like, what?

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:33.300
I don't know.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.130
Buy a non-blue shirt or don't
go to the Mexican place.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.670
There's so many options
on media right now

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.300
that are diametrically
opposed to one another

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.490
that I tend to resist any-- and
this wasn't your description.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.310
I'm just saying, I
tend to resist and sort

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:54.230
of bristle at any suggestion
that the media is too blank.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.510
The real problem, I
think, is the opposite.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:58.460
The media is too big, maybe.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.800
There are so many sources
that it is inherently

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.100
that we distrust
the mainstream Borg

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.645
and just like our little cut.

00:46:11.367 --> 00:46:12.200
AUDIENCE: Hi, Derek.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.610
DEREK THOMPSON: Hi.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.000
AUDIENCE: I'm curious how
universal these principles are

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.800
over the course
of one's lifetime.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.804
Like I love Selena Gomez
maybe, but my grandmother

00:46:21.804 --> 00:46:22.720
may hate Selena Gomez.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.540
She doesn't like country.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.456
She doesn't like rock.

00:46:24.456 --> 00:46:26.630
She doesn't like pop,
doesn't like hip hop.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:28.245
Why is that?

00:46:28.245 --> 00:46:29.870
DEREK THOMPSON: So
first of all, hello.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:30.953
I didn't see you at first.

00:46:33.479 --> 00:46:36.020
This comes back to an idea in
developmental psychology called

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.997
sensitive periods.

00:46:37.997 --> 00:46:40.580
There are sensitive periods, I
think, for all sorts of tastes.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.200
For food taste, the
sensitive period

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.780
seems to be between birth
and two, three years old

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.960
that, for example,
broccoli evolved

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.510
to taste bitter and bad.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:56.270
But if you feed lots of
broccoli to a newborn,

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.970
you'll have to sort of mix it in
with the applesauce and sugar.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.760
But they'll grow up
liking broccoli--

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.370
that babies are very neophiliac,
accepting of new things

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.350
when they're very young.

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:10.340
The sensitive taste for music
seems to be between the teens

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.110
and early to mid 20s.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:14.900
By the age of 33,
Spotify suggested,

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:19.220
people stopped listening
to new songs entirely.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:23.750
So by definition, your tastes
have crystallized by your 30s.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:24.980
This is one reason why--

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.540
right, the cliche
of my grandmother

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.170
loves Frank Sinatra and
Oscar and Hammerstein.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.450
It was too late for
her with the Beatles,

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:37.730
whereas my parents adored Simon
and Garfunkel and Elton John.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:40.400
In fact, what you've
seen is that taste

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.010
in people's favorite
music in their 20s

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.290
is so strong that
artists enjoy what

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:46.810
are called nostalgia bumps--

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.880
that as parents will
get to a certain age

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.750
and be able to teach their
children the kind of music

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.780
from a certain decade,
that band's popularity will

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.220
rise a bit on
streaming networks,

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.680
because kids who grow up under
parents who naturally like

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.510
Simon and Garfunkel
grow up listening

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.590
to a lot of Simon and Garfunkel
and therefore like them.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.350
The last interesting implication
of this is in politics.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:11.660
The political sensitive period
seems to be from mid-20s to--

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.400
I'm sorry, from
mid-teens to late 20s

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.470
as well, really
similar to music.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.180
So it's kind of
interesting and, I think,

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.470
intuitive that music
taste and political tastes

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.070
are sort of crystallizing
around the same time.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.940
And this explains a phenomenon
that the right bemoans,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.570
which is, why do so many
children of conservatives

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.670
grow up becoming liberals?

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.890
And one theory is
that you have children

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:37.130
who develop a taste
for politics in general

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.900
in their teenage
years, but then go

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.450
to college at, say, University
of Michigan or Northwestern

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.560
or Middlebury.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.280
And they will be surrounded
by more liberal students.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.770
And as their ideologies within
politics are crystallizing,

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.830
they'll become liberal.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:56.210
So the parents' interest
in politics has screwed,

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:59.390
you might say, them out of
sharing an ideological bond

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.260
with their child.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.843
They've developed a
taste for politics

00:49:01.843 --> 00:49:05.060
in a kid who then goes
off to crystallize

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.589
the taste on a liberal campus.

00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:10.130
Basically, the short answer to
your question-- and I'm sorry,

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:13.130
I just love the topic
of sensitive periods--

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:16.760
is that we seem to
peak-- our neophilia--

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.680
our interest in
discovering new ideas

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.780
seems to peak at a
certain part of our life.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.860
And we, somewhat depressingly,
spend the rest of our lives

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.050
playing around with tastes
that have already formed.

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.220
AUDIENCE: Except
for journalists.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.060
DEREK THOMPSON: Except
for journalists.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.150
We are indefatigable seekers
of the truth, no matter what

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.060
our biases are, yes.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.200
MICHAEL: OK.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.130
So unfortunately,
we are out of time.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.750
So I just want to thank
all of you for coming

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:44.290
and also, a big round
of applause for Derek.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.250
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.300
[APPLAUSE]
