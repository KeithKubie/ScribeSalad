00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.730
Problem 94.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.090
In Jefferson School, 300
students study French or

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.090
Spanish or both.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.430
OK.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.750
And they have to do
one of those two.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.890
If 100 of these students do
not study French-- so this

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.180
sounds like a Venn Diagram.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.975
Let's see.

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:20.966
So let's say that's French.

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.270
And I'll do Spanish in
a different color.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.230
Let's say that is Spanish.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.870
And we have 300 students,
and they study

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.360
either French or Spanish.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.870
If 100 of these students
do not study French--

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.460
so what did I say?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.560
This was French and
this is Spanish.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.470
So 100 of these students
do not study French.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.730
So this area right
here is 100.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.120
Right?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.700
Those are people who study
Spanish but no French at all.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.290
How many of these students study
both French and Spanish?

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.990
So what they want to know is
the intersection of who

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.360
studies French and Spanish.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.120
So that's this blue
area right here.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.140
So statement number one tells
us, of the 300 students, 60 do

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.487
not study Spanish.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.600
So people who study French but
no Spanish-- and I didn't mean

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.570
they know Spanish.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.560
People who study French and do
not study Spanish, that's this

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.000
right here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.210
And that's 60.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.570
Right?

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.950
And let's see if we can use this
information to figure out

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.020
what the intersection is.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.780
So if you think about it,
what we want to do

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.930
is the whole universe.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.290
So the whole universe is going
to be equal to the people who

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.770
study-- so this 60 people plus--
we'll call that the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.496
intersection, or we could call
that French and Spanish-- plus

00:01:52.496 --> 00:01:54.930
this blue area, plus
this tan area.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.140
Right?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.750
That's the whole universe.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.740
And that is equal to 300.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.210
So people who study French
and Spanish plus

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.210
160 is equal to 300.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.639
Subtract 160 from both sides
and you get the people who

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.820
study just French and Spanish.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.800
That's what?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.390
That's 240.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.280
That's 140 people who study
both French and Spanish.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.730
So statement one
is sufficient.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.570
Let's see what statement
two gets us.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.390
Statement two tells us, a total
of 240 of the students

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.250
study Spanish.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.140
So in statement two,
we don't know this.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.460
But we know that a total
of 240 students

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.520
study Spanish, right?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.530
So we know that this whole
circle is 240.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.200
And if we're just trying to
figure out this blue part, we

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.020
just have to subtract
out the tan part.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.400
So if we want to know French
and Spanish, French and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.420
Spanish is going to be equal to
the whole amount that study

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.110
Spanish-- which they just told
us, 240-- minus just the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.060
people who study only Spanish.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.310
Right?

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.390
Because you could study
Spanish and French.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.980
So 240 people who study Spanish
minus the people who

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.100
just study Spanish.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.840
So that's 100.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.100
That's that tan area.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.150
That also equals 140.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.620
So both statements individually
are sufficient to

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.480
answer this question.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.260
So the answer is D.
