00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.480
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video is

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.861
start trying to divide
by two-digit numbers.

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.207
And as we'll see, this is
a super important skill

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:12.680
that a lot of the rest of
mathematics will build off of,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.747
but it's also interesting
'cause it's a bit of an art.

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:16.964
So let's just start

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:20.632
by trying to compute what
186 divided by 31 is.

00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:24.959
And of course, we could
also write this as 186

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.126
divided by 31.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:30.228
Pause the video, and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:31.966
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.578
I assumed you've given it a go at it.

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:38.118
So I don't have my 31
times tables memorized,

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:40.352
so I can't just immediately
tell you the answer.

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:43.847
But my brain tries to
approximate these numbers

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:48.119
so that my times tables
knowledge does come in handy.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:50.702
For example, 31 is close to 30.

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:54.018
And this is why I'm saying
it's a bit of an art,

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:56.239
but I'm saying, hey, look,
this is pretty close to 30.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.116
And if I think about multiples of 30,

00:00:58.116 --> 00:00:59.892
well, those are just
the multiples of three

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.870
with an extra zero or the
multiples of three times 10.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.560
So the multiples of 30 are 30, 60, 90.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.784
Instead of three times four is 12,

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:10.386
30 times four is 120,

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:11.886
150 instead of 15,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.098
180 instead of 18

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:16.515
for 30 times six,

00:01:17.707 --> 00:01:20.821
and gee, this looks pretty close to 180.

00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:22.404
So this looks close

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.493
to 30

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:26.691
times six.

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:28.337
And if this is close to 30,

00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:31.128
well, maybe, maybe this is,

00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:34.188
maybe this is going to
be six right over here.

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:35.988
And I'm gonna put a question mark

00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:38.206
because then the natural
thing to do is to actually

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:39.157
try it out.

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:41.863
Figure out what is six times 31?

00:01:41.863 --> 00:01:43.617
I'll put the question mark here again.

00:01:43.617 --> 00:01:45.282
Is this equal to six?

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.903
Well, the art part is you've made a good,

00:01:47.903 --> 00:01:49.853
or we've made a good guess here.

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.462
Now let's try to verify that

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:53.401
maybe it is six, maybe it isn't.

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:55.324
So let's multiply

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:56.475
six,

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:58.994
or let's multiple 31 times six.

00:01:58.994 --> 00:01:59.827
31

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.063
times six,

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.503
one times six is six,

00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:08.208
and then three times six,
which is really 30 times six,

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:11.075
is gonna be 180 right over here.

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:12.716
So this is 186.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.495
So it all works out.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:15.912
186 divided by 31

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:18.627
is indeed six.

00:02:18.627 --> 00:02:22.284
We can get rid of this question mark here.

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:24.367
Let's do another example.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:27.498
So let me delete.

00:02:27.498 --> 00:02:29.248
Let me delete that as well.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.831
Let's say we want to figure out

00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:33.536
what 336

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:37.418
divided by

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:39.896
48 is equal to.

00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:44.990
So pause this video, and see
if you can figure it out.

00:02:46.394 --> 00:02:49.203
So the way I would think about it,

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:52.361
this thing right over here is close to 50,

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:53.361
close to 50.

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:56.449
And this thing, well,

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.412
if you think about the multiples of 50,

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:01.733
you have things like 300,
which would be 50 times six.

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:05.900
And then you have 350, which
would be 50 times seven,

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:09.323
because five times seven is 35.

00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:10.386
And so let's think about this,

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:12.123
and actually let me
write these things down.

00:03:12.123 --> 00:03:15.060
If I were to say 50 times six,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.193
that's the same thing as,

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:21.483
well, that's gonna be five times
six times 10, which is 300.

00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:23.100
If I say 50

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.785
times seven,

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:26.702
that's going to be 350.

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:29.130
Five times seven is 35,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.733
and then you're multiplying that by 10.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:35.285
But this number is someplace
in between 300 and 350.

00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:37.883
So my candidates for
what this is going to be,

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.732
well, I'm saying, hey, maybe this is six,

00:03:39.732 --> 00:03:41.129
maybe this is seven.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.023
And what I would do is I
would try out each of them.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.523
So let's try out 48 times six.

00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:49.327
So let's try that,

00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:51.046
this first candidate out.

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:52.446
48

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:53.279
times six,

00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:56.772
so eight times six

00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:58.272
is going to be 48.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.231
Four times six

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:03.064
is 24,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.268
plus four

00:04:05.268 --> 00:04:06.101
is 288.

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:10.956
So that actually seems a
good bit lower than this.

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:13.668
It actually seems almost exactly 48 lower.

00:04:13.668 --> 00:04:15.723
So I could probably, I'm
feeling pretty confident

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:18.042
that I can squeeze another 48 into this.

00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:19.458
So instead of squeezing,

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:22.119
instead of being able to
divide 6/48 into this,

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.168
I'm feeling pretty good that
maybe seven is the answer,

00:04:24.168 --> 00:04:25.460
but let me try it out.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.794
So this, so six is not

00:04:27.794 --> 00:04:29.610
going to be my answer, I tried it out.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.120
Let me try 48 times seven.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.444
48

00:04:33.444 --> 00:04:34.444
times seven,

00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:37.346
eight times seven is 56,

00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:41.920
four times seven is 28, plus three,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.334
336.

00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:44.735
That's exactly right.

00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:46.765
So there you have it, with a
little bit of trial and error,

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:48.727
but it was an informed trial and error,

00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:51.317
we got 336 divided by 48

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:53.377
is equal to seven.

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:55.865
This is what I meant,
that it's a bit of an art.
