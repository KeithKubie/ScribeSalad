00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.350
Welcome back.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.940
We are now on section four of
our third test, and so we're

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.480
on page 530.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.890
And let's start with
problem number one.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:19.340
If s plus t is equal to 3,
what is the value of s

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.400
plus t minus 6?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.480
Well, we know that s plus t is
equal to 3, so they're just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.250
asking us what is 3 minus 6.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.600
Well 3 minus 6 is minus 3.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.850
And that is choice A.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.590
Number two.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.130
They have a box on the cube.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.800
Let me see if I can
draw this box.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.370
So it looks like, and then the
back side's like this, and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.650
then let me draw a little
dotted-- And then the sides

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:13.160
are A-- let me do that in a
different color-- A, B, C, D,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.240
E, P, and Q.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.800
And they say, on the cube in the
figure above, each of the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.270
following points is the same
distance from P as

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030
it is from Q except?

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.580
And these are all the choices.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.520
A, B, C, D, and E.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.950
So we want to look for a point
that isn't the same distance

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370
from P as it is from Q.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.610
A is one edge from P and one
edge from Q, so it's not A.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.050
B is two edges from P no
matter how you go.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.800
And it is also two edges from
Q no matter how you go, so

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.490
it's not B.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:01.720
C is one edge from Q, but to get
to P you gotta go at least

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.950
three edges.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.890
1, 2, 3, to go to C.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.640
So it's going to be C.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.590
C is much closer to Q than
it is to P, so it is

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.050
not the same distance.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.170
So our choice is C.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.210
C is C.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.160
All right.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.410
Problem number three.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.200
And I'll switch to a
less tacky color.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.910
Problem number three.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.860
Oh boy, there's all sorts
of stuff to draw.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.950
Maybe I won't draw it.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.050
Let's see if I can get
by without drawing.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.930
The bar graph above shows where
fraud is committed on

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.470
the internet.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.690
Which of the following circle
graphs most accurately

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.340
displays the same graph?

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.830
Well I'll try it.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.260
So they say websites.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.060
Websites is this huge number.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.050
Websites, that's 78%.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.460
Let me say that that is
this purple color.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.640
Actually I should do this
with the rectangle too.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.970
The websites is a purple color,
and then let's say that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:11.580
email is, well I'll do it
this color, at 18%.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:20.760
And then they tell us that news
groups is 2%, so it's a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.200
really small percentage, 2%.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.450
And then finally, they tell
us that other is also 2%.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.840
And then you want to see a pie
graph that's the same thing.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.080
So if this is the pie graph.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.360
So 78% is going to
be this purple,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.200
it's going to be websites.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.670
So that's a little bit
more than 3/4, right?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.420
78% is 3% more than 3/4.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.460
3/4 would look like this.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.400
A little bit more than
3/4 is going to look

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.130
something like this.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.610
Oh, oops.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.750
I'm still using the line tool.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.920
But a little bit more than
3/4 is going to look

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.170
something like this.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.390
And then I can actually
even fill it.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.430
That's going to be a little
bit more than 3/4.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.380
And then the blue stuff, 18%,
that's going to look

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.260
something like 18%.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.000
That's a little less than 25%,
so it's going to be like that.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.550
So we could fill that too.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.150
The other pieces are going to
be these thin slivers like

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.100
this, 2% and 2%.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.290
This is really just translating
that into this.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.860
And they're actually going
to be even thinner than

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.970
the way I drew it.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.020
And out of all the choices, the
one that has this purple

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.560
region, websites, the dark
region on the graph.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.920
The only one that has that,
where it's more than 3/4, are

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.120
choices C and D, right?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.000
That's the only one where it
has more than 75% is shaded

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.930
the websites' color.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.640
It's either going
to be C or D.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.700
And then when you look at the
difference between C and D,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.830
choice C has nothing
for other in there.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.880
Choice C just has news
groups, no other.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.370
So it has to be D, because
news groups and other are

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.120
actually same size.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.610
So they should be the
same proportions.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.640
So the choice is D.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.890
Next problem.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.980
Problem number four.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.380
The numerator of a certain
fraction is 5 less than the

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.440
denominator.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.850
So let's say that the
denominator is x.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.000
The numerator is 5 less than
the denominator, so the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.950
numerator is x minus 5.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.230
The numerator is 5 less
than the denominator.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.880
And they say the fraction
is equal to 3/4.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.160
What is the denominator
of this fraction?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.010
So we just solve for x.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.580
So let's cross multiply.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.310
x times 3, so 3x, is equal
4 times x minus 5.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.220
So 3x is equal to 4x minus 20.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.940
And you can subtract.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.280
So you get 20 is equal to,
subtract 3x from both sides,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.240
is equal to x, and that's
the denominator.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.830
So that is choice D.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.200
The next problem has a bunch
of drawing for me to do.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.090
Let's see if I can finish
it in time.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.900
So we have the two axes.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.295
Let me draw the two axes.

00:06:51.295 --> 00:06:56.060
This is a big problem,
so I'll draw it big.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:04.990
I've got the two axes, and then
it goes from k to 6k.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:15.570
k, 2k, 3k, 4k, 5k, 6k.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.442
6k, 5k, 4k, 3k, you
get the point.

00:07:19.442 --> 00:07:21.230
And then it goes from 1 to 6.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:28.890
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.680
And then the triangle looks like
it goes from-- if I were

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.284
to draw a line-- it goes
from 2k to 6k, and

00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:37.840
then from 2 to 6.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.258
They actually draw the line
like this, 2k it is.

00:07:44.258 --> 00:07:45.900
This is a triangle.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.590
I don't know if I'll have time
to do it in this video, but

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.280
everything should work out.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:08:02.050
The triangle goes from 2k to 5k,
good thing I caught that,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.300
and it's at 0.2.

00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:06.695
That's its base.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.620
And then it goes up to
6, where it kind

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.475
of is in the middle.

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:13.795
It goes up to here.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.940
This is what the triangle
looks like.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.920
I have redrawn the problem.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:28.150
And this is B, A, C.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.370
And they say, in the figure
above, the scale on the x-axis

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.270
is different from the
scale on the y-axis.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:41.566
If the area of triangle ABC is
18, what is the value of k?

00:08:41.566 --> 00:08:43.270
The area is 18.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.990
So area is equal to 1/2 base
times height for a triangle.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.930
We know that the area is 18.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.810
So 18 is equal to 1/2.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.230
What's the base?

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.710
Well we went from 2k to 5k.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.030
So we went 3k.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.880
We went 1, 2, 3.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.700
We went 3k.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.430
So the base is 3k.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.810
And what's the height?

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.260
Well from 2 to 6.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.540
So the height is 4, and we
just saw solve for k.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:20.330
So 18 is equal to 1/2 times 4 is
2 times 3k is equal to 6k.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.880
k is equal to 3.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.040
And that is choice E.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.200
And we are done.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.700
You just have to know area is
equal to 1/2 base times

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.750
height, and then just put in the
base, which is 3k, and the

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.840
height, and solve for k.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.890
I'll see you in the
next video.
