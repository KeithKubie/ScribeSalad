00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, let's take a quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this scenario we have some large software under test,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and part of it is a library that's been flaky and has been giving us problems.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's say this library is implementing numerical functions,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and these numerical functions have been sometimes throwing floating point exceptions

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and crashing our system.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What happens is the vendor has given us a new version,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but what we don't want to do is just roll that directly into our production system

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because in the past we've gotten burned by that sort of thing

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
where we have deployed a new version and it contains flaws

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that were worse than the flaws in the previous version.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What we're going to do is we're going to spend some time checking this thing out

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and trying to make sure that even if it's not that great

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it's at least not worse than the previous version.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The question I have for you is what kind of testing is this most like?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Is it unit testing? 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Is it white box testing? Is it black box testing?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Or, on the other hand, is it stress testing?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Okay, please take a minute to mark what you think is the best answer.
