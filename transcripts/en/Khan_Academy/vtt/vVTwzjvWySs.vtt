00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:02.904
- [Instructor] So we have the
formula for an ionic compound

00:00:02.904 --> 00:00:04.777
here, and the goal of this video is

00:00:04.777 --> 00:00:06.771
what do we call this thing?

00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:10.164
It clearly involves some
cobalt and some sulfur,

00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.217
but how do we name it?

00:00:12.217 --> 00:00:16.120
Well, the convention is, is
the first element to be listed

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.511
is going to be our cation,
and if we look at cobalt

00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:23.801
over here, we see that
it is a D-block element

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:26.320
and D-block elements are
tricky because you don't know

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.081
exactly how it will ionize.

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.819
So we know that this is
going to be our cation,

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.503
it's going to be our positive
ion, but we don't know

00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:36.734
what the charge on each of those cobalt

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:39.049
is actually going to be.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:43.523
So now let's look at the anion,
let's look at the sulfur,

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:45.856
or as an anion, the sulfide.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:48.857
So let me underline that.

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:54.063
And on the periodic table,
we see sulfur is out here

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:59.769
that in its group, it would
want to gain two electrons

00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:03.742
in order to have a complete outer shell.

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:07.567
It's just like oxygen, it
wants to gain two electrons.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.984
So the sulfide anion will look like this.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.007
So it will have sulfur when it ionizes

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.834
will have a two minus
charge, just like oxygen,

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:21.582
just like everything else in this group.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.795
It would want to gain
one, two electrons so that

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:28.378
its outer shell looks
like that of a noble gas,

00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:30.819
looks like that of argon.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.277
We can use this as a clue
to figure out what must be

00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:37.169
the charge on the cobalts because we have

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:39.002
three of the sulfides.

00:01:40.693 --> 00:01:44.192
Each of the sulfides
has a two minus charge,

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:47.368
and we have three of them,
so that's going to give us

00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:49.535
a six minus charge all in.

00:01:50.537 --> 00:01:52.204
And then the cobalt,

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.316
we have two of them.

00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:01.253
And so these two cobalt have to offset

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:03.575
this six minus charge.

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:06.464
They have to have a six plus charge.

00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:08.336
Well that means that each of them need

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.453
to have a three plus charge.

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:13.670
If each of these have a three
plus charge and you have

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.090
two of them, then you're gonna
have six plus on the positive

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.506
side and you're gonna have
six minus from the sulfides.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.582
And the reason why this is useful for us

00:02:22.582 --> 00:02:24.582
is now we can name this.

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:29.804
We would call this ionic compound

00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:32.124
Cobalt III,

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.569
cobalt and you would write it

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.319
with Roman numerals
here, Cobalt III Sulfide,

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:41.768
Cobalt III Sulfide.

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:44.785
Now I know what you might be thinking.

00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:46.738
Hey, when we looked at
other ionic compounds,

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:51.011
I didn't have to write the
charge of the cation there

00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:55.178
and the reason why the
convention is to do it here, and

00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:58.430
I don't have to write in upper case there,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.151
so let me rewrite it as

00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.234
cobalt (III) sufide.

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:09.010
The reason why I wrote
that three in this case

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.841
is because the cobalt can
take on multiple charges.

00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:15.924
It's known as polyvalent, polyvalent.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.974
If something is in group one,
you know it tends to have

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:22.234
a positive one charge.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:24.800
Group two tends to have
a positive two charge.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.541
If it's a halide, it tends to
have a negative one charge.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:31.092
But these metals here
in this D-block here,

00:03:31.092 --> 00:03:33.360
they could be ionized in multiple ways.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.637
And so that's why we have to
figure out what the charge

00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:38.402
of the cobalt is, and we
write it here in the name.

00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:42.027
We would call this cobalt (III) sulfide.

00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:46.753
You could have other ionizations
of cobalt in other ionic

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:50.410
compounds, but this one
is cobalt (III) sulfide.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.347
And you could go either way.

00:03:51.347 --> 00:03:55.018
You could say, okay if the
cobalt has a charge of three plus

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.011
you could figure out its
formula right over here,

00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:58.762
or as we just did in
this video, you could go

00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:01.762
from the formula to the actual name.
