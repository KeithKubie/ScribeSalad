[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.580
MARINA WARNER: Well, thank
you all very much for coming.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.700
I wrote this little book for
the OUP series, "A Very Short

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.609
Introduction."

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.400
And since then, I've
gotten very interested

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.800
in the presence of stories
in the current times

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.930
of dislocation and migration.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
So there's an actual angle
to this talk which follows on

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.450
from the definitions and
discussion in the book,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.600
but it's not quite
exactly the same.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.020
This is a wonderful work.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.950
You probably know her.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
She does these cutout
sculptures from old books.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.660
And it seems to me this
captures brilliantly the idea

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.370
of the secrecy of the story--

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.130
the secrecy, the intimacy,
the hidden knowledge

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.430
deep in the forest and the
idea of the illumination

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.720
that the story might bring.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660
There are many ways to approach
the definition of fairy tale,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.520
but one of the
interesting aspects of it

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.510
is that it's frequently
associated with women's voices.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.210
Now, this may be to some extent
derogatory, because Plato,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.970
for example-- as
early as Plato--

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780
he says, oh, those are
just old wives' tales.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.760
So the idea of the
old wives' tale,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.710
which is exactly
what it is in Greek,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.080
is a sense a story
that is kind of what

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.340
we call now "fake news."

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.380
It's a sort of nostrum full
of superstition and ignorance.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.460
So very, very early on there's
this derogatory aspect,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.640
and that may have led to the
association of such material--

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.420
fairy tales, fables,
there's a vast body of work,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.560
but I'm going to
stick to fairy tales--

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.950
it might have lead
to this association

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.370
when attributing them.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.600
You know, we don't do it.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.470
We authority
figures don't do it.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.850
Those old women do it.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.330
But that's probably
not the case.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.600
It's probably also
true that this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.920
was a body of
stories circulating

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.180
in family and private circuits,
because one characteristic

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.910
of fairy tales is that
it's not associated

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.010
with literate elites.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.424
Now, that doesn't mean that
it wasn't written down.

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:09.090
A lot of them are
written down, and I'll

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.820
show you some very
famous collectors.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.280
But on the whole,
you didn't have

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.340
to be somebody with
an education to be

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.740
able to pass on a
version of Cinderella.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.200
And that means
that it is actually

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.110
the body of imaginative
discovery and creation

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.240
that links us all together, the
numerous cultural variations,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.690
many different aspects of
societies are affected.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.160
If you are in a
polygamous society,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.050
you have fairy tales
about polygamy, et cetera.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.240
Monsters take on the shape
of local fears, and so forth.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.330
But basically, the structures
are a form of language.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.470
They are what I've called an
Esperanto of the imagination.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.790
We can talk to somebody from
Finland or from Australia

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.320
through the language
of fairy tale.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.410
One of the earliest
fairy tales written down

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.370
is Cupid and Psyche, which is
a beauty and the beast story.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.710
And it's interestingly
set up in the middle

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.860
of a remarkable novel,
which some of you will know,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.660
Apuleis's "The
Golden Ass," which

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.150
is about the transformation
of Lucius, the hero,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.260
into a donkey.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.520
And as a donkey, he
experiences many sufferings,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.640
the brutality of people,
but also a lot of comedy.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.740
And then it ends with
a religious initiation.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.190
But in the middle of
this story, a young woman

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.550
is abducted on her
wedding night by bandits,

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.410
and she's taken to a cave.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.110
Her husband is seized by the
bandits, and taken elsewhere,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.780
and she fears for his
life quite rightly.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.760
And she's taken--
she's called Charite--

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.750
and she is taken by the bandits
to their cave, their lair,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.100
and she's given into the keeping
of a disreputable old woman.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.530
And the disreputable old woman--

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.680
when she's weeping and weeping
because she's lost her husband,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.730
and she has been
raped and abducted--

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.900
the old woman says,
let me tell you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.020
a story to make you
feel a little better.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.670
And this is absolutely
to the heart--

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.170
I mean, this is a
very early version

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.880
of a fairy tale in print--

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.090
this goes to the heart of
the characteristic defiance

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.320
of the fairy tale.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.220
It's not exactly optimism.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.190
The happy ending is
never elaborated.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.090
The story of cruelty,
and unkindness,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.510
of infanticide, and starvation,
and so forth, and maltreatment,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.690
will unfold, fully
occupying the story.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.640
And then, at the end,
it will be the promise

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.320
that this will be changed.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.920
So it's an act of defiance
more than an expression

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.980
of how hope can take place.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.850
But that spirit,
that spirit of what

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.970
Walter Benjamin called
cunning and high spirits,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.270
flows through the
conventional fairy tale--

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.590
the traditional idea we
have of a a fairy tale,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.070
and it differs it from a myth.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.550
A myth will not necessarily come
to a conclusion that is hopeful

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.990
or that's defiant.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.960
It will often be tragic.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.790
And it differs from a ballad.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.460
A ballad, like the one you
were hearing when you came in,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.230
which is very famous,
with numerous variations,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.110
both verbal variations
and musical variations,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.650
that is now called binary
in the Scottish tradition.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.870
And that one is called
"The Two Sisters."

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.220
Emily Portman was singing it.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.270
And that's the story
of two sisters who

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.550
are rivals for the same man, and
one sister kills the other one.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.320
And then after
she's murdered her,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.820
she buries her in the
mud of the river bank.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.040
And then someone coming by sees
a bone sticking out of the mud,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.620
thinks it's an animal
bone, and takes it out.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.760
And he either makes
it into a pipe

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.390
or he makes it into a
harp from her breastbone.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.090
And then he goes to
play, this minstrel.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.260
This shepherd who's made
this instrument for himself

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.630
goes to the King's hall,
and starts trying to play,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.110
and the musical
instrument will only

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.870
play the song of the murder.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.720
So when he pipes on it, this
pipe sings, I was your sister.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.040
You killed me.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.170
And if it's a breastbone
that's been strung for a harp,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.190
the harp sings, you are
strumming my hair on your harp,

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.890
and then tells the
story of her murder.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.400
So that is an example
of a story that

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.080
has no happy resolution,
except there's

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.970
a revenge on the murderer.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.440
But otherwise, it's not
at all a happy story.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.250
But it belongs to fairy
tale in one sense.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.480
It's supernatural.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.310
And it's the idea of
the eloquent bone,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.530
which of course is very central
to the idea of the oral voice.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:58.620
So there are numerous examples
in high literature of this idea

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.480
of the circle of storytellers.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.180
And very frequently,
as I said, female.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.690
So here, Boccaccio,
they're fleeing the plague,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.630
and the women dominate
the storytelling scene.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.740
So there, in Boccaccio, you
have a tremendous collection

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.300
of wonderful, inventive stories
that are, again, attributed

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.710
to women's passing on, to
the traditions of exchanges

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.710
between women.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.710
The first famous
collection that we all

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.390
know because it
contains Bluebeard,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.080
it contains Red Riding Hood,
it contains Sleeping Beauty

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.690
is Charles Perrault. So
here you have the example

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.240
of a very
characteristic pattern,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.250
which is that a man comes
along who is highly educated--

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.870
he was a very high court
official under Louis XIV--

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.640
and he collected stories, he
said, that were just sonnet.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.890
They were just little trifles.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.790
They were absurdities.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.060
But he collected them from his
grandmother and his servants,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.540
and then he wrote them
in these very elegant--

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.170
very, very elegant French.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.200
Ironic, delightful,
sophisticated stories

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.710
which have been retold and
retold many, many times

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.450
in a different tone of voice.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.060
He's much more
feline, and savvy,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.150
and sort of knowing
them than the way

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.710
we do we produce the
stories for children.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:22.500
He had a contemporary, and so
he signed the book Mother Goose.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.020
So there you have an
example of someone

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.970
who is a worldly courtier
taking on the identity

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.320
of a poor old woman--

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.140
and a slightly absurd
figure, Mother Goose--

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.299
Mere L'oie in French--

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:40.110
and it translated into English
culture almost directly.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.659
We still have Mother
Goose collections--

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.340
Mother Goose books.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.790
Though he had a contemporary
who has interestingly rather

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.290
vanished as a name
from the history.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.880
So Marie-Catherine
d'Aulnoy was a contemporary

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.312
of Perrault's, as I
said, and she wrote many,

00:08:58.312 --> 00:09:00.270
many fairy tales which
were turned into British

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.780
pantomimes--

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:09.660
like the golden goose,
the yellow dwarf--

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.760
these were all turned
into Victorian pantomimes.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.730
And theater and film
are chief conductors

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.420
of this form of literature.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.670
At the same time--

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.130
and this is often forgotten,
because unfortunately we

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.830
are formed to think
of the Islamic world

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:31.110
and the Christian world
as kind of cloven apart,

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.860
somehow existing in
separate spheres.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.350
This is not at all the case.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.970
They were deeply entangled.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.860
And one of the ways
they became very deeply

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.670
entangled in our fairy tale
tradition was interwoven

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.930
with the eastern Oriental
and Middle Eastern

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.930
fairytale tradition, was
through "The Arabian Nights."

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.640
"Les Mille et Une Nuit"-- it
was published in French first.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.600
It was the first print edition
of this immense collection

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:01.140
of incredibly brilliant and
elaborate stories of fantastic

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.170
range of human
experiences, which I'll

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.875
tell you in a second about.

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:09.700
But that, as you
know, it takes place

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.450
as a storytelling scene in bed.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.590
So the sultan is killing all
the women in his country,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.080
because he believes that
all women are perfidious,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.400
treacherous
adulteresses, so he's

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.140
decided to murder them all.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.230
And Scheherazade, who's
the daughter of his vizier,

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.510
actually volunteers
to marry him,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.480
knowing that she's under threat,
that the following morning he

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.600
will have her head cut off,
or he'll have her strangled.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.150
But she holds him by
telling him stories.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:48.610
And in "The Arabian Nights"
you have a very clear picture

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.622
of how stories were associated.

00:10:50.622 --> 00:10:52.330
But it's not only with
this idea that you

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.150
can make you feel
a little better,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.220
like the bride in the cave,
but that actually, you

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.360
could save your life.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.600
And I think that that
might seem preposterous,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.000
but I think in our kind
of very disruptive times,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.500
and you know, turbulent and
hostile times, the function

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.810
of stories matters
more and more,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.330
because they have
this power, actually,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.660
to impinge on reality,
and to change reality.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.655
The frameworks of narrative
through which we work

00:11:21.655 --> 00:11:25.060
are more important
than we perhaps allow.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:32.350
It's not a frivolous,
out-to-the-side activity.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.780
It's very central
to human thought.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.210
I mean, I feel I'm
speaking to an audience who

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.810
knows this extraordinarily
well, because the internet is

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:46.180
in some sense a material
expression of this network

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.970
of stories, and we're seeing
a lot of the consequences

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.860
of people being
frightened of that power,

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.600
and my kind of
mission as a writer is

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.890
to harness that power for the
ends of justice, and equality,

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.480
and understanding, and deeper
intelligence, and so forth,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.180
rather than for disinformation,
and propaganda, and other uses

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.859
which at the moment
are gaining ground.

00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:11.650
They don't necessarily
need to gain ground,

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.562
but they are gaining ground.

00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:15.270
There are three
quotations which I'd just

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.900
like quickly to mention to you.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.140
One is Ursula Le Guin,
who unfortunately

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.270
died, as you know, last year.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.110
She says, resistance and
change often begin in art--

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.490
very often in our art.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.330
She was addressing an
audience of writers--

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.540
very often in our
art, the art of words.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.140
So she's making the same point
which the story Scheherazade is

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:43.240
making, that you can influence
and shape the experience

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.280
and reality through
the power of words.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.780
Scheherazade tells many,
many varied stories

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.180
across a gamut of very
terrifying situations,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.790
to the sultan, and
the ultimate aim

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.800
is that he should see
the error of his ways,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.450
that he should see that there
were other ways of responding

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.930
to adultery than cutting
off the heads of all women.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.730
So the story eventually
goes in a full arc

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.060
after 1,001 nights, to
the resolution whereby

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.440
he is a changed man.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.910
Unfortunately, we
know from the world

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.260
that this has not happened.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.134
Because when I was
reading the Arabian Nights

00:13:25.134 --> 00:13:29.140
very intensively, it was the
beginning of the war in Syria.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.130
And it was clear--

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.140
Assad kept coming up in my mind
as I read about this sultan who

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.090
was so extreme and violent.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.660
And of course we know
that however many stories

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.230
we tell Assad, he
doesn't change his views.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.430
So there is a problem.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.050
But the second quotation
I wanted to mention to you

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.950
was Hannah Arendt, who wrote
in her excellent book, called

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.140
"Human Condition After
the Second World War,"

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.860
stories are a form of action,
the way we insert ourselves

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.930
into the human world.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.730
And that-- as she went on--

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.980
the ability to
produce stories is

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.650
the way we become historical.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.080
She says, produce
stories, but actually, you

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.600
can modify that
to, retell stories.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.780
The way we take our
traditions and refashion

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.840
them makes our history,
makes the history

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.090
in which we are living.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.490
And third is from
Walter Benjamin,

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:32.080
in which he stresses that these
individual acts of telling

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.910
stories are part
of the community.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.590
They're part of
the collectivity.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.190
And he, too, writing at the
end of the second World War

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.010
said, every morning brings
us the news of the globe,

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.790
and yet we are poor
in noteworthy stories.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:51.490
And he went on, calling for
more speculative fiction that

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.930
would build an experience
in this sort of mayhem

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.980
of the aftermath of the war.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.530
Folk art and the world
view of the child

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.140
demand to be seen as
collectivist ways of thinking.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.480
And I was very interested
that you have such an emphasis

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.620
on play in your reception
area, because it seems

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.160
to me that connects quite--

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.060
Walter Benjamin was very,
very interested in play,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.370
and wrote wonderful
things-- wonderful stories

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.410
for the radio for children.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.400
And there is a connection there.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.320
There is something
about the fairy tale

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.530
that is connected to the idea
of the imagination at play.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.820
You're not tied to the objective
representation of reality.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.070
You are speculative,
and you move freely

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.730
within this Esperanto
of fantasy in order

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:45.010
to build possible
alternative worlds.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:51.070
OK, so "The Arabian
Nights" were disseminated

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.560
throughout the world in
hundreds of different versions

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.990
and variations, in both
English and French, and then

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.240
finally in Arabic.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.990
It came into print in
Arabic in the 19th century.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.990
So these are just [INAUDIBLE]
So there are the Grimm brothers.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.320
They were the major collectors
of the other famous stories

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.330
that you know--

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.730
"Hansel and Gretel"--
anyway, we'll

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.130
look at them on the way out.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.210
And they've dominated the scene.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.940
But they did themselves
invoke female sources.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.350
And when they came
into English--

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.550
so this is one of their
principal sources, a very,

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.080
very nice portrait by
the younger brother,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.630
who didn't collect stories,
but was an artist--

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.650
of one of their principal
sources of fairy tales.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.570
She knew very many of them.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:45.280
Then when they were translated
into English, interestingly,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.430
the English were anxious
about the cruelty.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:53.350
So George Cruikshank, who was
a cartoonist and a campaigner,

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.360
actually, he was a
teetotaler, and so

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.140
when he re-translated
"Cinderella" in the Grimm

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.510
version, he had the
fountains at the wedding flow

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.790
with lemonade because
he wanted to make sure

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.369
that he was campaigning
against drunkenness in England.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.869
But the emphasis in England
tried to shift it to comedy,

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.099
and you can see that
in this frontispiece.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:22.859
The stories become jollier, and
more cheerful, and more absurd.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.510
There's a desire
to pull away, which

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.569
has now come back, actually.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.710
We now are back with
cruelty and violence.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.720
People now acknowledge
strongly that that's

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.930
a very intrinsic part of
the fairy tale tradition.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.240
The Cinderella that the Grimm
brothers collected is the one

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.610
where these ugly sisters'
cut off their heels,

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.090
and cut off their toes to
fit into the glass slipper.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.570
And the prince realizes that
it's not the right bride

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.680
because there's
blood in the shoe.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.720
It was very bloody.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.870
And then, at the end,
the enchanted birds

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.480
peck out the eyes of the
sisters at the wedding--

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.040
Cinderella's wedding.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.860
So they're both
maimed in their feet,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.030
and blinded in their eyes.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.330
(FACETIOUSLY) Very happy ending.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.260
Very happy ending.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.750
That has an interesting
little coda,

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.861
which is that they collected it
from the poor house in Marburg.

00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:18.110
They were students in Marburg.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.100
They began when they were very
young, collecting stories.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.270
So they were students
at Marburg University,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.190
and they heard that
there was a old woman

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.950
in the alms house, i.e.
in the poor house, who

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.510
knew a lot of stories.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.060
And they asked to see her,
and to collect her stories,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.393
and she didn't want to see them.

00:18:32.393 --> 00:18:33.250
She refused.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.660
So they paid the daughter
of the alms house director.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.100
They gave her a little--

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.720
she was a little girl--

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.190
and asked her to go in, and
ask her to tell you a story,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.870
and then you come out
and tell it to us,

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.640
and we'll write it down.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.740
And the little girl did this.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.320
And this is the
Cinderella she told.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.990
And my feeling, my
interpretation of this,

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.780
is that the old woman
in the alms house

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.220
was passing on a female secret,
a very, very cruel version

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.200
of revenge amongst women.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.460
And she didn't want the fine
gentlemen from the University

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.600
to know this kind of story.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.010
It was a kind of
promise between women,

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.300
between generations of women,
that if you're badly treated,

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.180
you will escape.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.009
And there will be a
wonderful revenge.

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:25.300
So it's an interesting example.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.730
We didn't have many actual
scenes of that kind.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.092
We don't know the
exact circumstances

00:19:31.092 --> 00:19:32.050
of a lot of collecting.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.240
And there's a lot of, of
course, massaging and changing

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.010
of the sources.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.440
Even the Grimms pretended to
be setting it down verbatim,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.190
but they couldn't.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.550
They kept rewriting them,
because we have the drafts.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.420
OK.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.660
So there are many
definitions of fairy tales

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.840
that I can't go into here.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.270
One of them is obviously the
presence of the supernatural.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.670
That's a very important and
defining characteristic:

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.260
the enchantment of
the supernatural.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.040
But there is a way in which
the supernatural is there

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.220
because reality can't be
tolerated, can't be born.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.840
It is so unbearable.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.100
Because the real hear of fairy
tale content is suffering.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.900
It's a domain of pain.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:22.260
And then every kind of human
aberration, crime, ordeal

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.380
are represented.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.130
In spite of their supernatural
clothing, the enchantments,

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.860
their improbabilities,
they're actually

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.740
very close to real experience.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.770
So for example,
this "Donkeyskin"--

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.230
I don't know if
any of you know it.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.320
It's the one that's least
reproduced from Perrault's

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.860
collection because it's
about father-daughter incest.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.029
And so in the story,
her father wants

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:49.820
to marry her after the
death of her mother,

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.531
because she looks
just like her mother,

00:20:51.531 --> 00:20:53.780
and he's promised never to
marry again unless somebody

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.390
was as good as her mother.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.950
So he asks to marry her.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.000
She doesn't want to
marry her father,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.250
and there's a lot of
magic to help her.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.700
And part of the magic
is that she's given

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.080
a kind of magic donkey skin.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.350
And this is her
in that disguise.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.615
And then she takes a job as
a scullion in the kitchen.

00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:13.370
She flees her father.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.430
And interestingly, the story--

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.100
and it's rather lightheartedly
written by Perrault--

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.720
the story upholds the
girl against her father.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.720
So here you have a story
of filial disobedience.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.020
She refuses to marry her
father as he asks her to do.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.200
But the story is covertly--

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.070
not covertly-- is
overtly upholding.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.430
The story is on her side.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.130
It is the wrong
thing for him to ask.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.120
So this story, if you
imagine it being passed on,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.160
is a way in which the
customs of the tribe

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.860
are being communicated
without actually

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.300
telling a story of child abuse.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.020
I mean, it's very fanciful.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.560
It feels like-- it's once
upon a time, far away,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.600
in a great palace,
a king, et cetera.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.390
So it sort of distanced by the
act of literary imagination,

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.241
but at the same time it carries
this seed, a very important

00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:09.740
seed.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.680
I mean, if you could imagine
how different it would

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.590
be if the child abuse stories
were told in this way,

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.491
we would understand.

00:22:16.491 --> 00:22:17.990
I mean, it's in a
way a lack of them

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.780
that has caused some
of the difficulties

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.320
that we're experiencing today.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.470
Children, if they
were brought up

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.190
with lots of fairy tales about
Harvey Weinstein in disguise

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:33.140
as a king, they would have
been more of an understanding,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.740
instead of being constantly
promoted by the tabloids

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.860
into being beautiful for,
to please, and so forth.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.670
So this is a great lost art.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:47.972
I mean, it's coming back.

00:22:47.972 --> 00:22:48.680
It's coming back.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.910
But it's to some extent a
lost art of communication.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.180
It was made into a wonderful
film in 1970, by Jacques Demy,

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.220
with Catherine
Deneuve in the role.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.830
And I wanted to put this
in, not only to remind you

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.730
of what a great film this is,
but also that film is probably

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.390
one of the ways that most of you
have encountered fairy tales.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.980
It's the chief channel
of communication,

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.360
even for children.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.150
They've not really read fairy
tales so much as seeing them.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.690
Because of this being this
language of Esperanto,

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:26.030
this Esperanto language,
the big blockbuster studios

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.540
love it, because it can actually
communicate across cultures.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.710
OK, so "Cinderella"
is about stepmothers.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:38.270
The same stepmother role
is, in some languages,

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.350
the same as the mother-in-law--

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.440
the same word.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.110
So belle-mere in French means
stepmother and mother-in-law.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.150
That's quite common
in several societies.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.700
So the situation
that Cinderella is

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.470
in, or being turned into
sort of skivvy, and abused,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.540
and not given food--

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.310
very, very widespread
in many, many cultures.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.760
Either the unwanted child
of an earlier marriage,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.820
or the daughter-in-law
is turned into a servant.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.160
So again, in the heart of this
fanciful tale of enchantment

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.580
lies a very true representation.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.850
We're very imprinted
by the film tradition.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.050
And I'm sure many of you--

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.260
probably all of you
have seen "Snow White."

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.430
I mean, it's incredibly
early, I think 1937.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:33.350
I mean, he used the
medium early on.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.810
And here, there's another catch.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.630
There's a catch, which is that
this evil stepmother figure--

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.200
and perhaps you
can ask me about it

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.130
later, because I
won't linger now--

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.350
has become an archetype.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.830
And here the reality
flips over in the sense

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.900
that a lot of stepmothers
today, of whom there

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.586
are very many, because
of easier divorce,

00:24:54.586 --> 00:24:59.570
are really very
well-meaning, and long to be

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.990
loved by their stepchildren,
and don't maltreat them at all.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.490
But the children
have all seen Disney.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.660
And so there you have
the reflection of reality

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.180
in the stories from
a different era

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.030
impinging and passing
on, reflecting

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:19.920
on the reality of
experience in the present

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.700
with a dangerous effect.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.150
And this means that the
fairy tales need constantly

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:30.480
to be rewritten and reworked.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.060
"Maleficent," the "Sleeping
Beauty" that was recently done,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.210
did a very interesting
reworking, which

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.980
we can talk about again later.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:44.800
This was a superb "Snow White,"
which took on Disney directly.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.720
It didn't do anything
kind of glib like reverse

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.700
the stepmother figure,
but it made "Snow White"

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.850
herself so interesting, and so
appealing, and so beautiful.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.880
But it didn't have
a happy ending.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.930
The film does not
have a happy ending.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.660
So it's an example of how the
new reworkings and recreations

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.980
of classic fairy tales actually
often edge them into myth,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.896
and edge them into tragedy.

00:26:11.896 --> 00:26:13.270
"Hansel and Gretel,"
probably one

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.700
of the most famous
stories in the world,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.390
is about child abandonment
due to starvation.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:24.220
And that is a very,
very common predicament,

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.960
not only in the past.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.530
Quite a lot of the refugees
who are arriving in Europe

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.810
are exactly in that situation.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.510
It's not exactly infanticide.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:37.360
In the story it says that
we will leave them to die.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.020
But actually what happened
in the early modern period,

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.390
and probably before that,
and is happening now

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.520
in some of the war torn
areas, is that families

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.350
are saying, leave.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.442
We're going to leave.

00:26:48.442 --> 00:26:49.900
We're going to put
you on the boat.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.059
You've probably read many
of these refugee stories.

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:53.225
We take you to the frontier.

00:26:53.225 --> 00:26:54.290
You're nine years old.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.060
We'll take you to the frontier.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.460
We're going to leave you
there, because they will come,

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.830
and they will help you.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.070
So there's this sort of modern
version of infanticide, which

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.610
is sending children to
a place where they might

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.120
be safer, and have
something to eat,

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.550
and have some which they don't
have in the place they are.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.540
These are wonderful,
wonderful illustrations

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.480
that David Hockney did
with the children being

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.100
cooked for supper--

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:26.790
again, aspect of famine, famine
being one of the dominant spurs

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.510
to the sufferings
reflected in fairy tales.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.360
Angela Carter once said
a very famous thing.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.260
She said, the definition
of a fairy tail

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.770
is a story in which one
king goes to another king

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.240
to borrow a cup of sugar.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:50.500
Famine-- only the
kings have sugar.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.130
Only some kings have sugar.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.360
So here he's being
mischievous with Rapunzel.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.130
Rapunzel is a story
about a childless woman

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.940
who takes the new baby of the
couple who live next door.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.740
And again, this is
actually a story

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.570
which I was inspired to write
a short story from the point

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.600
of view of the witch,
because it seemed to me

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.280
that it was very much about
childlessness and adoption.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.160
She adopts Rapunzel,
and then she

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.230
wants to keep her really safe.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.240
And then the prince comes by--

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.220
and you probably know the
story-- and climbs up her hair.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.000
And then one day she
says to the old witch who

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.880
looks after her,
she says, you know,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.130
why are my clothes
getting a little tight?

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.470
And the old witch, you
know, loses her temper,

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.940
realizes that someone
has been getting in,

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.880
and that Rapunzel
is having a baby.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.560
And she beats and abuses
her, and cuts off her hair.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.680
That of course was cleaned up.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.570
Originally it was--
the Grimms couldn't

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.090
bear the fact that
Rapunzel was pregnant,

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:02.450
so they just had her say
something completely different,

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.340
which makes nonsense
of the story.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.880
But the story is
about over-protection

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.430
of a woman who didn't have a
child, and has adopted a child.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.540
And that seemed to
me to be incredibly

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.280
recognizable as a
contemporary experience.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.190
So that's one of the images.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.940
Rackham.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.180
We had a fantastic tradition of
illustrators in this country,

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.780
including Arthur Rackham.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.930
Walter Crane, another one.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.270
The "Beauty and the
Beast" corpus of stories,

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:36.130
which comes down from "Cupid
and Psyche" pretty directly,

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.580
is the vehicle of
an enormous number

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.160
of explorations of the state
of marriage to a brute.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.990
So in the hope that's held
out in "Beauty and the Beast"

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.390
is that with love
and time, the brute

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.430
will turn into a
wonderful, lovable husband.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:58.030
The story as we know best of
all, which is this version,

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.570
was written by a governess
here in England, in French--

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.100
she was a French governess--

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.900
for her charges who were
all in arranged marriages.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.650
So it's the story that comes
out of the arranged marriage,

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.780
in which you will
find the stranger who

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.630
you will have to
marry, and you must

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.520
trust that all will be well.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.490
But of course some versions,
it's not always well.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.540
And that's like "Bluebeard.".

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.980
"Bluebeard" is
another classic story

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:33.350
that looks at the inside
of an abusive marriage.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.250
"The Arabian Nights" opens
with a very interesting example

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:46.770
of a storyteller thinking
about conditions in the world.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.845
So the two kings we see
off hidden in the tree,

00:30:50.845 --> 00:30:53.750
and have both found
their wives supposedly

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.440
cavorting with slaves, and
having sex with them in a very

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.390
raunchy and extreme fashion.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.950
The book is quite explicit--

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.790
not for children,
but the original.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.995
And so they both decide
the world is not for them.

00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:07.745
They're disgusted.

00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:09.244
They kill both their
wives, and then

00:31:09.244 --> 00:31:10.910
they decide the world
is not for them,

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.640
and they go wandering
across the world.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.240
And they come across--

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.775
out of the sea
comes a vast jinn.

00:31:20.775 --> 00:31:25.010
And on his head, he's
carrying a glass casket

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.620
in which there is the body
of a beautiful young girl--

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.770
a naked body of a
beautiful young girl.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.160
And she again, it turns out,
has been abducted on her wedding

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.940
night.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.709
It's interesting
these motifs recur.

00:31:37.709 --> 00:31:40.250
And also, you will notice the
glass box, which of course gets

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:42.620
into "Snow White."

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.500
So this glass coffin,
which she is still alive,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.900
he lets her out, and the kings
climb a tree to hide from it.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.610
They're scared of this jinn.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.890
And the jinn falls asleep.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.280
And when he's asleep,
she solicits the kings.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.220
She's noticed them in the tree,
and she solicits the kings,

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.660
and beckons them down, and
then orders them to make

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.300
love to her.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.620
And they say no, no, no.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.520
Absolutely, we're not
that kind of person.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.510
And she insists.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.090
She says, if you
don't, I will murder--

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.330
I will raise the jinn.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.860
I will wake him up,
and he will kill you.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.060
So they agree very reluctantly.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:27.590
And then after they've
both done the evil deed,

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.800
she takes out of her
clothes a string of rings.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.140
And she demands that they give
her a ring as a pledge of her,

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.490
of what's just happened.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.610
And they say, no, they won't.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.656
And she says, well,
I'll wake up the jinn.

00:32:43.656 --> 00:32:44.780
So they give her the rings.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.760
And when she puts
them on the string,

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.460
in the English version,
that makes her 98

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.480
rings so far into 100,
and in the Arabic version,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.370
she's got 365.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:33:00.011
So that was censored in
the English translation.

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.520
It was reduced.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:08.820
So interestingly, one of
the scholars of this story--

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.630
the obvious, sort of the
surface of the story,

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.930
is rather misogynist.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.310
You know, here's this
lascivious a woman

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:21.040
who demands sex, and
is taking this revenge,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.240
and she's sort of
uncontrollable.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.260
She fulfills in the story
all the worst imaginings

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.227
of the two kings, who seen
their adulterous wives.

00:33:30.227 --> 00:33:32.060
They now say, well, all
women are like that.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.800
So they go back
home, and that's when

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.260
they start killing all women.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.950
So it's presented
as women's wiles.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.240
But actually what's happened,
and what you can also

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.490
interpret the story,
that is telling you what

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.010
will happen if you do wrong.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:52.340
If you take a woman
from her wedding,

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.160
and abduct her, and
keep her in a glass box,

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.530
women will not obey that.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.170
They will not submit.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.230
And this is a fundamental wrong,
and you will suffer for it.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.700
There will be a consequence.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.340
So while it's put in a
sort of fairy tale setting,

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.960
it has actually a kernel of
thinking about justice in it,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.900
especially if you imagine the
beginning of the story in which

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.050
we're going to hear
many, many, many stories,

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.510
and which at the end,
the King will realize

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.340
that he has come to
the false conclusions,

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.926
and he must mend his ways.

00:34:24.926 --> 00:34:25.550
All right.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:31.530
One of the other important
aspects of fairy tales

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.040
that I have become
increasingly interested in

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.010
is their portability.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.260
They seem to transcend
difficulties of translation.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.100
This is a very, very
mysterious process.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:50.150
I mean, there are trade routes,
there are traveling scholars,

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.190
there are traveling
missionaries,

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.400
there are traveling
voices that possibly

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.510
translate these stories.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.540
But at the same time, it
seems more fundamental

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.710
than that, in that the
sort of human desire

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.650
to make stories, and
transmit them, and hear them,

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.100
overcomes cultural barriers
in a very, very, very

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.630
remarkable way.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:17.190
So we have stories like
"The Epic of Gilgamesh,"

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:22.620
which is probably the earliest
extent imaginative piece

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.160
of literature we have.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.090
It written down in 800 BC,
but it's much, much older

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.940
in actual creation.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.430
And many, many of its elements--

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.650
it's a fantastic book,
which Alice was telling me

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.730
she read when she was studying.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.130
It's a fantastic, and exciting,
and wonderful, wonderful poem

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:49.980
full of deep human
scenes of loss, and love,

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.850
and exploration, and power--

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.790
everything.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.530
It's elements--
it was only found

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.430
in the mid-19th century in
the desert in the library

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.040
of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:10.740
So it actually was
only read then.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.600
So it's like a modern book.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.670
For 2000 years, it wasn't read.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.720
It burst on the scene,
and many things in it

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.720
were recognizable, because
the elements of the story

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.280
have traveled.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.080
So for example,
there's one whole cycle

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.120
of stories within "The
Arabian Nights," which

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.600
is very close to Gilgamesh,
in which the hero goes down

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:36.160
to the bottom of the sea pick
the plant of immortality,

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.130
and many other aspects.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.920
And why the Victorians
loved it was

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.200
that it contained the
story of the flood.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.090
It contains the story of Noah.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.060
He's got a different name,
but it's the same story.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.310
And they thought-- because
they were Christians--

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.650
they thought, oh, this proves
the truth of the flood,

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.840
because we have
another source for it.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:00.160
But actually, what it proves
is that stories circulate.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.220
They pass.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.880
This is a-- the British Museum
is full of these absolutely

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.720
wonderful miniature stories,
a wonderful form which I would

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.225
love to use myself,
in which you--

00:37:12.225 --> 00:37:14.160
you roll this on wax.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.280
So the story's incised into it,
and then you roll it on wax,

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.820
and you get the
frieze, like that.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.740
The example of another
enormous body of fairy tales--

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.174
northern, Scandinavian--
this became--

00:37:26.174 --> 00:37:27.590
"The Ring of the
Nibelungen," it's

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:31.200
sort of Icelandic
sagas, Norwegian Sagas,

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.885
became the Wagner,
"The Ring Cycle,"

00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:38.520
a huge, living body of myth
that then gives us Tolkien.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:45.150
Tolkien, as you know,
such an incredible success

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.360
as a film that New
Zealand has now

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.900
got its highest
proportion of GNP

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.310
comes from its CGI industries
that was driven by the fact

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.466
that the director decided to
film Tolkien in New Zealand.

00:38:00.466 --> 00:38:03.870
So that's another
different sort of example

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:09.160
of the material effect of
fantasy and fairy tale.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.620
Another very important crossing
point between east and west

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.210
was the Mediterranean,
and the island

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:19.650
of Sicily, which for a while
was under Arab rule, and then

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.390
changed to Norman
rule, the same Norman

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.080
family that conquered Britain.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.080
And we have one collection--

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.780
this is another body of
tales that are proverbial,

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.460
which are animal fables.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.100
So when you say, one swallow
never makes a summer,

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:41.850
or, a dog in the manger, or many
other proverbial phrases that

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:44.310
use animals as they
reflect humans,

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.010
they all come from
Aesop's Fables,

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:51.690
and Aesop's Fables have an
earlier version in India,

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:56.130
and they get into this
Arabic book written in Sicily

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.610
in the 12th century, where
he expresses it as being

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.885
between women telling stories.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.440
And he makes variations.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.150
They're not the same
as the Indian stories,

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.100
nor are they the same
as Aesop's Fables.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:17.670
But they have jackals, and
lions, and snakes, donkeys--

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:22.040
all that vast cast
of animal characters

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.830
that then gets into "The
Lion King," and into much

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.330
of popular literature.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.535
This is the ballad
that I played you.

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:33.630
So that's-- because we
played it at the beginning.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.840
And Angela Carter does
a variation on that.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.290
When I was teaching
fairy tales, my students

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.060
all wanted to know
about Angela Carter.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.851
I don't know if you
want to know about her,

00:39:43.851 --> 00:39:46.830
but her wonderful
story, "The Erl King"

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.850
in "The Bloody Chamber" is
based on the story of the two

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.560
sisters.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.840
And the Erl King,
in her version--

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.380
she's put the stories together--

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.840
the Erl King in her version
turns all his victims

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.460
into singing birds,
and then she has

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.870
to rescue them, the narrator.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:06.590
All right.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:10.070
So this is the coda.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.330
This idea of stories as
the place you dwell--

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.640
the place that you
create where you dwell,

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.040
the way you furnish
your imagination

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.790
and use it to
apprehend and engage

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.190
with the world
through the narratives

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.160
that you have a
structure, and that this

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.490
could form a sanctuary.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:36.100
There was one very nice example
of it in this man's book.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.650
He became a very prominent
literary critic in Germany,

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:44.000
but he was in the ghetto
in Warsaw as a young man,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.510
and he'd just got married.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.730
And he and his wife fled--

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.750
managed to get out of the
ghetto before the massacres.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.860
And they were hidden by
two Protestant Germans

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.300
in their cellar.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.850
The Protestants
were out of work.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.160
It was very bad times.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.400
There was very little
to eat during the war.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.950
But they didn't
shelter the two Jews

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.500
for reasons of benevolence.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.040
They sheltered them
because they enslaved them,

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.660
and they made them
roll cigarettes

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.050
for the contraband
traffic in cigarettes.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.810
So they were in the
dark in the cellar,

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.120
and very much at the mercy of--

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.142
very frightened that at any
moment they would be denounced,

00:41:26.142 --> 00:41:28.100
that it would not in the
end be worth the while

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:31.370
of their shelterers to
keep them and feed them

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.570
in return for what they
got for their cigarettes.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.120
But one day, the
woman came down,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.040
and she said, I'm so
bored, I could scream.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.550
And this man in his
20s, Marcel, decided

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.400
that he would tell her a story.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.240
And he ransacked his mind for
everything he'd ever read,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.730
every film he'd ever
seen, every opera plot

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.480
he'd ever heard about, every
sort of nursery rhyme--

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.710
absolutely everything.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:01.340
And the atmosphere
completely changed.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.890
They became very dependent
on hearing more stories.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:09.530
And then, by the end of the
war, they were not denounced.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.860
The end of the war came
amid great hardship.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:19.040
And though they were not
exactly sort of best of friends,

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.930
they were definitely
on terms that

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.950
were different from the
terms that the Germans

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.940
and their Jewish victims
had been on before he

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.990
told them the plot of Aida.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.820
It was this most extraordinary
modern example of--

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.890
I think he must have
been very good at it,

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.030
because it's not always--

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.770
and he must have been very
good at remembering, too.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:47.030
So I think that the concept
of sanctuary was a legal--

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.880
Alice is a lawyer.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.870
I don't know if she
knows about the legal.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.710
For 1,000 years,
there was the concept

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:56.060
of sanctuary in this country
until Henry VIII abolished it.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.720
You could establish a place
that was a safe place.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.760
It was not an armed place.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.400
It had no fence or lock.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.410
It was simply a
symbolic place that was

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:10.190
created by the decree of words.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:15.020
So the place was designated by
custom, tradition, and language

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.820
as the sanctuary.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.990
So this is an example
that still exists.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:25.370
And you will notice that it
has on it this monstrous face.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:30.140
And they frequently, sanctuary
places such as still survive--

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.270
that's another one that
doesn't have a monster--

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:36.170
but they often have-- the door
knockers of sanctuary buildings

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.150
have a monstrous face on them.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.180
And I think the connection-- so
this is another one in Norwich,

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.690
and this is a famous
one in Durham.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:48.530
And I think the connection
is that it connects

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:54.550
to the fundamental recognition
that the patent words have

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.590
what's technically called
performative power.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.640
They will institute.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.420
They can institute
something like a safe place.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.110
And I think that
presents an analogy

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.420
for what stories can do.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.720
They can demarcate
a space in which

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.750
you are free to do certain
things, like imagine

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.270
delicious revenges or
reparation, or redress.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.220
But you are still
held safely within it.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.700
It's not going to
endanger you, this speech.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.860
The speech of imagination
is not quite the same

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.660
as direct communication.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:34.480
And the other thing is
that words have efficacy

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.692
to institute reality.

00:44:36.692 --> 00:44:38.150
This is something--
obviously, this

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.691
is partly magical
thinking, and a lot

00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:41.320
of people dissent from it.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.110
But it's something
that I have pretty much

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.860
come to acknowledge,
and accept, and even

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.500
support throughout
my work, which

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.350
began with looking at religious
symbols, which certainly have

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.420
this power.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:59.070
And I'm now looking at
secular storytelling.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.310
So I started-- this is the end--

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:06.670
I started a project in
Sicily with the refugees

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.250
there, because Sicily
is this crossing point.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.980
Right here is a map
from the 17th century,

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.710
showing Sicily right in the
middle of the Mediterranean.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:19.630
They all arrive there,
600,000 in the last two years.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:23.034
And one of the problems of the--

00:45:23.034 --> 00:45:25.450
you know, we were talking about
traveling stories, and how

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.720
they leap cultural barriers.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.720
But actually, how do you
tell a story to someone

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.250
who doesn't know your language?

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:37.490
So we wanted to find a
way of creating stories

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.440
from imagination--

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.450
not their own stories,
not their testimony,

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.330
a very different kind
of story: stories

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.960
they might remember
themselves from their culture,

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.370
stories they want to
invent themselves now,

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:50.811
and how are we going to do it?

00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:52.810
And of course, Sicily has
a tremendous tradition

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:53.860
of puppetry.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.340
And so there are many
languages beyond language

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.160
that are communicative.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.780
So there is puppetry, there's
music, there's gestural dance.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.600
And so we've--
working with puppets.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.740
This is the traditional
puppet theater in Palermo.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.840
Here they are
learning the puppets.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.010
They took to it--

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.280
they really loved it.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.280
We do dancing-- ask them how
they dance in their countries.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.510
We do group-- this
is sort of word game.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.320
As it comes around
to you-- the ball--

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.410
as you throw the ball
and make this web,

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:33.790
you say a word, either
as part of a story, or--

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.650
you give a structure
ahead of time.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:39.350
And that works also rather well.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:43.120
And so here's a group
session on sound--

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.440
making sounds.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.840
And this is part of
the Gilgamesh workshop.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.070
So here they're making the
sounds of the City of Uruk

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.180
as a sort of chorus.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.540
So they did bird songs, and
you know, animal sounds,

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.910
and not exactly traffic
sounds, because there

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:02.140
wouldn't have been so
much traffic in Uruk then.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.740
And here is, I think, Gilgamesh.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.137
That's his visor.

00:47:07.137 --> 00:47:09.220
Yes, that's the sort of
beginning of the Gilgamesh

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.199
puppet.

00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:11.740
And here they are
doing an animation.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.240
We took an animator with us,
and they really loved this.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.290
This is to do animation
on your phone,

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.060
and they really really
liked doing that.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.190
Here are three of
the characters.

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:24.880
If you know the epic, that's
Siduri, the innkeeper,

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.197
the tavern keeper, on the right.

00:47:27.197 --> 00:47:28.780
I think probably
Enkidu in the middle.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.200
That's the plant of immortality.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.080
We made it with balloons.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.420
And here's another Gilgamesh,
a different Gilgamesh.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.360
And we got a very good writeup
in the local paper which

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.330
we were very pleased with.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.840
So this was an idea of taking--

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.730
really conforming to my
ideas about the transmission

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:54.070
and the freedom of the
language of stories,

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:57.970
and trying to adapt
it to our present day

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:02.350
crisis of young people
arriving, and hoping

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.500
to make a better world for
themselves, and for us, too.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.389
Thank you.

00:48:06.389 --> 00:48:09.882
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.872
SPEAKER: If you have a question
and want to put your hand,

00:48:14.872 --> 00:48:16.038
I'll come to you with a mic.

00:48:16.038 --> 00:48:18.300
And I'll start us
off with a question.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.280
You talked about the
"Cinderella" story,

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:25.490
and how that was given to
a young girl by a woman.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:27.990
So obviously we receive these
stories quite differently now.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.600
We see them en masse on film.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.490
How does that change
the way we receive

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.910
the story when we're not getting
it woman to woman or father

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:36.630
to son?

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:38.088
MARINA WARNER:
Well, there has been

00:48:38.088 --> 00:48:40.170
a return, actually,
to women's presence

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.720
in the fairy tale transmission.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.110
I mean, "Maleficent" was
produced by Angelina Jolie,

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.920
and the script is, I think,
by Linda Woolverton, who did

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.610
"Beauty and the Beast" as well.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:53.460
So there's been a recognition
within the industry

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.365
that actually--

00:48:54.365 --> 00:48:58.610
and it's not just for reasons
of the are women coming up.

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.110
It's actually women being
identified with that genre,

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:04.800
and wishing to rewrite
it themselves in order

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.850
to transform it.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:10.350
I mean, I was pleased that I
have some men in the audience,

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:13.230
because normally when I
speak about fairy tales,

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.730
it's almost always women.

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:20.409
And there's a very strong
feeling for the relationship

00:49:20.409 --> 00:49:21.450
of fairy tales and women.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:25.950
And it's partly that it's one
of the main literary bodies

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:28.580
of work in which women
feature prominently.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.590
I mean, the characters--

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:34.680
the prince character
is often not

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.440
very colorful, and rather dim.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.770
So there's more interest in
the women's characters, even

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:41.870
the malignant women.

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:45.086
There's a real-- in the same
way as in Greek myths, too.

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:46.710
Women are attracted
to the Greek myths,

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:50.160
because they're full of women,
full of different scenarios

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.330
around women.

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.300
I mean, Medea is a great
favorite with women directors

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:54.930
and actors.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:03.540
So but the other aspect is sort
of in a sense less positive,

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.870
and it's also a
problem of the web,

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:09.420
and that is that there's
a sort of homogenization,

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.350
because you're not speaking
in particular to a group.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:14.250
You're speaking more widely.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:17.950
So you need to please
kind of too many people,

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.760
or to please a particular
group without actually

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.840
troubling them.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:32.226
So the mass audience creates
a difference of specificity.

00:50:32.226 --> 00:50:33.600
There is a
"Cinderella" variant--

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.250
a "Donkeyskin" variant, which
actually shows this quite

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:41.340
clearly, which is it was
collected by an anthropologist

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.180
from a very poor part
of Spain, Extremadura.

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.470
And in the "Donkeyskin" version,
she doesn't wear a donkey skin.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:52.020
She wears a pelican skin.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:57.480
And he couldn't understand
why this heroine is disguised

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.510
as a Pelican, because
there are absolutely

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.700
no pelicans in Spain.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.460
And then when he went
there to do his--

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.670
I mean, he realized that the
endemic illness in the area

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.650
was goiter.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:15.810
So in this story, she is loved
in spite of being a donkey--

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:19.500
or wearing a smelly,
horrible, filthy, donkey skin.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:24.110
The prince recognizes her true
beauty underneath her disguise.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:28.860
And in Extremadura, this
pelican-disguised girl

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:33.330
is also recognized in the story
for her beauty and goodness

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.010
beneath her dark
pelican skin, which

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:40.350
of course is standing in
for the illness of goiter

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.542
in that particular area.

00:51:42.542 --> 00:51:44.250
It wouldn't work if
you put it in a film,

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.700
because it wouldn't make
the same particular sense.

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:52.290
AUDIENCE: I think you began to
touch on it just now already,

00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:54.300
but how do kind of
myths and legends--

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.510
are they seen as
separate to fairy tales,

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:00.880
or are they seen as sort of the
male power versions of the more

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.640
domestic fairy tale issues.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.840
How do they interrelate?

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.215
MARINA WARNER: Yes, I mean,
one of the main differences--

00:52:06.215 --> 00:52:07.470
there are obviously overlaps.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:11.370
And as I said, I think,
there's a tendency now,

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:16.740
a trend that the fairytale
mode is becoming more mythical.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.470
But one of the
main differences is

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.330
that the characters
in fairy tales

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.580
are humans with some magic.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.520
They're not gods.

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.150
And the other is that while
there were some people

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:32.040
in different
cultures who believe

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.430
in some of the supernatural
elements in fairy tales,

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:39.870
on the whole, they are not
connected to official religion.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.760
I mean that's a fairly--

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.170
sort of rule of thumb.

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:44.760
I mean, the jinn
are in the Quran,

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.770
so the jinn actually
should be believed,

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:50.130
whereas the fairies
are not in the Bible,

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.520
so we don't have to believe
in them according to doctrine.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.440
But there have been
communities that

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.602
certainly believed in fairies,
and still do probably.

00:52:59.602 --> 00:53:01.185
I mean, I think there
are quite a lot.

00:53:01.185 --> 00:53:02.790
Like witches are
sort of coming back.

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:03.748
People believe in them.

00:53:03.748 --> 00:53:09.390
So there are aspects that
are connected to real belief,

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.950
but on the whole, the fairy
tale is a space of unbelief.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.090
It's a space of imagination.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:21.210
You're not requested to
consent to its structures.

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.810
That's pretty different.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:28.020
I mean, with Greek myths, we
don't consent to the Olympians

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:32.790
anymore, but they
did in the past.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.690
AUDIENCE: If I
understood you right,

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:39.300
I think you said earlier
that we had for a period

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.320
lost the ability to
tell fairy tales,

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.340
or to create new fairy tales,
but that it was coming back.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.048
I was just wondering
if you could tell us

00:53:46.048 --> 00:53:47.460
why you thought that was.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.860
MARINA WARNER: Well, it's
very complicated and difficult

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.010
to understand, because the
Romantics were very interested

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:53.850
in fairy tales.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:58.140
I mean, the "Lyrical Ballads,"
Wordsworth and Coleridge,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.370
contains poems they
wrote because they'd

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:05.760
collected some of the oral
traditions in Scotland and so

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.260
forth.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.360
So if you think of a famous
poem like La Belle Dame

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.960
sans Merci, in which the
night is palely loitering,

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.370
and meets a fairy by
a lake who kisses him,

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.690
and takes him into her world.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:18.260
I mean, this is a fairy tale.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.500
So but at exactly the
same time, the fairy

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.750
tales began falling down
the ladder of esteem,

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:29.730
and became associated
with children.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.060
It was partly an
effect of the market,

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.900
because there was a rise
in children who could read.

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.300
The rise of the bourgeoisie
in Victorian England

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.250
meant that more
children could read.

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:44.550
And there was a market, and some
of these beautiful books that

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.410
were made were made
were children--

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:49.710
elite children whose parents
could afford these nice books.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.635
So but that put it
into a kind of niche.

00:54:52.635 --> 00:54:56.580
And in that niche
was the romantic idea

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.400
that the imagination was
the property of the child.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.085
When Wordsworth wrote, not
in entire forgetfulness,

00:55:02.085 --> 00:55:05.640
and not in utter nakedness,
but trailing clouds of glory

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.970
do we come.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.900
A child as a sort of
marvelous creature

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.540
full of connections to other
worlds and imagination.

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.680
But that made it childish.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.280
And also, we were
very strongly then

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.280
sort of encouraged
or enjoined not

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.260
to yield to fantasy
and imagination,

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.050
that we, adults,
should be rational,

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.960
and we should be objective,
and we should assess evidence.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.460
You, know all this
stuff about fairy

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:35.400
lands and things was
nonsense, and it was only

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.870
fit for children.

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:41.700
So it fell under a huge kind
of cloud of incomprehension,

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.830
because you don't have
to think of this as--

00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:48.540
it's a way of thinking.

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.300
Thinking with the imagination
is a way of thinking.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.850
It's not to be dismissed.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.530
It's probably essential.

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:57.170
It's probably inevitable.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:59.290
There's also essential.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:03.150
Because you have
to model thought.

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:05.970
I mean, they've now discovered
with lots of cognitive studies

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.420
that the imagination is
not separate from reason

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:09.940
in the brain.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:15.605
The same synapses fire
if I say to you, lady--

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.700
that is a wonderful line.

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:25.410
A unicorn sat under
a juniper tree.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:29.510
If I say, a lady with a unicorn
sat under a juniper tree,

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:31.660
you bring it up in
your mind's eye.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.530
And when you're doing that, it's
the same as if I say to you,

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:36.810
I met your mother last week.

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:40.020
Your mother comes up
in your mind's eye,

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.620
and you assemble it
with me in your mind,

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.170
but you're using
the same faculties.

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:47.900
The same place fires.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:56.650
So thinking models thought
using imaginative powers.

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:59.150
You're looking--

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:01.400
AUDIENCE: I think that's
really interesting on--

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.740
so you think maybe the
invention of childhood

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.190
in the Georgian and
Victorian periods

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.050
compartmentalized
different kinds of stories

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:11.930
as belonging to different
kinds of imaginative domains.

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:14.027
But why then are fairy
tales coming back?

00:57:14.027 --> 00:57:15.860
Is it something to do
with adults reclaiming

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:18.240
childhood for themselves?

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.200
MARINA WARNER: Well there
has been a lot of very, very

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.030
powerful work on play.

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:25.680
I mean, Winnicott,
wrote very powerfully

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.380
on the development of
children, and the capacity

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:35.000
to play in order for
them to become fully

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.750
achieved adults, has this has
been a cornerstone of Piaget,

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:44.090
of Winnicott, of Melanie Klein.

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:46.570
And I don't think people
have overturned that at all.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.370
Now, Adam Phillips has written
about this very importantly.

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:53.260
I mean-- and I think, you
know, you have this ethos here,

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:59.210
because in order to think up the
projects that are new thinking,

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:00.815
it requires play.

00:58:00.815 --> 00:58:04.380
You can't just stick to
what's already known.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:13.070
So I think there's been a
recuperation, re-evaluation,

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:16.730
a trans-valuation of
fantasy and imagination.

00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:19.610
They're slightly different,
but nevertheless,

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:21.170
the two contiguous, contingent.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:25.790
But there are attendant dangers.

00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:28.190
I mean, the people who
insist on objectivity

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:32.360
and so forth, they
have identified

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:38.972
a danger, which is we can't
live entirely in imagination.

00:58:38.972 --> 00:58:40.305
What exactly needs to be tested?

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.780
I mean, just the
great task of our time

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:53.790
is to how to inspire people
to question what they imagine,

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:56.690
and what they think,
but not by using

00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:03.230
only the yardstick of
objective verification,

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:07.892
because that will just trap
us in what we already know.
