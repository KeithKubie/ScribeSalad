00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:09.197
They call me the tornado chaser.

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:11.716
When the wind is up 
and conditions are right,

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:15.159
I get in my car and follow violent storms.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:20.259
"Crazy," you say? Perhaps, but really I
chase these sky beasts to learn about them.

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.837
I want to share with you what I know.

00:00:22.837 --> 00:00:27.730
Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns
of air that form inside storms

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.874
that connect with the ground via
a funnel of cloud.

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:33.382
When that happens, 
they tear across the Earth,

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:36.521
posing a huge threat to life and property.

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:40.258
Because of this, there's a great deal
of research into these phenomena,

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:44.986
but the truth is, there's still a lot
we don't know about how tornadoes form.

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:47.371
The conditions that may 
give rise to one tornado

00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:50.188
won't necessarily cause another.

00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:54.466
But we have learned a lot since
people first started recording tornadoes,

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:58.593
like how to recognize the signs
when one is brewing in the sky.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:00.579
Are you coming along for the ride?

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.035
Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm
but not just any thunderstorm.

00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:09.854
These are especially powerful, towering
thunderstorms called supercells.

00:01:09.854 --> 00:01:13.698
Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,
they bring high force winds,

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:19.444
giant hailstones, sometimes flooding
and great flashes of lightning, too.

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:22.329
These are the kinds of storms
that breed tornadoes,

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.328
but only if there are also very
specific conditions in place,

00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:31.217
clues that we can measure and look out for
when we're trying to forecast a storm.

00:01:31.217 --> 00:01:35.495
Rising air is the first ingredient needed
for a tornado to develop.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.261
Any storm is formed 
when condensation occurs,

00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:40.361
the byproducts of the clouds.

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.392
Condensation releases heat,

00:01:42.392 --> 00:01:46.676
and heat becomes the energy that drives
huge upward drafts of air.

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:50.021
The more condensation
and the bigger the storm clouds grow,

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:52.808
the more powerful those updrafts become.

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:57.369
In supercells, this rising airmass 
is particularly strong.

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.957
As the air climbs, it can change direction
and start to move more quickly.

00:02:01.957 --> 00:02:05.037
Finally, at the storm's base,
if there is a lot of moisture,

00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.781
a huge cloud base develops,
giving the tornado

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:11.451
something to feed off later,
if it gets that far.

00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:15.574
When all these things are in place,
a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm,

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:20.520
and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning
air that then gets pulled upwards.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.844
We call this a mesocyclone.

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:25.277
Outside, cool, dry, sinking air

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:28.106
starts to wrap around the back of
this mesocyclone,

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.229
forming what's known as a
rear flank downdraft.

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.547
This unusual scenario creates 
a stark temperature difference

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:38.539
between the air inside the mesocyclone,
and the air outside,

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.680
building up a level of instability
that allows a tornado to thrive.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.558
Then, the mesocyclone's lower part
becomes tighter,

00:02:45.558 --> 00:02:48.240
increasing the speed of the wind.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.539
If, and that's a big if,
this funnel of air moves down

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.412
into that large, moist cloud base
at the bottom of the parent storm,

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:58.990
it sucks it in and turns it 
into a rotating wall of cloud,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.826
forming a link between 
the storm that created it and the Earth.

00:03:02.826 --> 00:03:05.406
The second that tube of
spinning cloud touches the ground,

00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:07.628
it becomes a tornado.

00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:13.359
Most are small and short-lived,
producing winds of 65-110 miles per hour,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.609
but others can last for over an hour,
producing 200 mile per hour winds.

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.030
They are beautiful but terrifying,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.335
especially if you or 
your town is in its path.

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:27.700
In that case, no one,
not even tornado chasers like me,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.765
enjoy watching thing unfold.

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:34.578
Just like everything, however,
tornadoes do come to an end.

00:03:34.578 --> 00:03:38.266
When the temperature difference disappears
and conditions grow more stable,

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:40.214
or the moisture in the air dries up,

00:03:40.214 --> 00:03:45.641
the once fierce parent storm loses
momentum and draws its tornado back inside.

00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:50.485
Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers
like me will remain on the lookout,

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:55.800
watching, always watching to see
if the storm releases its long rope again.
