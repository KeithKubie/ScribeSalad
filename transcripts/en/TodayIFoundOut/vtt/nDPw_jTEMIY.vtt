00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.790
Less like sleep and more like suspended animation,
most fish species do spend some time resting.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.310
And like us, if they don’t put in enough
downtime, they try to make up for it later.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.590
Sleep has a simple definition that includes
closed eyelids and a particular brainwave

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.369
pattern in the neocortex; as a result, it’s
relatively easy for researchers to determine

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.400
when a person, another mammal or a bird is
asleep.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.710
This definition is problematic, however, when
it comes to fish, since they have neither

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.230
a neocortex nor eyelids.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:45.400
As such, researchers have to rely on behavior
observation to determine when they’re napping.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.450
Typically when a fish is “sleeping,” four
characteristics are observed: (1) inactivity

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.440
for a long time; (2) a resting posture (like
a droopy tail); (3) a routine (like resting

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.680
at the same time, and in the same manner,
each day); and (4) decreased sensitivity to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.790
its environment (hard to arouse).

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.610
Different species of fish snooze in different
ways.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.310
For example, tilapia have been observed resting
at the bottom of their habitats, while brown

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.719
bullhead catfish were found napping at a 10-30
degree angle along the bottom, with their

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.420
tails flat and fins stretched out.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.240
In addition, some species of bass and perch
were seen sleeping on or under logs, while

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.520
fish around a coral reef often hide in its
crevices at night

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.070
In many fish species, during this period of
rest, lower cardiac and respiratory rates

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.020
are observed, as are decreased mouth, gill
and eye movements.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.639
For several, like the bluehead and requiem
shark, the decreased sensitivity to disturbance

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:44.740
is so profound that researchers have been
able to pick them up and haul them toward

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.600
the water’s surface without stirring any
reaction.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.679
Interestingly, some fish species never seem
to sleep.

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.799
Both mackerel and bluefish swim constantly,
and although they swim less at night than

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.579
during the daytime, they remain responsive
to stimuli 24-7.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.369
Another night-owl, the California horn shark,
is far more active at night, although even

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.619
during the day it remains responsive to disturbances.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.349
Others that never seem to sleep, but may actually
catch 40 winks now and then, include many

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.280
fish that live in large schools.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.939
One theory holds that while some members of
the group have their eyes peeled, others are

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.439
able to enter a kind of daydreaming restful
state.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.610
Other fish don’t give any signs of sleeping
when they’re young, but develop a sleep

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.379
pattern once they reach adulthood; still others
that normally sleep at night, like the tautog,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.810
suspend any signs of sleeping during periods
of migration and spawning.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.129
Some chichlids and threespine sticklebacks
will forego sleep while their eggs are incubating

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.650
– not necessarily to protect them, but to
fan them (thereby providing a continuous supply

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.370
of oxygen to the brood).

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.370
Some species of sleep-loving fish will work
to catch up on lost sleep.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.450
In a 2007 study, several researchers ruthlessly
pestered a group of zebrafish by alternately

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.859
tapping on the aquarium and even piping noise
in through an underwater loudspeaker.

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.690
Completely deprived of sleep during their
normal 6 hour dark period, the next day, the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.719
researchers left the tank dark and observed
that the zebrafish were significantly harder

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.580
to arouse, and their normal mouth and gill
movements had been cut in half.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.150
Tapping on tanks seems to be a popular method
with fish-sleep researchers, and in 2011,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.410
some NYU biologists used the technique to
determine that cave fish don’t sleep much

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.400
when compared with their surface-dwelling
neighbors.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.370
Observing four species of fish all indigenous
to northeast Mexico, a surface-fish species,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.000
Astyanax mexicanu, as well as three cave-dwellers,
Pachón, Tinaja and Molino, the scientists

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.659
discovered that the surface fish slept about
4 times more than cave fish (800 minutes in

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.159
24 hours compared with 110-250).

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.500
Easily as seemingly sadistic (to those of
us who love sleep) as the zebrafish researchers,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.900
the NYU biologists also experimented with
depriving the Mexican fish of sleep – by

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.889
moving their containers once every minute.

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.290
Sure enough, the fish lost sleep, and like
their zebrafish cousins, they caught up on

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.849
it by sleeping more the next day.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.629
Seeking to learn why the cave fish sleep less,
the scientists with the 2011 study then bred

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.490
cave fish with surface fish (to observe any
inherited sleep characteristics).

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.099
Remarkably, each hybrid inherited the cave
fish’s need for less sleep, and as a result,

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.189
the researchers concluded there is a genetic
basis that regulates sleep, and the cave fish’s

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.930
gene (requiring less sleep) was dominant.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.779
After a review of over 300 scientific publications,
a panel of 18 scientists and researchers including

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:20.620
representatives of the American Physiological
Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, American

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.110
Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics
Society, prepared a list of new sleep recommendations

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.009
for the National Sleep Foundation.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:34.160
They concluded that newborns should optimally
get 14-17 hours of sleep each day, infants

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.449
12-15, toddlers 11-14, preschool kids 10-13,
grammar school kids 9-11, teenagers 8-10,

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:58.460
adults (aged 18-64) 7-9, and older

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.139
adults 7-8.
