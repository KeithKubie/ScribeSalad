00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:01.370
TONY PADILLA: What's
going on in London?

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.250
Well, I don't know just some
small event known as the

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.370
Olympic Games is going on
at London at the moment.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.210
Last night.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.450
In particular, there was a
100-meter final and Usain Bolt

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.180
winning it in 9.63 seconds.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.410
Well, it was a little bit less,
really, if you include

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
some of the relativistic effects
from Einstein's theory

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.520
of relativity.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.150
So I guess that's what we're
going to talk about.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.610
All right.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.930
So do you want me to draw
a picture of race?

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.730
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.480
TONY PADILLA: OK.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.170
I'll do my best.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.689
So of course, you've got--

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.490
Here we are at the Olympic
stadium in London.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.600
There's my racetrack.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.270
It's 100 meters long.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.840
The guys start down
here, right?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.060
And then they run there
along the tracks.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.190
Let's say this is Tyson
Gay or something.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.420
And then somewhere out
in front of him,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.720
we've got Usain Bolt.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.070
So Usain Bolt in front, and a
bunch of the other guys sort

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.630
of en route.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.160
So Usain Bolt went past the
finishing line in 9.63

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.370
seconds, according to
the stadium clock.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.500
So let's make that clear,
the stadium clock.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.830
Now, what I want you to imagine
is that Usain Bolt--

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.700
this is Usain here--

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.570
has got a little watch on.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.570
So this is his watch.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.060
So this is Usain Bolt's clock.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.550
Well, what did Usain Bolt's
clock read at the point moment

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.940
he crossed the finishing line?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.220
Now, you might think, well,
it's 9.63 seconds.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.220
But it's not.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.560
It's actually a little
bit less than that.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.130
It's 9.63 seconds less about
more or less five millionths

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.910
of a nanosecond.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.480
So he actually clocked according
to his clock, five

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.070
millionths of a nanosecond less
than the stadium clock,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.290
less than this 9.63 seconds.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.590
OK.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.140
So a nanosecond is 10 to
the minus 9 seconds.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990
So if you do it in the American
billions, that's a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.570
billionth of a second.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.150
And then it's a millionth
of that billionth.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.360
Naught point naught
naught, naught--

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.560
that's three naughts.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.690
Naught, naught, naught,
naught, naught.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.250
We've got 12.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.110
I've got four, five, six,
seven, eight nine.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.370
So Usain Bolt, if you actually
looked at his watch, it would

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.840
have read this.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:29.260
It would have read
9.629999999999995.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.540
Well, this is all because of
special relativity, Einstein's

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.590
theory of special relativity.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.850
So what was the key thing
about Einstein's theory?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.580
A lot of people say it's the
oh, you can't travel faster

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.280
than light.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.680
And that's true, but
that's not the most

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680
important thing about it.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.660
The most important thing about
it is that everybody agrees

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.550
that light travels at about 300
million meters per second

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.810
in a vacuum.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.820
That's the most important thing,
that everybody agrees

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.480
on that, no matter whether
they're moving

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.280
relative to it or not.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.750
So this really changes how you
think about velocities and how

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.740
you think about timing in a
really fundamental way.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.930
And so to illustrate that,
imagine you're going along the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.790
motor way, and you're going in
a car at 70 miles an hour.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.970
And The guy is going in the
opposite direction at 70 miles

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.480
an hour relative to
the road as well.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.750
Then you would say, what's
the relative speed of you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.305
to the other car.

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:25.070
And you'd say, well, what
would you say it is?

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.460
BRADY HARAN: 140.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.120
TONY PADILLA: 140.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.560
That's what most people
would answer to that.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.390
But actually, that's
not quite right.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.820
That's almost right.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.385
It's a little bit
less than 140.

00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:35.830
And to see that it can't quite
be the right answer, consider

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.930
what would happen if the
car was going along at

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.150
the speed of light.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.060
Then you would be saying what's
our relative speed?

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.340
Well, is it the speed of light
plus 70 miles per hour?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.493
Well, no.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.550
It can't be, because everybody
agrees that something that

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.635
goes goes at the speed
of light goes at the

00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:51.390
speed speed of light.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.080
So you've clearly got to change
what you think about

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.760
velocities, what you
think about time.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.960
So what actually happens when
somebody is moving relative to

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.950
something else is that their
clock slows down, and it slows

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.860
down by a particular factor.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.570
So if we were to work out what
Usain Bolt's time is, tbolt.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.900
And we were to compare
it to tstadium.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.570
This is a time measured by
Usain Bolt on his clock.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.150
This is the time measured
by the stadium clock,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.730
which is this one.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.690
And they differ by a factor.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.820
They're not the same.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.130
They differ by this factor.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.950
It's square root of 1 minus
v squared over c squared.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.600
Now, v here is Usain Bolt's
speed relative to the track.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.560
And c, of course, is
the speed of light.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.630
So this is a very small number,
this v squared over c

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.480
squared, but it's not zero.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.930
And these would only be
equal if it were zero.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.040
So what we can do is if we want
to get this approximation

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.210
that we've got here, well, we
do a little sort of bit of

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.300
mathematical trick here.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.780
We do what's called a Taylor
expansion on this thing,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.090
because this system
is very small.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.320
It's v squared over c squared.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.830
So we can do a Taylor expansion,
and we can

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.330
approximate this by 1 minus a
half v squared over c squared

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.580
times tstadium.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.190
I'm going to have to look
it up now, aren't I?

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.410
So I'm going to put that in.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.690
So that's 299792458.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.937
That's probably not exact
values, but you're going to

00:05:27.937 --> 00:05:28.920
have to make do with that.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.210
4, 5, 8.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.840
5.77 times 10 to the minus 15.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.320
When I did this, I did this
sort of essentially, very

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.010
quickly, approximating things.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.870
But actually, maybe I should
have done it a bit more

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.380
accurately and this should
be a 7, 8 there.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.390
So this is the number that Usain
Bolt actually ran the

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:57.730
time that he clocked on his
watch, which is 9.62999999--

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.460
how many 9's have I got--

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.636
422 seconds.

00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:05.170
And that's the time that
he actually would have

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.490
clocked on his clock.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.760
Now, there is actually something
even more remarkable

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.180
about this when you actually
think about the implication.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.540
You could ask the question
the question.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.950
So he's running it in a shorter
time it would seem.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.150
Does that mean he ran
faster in some way?

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.480
Is that the implication?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.710
And no, it doesn't mean that,
because the laws of relativity

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.720
don't allow that.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.720
Basically, Usain Bolt's running
at roughly 10 meters

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.490
per second relative
to the track.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.840
And just by the laws of
relativity, the track is

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.320
moving at about 10 meters per
second relative to Usain Bolt,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.680
which is completely
equivalent.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.030
So there is no change
in their speeds.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.460
So what's changing, then?

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.360
Well, actually, the answer
is even more remarkable.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.820
The answer is that from Usain
Bolt's perspective, that track

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.430
is moving, and then because
that track is moving, it

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.320
actually shrinks a little bit
from his perspective by about

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.890
50 millionths of a nanometer.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.020
So he clocks a shorter time
basically because the track

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.640
shrunk a little bit for him.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.880
So you could say that he didn't
complete 100 meters.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.494
They should take his
metal off him.

00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:15.160
JOHN HUNTON: --and each one
goes outside one ring and

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.220
inside the other as
you go around.
