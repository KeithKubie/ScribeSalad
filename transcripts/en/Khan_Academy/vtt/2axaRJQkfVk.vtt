00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.050
We're now on part c. "Evaluate
the definite integral

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.850
from 0 to 10 of
H prime of (t)dt.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.060
Using correct units,
explain the meaning

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.150
of the expression in the
context of this problem."

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.140
So we know that if we
just want to evaluate

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.070
this definite integral from
0 to 10 of H prime of (t)dt,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.640
this is just the same thing as
evaluating the anti-derivative

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.120
of this thing right over here,
which is just H of t at 10.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.430
And subtract from that the
anti-derivative of this

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.550
evaluated at 0.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.930
This is the second fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.984
This is exactly how we
evaluate definite integrals.

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:35.400
And when you look
at it from this,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.590
you just see that
when you evaluate it,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.110
it just gives us the
difference in temperature

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.560
from 0 minutes to 10 minutes.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.309
We're taking the
temperature at 10 minutes

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.140
and from that we're subtracting
from that the temperature at 0

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.670
minutes.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.810
So this is really our
change in temperature

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.357
over those 10 minutes.

00:00:55.357 --> 00:00:56.690
And we can actually evaluate it.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.080
We know what our temperature
was after 10 minutes.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.400
H of 10 is 43 degrees Celsius.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.769
So this is 43 right over here.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.440
And from that, we're
going to subtract

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.280
our initial temperature,
our temperature

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.140
at 0 minutes, which
is 66 degrees Celsius.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.220
We're going to subtract
66 degrees Celsius.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.150
This gives us negative
23 degrees Celsius.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.560
So our change in temperature
is negative 23 degrees.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.960
Or our temperature has gone
down 23 degrees Celsius

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.600
over the course of
the first 10 minutes.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.290
So that is part c
right over there.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.500
Now, let's do part d.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.475
"At time t equals 0, biscuits
with temperature 100 degrees

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:40.600
were removed from an oven."

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.099
So now we're talking
about biscuits.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:43.710
We started with
tea, now biscuits.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.500
"The temperature of
the biscuits at time t

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.320
is modeled by a
differentiable function

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.270
B, for which it is
known that B prime of t"

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.450
is equal to this
business right over here.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.410
"Using the given
models at time t

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.800
equals 10, how much cooler are
the biscuits than the tea?"

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.050
Well, we know what the
temperature of the tea is.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.591
So we just have to figure out
the temperature of the biscuits

00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:04.930
to figure out how much
cooler they are than the tea.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.013
And to figure out the
temperature of the biscuits,

00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:09.860
we can essentially just
use the exact same idea.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.250
We can say, we know that
the biscuits started off

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.040
at 100 degrees Celsius.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.570
And we could say, well, how
much did they cool down?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.210
Or what was their
change in temperature

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.359
over the 10 minutes?

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.900
If we know the change
in temperature,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.691
and we know it started
at 100 degrees, then

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:24.590
we can use that
information to get

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.390
what its temperature
is at 10 minutes.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.200
And then we can
answer their question.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.400
So the change in temperature
over those 10 minutes

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.190
is just the definite
integral from 0 to 10

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.835
of this business
right over here.

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:36.710
Let me just write it.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.370
So you see it's the
exact same pattern

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.749
as what we saw over here.

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.790
This was for the cookies.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.840
Now we're talking
about the biscuits.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.830
And this right
over here is going

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.680
to be the definite
integral from 0 to 10.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.400
B prime of t-- they give
it to us right over here--

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:00.490
is negative 13.84e to
the negative 0.173t, dt.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.110
And now we just evaluate this.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.840
Well, we can evaluate this.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.620
What we'd have to
is-- because we

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.791
know the derivative of e
to the a x is a e to the x.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:12.540
Let me write that.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.049
The derivative of e to the
ax is equal to ae to the ax,

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.090
just from the chain rule.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.234
Derivative of the
inside is just a.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.150
And then we multiply
that times the derivative

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.050
of the entire thing.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.650
And derivative of e to
the x is just e to the x.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.110
Or we could say that the
integral of e to the ax dx

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.742
is equal to 1 over a
e to the ax plus c.

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:36.450
And you could take
the derivative of this

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.230
to see that you would
get this right over here.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.100
So using that same idea,
the anti-derivative

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.880
of this over here is just
going to be the negative 13.84.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.130
And we're going to divide
by this coefficient on the t

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.210
right over here.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.814
So negative 0.173.

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:56.230
And you could use
your calculator.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.438
Calculators are allowed for
this part of the problem.

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.900
But we could do
this analytically.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:08.340
Times e to the
negative 0.173 times t.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.662
We're going to evaluate
that from 0 to 10.

00:04:11.662 --> 00:04:13.120
So we're going to
evaluate it at 10

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.819
and subtract from that
this thing evaluated at 0.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.019
Let me just factor out
this part right over here.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.800
So it's going to be negative
13.84 over negative 0.173

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.720
times this evaluated
at when t is 10.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.720
So e to the-- if we
multiply this times 10--

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.460
this is negative 1.73.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.110
That's when I
evaluated it at 10.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.040
And from that we
want to subtract

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.440
when this is evaluated at 0.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.180
If the exponent here is 0, if t
is 0, the whole exponent is 0.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.980
So e to the 0 power
is just equal to 1.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.590
And now we can get
our calculator out

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.512
to evaluate this.

00:04:53.512 --> 00:04:57.212
So I'll get my TI-85 out.

00:04:57.212 --> 00:04:59.670
I'm just going to evaluate this
inner expression right over

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.169
here.

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:07.150
So e to the negative 1.73.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.180
And from that I
want to subtract 1.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.900
So that gives me negative 0.822.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.570
So that's this part
in parentheses.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.410
And then I want to multiply it
times what I have out front.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.222
So my previous
answer times-- and I

00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:26.680
won't write the negatives just
because the negative divided

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.263
by negative is going
to be a positive.

00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:38.455
So it's just 13.84
divided by 0.173.

00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:39.830
And I didn't write
the negatives,

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.270
because they just cancel out.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.860
And that gives me
negative 65.817.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.170
So this is our change in
temperature for the biscuits.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.915
It's our change in temperature.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:50.790
Let me write it down.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.130
Negative 65.82 degrees.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.290
So this is negative
65.82 degrees Celsius.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.080
This is our change in
temp for the biscuits.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.460
Now we know that they
started off at 100 degrees,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.450
and they went down by 65.82
degrees over the 10 minutes.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.980
They started at
100, and then they

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.550
went down by this
previous amount.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.770
So, whoops.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.920
I want to subtract the answer.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.450
So minus the answer.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.124
Oh, sorry.

00:06:21.124 --> 00:06:23.165
I want to actually add
the change in temperature.

00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:24.490
I want to be very careful here.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.100
It went down by 65 degrees.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:36.210
So I really should just
say 100 minus 65.817.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.830
I could keep adding
digits if I want.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.750
247, that's enough.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.140
So after 10 minutes the
biscuits are 34.18 degrees.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:50.420
And we already knew what
the temperature of the tea

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.570
is after 10 minutes.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.805
We already knew
it was 43 degrees.

00:06:53.805 --> 00:07:00.100
So the biscuits
are at 34 degrees.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.440
The tea is at 43 degrees.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.370
So if we do 43 is
where the tea is, then

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.230
we subtract the temperature
of the biscuits,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.360
we see that the biscuits
are 8.82 degrees cooler.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.530
8.82 degrees Celsius cooler.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.660
So we could say the biscuits
are 8.82 degrees Celsius cooler

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.190
than the tea.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.180
And we're done with
part d as well.
