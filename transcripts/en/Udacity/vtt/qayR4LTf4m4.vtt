00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You might remember for P = 0.5 then you go to the truth table, you’ll find the answer is 0.375.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you set P to 0.8, the number actually goes down at 0.096.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, you can check the implementation to see if you get the exact the same numbers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, here’s my result--when you build the truth table,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you’ll find that exact the 3 possible outcomes have had exactly once; it’s H T T, T H T, and T T H.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, of the 8 possible outcomes of the coin flips, those 3 are the ones you want to count.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, each has exactly the same probability of P for heads x (1 - P) x (1 - P).

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, to get all 3 of them together, we just multiply these by 3.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And this is how it looks in the source code 3 x P x (1 - P) x (1 - P) if,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
for example, I give this input 0.8, then I get 0.096 as an answer.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But if you never programmed before and you got this fight, then congratulations!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You might actually be a programmer.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Obviously, if you programmed before, this should relatively straightforward but it’s fun to practice.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.001
Let’s now go to a case where we have 2 coins.
