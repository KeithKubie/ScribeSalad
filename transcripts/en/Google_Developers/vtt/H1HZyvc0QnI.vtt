00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.460
But first, our
CEO, Sundar Pichai,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.572
kicks things off with
the Google Keynote.

00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:38.030

joining us to break down

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.360
all the major announcements.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What do you say?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.500
Should we get the
festival started?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.625
EMILY FORTUNA: Let's do it.

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:47.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Welcome,
everyone, to I/O 2019.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.555
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.540
It's finally here.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.590
Google I/O 2019 is
officially underway.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.710
Hi, everyone.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590
Thanks for joining
us on I/O Live.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.428
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:11.970
EMILY FORTUNA: And
I'm Emily Fortuna.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.930
If you can't be here this
week at I/O, don't worry.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.030
We're here for you.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.660

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.648
and sessions, plus all the
exclusive interviews and demos

00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:25.940
our team of Googlers will be
bringing you over the next

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.020
three days.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.228
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We've lined
up several special guests

00:01:29.228 --> 00:01:31.580
to help us deep dive into
today's major announcements.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.770
First up, we welcome
Manuel Bronstein,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.230
VP of product management
here at Google,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.180
to talk to us about the next
generation Google Assistant.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.440
Manuel, thanks for joining us.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.960
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Thanks
for having me here.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
let's go really big picture

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.120
for a moment.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.700
When you think about how
the Google Assistant changes

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.408
people's everyday lives for the
better, what does it look like?

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:52.950
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Yeah, so when
we thought about the product,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620
we wanted to--

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.600
our mission is to be the
best way to get things done.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.740
And when we say best, we
think about seamless, fastest,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.333
easiest way to get things done.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.250
And if you think about
our world, in some ways

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.412
it's getting more complex.

00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:06.870
Every time you try
to do something,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.078
you need to think about not
only what you want to do,

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:10.020
but the how.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.200
And if we do our
job right and we're

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.080
investing to make it happen,
you want to be able to go from,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.420
what do I want to
get done, to getting

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.480
it done without having to worry
about the how in many ways.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.970
And our hope is that
that saves you time.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.023
And we all know how
important it is for all of us

00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:27.440
to get a little bit more time
to do all the things that we

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440
care about.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.050
So we're very proud
to be investing

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.467
in making the
product the best way

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.078
to get things done, in many
ways, to give users time back.

00:02:34.078 --> 00:02:35.870
EMILY FORTUNA: So the
Assistant is becoming

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.190
more and more personalized.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.848
How does that help us as well?

00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:42.140
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: When people
think about an assistant,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.340
they're thinking
about a product that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.010
is going to learn from them,
that is going to understand

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.150
what they're saying.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.880
And in order for the system to
understand what you're saying,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.680
it needs to understand
your world, right?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.660
If I say "Call my
wife," it needs

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.700
to know that my wife is
[? Arianna ?] and what number

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.200
to call.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.530
If I say "Set an
appointment for my kids,"

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.390
it should understand
who my kids are.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.490
So when the system starts
getting to know you--

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.160
or it even knows where
is home, where is work--

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.660
so that I can
know, hey, when I'm

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.600
asking it to give me directions,
I say, "Drive me to work."

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.692
It can understand that.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.900
The system becomes more
useful, because you can speak

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.335
to it in a more natural way.

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:17.960
You don't have to
think about addresses

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.710
or you don't have to
think about commands.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.220
You speak to it the same way
you would speak to a friend,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.137
and then it will understand
what you're trying

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.178
to do and help you get it done.

00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:28.220
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What is
your favorite new feature

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.980
that Assistant announced
today, and why?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.590
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: It's really
hard to pick a favorite.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.965
The team worked really, really
hard on many of the things

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.070
that we announced today.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.590
I think that, when you
think about the promise

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.800
of the Assistant being the
best way to get things done--

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.763
when it starts
getting really fast.

00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:46.680
And what we announced
with the next generation

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.780
Assistant, one of the
key things about it--

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.040
and we're saying it in
a very proud way, which

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.970
is, imagine that it starts
understanding you so fast, so

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.900
quickly, that speaking to your
phone is faster than tapping,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.510
or that tapping your phone
is going to feel slow.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.790
That's when you know
that you hit something

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.800
that could change
user behavior and get

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.130
people to start embedding
themselves into this product.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.340
Because it's actually
becoming very simple, but also

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.500
very fast and very
efficient in helping you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.513
get your tasks done.

00:04:17.513 --> 00:04:18.680
EMILY FORTUNA: That's great.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.222
So in the past couple
of years, we've

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:23.270
seen Assistant play a
much larger role in homes

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.370
and phones, and now in driving.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.515
So can you tell us about
the experience for drivers

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:29.390
and what that's like?

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.470
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Yeah.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.040
When you think about using your
voice and being hands-free,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.950
actually, the car is a
perfect environment for it.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.870
Hopefully people are
driving, and they're

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.690
looking at the road, they're
not looking at their phones,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.800
they're not touching
the screens.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You don't
mean hands-free driving?

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.450
MANUEL BRONSTEIN:
Hands-free driving, no.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.908
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Your hand's on
the wheel, not on the phone.

00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:47.388
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Correct.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:49.430
So when you can think
about it, actually, the car

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.090
is one of the places where
the Assistant can be even more

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.770
helpful.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.360
But the car is a
hard environment,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.840
because if your windows are
down, there's a lot of noise,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.348
you may lose connectivity,
and so forth.

00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:03.890
But one of the things
that we started

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.103
thinking about is let's
start from the user,

00:05:06.103 --> 00:05:07.520
and what is that
thing that you're

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.310
trying to get done when
you're in your car?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.900
And there are
mainly three things.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.670
You're trying to
navigate from point A

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.710
to point B. You want
to get to the place,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.918
hopefully fast and safe.

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.210
You also want to make sure
that when you're in the car,

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.930
you can get
entertained, so you want

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.760
to listen to music
or podcasts or radio.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.630
And then, of course, you
sometimes want to communicate.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.880
You want to make a phone call.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.110
You want to receive a text
message or send a text message.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.295
And think about doing all
these things with your hands

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:37.170
while you're driving.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.878
It's probably not the
right way to do it.

00:05:38.878 --> 00:05:39.660
It's not safe.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.110
But when you start doing
each of these scenarios,

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.150
like driving from
point A to point B,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.800
communicating, or
listening to media,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.990
and you can control
that with your voice

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.510
and it understands exactly
what you're trying to get done,

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.160
then the product
becomes very magical,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.800
because it's really solving a
real need and a real problem

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.403
in an environment
that needs that help.

00:05:57.403 --> 00:05:58.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Can you talk to us

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.340
about how the next generation
of the Google Assistant

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.270
will change the way that
people interact with it?

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.530
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Yeah,
so if you think about--

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.490
when you start
forgetting about the how

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.160
and you start worrying about
what is it that you want to do,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.840
you start relying on the
product in a very different way.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.030
That's when a behavior
change starts to happen.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.190
So in the first phase
of the Assistant,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.160
it should be very
responsive to you.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.940
It should understand
what you're saying,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.980
and then help you get it done.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.260
As this product starts
learning from you,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.300
it can start getting
more proactive.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.160
So now when I get in my
car, it could flash to me

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.140
some missed calls or
voicemails that I have,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.670
so that if I want to return
that call, I'm reminded of that.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.070
Or if it knows that,
in my calendar,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.340
I have an appointment at 7:00
PM and it's 6:00 PM or 6:30

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.225
and I haven't left--

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:48.600
and it also knows
the information

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.990
about where I'm trying to
go and knows the traffic--

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.400
it could actually
send me a notification

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.650
and let me know, hey, you're
probably going to be late

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.970
if you don't leave now.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.770
And it's very interesting
when the product

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.720
starts getting more proactive.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.670
I think that we're
going to see a switch--

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.800
I see it a lot with my kids--

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.830
that, in the same way
that when the screens

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.930
became touch screens
and people felt

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.260
that every screen is touchable,
and you see a little kid,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.760
and they see an old
TV, and they try

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.920
to touch on the screen and
the screen doesn't work.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.420
I think that people
are going to get

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.240
used to talking
to their products

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.340
and expecting that the
product will understand

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.027
what you're saying in a natural
way and help you get it done.

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:27.110
And I think that we're
going to see that evolution

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.780
from basically understanding
your commands, what you want

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.610
to do and help you get
it done, to getting

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.260
very proactive, personal,
and more helpful,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.230
so anticipating your
needs and the things

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.890
that you're trying
to accomplish.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.510
EMILY FORTUNA: So you've got
Assistant on your phone, home,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.990
and now driving.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.563
Where do you see Assistants
going in the future?

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:46.230
MANUEL BRONSTEIN:
It's a great question.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.518
Look, I think that a personal
assistant needs to be with you.

00:07:50.518 --> 00:07:53.060
So, of course, a lot of the work
that the team has been doing

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.995
is making sure that the
product is available

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:56.120
where you need it the most.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.787
I don't know necessarily
that it's going

00:07:57.787 --> 00:07:59.870
to go to different places.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.350
At the end of the day, we
spend time in our homes,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.550
we spend time at work, we
spend time in our cars,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.170
we spend time with our phones--

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.330
maybe too much time
with our phones.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.730
But if the product can
always be with you,

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.980
then it can help you fulfill
some of those things.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.603
I think that, in the future,
what I'm hoping it helps--

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:18.020
if you think about
the areas where

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.780
people spend time trying
to get things done,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.020
but they wish that--

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.710
Think about it.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.653
When you want to
go to a restaurant,

00:08:26.653 --> 00:08:28.070
the act of going
to the restaurant

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.230
and having a nice
meal is awesome.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.158
Maybe calling to make a
reservation is not that great.

00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:35.450
But if the product can start
doing those things for you

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.620
and remove that load from you,
it becomes incredibly useful.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.870
So I think that if you think
about more of those tasks

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.640
that people are trying to get
done and help you anticipate

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.030
it, find that ticket
for an event for you

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.930
that you want to go to, making
that appointment for you,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.060
and getting predictive
about those things,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.570
then the product becomes
extremely magical.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Before you leave us,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.740
are there any hints you can
give us to find some Easter

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.760
eggs in the Assistant?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.718
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Sure.

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:05.120
We recently launched a new
voice for the Assistant

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.830
with John Legend.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.822
It's pretty cool.

00:09:07.822 --> 00:09:10.280
And if you ask, actually, if
you turn the voice to the John

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.905
Legend voice over
the Assistant and you

00:09:11.905 --> 00:09:14.360
ask it to sing a song for
you or sing "Happy Birthday,"

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.950
you want to hear John
Legend singing for you.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.910
And it's [INAUDIBLE]
pretty cool.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh,
I'm going to do that.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.710
EMILY FORTUNA: Thank
you, Manuel, so much,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.830
for sharing your insight.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.413
MANUEL BRONSTEIN:
So great to be here.

00:09:21.413 --> 00:09:23.913
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, it's
time for us to take a break.

00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:26.750
When we return, we'll be talking
about the new Google Pixel 3a

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.400
and 3a XL.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.090
We're here in Mountain
View, California,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.770
and you're watching I/O Live.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.032
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.480
EMILY FORTUNA: Joining us now
is Soniya Jobanputra, a product

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.188
manager at Google,
who is here to give us

00:09:53.188 --> 00:09:55.230
the 411 on those
sleek new phones.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.890
Hi, Soniya.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.150
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Hi, Emily.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.580
EMILY FORTUNA: So your team
has been amazingly busy

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.930
these past few months
getting out this new Pixel

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.370
to the lineup.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.480
What inspired you to
create this phone?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.160
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: When we
set out to do Pixel in 2016,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.200
we really set out to
do something different,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.990
to really bring radically
helpful hardware

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.988
to our consumers.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.780
And we thought we could
do that by bringing

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.417
the power of hardware,
software, and AI together.

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:19.500
And we still believe that.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.270
That's still our mission
with these devices.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.150
But with the benefit
of three years,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.940
we've been able to finally
bring a phone that's

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.040
more affordable to more people.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.300
And what we've managed
to do is essentially

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.510
improve our capabilities from
a manufacturing standpoint,

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.600
improve our capabilities from
a hardware design and software

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.700
standpoint, and,
three, we've just

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.800
understood our users better
over the last three years.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.100
Starting with the third one,
understanding our users--

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.190
by understanding our users,
we can pick which pillars

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.840
and which parts
of the product are

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.320
most important to our users,
and focus on those areas

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.020
to design phones that
give users what they

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.190
need in a really optimized way.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.730
On the second two, we
really have, year over year,

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.800
improved our manufacturing.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.720
When we started out,
we had other people

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.040
building our phones for us.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.040
We are now a full-contract
manufacturer.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.350
We design and build
our own devices,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.470
which means we've
come a tremendous way,

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.540
from a manufacturing standpoint.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.130
Finally, on the
engineering side--

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.220
just last year, we
ended up acquiring

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.410
a huge and talented engineering
team in Taiwan from HTC.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.230
That team has been the
lead on these devices,

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.980
and they have brought years
and years of experience--

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.740
in conjunction with our Chicago
design team and our Mountain

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.850
View design team--

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.090
to come together to
build this new Pixel

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.685
3a device, the more affordable
Pixel device at $399.

00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:51.060
EMILY FORTUNA:
That's super cool.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.240
I am personally very excited
to see a new phone come out

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.340
with a headphone jack
and a great camera.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.630
What are your three favorite
features on this new phone?

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.840
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Well, let's
talk about that headphone jack.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.090
We debated on this
headphone jack.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.990
But we really felt that
consumers, at this price point,

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.750
in this price tier,
really needed flexibility.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.990
And that's what that
headphone jack gives you.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.650
We still support digital audio,
and it is the ultimate way

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.800
to consume your audio.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.900
You can either use our
USB adapter on the bottom

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.790
or you can use
Bluetooth headphones,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.200
and digital audio is incredible.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.512
But a lot of people
have headphones,

00:12:31.512 --> 00:12:33.970
and we didn't need to create
any more e-waste in the world.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.340
So we've decided to put a 3.5mm
headset jack in so that people

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.700
could use the accessories that
they already had available

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.670
to them.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.550
Now, my top three.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.350
Let's start with the
camera, because I

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.740
think that's everybody's
top for Pixel in general.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.080
And Pixel 3a is incredible.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.440
It shares the same
camera experiences

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.310
that you get on your Pixel
3 device, minus group selfie

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.520
mode.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.970
But in general, you get
all the great stuff,

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.370
starting with Night
Sight, which lets you take

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.650
incredible images in low light.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.510
My favorite is taking
pictures of my kids

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.218
when they're sleeping,
because they sleep

00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:12.990
in the most awkward positions.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.810
But you would be surprised
at the detail you can get.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.552
You can catch their bedspread,
their little stuffies--

00:13:18.552 --> 00:13:20.760
and that's without turning
any lights on in the room.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.220
It is truly incredible.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.570
On top of Night Sight, of
course you get portrait mode,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.300
so you can take those
incredible selfies,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.850
with that bokeh effect,
with that beautiful blurred

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.193
background.

00:13:31.193 --> 00:13:32.610
And we have a depth
editor, so you

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.440
can change and
adjust that just to

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.100
how you want to
see that picture.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.100
We also have Photobooth.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.250
Again, I'll say, savior,
when you have kids.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.960
You just turn on the
Photobooth and it

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.330
captures the picture when
they're both facing the camera

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.320
and smiling.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.750
That is a rare split-second
event anywhere,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.320
and Photobooth captures
it every single time.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.740
And that's also available
on the Pixel 3a.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.640
So by far, the most incredible
thing on this device

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.480
is this camera.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.340
It's amazing.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.060
And finally, it has
unlimited storage,

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.080
just like our Pixel 3 devices
with high-quality [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.950
My second favorite has
to be Google Assistant.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.540
Google Assistant is awesome.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.353
It saves time and
effort all day long.

00:14:15.353 --> 00:14:16.770
You just have to
talk to the phone

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.350
to set reminders,
get directions--

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.970
it's super quick and easy.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.800
And when you're
on the go, that's

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.220
what you need-- something that's
quick and easy and reliable.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.850
Finally, it also
has call screen.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.360
I don't know about you, but
I get a lot of spam calls.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.730
Call screen is a savior.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.370
And with the power of Google
Assistant and call screen,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.690
I only pick up calls that
matter now, which is amazing.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.390
And the bonus-- you get to
waste a little bit of time,

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.268
of that spammer's
time, as they try

00:14:47.268 --> 00:14:49.560
to call you and have to deal
with your little automated

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.060
message.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.410
So I really appreciate
call screen.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.990
And then my final one
has to be battery life.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.630
We heard this loud and
clear from our research,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.450
that battery life is an issue.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.670
And we all feel this,
this anxiety of,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.790
like, oh no, I have 20%, am I
going to get through the day?

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.260
We wanted to eliminate
battery anxiety,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.120
and I think we've done a
fabulous job on these devices.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.120
One, we beefed up the batteries.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.460
So they're just bigger.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.160
On top of that, these both
support Adaptive Battery,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.550
which we introduced on our
Pixel devices earlier this year.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.830
And that just makes the
battery a little bit smarter

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.720
around how it's using
the power, extending it.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.930
And so these devices,
both get over--

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.100
sorry, up to--

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.520
30 hours of battery
life on a full charge.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.490
On top of that, we put a
fast charger in the box.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.170
That's an 18-watt
charger in the box.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.920
You can charge this
bad boy for 15 minutes

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.790
and get seven hours
of battery life.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.803
While you're getting ready to
get out the door, charge it,

00:15:46.803 --> 00:15:48.720
and you have the whole
night available to you.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.990
It's pretty fantastic.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.140
So those would have
to be my top three.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.500
EMILY FORTUNA: That is
quite an impressive list.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.920
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Thanks.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.500
EMILY FORTUNA: I'd be curious
to learn a little bit more

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.970
about the camera itself.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.820
Can you tell me some
more of the specifics

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.150
on how it's able to create
all these cool effects?

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.650
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.450
So it starts with the hardware.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.820
The hardware that we've
picked for these cameras

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.740
is not mid-tier.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.210
It is premium hardware.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.360
In fact, the imager on the
rear is the exact same imager

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.670
that we use on our
premium devices.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.520
The front imager is also
the same normal field

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.410
of view imager that we use
for our premium devices.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.700
So we started with
really great raw images.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.120
From there, our magical
software team took over.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.440
They are phenomenal.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.820
And they really were put
to task on this phone,

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.910
because as you may
know, the phone has not

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.610
the same type of processing
power as our premium phones.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.825
It has the Snapdragon 670 in
it, versus the 800 series that

00:16:48.825 --> 00:16:49.950
sits in our premium phones.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.460
So we've really condensed
their processing power,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.550
and they were still
able to deliver.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.380
They optimized every
last aspect of the camera

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.210
features to get them
to work on here.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.960
Each individual feature
was revisited by the team

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.190
to not only optimize
the algorithms,

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.030
but to optimize the
overall experience to work

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.160
on these particular devices.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.720
And they did it.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.470
They did a phenomenal job
of delivering those software

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.401
features.

00:17:20.401 --> 00:17:22.109
EMILY FORTUNA: Thank
you so much, Soniya,

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.119
for coming to talk to us
about the Pixel 3a and 3a XL.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.077
SONIYA JOBANPUTRA: Thanks
for having me, Emily.

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:27.744
It's really exciting
to talk about them.

00:17:27.744 --> 00:17:29.702
EMILY FORTUNA: If you
would like to learn more,

00:17:29.702 --> 00:17:31.440
you should visit
store.google.com.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.330
They're available
online right now.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.800
And it's time for a break.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.990
We'll take a peek into
Google's new Nest Hub Max

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.150
to see how your smart home
can become a helpful home.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.740
Stick around.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.167
You're watching I/O Live.

00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:45.089
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:55.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Joining me now
to talk more about Nest Hub Max

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.780
is Prabhu.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.650
Welcome.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.160
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Thanks for having me.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.522
I'm excited to be here.

00:17:58.522 --> 00:18:00.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So let's
start with a quick overview.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.950
Tell us about the larger
screen, the camera,

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.985
and all the cool features
that they activate.

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:06.610
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
So Nest Hub Max

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.470
is our premium smart
display designed

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.810
for the center of
your home, and it

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.743
builds on all of the
great experiences

00:18:12.743 --> 00:18:14.410
we built with the
Google Nest Hub, which

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.740
we launched last year.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.180
So we've got a 10-inch HD
screen for an even bigger screen

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.140
for your Google Photos and for
watching YouTube TV and all

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.670
of the other experiences there.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.920
It's got premium
stereo sound built in.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.020
And it's also got a
really helpful camera

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.750
with all kinds of features and
experiences that it can offer--

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.120
everything from video
calling with Google Duo

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.690
to peace of mind through the
built-in Nest Cam functionality

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.480
that allows you to
keep an eye on what's

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.360
happening at home,
to personalization,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.360
through a feature that
we're calling Face Match.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:44.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Mm-hmm.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.760
Very cool.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.200
And what's your
favorite feature?

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.450
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN: So
I personally love the video

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.423
calling with Duo, because I've
got a two-and-a-half-year-old

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:54.840
at home, and he loves to call
his grandparents on our Nest

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.600
Hub Max at home.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.280
And the auto-framing
feature of our Duo calling

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.930
allows him to run
around the room,

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.510
and my parents can still
keep track of what's

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.635
happening in his busy life.

00:19:05.635 --> 00:19:06.927
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:19:06.927 --> 00:19:08.610
Let's talk for a
moment about privacy.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.470
There's a huge consumer demand
for privacy and transparency

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.930
about our personal
information-- how it's stored

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:14.693
and how it's used.

00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:16.360
Now, this seems like
one of those things

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.232
that the team was particularly
passionate about and proud of.

00:19:19.232 --> 00:19:20.690
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Absolutely.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.270
You're absolutely right.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.370
We thought about privacy
from the very beginning

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.530
of our process designing
the Nest Hub Max,

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:29.290
and actually, even going
further back, the Nest Hub.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.780
One of the reasons that we
had our first smart display be

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.280
one without a
camera is because we

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.855
wanted to make it
available as a device

00:19:35.855 --> 00:19:37.480
that you would feel
comfortable putting

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.280
in any room of your house.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.747
At the same time, we knew
that the camera unlocks

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.330
a lot of helpful
functionality, and we

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.632
wanted to provide that
option as well for consumers.

00:19:46.632 --> 00:19:48.340
And so the way we
thought about designing

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.990
the camera was very much with
privacy at the forefront.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.810
We thought about easy
and simple controls

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.600
for all of the features,
which are all opt-in features,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.350
and you choose what
you want to use.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.160
And there's simple controls,
like the hardware switch

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.710
on the back of the device that
lets you quickly just turn off

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.750
the camera and the microphones.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.280
On top of that,
taking a step back

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.070
from the individual
products, we, as Google Nest,

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.270
have also tried to define a
set of privacy commitments

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.482
for the home, which articulates
our point of view on what it

00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:18.940
means for us to respect your
privacy in all of the products

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.523
that we build.

00:20:19.523 --> 00:20:22.000
And those are really
specific, factual commitments

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.810
about what you can expect
with your personal data

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.920
when you're using our
products in your home.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: One of the
really insightful things

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.747
about the keynote
that resonated with me

00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:34.240
was that there's a fundamental
difference between a smart home

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.650
and a helpful home.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.300
Can you define that difference?

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.508
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN: Sure.

00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:40.270
So smart home
technology is fantastic.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.182
It helps us solve
all kinds of really

00:20:42.182 --> 00:20:44.140
interesting and important
problems in our homes

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.393
and in our lives.

00:20:45.393 --> 00:20:47.560
But one of the challenges
with smart home technology

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.040
is it's kind of complicated.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.540
It's not that easy to use.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.270
And so we wanted
to think about how

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.490
we can solve that
as we push forward

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.560
with our vision for
the helpful home.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.720
And there's a few key
tenants for what we think

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.190
the helpful home looks like.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.020
One is that the
products in it should

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.790
be easy to use for
everyone in the home.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.390
The second is it
should feel personal.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.940
As you use these
devices, they should

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.150
get to know you and be able to
provide an experience that's

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.680
tailored to you and your family.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.890
The third is they should
work really well together.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.950
These devices aren't just
operating in a vacuum

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.060
individually.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.450
They're helping fill
out your entire home.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.143
And so your whole home should
work together really well.

00:21:27.143 --> 00:21:28.810
And then the last is,
of course, the one

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.477
we just mentioned,
that it should really

00:21:30.477 --> 00:21:33.217
respect your privacy,
and that privacy should

00:21:33.217 --> 00:21:35.050
be part of the design
of all of the products

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.005
that you bring into your home.

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's talk
about design a bit more.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.950
I think designing
for a screen that's

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.010
meant to be viewed
up close, far away,

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.510
and from different angles-- it
seems like a really difficult

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.010
problem.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.880
Can you talk about
your design process

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.213
while addressing that challenge?

00:21:50.213 --> 00:21:51.672
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Absolutely.

00:21:51.672 --> 00:21:54.010
So when we started
working on the Google Nest

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.860
Hub, the first smart
display that we built,

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.638
we were thinking about
that first and foremost.

00:21:59.638 --> 00:22:01.180
Because we wanted
this device to feel

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.840
like an ambient, glanceable
device, not one that needs your

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.460
focused attention for
long periods of time.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.790
And so we designed the user
experience on that device

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.502
to be readable from a
variety of distances.

00:22:12.502 --> 00:22:13.960
Obviously, the fact
that it's voice

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.070
means that it can be used
from both near and far.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.990
Then, when we went
to the Nest Hub Max

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.658
and we added a
camera to the device,

00:22:21.658 --> 00:22:23.200
the other thing that
we thought about

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.920
was, how can the camera help
solve that same problem for you

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.180
and your family in the home?

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.950
And so an important
decision we made

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.530
was to provide a really wide
field of view for the camera.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.200
It's got a 127
degree field of view.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.050
So if you think about all the
experiences that you're using

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.220
the camera for,
from video calling,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.220
where it allows you to
move around the room with

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.270
auto-framing, to the built-in
Nest Cam functionality,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.220
where you can get a pretty
good view of what's happening

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.740
in the room, to the
personalization with Face

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.460
Match, where our thinking
was the device should be able

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.160
to tell that you're looking at
it when you can see it and when

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.350
you would be able to receive
the personalized experience that

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.280
it's giving you--

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.200
and so all of those
design decisions

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.720
helped us to feel
like we're extending

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.030
that "whether near
or far, it's great"

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.270
experience from the Nest
Hub to the Nest Hub Max.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.710
OK, one last thing.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.290
During user research, what
was the most fun thing

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.210
that you saw someone do
that you didn't expect?

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.070
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
So one of the things

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.445
I love about our
user research is

00:23:20.445 --> 00:23:23.610
that we get to see how our
products fit into their homes,

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.710
and we get to feel the impact
that we're having on real homes

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.670
and real people.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.440
And one small
example of an insight

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.160
that we get from that
research is, hey,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.660
where do people put
our devices when

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.040
we get them in their homes?

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.120
And we learn a lot from, for
example, the other Googlers who

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.190
test our products and
help give us feedback

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.830
before we ship
them to the public.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.055
And there was one
email thread where

00:23:45.055 --> 00:23:47.390
a Googler who was
testing the Nest Hub Max

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.350
showed a photo of his living
room, where he had the Nest Hub

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.370
Max, which is already
a pretty big screen,

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.400
sitting right next to his big
flat-screen TV on the wall.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.110
And that was
obviously not what I

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:01.263
had expected, because I figured
these devices are big enough

00:24:01.263 --> 00:24:03.680
that you're going to put this
bigger screen in a room that

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.138
doesn't really have
another screen.

00:24:05.138 --> 00:24:08.410
But we had a dialogue
with the Googler,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.230
and we realized the value
of checking your assumptions

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.220
and learning from
what people do to fit

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.470
your products into their home.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.975
So he loved the photo
frame in his living room

00:24:18.975 --> 00:24:21.350
and loved that you can see it
from a little farther away,

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.280
because it was bigger.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.510
He loved the fact
that it had a clock

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.860
that he could look at any time.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.380
He loved that he could control
his TV and his home theater

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.270
system by voice
through this device.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:34.010
And so I think that every
time we actually see

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.010
how our products fit into
people's homes, we learn a lot,

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.590
and that's one of the most
fun examples of research

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.520
that we do.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks
for swinging by, Prabhu.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.190
This has been really insightful.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.890
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Thanks for having me.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:44.935
I appreciate it.

00:24:44.935 --> 00:24:46.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Nest Hub Max will

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.800
be available later this
summer in the US, Australia,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.490
and the UK.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.073
And we're going to
take a short break.

00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:53.450
Up next, we'll turn our
attention to augmented reality.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.980
You're watching I/O Live.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.884
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.440
EMILY FORTUNA: Welcome
back to I/O Live.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.060
Here with us now
is Harsh Kharbanda,

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.830
product manager on Lens.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.760
Welcome, Harsh.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.263
HARSH KHARBANDA: Hi, Emily.

00:25:13.263 --> 00:25:15.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Harsh, there
were so many AR announcements

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.910
at I/O. Let's go a little
deeper with one of them--

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.850
Lens and Google Go.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.590
Can you take us back to when you
all were first conceiving it?

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.663
What were the problems that
you were trying to solve?

00:25:25.663 --> 00:25:26.580
HARSH KHARBANDA: Sure.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.800
So technology's getting
cheaper and more accessible.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.740
Smartphones today can
cost as little as $50.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.170
And while building all our
OCR and document structure

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.690
understanding
capabilities in Lens,

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.580
we realized that these can
be transformational for users

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.748
new to smartphones.

00:25:39.748 --> 00:25:41.790
There are two things that
we realized about users

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.930
who are new to smartphones.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.480
The first thing is that
the smartphone is likely

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.190
their first digital device.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.980
Unlike you and I, they haven't
grown up with desktops.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.780
And so the keyboard itself
is a novel concept for them.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.660
They have to learn how
to express information

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.390
needs for the first time
on a 2-inch keyboard,

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.520
and typing is just
fundamentally hard.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.640
The second thing we realized was
that these users typically have

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.950
lower literacy rates, which
means that they come across

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.770
text throughout their lives--
bank forms, ATM notices,

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.715
street signs--

00:26:08.715 --> 00:26:10.590
text that they want to
understand, but really

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.700
have to depend on
others to do so.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.000
But the camera is something
everybody knows how to use.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.320
The selfie has really made
its way around the world.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.560
So we thought, what if we
could build a camera that

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.060
could help you
learn, understand,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.482
and read the world around you?

00:26:22.482 --> 00:26:24.440
And that's what we did
with Lens and Google Go.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.260
EMILY FORTUNA:
That's super cool.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.020
I foresee myself making use
of Google Go when I travel,

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.620
for example.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.440
It's like, if I don't know
the language or the alphabet,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.170
it's like I have my own
personal translator.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.670
Can you tell us
about the first time

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.520
you saw someone use Lens
how you had envisioned?

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.498
HARSH KHARBANDA: Sure.

00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:41.040
So we've been testing
Lens and Google

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.730
Go over the past several
months, and we've seen people

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.770
use it in several
different instances

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.380
throughout their daily lives--
bank forms, ATM notices,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.353
product packages,
medicine labels.

00:26:51.353 --> 00:26:52.770
But the point where
we realized we

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.200
were making a true impact
in the users' lives

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.760
was when we saw a parent
using Lens and Google

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.990
Go on their child's
homework, to understand

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.790
what the homework
problem was and help them

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.930
in their education.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.360
Before that, their
homework was in English.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.360
The parent could not
really help the child.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.690
But in this case, they were
able to take a picture,

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.153
translate it into the
language that they understood,

00:27:14.153 --> 00:27:15.570
and understand the
problem and be,

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.832
really, a part of their
child's education.

00:27:17.832 --> 00:27:19.290
And that is something
that's really

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.582
humbling and gratifying to see.

00:27:20.582 --> 00:27:23.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Harsh, that
sounds really awesome, and also

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:23.850
fairly complex.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.100
Can you tell us about some
of the technical challenges

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.558
that you faced
while building this?

00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:28.475
HARSH KHARBANDA: Yeah.

00:27:28.475 --> 00:27:29.970
So to be able to
do all of this, we

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.280
had to bring the
technology to a phone

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.550
that new smartphone users
would be able to afford.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.688
And so we had to bring OCR
to be able to understand

00:27:38.688 --> 00:27:40.980
the text that users take a
picture of, machine learning

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.810
to translate the text
into the language

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.720
that these users speak, TTS
to be able to read it out

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.460
in a very naturally
accented form,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.330
and even AR to highlight each
word as it's being read out--

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.390
all done on a phone that
cost as little as $50

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.030
in an APK footprint
of 100 kilobytes.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.358
And that was a really hard
technical challenge for us.

00:27:59.358 --> 00:28:01.900
EMILY FORTUNA: Harsh, thank you
so much for joining us today.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.120
HARSH KHARBANDA:
Thank you, Emily.

TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
the developer keynote

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.690
is just minutes away.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.820
EMILY FORTUNA: Welcome
back to I/O Live.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.487
We're excited to have
Daniel Galpin here

00:28:31.487 --> 00:28:34.110
to tell us about Android News
from the developer keynote.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.730
Hey, Daniel.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:35.480
DANIEL GALPIN: Hi.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, Dan.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.065
So responsibility to our
users was the first core part

00:28:39.065 --> 00:28:40.440
of the Android
Developer keynote.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.700
Now, how does this
relate to developers?

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.340
DANIEL GALPIN:
Well, users trusting

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.957
the platform is inherently
important to developers.

00:28:46.957 --> 00:28:48.540
Downloading an app
is something we all

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.235
want users to feel
comfortable doing.

00:28:50.235 --> 00:28:52.110
And that's why we've
given users more control

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.610
over their identity, [INAUDIBLE]
apps run in the background,

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.620
and about how app share
storage with each other.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.470
Now, these platform
changes ultimately

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.110
will require some
apps to make changes

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.610
when they target [? queue ?]
but it's important for everyone

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.568
that we get this right.

00:29:03.568 --> 00:29:05.902
EMILY FORTUNA: Tell me more
about how the Android Studio

00:29:05.902 --> 00:29:07.680
team focused on
quality improvements

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.833
for their latest release.

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:11.250
DANIEL GALPIN: Well, we're
always listening to developers.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.985
And while new IDE
features are great,

00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:14.610
they don't mean
anything if your coding

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.110
is interrupted with the crashes
and performance problems.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.680
So the team has fixed over
400 high-priority bugs

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.800
and made existing
features work better.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.850
For example, we've
rewritten Instant Run

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.130
from the ground up with
a more solid foundation,

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.750
renaming it Apply Changes.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.010
And developers can try all of
this today in the 3.5 Beta.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, what's
the latest with Google Play?

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.830
DANIEL GALPIN: Well, it's
all about app bundles.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.455
And they make sure
that the devices get

00:29:36.455 --> 00:29:38.340
just the parts of
the APK they need,

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.800
which has turned into an
average of 20% smaller

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.150
downloads for users.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.720
We've also recently launched the
1.0 release of dynamic feature

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.850
modules, which allows
apps to have even smaller

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.440
initial downloads
by choosing which

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.690
parts to download at launch.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.300
And speaking of distribution,
we launched inline app updates

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.800
today, which provides
a standard way

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.290
to prompt users to update
their app when a new version is

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.610
available on Play.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.370
EMILY FORTUNA: So what's about
the updates to Android Jetpack?

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.870
DANIEL GALPIN: Well,
Android Jetpack

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.640
is another way
we've been investing

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.780
in developer productivity.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.320
And CameraX is a huge step
forward in making it easier

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.480
for Android apps to
access the camera

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.970
and get consistent
behavior across devices.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.370
We've also continued to
improve Jetpack's architecture

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.530
components, having recently
released WorkManager

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.600
and the Navigation
Controller into stable,

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.430
adding enhanced Rx
Java support for Room,

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.590
adding Kotlin [INAUDIBLE]
support to Room lifecycle

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.440
and live data, and adding save
state support to ViewModel.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.630
And we're also continuing
to expand the architecture

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.160
components, and
Jetpack in general,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.535
to tackle new pain points,
including the new benchmarking

00:30:34.535 --> 00:30:35.250
library.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.820
Also the early source for a new
Kotlin-first, reactive UI tool

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.952
kit we're developing in
the open, Jetpack Compose,

00:30:41.952 --> 00:30:42.660
is now available.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.532
So check it out and
give us feedback.

00:30:44.532 --> 00:30:45.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Android development

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.550
is becoming Kotlin-first.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.180
Why is Kotlin-first important?

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.930
DANIEL GALPIN: Well,
the world has spoken.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.420
Kotlin is wildly popular.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.330
Over 50% of pro-Android
developers are using it,

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.660
and it means much less code
to type, test, and maintain.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.205
Now, of course, we're continuing
to invest in C++ and Java

00:31:03.205 --> 00:31:04.080
programming language.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.230
And all three choices
remain great options

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.640
for Android development.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.680
That being said, I'm
excited to see the reaction

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.840
to our new free Udacity
course developing

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.580
Android apps in Kotlin.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks
for stopping by, Daniel.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.460
That was a lot of really
great information,

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.520
and we really appreciate it.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.420
EMILY FORTUNA:
Thank you, Daniel.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.837
DANIEL GALPIN:
Thank you, Timothy.

00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:23.470
Thank you, Emily, and I
appreciate talking to you.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
time to step away

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.290
for some more sessions.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.680
Be sure to join the
conversation at #io19.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.420
You're watching I/O Live.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.835
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:51.153 --> 00:31:52.820
EMILY FORTUNA: Welcome
back to I/O Live.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.460
Joining us now is Yossi
Matias, vice president

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.340
of engineering at Google and
the head of the Google R&amp;D

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.532
Center in Israel.

00:31:59.532 --> 00:32:00.740
Thanks for being here, Yossi.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.790
YOSSI MATIAS: Thank you
very much for inviting me.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.373
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Yossi, you're involved

00:32:04.373 --> 00:32:05.960
with AI for Social
Good, and you've

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.080
worked on an impressive number
of projects surrounding that.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.740
How did you get into that area?

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.300
How did it start up here?

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.840
YOSSI MATIAS: So in a way, we
were working on Social Good

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.465
from the early days in Google.

00:32:18.465 --> 00:32:20.090
It's part of the
DNA of the company

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.330
to try and use technology to
solve problems for people.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.670
And obviously, in the last
couple of years, where AI

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.950
is getting a lot of--

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.860
we became an AI-first company.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.320
And AI had all
these advancements.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.460
So suddenly, we started looking
into how to leverage on AI,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.720
how to use it to solve those
problems, societal problems,

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.175
that can help out people
in a profound way.

00:32:44.175 --> 00:32:45.800
EMILY FORTUNA: And
specifically, you've

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.080
worked on flood prediction.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.180
And in my experience,
predicting the future

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.385
is not a task best
left to mere mortals.

00:32:52.385 --> 00:32:55.010
So I'm curious if you could tell
us how you got started on that

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.925
and how it actually works.

00:32:55.925 --> 00:32:56.450
YOSSI MATIAS: Sure, yeah.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.825
There's an old saying that
prediction is hard, especially

00:32:58.825 --> 00:33:01.160
about the future.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.800
So I've been
leading a team which

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.580
is working on crisis response,
where the mission of the team

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.310
is to develop technologies to
help people during crisis--

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.880
natural disasters
and other crises--

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.532
by providing the right
information to people.

00:33:16.532 --> 00:33:17.990
And in fact, my
involvement in that

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:22.310
going back eight and a half
years where, as a user,

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.870
I had the experience--

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.200
we had a devastating
fire in Israel.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.550
And it was near our office,
in our Haifa office.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.170
We have offices in
Tel Aviv and Haifa.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.180
I was visiting that day.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.430
And I didn't know what
I should be doing.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.370
I saw this huge smoke.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:41.540
I didn't find any
information on the internet.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.040
And this was actually
the first time

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.920
that I experienced the
need for information,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.250
and it was not until I actually
called the mayor's office

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.310
that I got the phone number
of actionable information.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.210
And in fact, at that
time, I asked my team

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.490
to see how to make
that information

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.960
available to everybody.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.130
And within a few hours, anybody
searching for "fire in Israel"

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.670
could get that information.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.160
So this was the
first example where

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.030
we gave actionable
information to people.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.210
Now, fast forward--
now we integrated

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.440
into Search something
we call SOS alerts,

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.409
which essentially provides
information about major crises

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:22.790
when they happen.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.239
And one thing we discovered
is that we can only

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.960
give information which we have,
but one of the most devastating

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.050
natural disaster is our floods.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:37.850
They impact up to 250
million people per year,

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.920
and there are thousands of
fatalities because of them.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.270
And in many cases, we don't have
information about where floods

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.440
exactly is going to occur.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.288
So we knew this is
an important problem,

00:34:49.288 --> 00:34:51.080
but it wasn't clear
whether we can actually

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.739
do anything about it.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:54.949
There was an engineer
that just joined,

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.410
and he said he wants to
work on a project that

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.870
could help save lives.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.350
And I asked him, well, why don't
you spend part of your time

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:08.210
seeing how much we can advance
using AI and other technologies

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.160
in order to help out
with flood forecasting?

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.160
And within a few months,
he made enough progress

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.140
that he actually built
a team around it.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.600
And in less than a
year, actually, it

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.400
was ready as a pilot in
the Patna area in India.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.650
And that's how, actually,
the flood forecasting effort

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.963
came to life.

00:35:25.963 --> 00:35:27.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And when you first

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.005
started looking at that problem,
did you think it was solvable?

00:35:30.005 --> 00:35:32.505
YOSSI MATIAS: So actually, when
I had a discussion with him,

00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:34.083
I told him that I'm
not sure if we're

00:35:34.083 --> 00:35:36.500
going to be able to solve it,
because in order to really--

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.300
and we were focusing on, really,
what we call riverine floods.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.730
These are floods where the river
starts rising because of water.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.270
Then, you know, then there's
likely going to be some floods.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.430
But the important
information to know

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:52.010
is exactly where the
floods is going to occur,

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:55.400
because it's only then that
people will take action.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.250
It's only then that
people would evacuate,

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.855
or it's only then
where government

00:35:59.855 --> 00:36:01.730
can take action and
evacuate the right people

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.350
from the right places.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.840
Now, in order to get these
accurate predictions,

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.000
there's a lot going on.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.030
You need to have relatively
fresh information about where

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.940
the water already is in order
to make the predictions.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.610
We are leveraging on the fact
that we have a better elevation

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.030
models for many more
places around the world,

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:22.220
and that elevation
model itself is computed

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.180
with a lot of some of the
advanced technologies-- machine

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:31.070
learning, aerial imagery, and
the other data that we have.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.290
It's using a lot of
computational power

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:37.040
to do hydraulic simulations,
and complimented also

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.900
with machine
learning techniques,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.610
and it's using
information that we're

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.450
getting through a partnership
with the Indian government,

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:48.080
where they're actually measuring
the water level in quite

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.110
a few rivers and
trying to actually make

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.410
sense of what's going on there.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.110
So this is really
a true partnership

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.650
with the Indian
government on that.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:00.680
And as it turns out, we could
actually get into prediction

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.450
a few hours before the floods
actually get to the level

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:08.900
that it did of over 90%
accuracy, which was actually

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.990
quite impactful.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
that's hugely impactful.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.220
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.430
How were you able to connect
with the Indian government

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.273
and get these people
involved in the project?

00:37:19.273 --> 00:37:20.690
YOSSI MATIAS: You
know, the beauty

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.720
is that once we started
working on that,

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.750
there's a lot of
interest to collaborate.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.900
And I would say that on many
of the societal problems,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.050
the notion of collaboration
between companies

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.990
and communities and
entrepreneurs and governments--

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.260
I think this is one of the areas
that we need to see more of.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.770
Because these are big
problems, and we do

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.240
need to have this
kind of community

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.213
effort and global effort in
order to really tackle them.

00:37:47.213 --> 00:37:48.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.210
EMILY FORTUNA: Thank
you so much, Yossi.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.880
And thank you for helping
create this environment

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.020
to be able to make
these projects possible.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:54.590
YOSSI MATIAS: Well,
it's a privilege

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.080
to be able to have this
kind of environment

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.170
and to work with people who care
about how to use technologies

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.858
to solve big problems.

00:38:01.858 --> 00:38:04.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, let's
now head over to the sandbox

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.170
to see some awesome demos.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.170
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So here,
I have Bhavin and Greg

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.040
from the Android
team who are going

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.712
to show us more about what's up
with 5G here at Google I/O. So

00:38:14.712 --> 00:38:16.670
what's new here, and what
are we showing today?

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.310
BHAVIN ROKAD: So at I/O, we want
to demonstrate to developers

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.250
how Android is leading the
way when it comes to 5G

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.400
and what it means for them.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.690
In 2019, 5G is launching with
over 20 carriers worldwide,

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.297
and on more than a
dozen Android OEMs.

00:38:32.297 --> 00:38:33.380
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: OK, cool.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.588
So there are going to be
all these devices out there.

00:38:35.588 --> 00:38:38.660
So what APIs have we now added
to Android to allow developers

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.160
to use this kind of capability?

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.577
GREG LEON: Yeah,
so we've extended

00:38:41.577 --> 00:38:44.930
our connectivity manager
API to be 5G-aware,

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.510
so that you'll know when you
have an amazing 5G connection

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.010
from a bandwidth perspective.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.910
Additionally, we've also added
the meteredness component

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.823
to the API, so that you'll know
when that connection is metered

00:38:55.823 --> 00:38:57.740
or unmetered so, you can
do interesting things

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.698
over the 5G connection.

00:38:58.698 --> 00:39:00.282
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: All
right, so metered

00:39:00.282 --> 00:39:02.540
means you're paying for it
per gigabyte or something

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:02.670
like that.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:03.050
GREG LEON: That's right, yeah.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.890
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So that
would be a great opportunity

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.738
to download movies
before a flight,

00:39:05.738 --> 00:39:08.030
or when you're going away
with there's no connectivity?

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.280
GREG LEON: That's right, yeah.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.020
So you can do all of these
great downloads of content

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.270
before you jump on a
plane, for example.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:15.720
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
All right, nice.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.560
So from what I understand,
5G is a lot faster

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.300
than previous phone
networks, and it

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.760
sounds like it has the ability
to do really fast downloads.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.102
So you have a phone
there that is 5G-aware.

00:39:25.102 --> 00:39:26.810
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yeah,
so let's take a look.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.480
To help demonstrate
5G at I/O, we've

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.000
actually set up three
live networks here at I/O

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.030
on a range of six OEM devices.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.280
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Oh, wow.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.990
So that's something people
don't get to see every day.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.540
Here at Google I/O, we actually
have real cell phone company

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.753
base stations for our demos.

00:39:39.753 --> 00:39:42.170
So let's see what this looks
like on a real 5G phone here.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.920
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yep.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.860
So one of the challenges
that many of the AAA app

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.840
game developers
might run into is

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.780
that file sizes get larger
and larger as we make

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.430
games more and more immersive.

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.610
For instance, this
game is two gigabytes,

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:57.440
and that file size could
mean the difference

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.540
between acquiring a
user or not, especially

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.660
if they're on the go.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.790
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Those
could take hours.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:02.915
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yes, exactly.

00:40:02.915 --> 00:40:06.320
So with 5G, we can see that
the download gets kicked off

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.310
relatively quickly,
and we're downloading--

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.570
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: 43 megs.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.070
Oh, wow.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:09.810
BHAVIN ROKAD: 62.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.620
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: 62 megs.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.940
BHAVIN ROKAD: 120.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.340
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Oh, wow.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.550
So it's going like
60 megs at a time.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.050
Wow.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.570
BHAVIN ROKAD: 200, 300--

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.350
so we're cranking right along.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.392
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah,
well, that's really quick.

00:40:21.392 --> 00:40:24.860
So what technological advances
have they added to 5G in order

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.647
to get the speed
achievements that we're

00:40:26.647 --> 00:40:27.730
seeing in [? demo here? ?]

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.855
GREG LEON: Yeah, so we've
done a few things for 5G.

00:40:29.855 --> 00:40:32.600
One is new spectrum
mid-band and high-band,

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.030
increase the
robustness of the link

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.510
through beamforming
technology and Massive MIMO.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.050
And also, we've
improved latency,

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:41.592
which is really
important for gaming,

00:40:41.592 --> 00:40:44.790
through shorter packet sizes
and distributed core network,

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:48.410
which is taking the central core
infrastructure of the carrier

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.540
and bringing it closer
and closer to the user.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.103
And that's allowed for
a much better latency,

00:40:53.103 --> 00:40:55.020
and that really matters
to things like gaming.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.240
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah, that
sounds like it would really

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.698
help consumers,
and also developers

00:40:57.698 --> 00:41:00.250
who are going to be
[INAUDIBLE] these kind of apps.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.542
BHAVIN ROKAD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:03.650
And you can see we're
ready to play the game.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.940
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Oh, wow.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:04.340
Cool.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.050
So that's all done, so
we're ready to roll.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.590
OK.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.820
Thanks for talking to us today.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.980
Appreciate your time, and I'm
sure everyone's looking forward

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.020
to trying this out.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.353
GREG LEON: All right, thank you.

00:41:12.353 --> 00:41:14.180
BHAVIN ROKAD: Thank you.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That'll do it
for day one here at I/O Live,

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.230
but we've only
started to scratch

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.490
the surface of the festival.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:20.360
EMILY FORTUNA:
Yes, tomorrow we'll

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.580
check out some cool product
demos in the sandbox.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
we'll recap all the I/O

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.760
After Dark festivities.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.530
If you're into roller
rinks and arcades,

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.760
you're going to want to tune in.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.843
EMILY FORTUNA: Super cool.

00:41:29.843 --> 00:41:32.250
The remaining sessions of
the day are about to begin.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.510
Remember to visit g.co/io/live
to check out our videos

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:36.200
on demand.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.520
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Have a
great rest of the day.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.140
Emily and I will
see you tomorrow.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.265
EMILY FORTUNA: Bye for now.

00:41:40.265 --> 00:41:43.060
