00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:02.200
Voiceover:Let's see if we can compute what

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.692
14 - 2 is, and then
figure out what 14 - 4 is,

00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:09.357
and then figure out what 14 - 6 is.

00:00:09.357 --> 00:00:10.997
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:14.149
and try to figure these out
before I work through them.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.422
Voiceover:So I'm assuming you've given

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:18.117
it a try, now let's think about it.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:21.512
The number 14 just by how it's written,

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:24.105
we know that it's going
to be 1 group of ten.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:28.353
That's what this 1 tells
us plus another 4 ones.

00:00:28.353 --> 00:00:31.250
So let's verify that we
have 14 objects down here.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.088
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:39.888
So we definitely have a group of ten.

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:43.619
We have 1 group of ten here,
so that's my group of ten.

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:48.473
So let me box that off,
so I have my group of ten.

00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:50.183
And then how many ones do I have?

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:54.165
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, I have four ones.

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:58.321
So this is indeed, 14.

00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.823
This one that we have right over here,

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:05.143
this represents this
ten, it's 1 group of ten.

00:01:05.143 --> 00:01:09.386
This is 1 group of ten,
let me write that down.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.954
Group of ten.

00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:18.665
And then we have 4 ones,
4, I guess we could say,

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:23.191
4 ones like that, so that is indeed 14.

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:27.705
Now let's look at each of
these, what is 14-2 going to be?

00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:30.828
Well we could take away
2, so take away 1...

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.918
take away 2, and how
many are we left with?

00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:36.710
Well we still have our one group of ten,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.250
so it's going to be 1,
followed by how many ones

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.387
do we have left over, well we have 2 ones.

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:46.956
We have 2 ones left over.

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:51.828
1, 2, so we are going to be left with 12.

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:57.510
Now what about 14 - 4?
So let me clear this out.

00:02:01.463 --> 00:02:03.475
Actually let me do it like this.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:10.513
So if I clear that, so
what is 14 - 4 going to be?

00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:16.742
So now I'm going take away 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:19.802
I have essentially taken away all 4 ones.

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:21.197
So what am I left with?

00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:23.917
Well I still have my 1 group of ten,

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:28.642
I still have my 1 group of ten
and I have 0 ones left over.

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:32.168
No ones anymore, so now I have 0 ones.

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:35.794
And so 14 - 4 is 10, and that makes sense.

00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:39.590
14 is 10 + 4 and now we're subtracting 4,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.410
to get 10, let me write this down.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.252
This is the same thing, 14 is 10 + 4.

00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:52.343
Voiceover:10 + 4, this is 14

00:02:52.343 --> 00:02:55.130
and then we're going to subtract 4,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.381
Then we're subtracting 4,
so if you have 10 + 4 - 4.

00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:01.762
Well the 4 - 4 is going
to be 0, you're going

00:03:01.762 --> 00:03:05.259
to be left with 10 + 0 or just 10.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.386
We can do the same thing up here.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:16.254
This is equal to 14 is 10 +
4 and then we subtracted 2.

00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:18.822
And then we subtracted 2.

00:03:18.822 --> 00:03:21.810
So what you're going to be
left with 10 + what's 4 - 2?

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.543
It's 2, so that's what
we got right over here.

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:28.301
Let me make this very
clear, this simplifies to 2.

00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.482
This 2 right over here.

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:33.726
This simplifies to 0,
this 0 right over here.

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:38.266
Now let's do the last one, what is 14 - 6?

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:41.298
Well we're going to take away 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:46.439
then 5, and 6, so now we've
broken into our group of ten.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.122
So this is going to be a one-digit number.

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:54.035
And we are left with
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:54.035 --> 00:04:02.364
So this is going to be equal
to 8 and we're all done.
