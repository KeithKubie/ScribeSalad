00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.040
and today I'm learning more
about the fifth amendment

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.670
to the US Constitution.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.710
The fifth amendment is
one of the better known

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.230
constitutional amendments
since we frequently

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.350
hear references to
suspects taking the fifth

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.140
in TV shows and movies.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.720
But what does it actually
mean to take the fifth?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.880
To learn more, I talk to two experts.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.870
Donald Dripps is the Warren
Distinguished Professor of Law

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.180
at the University of
San Diego School of Law.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.590
And Steven Saltzburg is the
Wallace and Beverly Woodbury

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.140
University Professor of Law at
George Washington Law School.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.860
So, Professor Saltzburg
could you talk a little bit

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.520
about why the framers were
interested in choosing

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.290
to protect these rights in particular?

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.120
- [Saltzburg] The fifth
amendment really addresses

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.870
four different things.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.153
One, it says that generally
you can't be charged

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:52.930
with a serious crime unless
you're indicted by a grand jury.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.370
Two, it says you can't be
subjected to double jeopardy.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.830
Three, it says you can't be compelled

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.560
to be a witness against yourself.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.050
And four, there is this due process right,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.090
not to be deprived of life, liberty,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.130
or property without due process.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.950
If you look at it, the three provisions,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.630
the grand jury provision, double jeopardy,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.610
and the privilege against
self-incrimination

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.500
all have a common history
and that is that in England

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.390
there was a time in which
the crown, the King,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.310
basically tried to assert
power to bringing people

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.217
to trial for charges that
the King wanted brought.

00:01:33.217 --> 00:01:37.290
And the grand jury served as a protection

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.350
between the King and ordinary people.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.220
- [Dripps] Most of the
provisions in the Bill of Rights

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.350
are aimed at preventing the
recurrence of some specific

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.430
abuse that had been
known to English history.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.290
There are different provisions
in the fifth amendment

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.660
that speak to different abuses.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.180
The fundamental one and the
one that goes furthest back

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.010
in the legal history, back to Magna Carta

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.440
and so on is the due process clause.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.630
And that clause means that
no person can be injured

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.960
by the government except
according to the law

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.200
of the land and after a fair trial.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.960
And that in the very,
very distant past back

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.210
in the 13th century King
John had an infamous practice

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.410
of executing supposed rebellious barons

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.100
and then holding a solemn trial

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.360
after the drawing and quartering.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.020
And so, that notion of judgment

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.173
before punishment is
really, really fundamental.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.940
That's what due process is
about at its most basic level.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.180
- [Kim] Interesting, so can you say more

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.370
about the due process clause here?

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.370
What is due process?

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.130
- [Saltzburg] Due process
is an extraordinarily

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.660
complicated concept.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.920
It means that there are certain procedural

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.510
and substantive rules that must be honored

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.320
in the way in which governments
approach individuals

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.610
and entities that they
are seeking to regulate.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.310
It's not a simple bright
line that in order

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.090
to have due process this
is what is required.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.530
Due process is somewhat flexible.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.880
It tends to provide more protections

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.350
when individuals are faced
with more serious consequences.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.020
So, in terms of criminal law
it's generally understood

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.410
that the most severe
penalties that we have

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.410
that can legally be imposed upon people

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.360
are the death penalty, prison, and jail.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.410
And generally, you can't
impose any of those except

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.070
as punishment for a crime.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.780
And so, the due process
in the criminal arena

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.000
is largely defined by the Bill of Rights.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.770
And some common law understandings

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.970
that have been carried forward,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.030
let me give you a couple of examples.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.730
There is nothing in the Constitution

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.400
that says the government must prove guilt

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.240
in a criminal case beyond
a reasonable doubt,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.590
but that is a fundamental
part of American law.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.460
The Supreme Court has
held that that is a part

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.120
of what due process
requires and that is the law

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.470
throughout the United
States not withstanding

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.670
the fact you don't see
it in the Constitution.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.760
Similarly, the right to a unanimous jury

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.267
in a criminal case is
also not found anywhere

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:15.500
in the Constitution.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.480
- [Kim] You mentioned a grand jury,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.580
so how is that different
from an ordinary jury?

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.808
- [Dripps] The grand jury
served a very delicate role

00:04:24.808 --> 00:04:28.270
in Founding era times because
many, many prosecutions

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.970
were brought by private persons.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.920
There were no police forces
of the modern paramilitary

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.930
24/7 type and a lot of
law enforcement was done

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.320
by self help and prosecutions
were privately funded

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.450
and sometimes lay people would
represent themselves pro se

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.161
in pressing a criminal prosection.

00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:50.150
And the grand jury was there to make sure

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.990
that people weren't
subjected to vindictive

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.690
or malicious prosecutions
by ill-spirited neighbors

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.180
and that sort of thing.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.600
The framers probably had
in mind a famous case

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.140
of the Earl of Shaftesbury
who was suspected of misdeeds

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.650
and a grand jury famously
refused to indict him.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.350
And so, they sought as
one among many checks

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.190
against the possible abuse of power

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.970
by this new federal government.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.450
- [Saltzburg] So, a grand jury is a body

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.620
that decides whether or
not to bring a charge

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.090
against an individual or an
entity like a corporation.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.520
The grand jury in federal
court happens to be 23 people,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.610
but there isn't anything
in the constitution

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.960
that actually says it
has to be that number.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.890
Unlike a trial by jury
which we call a petty jury,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.350
the grand jury does not
have to be unanimous.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.430
It basically decides to bring
a charge by majority vote

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.140
and the grand jury specifically instructed

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.390
that its job is not to
decide guilt or innocence,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.630
its job is to decide whether
there is sufficient evidence

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.500
to bring a job.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.590
Which we usually say means probable cause

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.400
to believe that a crime was committed

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.010
and a particular person
committed that crime.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.440
So the grand jury's function
is to bring a charge,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.650
the trial jury's function is to then

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.830
decide guilt or innocence.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.550
- [Kim] Interesting, so
how about double jeopardy?

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.730
This is something that I think we have

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.410
a maybe rudimentary understanding
of in popular culture.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.310
What does double jeopardy really mean?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.280
- [Saltzburg] If we didn't
have a double jeopardy clause

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.220
the executive branch, if it
could persuade grand jury

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.490
to charge somebody with
a crime, could prosecute

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.560
that person and if the
person was acquitted

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.260
then government could do it again.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.270
Bring the same change and do it again

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.920
until they got a conviction and that meant

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.460
that an individual could be persecuted

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.200
rather than prosecuted
by continuing charges

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.980
for the exact same thing.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.340
And the basic function of
the double jeopardy clause

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.000
is to basically tell the
government, you get one shot.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.930
- [Dripps] Trials are very
stressful and very expensive,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.800
and the government has more resources

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.630
than the typical defendant does

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.660
and so one concern is that you would just

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.660
have the government have
power to bankrupt people

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.660
by retrying the case over and over again.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.130
It becomes very, very
complicated saying just

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.830
what the same offense is.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.830
The current doctrine is
that every statutory crime

00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:22.160
that includes different factual elements

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.310
than every other statutory crime arising

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.960
out of the same course of
conduct is a separate crime.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.560
- [Kim] Are there an
exceptions to double jeopardy,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.870
or common misconceptions
about how it works?

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.083
- [Saltzburg] Yes, there are
two common misconceptions.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.570
One of them is that you
can only be tried once

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.460
for the same criminal
activity and the reason

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.730
you can actually be
prosecuted more than once

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.010
is because in our system,
federal government

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.660
in each state is considered
to be a separate sovereign

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.880
which means the federal
government can charge someone

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.400
with a crime, let's say a drug conspiracy.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.400
The State of Virginia or
California can also prosecute

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.163
for the same criminal conduct.

00:08:09.264 --> 00:08:13.170
The states have their own
criminal law to enforce.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.440
So technically, someone
could be prosecuted let's say

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.150
by the Commonwealth of Virginia

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.420
for a drug conspiracy and convicted.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.140
And then could be prosecuted
again by the federal government

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.820
or another state for the
same criminal activity

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.510
and be convicted or acquitted

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.300
and the double jeopardy
clause would not be violated.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.090
The second thing about double jeopardy is

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.800
that it only protects
you from being prosecuted

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.420
a second time by the same
sovereign for the same crime.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.340
It doesn't protect you
from being prosecuted

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.560
for a different crime.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.560
Suppose the State of California
prosecutes a defendant

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.110
for murder and the defendant is acquitted,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.730
the State of California could then bring

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.760
a second prosecution for a
kidnapping of the same victim

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.250
that actually occurred before the murder.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.690
And because that's a different crime,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.393
the double jeopardy clause doesn't bar

00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:14.564
a separate prosecution.

00:09:14.564 --> 00:09:16.420
- [Kim] And so there's also a clause here

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.743
that says an individual
shall not be compelled

00:09:20.743 --> 00:09:25.550
in any criminal case to be
a witness against himself.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.840
So, this is what we call
taking the fifth, right?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.370
What does that mean?

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.700
- [Dripps] So, the fifth
amendment privilege is a privilege

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.610
that can be asserted by
anyone who is called to answer

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.978
by agents of the government
and to claim the privilege

00:09:40.978 --> 00:09:44.930
it has to be the case that
the witness is being compelled

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.520
to speak will suffer adverse consequences

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.570
if she doesn't answer the
questions the government officers

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.860
want her to answer.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.520
Those answers have to tend
to incriminate the witness

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.330
and those answers have to be testimonial,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.436
that is to say they have to say

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:01.300
in some way they constitute witnessing.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.950
- [Saltzburg] Good lawyers,
good lawyers will generally

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.470
advise their clients to take the fifth.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.930
That is, claim their privilege
against self-incrimination

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.420
almost any time that the government

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.850
is seriously investigating them.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.840
And the reason is people's
memories are often bad,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.569
that when people are asked
question they may believe

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:24.240
that something happened in a certain way

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.130
but they haven't gone back to review it.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.870
And when people make
mistakes, simple mistakes,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.700
that are made in response to a question

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.130
may look like people deliberately lied.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.420
They may make someone look
like they were attempting

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.900
to deceive investigators.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.030
And therefore, when in doubt,
individuals who are being

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.320
investigated have good reason to invoke

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.830
their privilege against
self-incrimination.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.920
- [Dripps] Historically,
there were two things

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.190
that the fifth amendment privilege

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.920
was really supposed to prevent.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.360
One was that while the
English system relied

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.360
on grand juries and petty
juries and cross examination,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.380
confrontational trials,
the European system

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.190
of the Founding era
even as late as the end

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.350
of the 18th century still
relied on juridical torture.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.330
So, if there was a lot
of preliminary proof,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.530
if it's super probable
cause against a suspect

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.730
in say France or Germany,
the judges will authorize

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.010
to torture the target into confessing.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.430
They didn't want to adopt
this inquisitorial practices

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.930
of continental Europe.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.180
And the other great abuse
behind the privilege

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.390
was the Court of Star Chamber's
use of the oath ex officio

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.530
which was witnesses were
called before the Star Chamber

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.060
without knowing what the
investigation was about,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.300
whether they were a target,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.120
what they were suspected of doing,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.250
and the first thing that happened

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.310
was they were obliged to swear an oath.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.330
And there was a famous
case involving a man

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.310
named John Lilburne who
refused to take the oath

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.880
and was torturously punished
by the Court of Star Chamber

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.970
for refusing to take that
oath they pilloried him

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.720
and they flogged him, and
his case was seen as kind of

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.231
an example of the kinds of
abuses that might be done

00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:09.231
by asking questions subject to
oaths where the answer might

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.420
incriminate you or expose your to perjury,

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.950
or expose your soul to
eternal consequences.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.940
So, those two things were behind

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.568
the privilege against self-incrimination.

00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:20.401
The Founders didn't want either of those

00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:23.690
to come back from the past
to haunt the new continent.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.160
- [Kim] Say that I have committed a crime,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.380
what might happen?

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.820
Are police or investigators required

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.547
to tell me about my right
not to self-incriminate?

00:12:33.547 --> 00:12:36.690
- [Saltzburg] Starting 1966, in the case

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.350
that many people have now heard
of Miranda versus Arizona.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.490
The United States Supreme Court held

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.180
that when a person is in custody,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.330
that is generally has been arrested

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.000
and the investigators or prosecutors want

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.330
to question the suspect
they have to give a series

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.680
of warnings which are widely
known as the Miranda Warnings.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.257
In short, they have to say to the suspect,

00:13:00.257 --> 00:13:02.607
"You have the right to remain silent.

00:13:02.607 --> 00:13:05.337
"Anything you say can and will be used

00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:07.157
"against you in a court of law.

00:13:07.157 --> 00:13:09.527
"You have the right to
have a lawyer present

00:13:09.527 --> 00:13:13.217
"during any questioning, and
if you cannot afford a lawyer,

00:13:13.217 --> 00:13:15.680
"one will be appointed for you."

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.720
- [Dripps] When the suspect is in custody,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.220
they have to give the
famous Miranda Warning

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.250
that everybody knows from
movies and television

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.710
and so forth, and that's the one case

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.200
where the government is
required to be proactive.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.860
In front of a congressional committee

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.590
or grand jury investigation,
or if you're just a witness

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.380
at a civil trial, and there's a question

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.656
that might expose you
to criminal liability

00:13:37.656 --> 00:13:39.510
you have to claim the privilege.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.547
You have to say, "I refuse
to answer that question

00:13:41.547 --> 00:13:43.700
"on the grounds that
it may incriminate me."

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.703
When the suspect is under arrest

00:13:45.703 --> 00:13:47.920
and the police wanna question him,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.970
they have a different duty.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.620
They have a duty to
proactively give him a warning

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.060
to make sure that he
understands his rights,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.990
that he doesn't have to
say anything to the police,

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.570
that what he does say could
be admissible against him.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.210
- [Kim] So, we've learned
that the fifth amendment

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.370
protects citizens from
possible abuses of power

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.470
by the government when an individual

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.040
is charged with a crime.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.410
It requires a grand jury to determine

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.960
whether an individual should
be indicted for a crime.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.190
Limits the number of times an individual

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.280
can be tried for the same crime.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.820
Protects people from
self-incrimination and requires

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.130
that the government follow fair procedures

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.660
in prosecuting the law.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.460
