MALE SPEAKER: What
happened to the logo?

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.920
Actually, you know what?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.910
Ouch.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.235
Can't take it out, sorry.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:15.360
BRIAN FORD: Need some help?

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.406
I have it on my shirt, too.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:23.530
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I know.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.930
BRIAN FORD: We'll be good.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.720
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.050
Hi, we're back here
at Devoxx 2013.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.180
Devoxx has been a great year,
I think, a great addition

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.380
for a lot of technologies,
Angular in particular,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.069
and I'm here with Brian.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.860
BRIAN FORD: Thanks.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.068
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome, Brian.

00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:41.240
And you're here to talk
about testing, and testing,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.720
in particular, web apps,
JavaScript, obviously not just

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.740
Angular, right?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.480
And you had a session
a couple days ago

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.062
about Karma, so give us
the introduction on Karma.

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:52.770
BRIAN FORD: Sure.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.850
So Karma is a JavaScript
unit test runner

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.430
developed by a guy, Vojta, who
also works with me on Angular.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.410
And what's cool about Karma
is that it kind of harnesses

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.040
real web browsers, so you can
quickly test your JavaScript

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.412
app right as you're
developing it.

00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:13.870
MALE SPEAKER: The
quick feedback is

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.050
key, that's what
you're looking for.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.852
BRIAN FORD: Yeah.

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:17.810
MALE SPEAKER: So how soon
do you run this test?

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.780
On save, or--

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.070
BRIAN FORD: Yeah, so
Karma's pretty configurable,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.150
but the typical setup
that we have is you

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.850
start Karma when you
start developing,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.040
and you can specify which
files it will watch.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.260
It can even watch CoffeeScript
files, for instance,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.730
and it'll recompile
everything, load it up

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.830
in however many browsers
you want to open up,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.090
and have it hook into,
and then it'll quickly

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.260
give you the tests.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.790
So for some idea of how
this works in practice,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.850
we have something like
2,400 tests with Angular.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.570
And when you're
developing in Angular,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.130
you might touch
some certain part

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.542
of the framework that has
kind of a wide impact,

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:04.000
so you want to be able to run
all these tests very quickly.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.970
So on each save, Karma will
run all of these 2,400 tests

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.360
in just a couple seconds.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.729
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.437
BRIAN FORD: Yeah.

00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:13.880
So it's all about being
fast and about getting

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.660
immediate feedback so
you can immediately

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.855
see the effects of your changes.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:19.730
MALE SPEAKER: But you
can also integrate this

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.787
into a continuous
integration, I suppose?

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:22.870
BRIAN FORD: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.450
We also run this on our
continuous integration server.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.850
It has all sorts of
plug-ins and hooks,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.300
so you can get email
notifications, it does Tap,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.340
it does all of these
sort of things.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.720
We run it in like
a Jenkins set up.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.150
So it's very versatile.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.660
It's an excellent tool.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.030
MALE SPEAKER: So you
actually-- this is not linked--

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.520
and you mentioned CoffeeScript--
in any way to Angular.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.654
You can actually use
it with Dart or other--

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:52.112
BRIAN FORD: Right,
that's the idea.

00:02:52.112 --> 00:02:56.800
The idea is that through a
kind of a plug-in system,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.600
Karma can automatically
recompile or transpile,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.200
or it can do some
small subset of your

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.100
build process to get
your web app going,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.250
and then it can quickly iterate
through and do these tests.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.460
MALE SPEAKER: And these are
mostly unit tests, right?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.210
Do you have anything
that goes beyond that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.982
that could look like scenarios,
integration tests, or anything?

00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:18.440
BRIAN FORD: So at
the moment, we do

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.710
have a scenario runner for
Angular that works with Karma,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.640
but another Googler,
Julie, has been developing

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.860
this new tool called Protractor.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.550
And Protractor is an
Angular-specific, I guess,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.270
scenario runner,
but it's very cool.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.990
And I think you can kind
of take a look at it.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.830
And perhaps in the
future we'll extend it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.320
so it's a bit more general.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.310
But for now, it's very cool.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.870
If you're developing
an Angular app

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.760
and you want a better
end-to-end experience, better

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.710
end-to-end testing
experience, Protractor

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.630
is a very cool project.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.500
MALE SPEAKER: So one
of the reasons people--

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.050
one of the key features
of Angular, I suppose,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.900
is the dependency
injections, which

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.070
makes it much more easy to test.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.970
So how do you go about testing
other languages and frameworks?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.665
Is it any harder than it
is to test Angular code?

00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:13.040
BRIAN FORD: So it
really depends.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.170
Like you said,
Angular's kind of been

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.003
designed from the ground
up, so that way you

00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:18.250
can easily decompose
it into its parts

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.040
and test each in isolation.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.800
So as long as you've done a good
job separating your concerns,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.130
it's not too hard
to test in Karma.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.770
But one of the cool
things is, because Karma

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.790
is using real browsers,
you can do things,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.270
you can manipulate the Dom,
you can run parts of your app

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.322
just as they would
run in production,

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.030
and then make those
kind of checks on it.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.200
So it depends.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.340
I know that other libraries--
Backbone, jquery apps--

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.080
people have written plug-ins
and people have written helper

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.365
libraries to make testing
with Karma easier.

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.990
But really, as long as you do a
good job architecting your app,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.990
there's no reason you
can't use Karma with it.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.823
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:00.300
So this is a standalone project.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.200
Where does it stand,
in terms of versions,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.080
and then what's ahead
for the project?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.510
BRIAN FORD: So I don't know what
the actual version number is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.010
for it, but at the
moment, it's very stable.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.380
We just kind of have
bug fixes at this point.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.750
I'm not sure what Vojta's
plans are for the future of it.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.620
Again, it's got
kind of this more

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.010
of a horizontal architecture.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.960
So at this point,
future development

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.120
is more or less
about adding plug-ins

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.914
to add more options
for yourself.

00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:35.330
MALE SPEAKER: BuilD
the ecosystem.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.980
BRIAN FORD: Right, right.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.646
But it's not something
that, really, you

00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:40.240
need to add too much more
to the core of besides

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.081
if we can make it faster, or
if we can make it more stable,

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:43.580
somehow.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.450
MALE SPEAKER: So what's
a good place to start?

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.480
What kind of URL can
you share with us?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.260
BRIAN FORD: Let's
see, I think it's--

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.140
MALE SPEAKER: Thekarmarunner?

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.910
BRIAN FORD:
Karma-runner.github.io,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.050
or something like that.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.370
Just search for it on GitHub.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.661
That's the best way to find it.

00:05:58.661 --> 00:05:59.612
Karma Runner.

00:05:59.612 --> 00:06:01.320
MALE SPEAKER: Great,
well, Brian, thanks.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.930
That's all the time we have for.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.590
Thanks for answering
my questions.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.770
BRIAN FORD: No, thank
you for having me.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.561
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.125
Cheers.
