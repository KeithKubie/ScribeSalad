and thinking about the importance of my

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
and thinking about the importance of my
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.390
and thinking about the importance of my
work and especially in preparing for my

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400
work and especially in preparing for my
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600
work and especially in preparing for my
Nobel lecture I'm struck at how many

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
Nobel lecture I'm struck at how many
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.140
Nobel lecture I'm struck at how many
different people did important work and

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150
different people did important work and
 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.960
different people did important work and
often they're forgotten or not

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
often they're forgotten or not
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.820
often they're forgotten or not
completely forgotten but largely

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
completely forgotten but largely
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.290
completely forgotten but largely
forgotten so I'm inclined to reflect

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
forgotten so I'm inclined to reflect
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.800
forgotten so I'm inclined to reflect
that the Nobel Prizes is quite a rare

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
that the Nobel Prizes is quite a rare
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.330
that the Nobel Prizes is quite a rare
event it's not enough to do good work it

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
event it's not enough to do good work it
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.810

has to somehow be really highly regarded

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
has to somehow be really highly regarded
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.000
has to somehow be really highly regarded
and I just feel that there are so many

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
and I just feel that there are so many
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.670
and I just feel that there are so many
other people who are highly deserving I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
other people who are highly deserving I
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.559
other people who are highly deserving I
feel humbled by the thought of that
