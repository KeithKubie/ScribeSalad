00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.500
What if all of my
footage was this close?

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.500
Ah, that hurt my stomach I
started laughing so hard.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.100
What?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.370
Like, every single
scene was this close.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.970
Oh my God.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.030
Oh, there goes the camera.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.470
Oh, crap.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.500
OK, calm it down.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.330
That was a moment of insanity.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.000
So with that said,
it's time to get up.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.430
I think today will be
a good day for fishing.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.630
I feel it.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.970
The water's at a
good level today.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.500
Here we go.
That's a good one.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.800
This one got my bait.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.430
I can't wait to take
Campbell fishing.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.870
We'll rent a canoe and go out.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.030
I know he's going to love it.
There we go.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.030
Time with my son is what I look
forward to more than anything

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.170
else.
He's not just my son.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.930
He's my friend.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.130
Can't wait to watch
all the amazing things

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.000
he's going to do and to be front
and center for all of them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.800
there we go.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.630
Something's a little bigger.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.100
See, you catch one more, then
you want to keep fishing.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100
I've got one more
grasshopper in my pocket.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.070
How about I give it
a few more minutes?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.030
My strategy is working basically
exactly as I thought it would.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.930
I am pleasantly surprised
with the amount of fish

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.170
I've been able to
pull out of the water.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.670
I wonder if anybody's doing
as well as me with the fish.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.970
Because I would define what
I'm doing as killing the fish.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.000
Good haul.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.400
This one has a big
belly right here.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.300
Wonder why.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.700
It's a small fish and big belly.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.530
This had a really full stomach.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.800
Wow!

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.130
I'm gonna have to cut that
open and see what that is.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.130
That thing has been eating.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.930
There's the grasshopper
that was there.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.200
And this is what
else was in there.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.030
You kidding me?

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.270
Look at that.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.700
That looks like a mouse.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.730
Let me get it all the way out.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.670
That's incredible.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.230
I don't want to be limited
to how many fish I can hold.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.070
Right now, I am.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.070
I need to try smoking my fish.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.800
So I'll take a
whole line of fish,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.630
string it from one
raft to the other,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.630
and then just keep a good,
smoky fire going all day.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.100
Now after a while, they'll
firm up and find their groove

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.330
and they won't slide off.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.370
So we'll be fine.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.900
Everything is perfect right now.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.930
It's really smoking
that stuff up.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.030
Big plumes of direct smoke.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.030
Operation smoke house.
