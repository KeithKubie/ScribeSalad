00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:01.451
- [Narrator] We have the graph

00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:04.366
of y is equal to h of x right over here.

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:08.806
They ask us does the
intermediate value theorem

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:12.124
apply to h over the closed interval

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:13.533
from negative one to four.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.346
The closed interval from
negative one to four

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:19.040
right over here.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.117
We can first remind ourselves what is

00:00:21.117 --> 00:00:22.670
the intermediate value theorem.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.827
Although you don't have to even know

00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:25.450
what the theorem is actually saying,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.435
you just have to remember that

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:28.031
the intermediate value theorem

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:31.440
only applies over closed intervals

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.542
where the function is continuous.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:36.108
You just have to say, you might

00:00:36.108 --> 00:00:37.080
be tempted to say wait, wait

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.416
this function has a point of discontinuity

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.864
but this is outside of that interval.

00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:44.142
The interval we care
about at negative one,

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:46.392
this is the value of h of x

00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.622
and then at four this is the value

00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:53.246
of h of x and you can see over

00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:55.888
that entire interval right over here,

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:58.628
the function is continuous.

00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:00.526
First, I would definitely say it meets

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.281
the continuity requirement,
it's continuous

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.280
over this closed interval.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.455
I would say yes, it does,

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:08.804
the intermediate value theorem does apply.

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.719
Since it does apply, I will be

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.647
able to say that by the
intermediate value theorem

00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:16.388
because we are continuous
over this closed interval,

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:18.943
the function in this case, h of x

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:20.958
will take on every value between

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.320
h of negative one and h of four,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.887
including those values.

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:27.785
H of negative one, eyeballing it,

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:29.376
looks like it's negative three.

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:31.687
H of four looks like it's zero.

00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:34.006
We know by the intermediate value theorem

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:35.456
that we take on every value

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:38.123
between negative three and zero.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.676
You can even see that right over here.

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:41.867
It actually does take on every one

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:45.284
of those values in this part of the curve

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:50.436
right over there.

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.519
Let's do another example.

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:57.368
Here we're asked does the
extreme value theorem apply

00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:59.047
to g over the closed interval

00:01:59.047 --> 00:02:00.547
from zero to five.

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:02.832
Once again before we even think about

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:06.357
what the extreme value theorem says,

00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:07.342
we have to remember that just like

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:09.228
the intermediate value theorem

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.605
it only applies over closed intervals

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:13.592
where the function is continuous

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:15.072
over the entire interval.

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:16.769
Let's see, is our function continuous

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.492
on the closed interval from zero to five?

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:20.992
From zero to five.

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:25.831
No we clearly have a discontinuity

00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.265
right over here at x is equal to three.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:31.630
First of all, we would say no.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.254
We can't say that over
this closed interval,

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:39.113
that we have a well defined
maximum or minimum value.

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:40.548
This is actually very clear over here

00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:43.157
that you don't have well
defined maximum value,

00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:44.504
we approach infinity over there

00:02:44.504 --> 00:02:46.449
and then we approach
negative infinity over there.

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.016
Extreme value theorem does not apply.

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:52.235
If instead it had offered
us a closed interval

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.624
where we were continuous,
say they said between

00:02:55.624 --> 00:03:00.354
negative two and zero, let's
say it's that interval.

00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:01.313
It is a different color.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.851
Say it's between negative two and zero.

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.589
Then the extreme value theorem would apply

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.241
where you would say
okay, over this interval,

00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:11.284
the function has a well
defined minimum value

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:12.909
and a maximum value.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.621
In this case it would actually be,

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.289
the maximum would happen
at the right bound

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.925
and the minimum value
happens at the left bound.

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:21.452
But for this case, the closed interval,

00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:22.714
the one that we started with,

00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:24.932
definitely is not continuous so we do not,

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:29.557
we would not say that the
extreme value theorem applies.

00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:31.485
Let's do one more example.

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:32.878
Does the extreme value theorem apply

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:37.213
to f over the interval from
negative five to negative two?

00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:39.822
Once again, let's just
look at the interval.

00:03:39.822 --> 00:03:43.739
We're going from negative
five to negative two.

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:48.186
This is our function over that interval

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:52.423
from x equals negative five
to x equals negative two.

00:03:52.423 --> 00:03:53.917
Even though there is a discontinuity

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:55.861
in this graph that we
see, it's sitting outside

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:56.817
of the interval.

00:03:56.817 --> 00:03:59.977
We only care about what's
happening inside of the interval.

00:03:59.977 --> 00:04:02.326
There we actually are continuous.

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:04.329
We're continuous over
this closed interval.

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.549
Because of that we know that
the extreme value theorem

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.983
would apply, that there is a well defined

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:13.345
minimum and maximum
value over the interval.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:14.623
You can see that the maximum value here

00:04:14.623 --> 00:04:17.090
happens when at f of negative two,

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.409
it's looks like it's around negative 3.5

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:20.942
or so, or negative 3.6.

00:04:20.942 --> 00:04:22.566
Then the minimum value over this interval

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:26.643
looks like it happens
at f of negative five.

00:04:26.643 --> 00:04:29.880
It looks like it's pretty
close to negative four

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.428
because it looks like
we're just increasing

00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:34.295
over this entire interval.

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:37.607
But the important thing here
is to recognize continuity.

00:04:37.607 --> 00:04:38.781
Continuity does not have to apply

00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:42.059
to the entire function or
over its entire domain,

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.944
it just has to be true
over the closed interval

00:04:45.944 --> 00:04:49.479
that we are trying to
apply these theorems to.
