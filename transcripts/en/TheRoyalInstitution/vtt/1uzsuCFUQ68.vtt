00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.660
My friend has a theory that Elvis isn't really
dead. He says that Elvis got tired of the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.980
limelight and faked his own death.
He also has a theory that aliens regularly

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.640
come to the Earth... but the government keeps
their visits a secret.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.470
His weirdest theory is that all the leaders
of the world are actually shape-shifting extra-terrestrial

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.040
reptiles pretending to be human.
I have a hunch that my friend only says these

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
things to make himself sound clever down the
pub. You could say that I have a theory about

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.750
my friend's theories. But really, I'm just
guessing at what motivates him to say such

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.420
outlandish things.
My theory about my friend is just a theory

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.250
- it could be wrong. Maybe he really does
believe the things he says... in which case

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.360
there may be other explanations, or theories,
to explain why my friend is such a fan of

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.560
these conspiracy theories.
As for me, I'm a fan of scientific theories.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.869
Like the Big Bang Theory, the Theory of Evolution
by Natural Selection, the Germ Theory of Disease,

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.540
Plate Tectonics Theory, The Theories of Special
and General Relativity and, my favourite, Quantum Theory.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.680
Some people say that these are "just theories"

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.799
and believe that they have not been proven
by science. They talk and think about them

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.170
as somehow inferior ideas about how the world
works because they are called "theories" rather

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.930
than say "facts" or "laws".
But these people are mistaken. It's not entirely

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.990
their fault. It's because the word "theory"
doesn't mean quite the same thing in the world

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.469
of science as it does when used in general
conversation, where it can mean a guess or

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.549
a hunch or something that isn't quite known
for sure.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.259
When scientists call something a theory, they
mean a set of ideas that does three things:

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.930
One: a scientific theory puts forward a comprehensive
explanation for things we observe in nature

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.880
Two: a scientific theory provides strong evidence
for that explanation

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.880
Three: Perhaps most importantly, a scientific
theory provides ways to make predictions about

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.349
the aspect of the world it explains, which
we can then test by further observation.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.760
In every day conversation, we can dismiss
someone's idea about something by saying "it's

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.370
just a theory". But we can't dismiss the theories
of Darwin and Einstein and other great scientists

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.370
in the same way.
In science, an idea about how the world works

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.730
usually only gets accepted as a theory once
it's been tested and shown to be supported

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.780
by observations and other evidence - things
that are distinctly lacking from theories

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.510
about Elvis' continued existence, alien visits
to the Earth and shape-shifting reptiles running

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.810
the world.
What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.690
make sense to belittle an idea in science
by saying it's "just a theory" because when

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.500
scientists refer to an idea as a theory, well,
they're giving it the highest praise it can have.
