 Publishing an app may not always proceed as planned. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.010
 That's why we created "Start Android with Google." 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.440
 "Start Android" in trial start mode 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.860
 Help select developers to use Google’s primary resources, 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.090
 This way you can launch your app like an expert. 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.900
 Start using Android, 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.340
 You can access a large number of Google Play beta testers. 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.570
 They will provide a wide audience 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.850
 Intimate and honest feedback. 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.290
 You will receive a design review by a Google expert. 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.520
 Technical support and business consulting. 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.550
 Take advantage of Google Play’s advanced developer tools 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.460
 To iterate this feedback, 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.200
 To build your best version of the app. 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.870
 So if you are launching an app 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.180
 And looking for guidance and support, 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.770
