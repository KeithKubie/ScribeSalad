00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.976
Some of the best opportunities to learn

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are the moments in which we are perplexed.

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:20.976
Those moments in which you
begin to wonder and question.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.239
These moments have happened
throughout history.

00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:25.502
and have led to some truly
amazing discoveries.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:26.976
Take this story, for example.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.976
There once was a fellow named Archimedes.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.976
He was born in 287 B.C. in the city
of Syracuse in Sicily.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.976
He was a Greek mathematician,
physicist, engineer,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.976
inventor, and astronomer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.976
One day, Archimedes was summoned
by the king of Sicily

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.976
to investigate if he had
been cheated by a goldsmith.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The king said he had given a goldsmith
the exact amount of gold

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.976
needed to make a crown.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.976
However, when the crown was ready, the king
suspected that the goldsmith cheated

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.976
and slipped some silver into the crown,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.976
keeping some of the gold for himself.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.976
The king asked Archimedes
to solve the problem.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.976
But there was a catch: he couldn't
do any damage to the crown.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.976
One day, while taking his bath,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.976
Archimedes noticed that the water
level in the bathtub rose

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.976
and overflowed as he immersed
himself into the tub.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.976
He suddenly realized that how much
water was displaced

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.976
depended on how much
of his body was immersed.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.048
This discovery excited him so much
that he jumped out of the tub

00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:23.976
and ran through the streets
naked, shouting "Eureka!"

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.976
Which comes from the ancient
Greek meaning "I found it."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.976
What did he find?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.286
Well, he found a way
to solve the king's problem.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.976
You see, Archimedes needed
to check the crown's density

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.976
to see if it was the same
as the density of pure gold.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Density is a measure of an object's mass
divided by its volume.

00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:42.976
Pure gold is very dense,
while silver is less dense.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.976
So if there was silver in the crown, it would be
less dense than if it were made of pure gold.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.286
But no matter what it was made of,
the crown would be the same shape,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.976
which means the same volume.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.976
So if Archimedes could measure
the mass of the crown first,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.976
and then measure its volume,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.976
he could find out how dense it was.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.976
But it is not easy to measure
a crown's volume - it has an irregular shape,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.048
that's different
from a simple box or ball.

00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:07.976
You can't measure its size and multiply
like you might for other shapes.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.976
The solution, Archimedes realized,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.976
was to give the crown a bath.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
by placing it in water and seeing
how much water was displaced,

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:17.976
he could measure the volume,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.976
and he'd calculate
the density of the crown.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.048
If the crown was less
dense than pure gold,

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:25.976
then the goldsmith most definitely
cheated the king.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.976
When Archimedes went back
to the king and did his test,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.976
the story says, he found that the goldsmith
had indeed cheated the king,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
and slipped some silver in. These days,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.191
using the way an object displaces
water to measure volume is called

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:41.976
Archimedes' principle. The
next time you take a bath,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.976
you can see Archimedes'
principle in action,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and maybe you'll have
a genius idea of your own.
