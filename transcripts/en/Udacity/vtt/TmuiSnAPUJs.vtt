The IGP or the intra-domain routing protocol, disseminates routes inside an AS

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.210
to internal destinations. Whereas iGBP or

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.570
internal-gateway border protocol, disseminates routes inside an

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.265
AS to external destinations. So let's suppose that a router inside

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:25.630
AS-A is trying to reach a destination inside AS-B. ASA would learn the route

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.730
by EBGP. And the next topic of course, at this router, would be the border

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.190
router at B. And now a router inside autonomous system A would learn the route

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.250
to B via IBGP. Then the BGP next stop, would be the border router. And so, this

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.740
router inside ASA, needs to use the IGP, to reach the iGBP, next hop.
