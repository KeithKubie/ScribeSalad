00:00:00.651 --> 00:00:01.150
Let's see.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.500
We have this graph
over here with t

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.220
is the independent variable
on the horizontal axis

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.967
and d is the dependent
variable on the vertical axis.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:11.300
And then they have a table here.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.740
Looks like this table
corresponds to this graph.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.090
When t equals 1, d is 40,
when t is equal to 2, d is 80.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.760
So these points correspond
to points on this line.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.560
And then they explain to us,
you are buying a gym membership.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.600
The membership
costs $40 per month.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.710
In the graph and table above, d
is the total number of dollars

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.360
that you pay for
your gym membership,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.630
so that's d right over there,
and t is the time in months

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.240
that you keep the membership.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.340
Write an equation for
the amount of money

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.920
d that you pay for
your gym membership,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.490
if you keep the
membership for t months.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.440
And you see that here.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.870
If you're one
month, you pay $40,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.420
two months you pay
another $40, you pay $80.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.960
You see that in the
graph right over here.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810
If you have 0 months,
you pay nothing.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.710
Then one month, $40, the
next month another $40

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.060
getting you to $80.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.040
So if I were to write
this as an equation,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.660
the dependent variable
here is the amount

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.070
that I pay in dollars.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.110
So that is going to
depend on the time.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.290
And how is it going to
depend on the time in months?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.660
Well I'm going to pay
$40 per month times

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.590
the number of months.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.910
So I can either write it as
40 with a little asterisk

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.050
sign, which is Shift 8--
and then I put t there--

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
or I could literally put
just a t right over there.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.910
And I think that's right,
because if my time is 0

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.580
according to this table and
according to this graph,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.251
I pay nothing.

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:39.250
If there was some initial
membership charge then

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.310
maybe we would add
that membership charge

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.310
and you would pay the
monthly fee after that.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.840
But here this looks about
right, that the dollars

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.210
paid is equal to 40
times the time in months.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.870
The time in months is
the independent variable.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.740
It drives the
dependent variable,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.640
the number of dollars you pay.
