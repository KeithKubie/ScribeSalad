these up and what insurance allows

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
these up and what insurance allows
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.779
these up and what insurance allows
people to do is to recover from that

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789
people to do is to recover from that

days there's a payout people can pay for

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
days there's a payout people can pay for
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.789

the funeral people can pay off their

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
the funeral people can pay off their
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.660
the funeral people can pay off their
loans people can have some money to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670
loans people can have some money to
 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.859
loans people can have some money to
continue the business and get it to a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
continue the business and get it to a
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.169
continue the business and get it to a
point where they can run it six months

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179
point where they can run it six months
 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.340
point where they can run it six months
later so this insurance may seem like a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
later so this insurance may seem like a
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740
later so this insurance may seem like a
small thing because it only costs a few

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
small thing because it only costs a few
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.320
small thing because it only costs a few
dollars but it provides people with the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
dollars but it provides people with the
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.090
dollars but it provides people with the
ability to recover from shock and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
ability to recover from shock and
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.440
ability to recover from shock and
actually globally studies have shown

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450
actually globally studies have shown
 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.460
actually globally studies have shown
particularly the work of Nobel laureate

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

Amartya Sen has shown that the poram

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
Amartya Sen has shown that the poram
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.110
Amartya Sen has shown that the poram
poor often because they have these

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120
poor often because they have these
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.210
poor often because they have these
adverse shocks they do actually

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220
adverse shocks they do actually
 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.760
adverse shocks they do actually
accumulate assets over time and then

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770
accumulate assets over time and then
 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.340
accumulate assets over time and then
they fall back under the poverty line so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350
they fall back under the poverty line so
 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.100
they fall back under the poverty line so
the the importance of this cannot be

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110
the the importance of this cannot be
 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.710
the the importance of this cannot be
underestimated I think it is the one of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
underestimated I think it is the one of
 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.260
underestimated I think it is the one of
the most central if not the most central

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
the most central if not the most central

development interventions in the world
 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.800
development interventions in the world
and the exciting thing is it's

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
and the exciting thing is it's
 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.420
and the exciting thing is it's
profitable now just to take a step back

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430
profitable now just to take a step back
 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.930
profitable now just to take a step back
that why is it profitable well if you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940
that why is it profitable well if you
 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.840
that why is it profitable well if you
think in pure actuarial hard-nosed

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850
think in pure actuarial hard-nosed
 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.600

business terms insurance is about risk

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610
business terms insurance is about risk
 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.910
business terms insurance is about risk
and it's about predicting what's going

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920
and it's about predicting what's going
 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.380
and it's about predicting what's going
to happen an insurance company takes

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390
to happen an insurance company takes
 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.780
to happen an insurance company takes
money tries to predict what's going to

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790
money tries to predict what's going to
 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.250
money tries to predict what's going to
happen and promises to make a certain

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
happen and promises to make a certain
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.920
happen and promises to make a certain
payout at a later at a later date and it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
payout at a later at a later date and it
 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.449
payout at a later at a later date and it
takes some money for doing that and for

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459
takes some money for doing that and for
 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.880
takes some money for doing that and for
sharing the risk pool for organizing a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890
sharing the risk pool for organizing a
 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.480
sharing the risk pool for organizing a
risk pool now what makes something

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490
risk pool now what makes something
 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.840
risk pool now what makes something
predictable well it's large numbers you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850
predictable well it's large numbers you
 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.270
predictable well it's large numbers you
would rather have a million people

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
would rather have a million people
 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.160
would rather have a million people
you're insuring at a lower cost then a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170
you're insuring at a lower cost then a
 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.650
you're insuring at a lower cost then a
thousand people you're insuring at for a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
thousand people you're insuring at for a
 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.740
thousand people you're insuring at for a
higher premium that they're going to pay

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750
higher premium that they're going to pay
 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.240
higher premium that they're going to pay
so the incredibly exciting thing about

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
so the incredibly exciting thing about
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.330
so the incredibly exciting thing about
micro insurance is you can sell a huge

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340
micro insurance is you can sell a huge
 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.030
micro insurance is you can sell a huge
numbers of policies at low margins to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040
numbers of policies at low margins to
 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.640
numbers of policies at low margins to
huge numbers of people and your risk

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650
huge numbers of people and your risk
 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.430
huge numbers of people and your risk
pool becomes quite predictable and that

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440
pool becomes quite predictable and that
 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.370
pool becomes quite predictable and that
makes it much easier to manage so even

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380
makes it much easier to manage so even
 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.080
makes it much easier to manage so even
though you're taking a smaller cut on

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090
though you're taking a smaller cut on
 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.500
though you're taking a smaller cut on
each policy you're actually doing

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
each policy you're actually doing
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.970
each policy you're actually doing
fundamentally in some ways a better

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980
fundamentally in some ways a better
 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.610
fundamentally in some ways a better
business now the important thing is

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620
business now the important thing is
 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.229
business now the important thing is
you've really got to get your costs low

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239
you've really got to get your costs low
 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.570
you've really got to get your costs low
because if you're selling a policy for
