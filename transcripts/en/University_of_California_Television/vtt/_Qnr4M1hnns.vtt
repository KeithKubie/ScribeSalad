00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:05.067
(clicking and chiming sounds)

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.384
- We hope you enjoy the next
two days and we're very please

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.699
to kick off the conference
with a really wonderful panel

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.869
which Lucy is gonna introduced.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.228
- Thank you.

00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:24.728
Not really a panel but
- It's two speakers.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.293
- You call that a panel?
- It's a panel.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:31.043
- Oh alright, okay (laughs).

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.866
We are please to have Shelton Dent

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:39.862
who's standing for Nancy Bargmann.

00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:44.611
Well Shelton has spoken
at this conference before

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.541
and he doesn't need to be
described as a stand-in.

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:52.708
He's a stand alone speaker
and he is the assistant deputy

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:57.307
director of programs and policy branch

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.046
for the department of
developmental services.

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:01.412
Has worked with people

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:04.393
with disabilities for nearly 40 years

00:01:04.393 --> 00:01:08.166
and has been with DDS
for, I believe 31 years.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.499
And he will be followed by on the panel.

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:14.280
- On the panel.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.183
- Eric Zigman who is
the executive director

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:19.335
of Golden Gate Regional Center

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:23.884
and I didn't get all that
background info on you Eric.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:27.467
So you have to describe
yourself a bit more

00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:31.689
- [Eric] I'm not that interesting.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.856
- Not that interesting.
- Oh I bet it is, I bet it is.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.617
- And so Mr. Dent, will you
come to the podium please.

00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:47.970
Welcome back.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.887
- Thank you, thank you.

00:01:57.178 --> 00:01:58.451
Good morning everybody.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.635
- [Audience] Good morning.

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:03.993
- Alright, first of all Nancy
Bargmann wanted to make sure

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:06.045
that I apologize profusely for her.

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:08.809
She sincerely wanted to
come to this meeting.

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.452
She knows that there's a lot of clinicians

00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:12.612
and such that she doesn't
get to speak to very often

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:15.384
so she really wanted to be apart of this.

00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:18.463
But one of the things that got in the way

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:21.593
but is helpful to all of
us is the budget hearings.

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:24.343
So she had to go up to the Senate

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:32.098
and our representatives to talk
about our next state budget.

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:34.215
And she's doing that and
doing a great job of it.

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:35.949
Some of you might have
saw her on the CalChannel

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:38.491
just yesterday, talking
about budget issues

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.981
and that is what called her away.

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:44.218
One of the things she asked me to do

00:02:44.218 --> 00:02:46.634
and it still says Nancy
Bargmann on her presentation

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:47.881
'cause it is her presentation.

00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:49.437
I'll try to do it justice

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:52.957
but it is what she wanted
me to go over for you today.

00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:57.124
An update on the developmental
disabilities service system.

00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:01.634
So I'm also suppose to let you know

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:04.935
that I don't have any thing to disclose.

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:09.102
So with that said, The Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:17.025
Services Act, as you
know was passed in 1969.

00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:20.106
And it just celebrated
its 50th anniversary.

00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:22.666
But the biggest thing about
this Lanterman Entitlement Act

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:25.586
is that it's the only Entitlement Act

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:27.257
of all of the 50 states.

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:30.362
So California has the only
entitlement for services

00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:33.945
for people with
developmental disabilities.

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:45.734
We have a mission statement,
we have a vision statement.

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:48.525
The mission statement
is to ensure that people

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:50.911
with developmental
disabilities have the ability

00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:53.828
to live lives just as you and I do.

00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:58.319
Our mission statement
is that and our vision

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.252
building partnerships
and supporting choices

00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:03.847
is really about a system
of partnering with folks

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:07.899
so that our system works together as one.

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:12.066
It's a system structure
for people to work together

00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.715
and agencies to work together
and everybody to work together

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.902
to make services support
available for people

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:20.799
with developmental disabilities.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.882
When we look at our system structure,

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:25.762
you'll notice that it starts

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:27.546
with the governor's office of course.

00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:29.314
We have the health and
human services agency

00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:31.083
which the departmental
and developmental services

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:35.021
is apart of and then we have
the state developmental centers

00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.624
as well as one state
operated community facility.

00:04:37.624 --> 00:04:40.822
Which is run by the state
and has state employees

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.324
and then we contract
with 21 regional centers.

00:04:44.324 --> 00:04:46.763
Often times people call the department

00:04:46.763 --> 00:04:50.073
and ask us to, have an issue
with the regional center

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:52.165
and they want department
of developmental services

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:54.306
to address it immediately.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:57.009
And we often times, unless
it has something to do with

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.155
a violation of law regulation.

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:01.759
We have to refer them back
to the regional center

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.923
because the regional centers are all

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:05.506
and a lot of people are surprised by this.

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:06.433
The regional centers are all

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:08.396
private non-profit organizations

00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:10.391
and they answer to a board of directors.

00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:13.543
Other than violations
of law and regulation

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:16.066
everything else, we can address things

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.938
that have to do with a
violation of law and regulation

00:05:17.938 --> 00:05:19.604
but everything else has to go through

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:22.814
their regional center
director and their board.

00:05:22.814 --> 00:05:24.184
So one of the big examples

00:05:24.184 --> 00:05:26.515
that we get is often times people,

00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:28.416
vendors might get vendored to serve

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:31.658
like a residential provider
might get vendored to serve six

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:33.779
or get license to serve six people.

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.525
And the regional center tells
them, well vendor you forfour

00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:38.052
and they'll call the department and say,

00:05:38.052 --> 00:05:40.111
I got license for six people.

00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:41.579
I want six people in my home.

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:43.806
The regional centers says
they'll only give me four.

00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:45.665
That is not something that the department

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:47.140
can do something about.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.392
That is a regional center
and their board of directors

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:51.973
decision to serve people in that manner.

00:05:51.973 --> 00:05:53.764
And that's how regional
centers were set up

00:05:53.764 --> 00:05:57.200
to do what their local
community feels is the most

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.534
appropriate way to serve folks.

00:05:58.534 --> 00:06:01.586
So that's not a violation
of law and regulation

00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:03.488
and when we get calls
about that we refer them

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:04.624
back to the regional center

00:06:04.624 --> 00:06:07.795
because that's the way our system works.

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:09.727
The regional centers have case managers

00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:11.440
that help coordinate services

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.713
and they vendor service providers

00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:15.894
who actually provide direct services

00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:18.507
and supports to our consumers.

00:06:18.507 --> 00:06:21.795
And all of that is done through a IPP

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:25.045
and a person centered planning process.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.004
So as I said they contract
with these 21 regional centers,

00:06:32.004 --> 00:06:34.207
the 21 regional centers
are private non profit.

00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:35.455
They are 21 regional centers

00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:38.705
to cover all 56 counties of California.

00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:43.741
Regional centers work with
approximately 45,000 vendors

00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:46.214
who provide those direct services

00:06:46.214 --> 00:06:49.797
and we work with a system of
partners, other organizations,

00:06:49.797 --> 00:06:52.021
stakeholder groups, individuals, families

00:06:52.021 --> 00:06:55.771
to implement the vision
of The Lanterman Act.

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:02.981
So what's been going
on the last few years?

00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:04.868
More than a few years I guess.

00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:08.160
From 2002-2016, you can see the growth

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.410
in our consumer population.

00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:16.074
As of December of 2016,
we're serving 304,000 people.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:23.263
When you look at the
regional center population,

00:07:23.263 --> 00:07:24.737
from the smallest regional center,

00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:26.290
Redwood Coast Regional Center,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.645
up at the northern tip of California

00:07:28.645 --> 00:07:30.715
verses Inland Regional
Center in the San Bernadine.

00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:33.677
You see Redwood Coast serving 3600 folks

00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:36.911
and Inland Regional Center 31,300 folks

00:07:36.911 --> 00:07:41.078
with the average regional
center serving 14,000 folks.

00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:47.079
The way this consumer population
is growing essentially

00:07:48.494 --> 00:07:52.494
we could start a new
regional center every year.

00:07:56.892 --> 00:07:59.142
Consumer population by age.

00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:04.690
As we gather this type of
information at the department,

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.362
this is one of the areas
where we look at trends

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.288
to see what's going on and
see what kind of resources

00:08:10.288 --> 00:08:12.379
need to be developed and
what kind of legislation

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:16.225
might need to be addressed to
address some of the trends.

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:18.430
One of the things you'll notice here

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.983
is that our elderly seniors
are beginning to grow

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:24.350
which tells us that our folks

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.163
are starting to live a lot longer.

00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:29.016
One of the things that we've
done to address this is

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:31.324
we've worked with Community Care Licensing

00:08:31.324 --> 00:08:34.539
and you may have notice this already

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.152
but a lot of the Community
Care Licensing folks

00:08:37.152 --> 00:08:39.618
are now starting to allow
people to age in place.

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:43.202
So folks that are in adult
residential facilities

00:08:43.202 --> 00:08:44.963
can stay in adult residential facilities.

00:08:44.963 --> 00:08:48.727
They don't have to simply
move because they turn 60.

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:50.433
Usually the adult residential facilities

00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:53.393
limit is up to 59 years of age.

00:08:53.393 --> 00:08:55.245
But Community Care
Licensing is working with us

00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:57.858
and now for the most
part is allowing people

00:08:57.858 --> 00:08:59.443
unless there's some drastic differences

00:08:59.443 --> 00:09:01.050
between the consumer population.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.725
Will allow people to stay in
adult residential facilities

00:09:03.725 --> 00:09:05.975
for as long as they choose.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.289
Consumer population by living arrangement.

00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:16.213
As you can see developmental
center population continuing

00:09:16.213 --> 00:09:18.909
to go down, less people are living those.

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:22.084
Of course that's because of our initiative

00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:24.541
to close all of our developmental centers.

00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:28.016
And as always have been the
case, regional centers work hard

00:09:28.016 --> 00:09:29.709
to support people and their families.

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:33.894
So the family home, parent/guardian
still continues to grow

00:09:33.894 --> 00:09:36.813
and people continue to
live in their family home

00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:38.480
as long as possible.

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:51.142
When we look at the consumer
population by diagnosis.

00:09:51.142 --> 00:09:55.309
Another thing that you see,
you can clearly see that autism

00:09:56.474 --> 00:09:59.307
growth continues to climb rapidly.

00:10:00.911 --> 00:10:05.120
This is not a secret and
we continue to provide work

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.120
on developing resources
to address those issues.

00:10:13.388 --> 00:10:14.994
Population of developmental centers

00:10:14.994 --> 00:10:18.327
and state operated community facilities.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.519
You can see the steep
decline that started in 1994.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.843
I don't know if people
remembered the Coffel years

00:10:25.843 --> 00:10:29.488
when we were court ordered
to move over 2000 people

00:10:29.488 --> 00:10:32.733
out of developmental centers
within a five year period

00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:34.328
that accounts for the steep decline

00:10:34.328 --> 00:10:36.229
right there in the early years.

00:10:36.229 --> 00:10:39.497
But ever since that time, there
have been laws put in place

00:10:39.497 --> 00:10:42.232
and the lack of federal funding

00:10:42.232 --> 00:10:43.582
for some of our developmental centers,

00:10:43.582 --> 00:10:45.822
actually for all of our
developmental centers at this point.

00:10:45.822 --> 00:10:48.179
Which has cause us to make the initiative

00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:51.512
to close all of our development centers.

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.371
And now we have less than
a thousand people living

00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:57.454
in developmental centers.

00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:05.949
And then we look at a few budget things

00:11:06.804 --> 00:11:08.641
and of course that is also driven

00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:11.505
by the fact that we are closing
our developmental centers.

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:15.482
So there's more growth
in community services

00:11:15.482 --> 00:11:19.305
from 16/17 it was $5.8
billion to community services

00:11:19.305 --> 00:11:23.472
and proposed for 17/18 is $6.4 billion.

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:27.530
That's an interesting stats
by itself because as she said,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.546
I've been doing this services

00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:31.800
for developmental disabilities
for almost 40 years

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.200
and I remember when the budget

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.816
for the whole regional center system

00:11:35.816 --> 00:11:38.067
was less than $20 million.

00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:42.234
So we're in the billions
now and we're working hard.

00:11:50.214 --> 00:11:52.083
And the reason that we're
able to be in the billions

00:11:52.083 --> 00:11:54.959
and the reason that we still
have an Entitlement Act

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:56.842
is the fact that we are able

00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:59.209
to capture more federal dollars.

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:02.209
It is imperative that the department

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.314
and our service system
captures every federal dollars

00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:08.898
we can get in order to
maintain the entitlement

00:12:08.898 --> 00:12:11.230
provided by The Lanterman Act.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.763
As you can see, a little less than 50%

00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:18.828
of our funds are federal but as we move

00:12:18.828 --> 00:12:20.617
from the developmental centers systems

00:12:20.617 --> 00:12:22.444
moving everybody into the community.

00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:24.726
We'll have a lot more pressure still

00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:27.196
to maintain those federal dollars
and the federal government

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:29.363
will still be looking at the community.

00:12:29.363 --> 00:12:32.823
In terms of the dollars that
are spent for federal funding.

00:12:32.823 --> 00:12:34.945
So we'll be under the same
types of pressures really

00:12:34.945 --> 00:12:36.395
as the developmental centers were.

00:12:36.395 --> 00:12:39.647
Developmental centers were
unable to maintain certification

00:12:39.647 --> 00:12:41.984
which is partly what's
led to their closure,

00:12:41.984 --> 00:12:43.832
other than the fact that
people shouldn't have to live

00:12:43.832 --> 00:12:45.621
in state institutions.

00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:47.419
But the other, the
driver of that has to do

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:49.745
with they could not
maintain their certification

00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:51.538
which meant total general fund dollars

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:54.014
were going into funding
the developmental centers.

00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:56.367
That same pressure will
be community because

00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:58.188
through our home and community
based services waivers

00:12:58.188 --> 00:13:00.504
that captures a great
deal of federal funding.

00:13:00.504 --> 00:13:03.403
They'll be out monitoring
to make sure we're meeting

00:13:03.403 --> 00:13:07.857
or complying with the home and
federal waiver requirements.

00:13:07.857 --> 00:13:11.932
And if by chance we're not
following those requirements,

00:13:11.932 --> 00:13:13.919
they will cut federal funding

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:15.951
which is why there is a lot
pressure on regional centers

00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:18.143
and our service system to
capture those federal dollars

00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:21.643
and be in compliance with federal waivers.

00:13:27.647 --> 00:13:29.230
So who do we serve?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.890
As you can see, the Hispanic community

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.890
and our white community
are the primary drivers.

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:55.490
And when we look at who we
serve, we also have to be mindful

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.240
of the unrepresented communities.

00:13:59.937 --> 00:14:02.489
One of the big things
that's talked about a lot

00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:04.863
at the legislature and
within the department

00:14:04.863 --> 00:14:06.492
and within the regional
centers now has to do

00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:10.659
with disparity in services
to different ethnic groups.

00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:16.664
A very interesting issue
that's come up with this

00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:20.877
and another slide will
show you has to do with,

00:14:20.877 --> 00:14:24.127
even though White is still the largest.

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.039
They're starting to go down and Hispanic

00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:30.456
is starting to be a large area of growth.

00:14:31.443 --> 00:14:34.977
However when you look at
the utilization of services,

00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:38.477
you'll see that Hispanic is not utilizing

00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:41.616
a lot of services that
are available to them.

00:14:41.616 --> 00:14:45.783
We find this can be of
course the issue with culture

00:14:47.062 --> 00:14:49.846
but it is something
that we want to address.

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:52.254
And it's something that the
legislature wants to address

00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:55.048
as there have also been
a lot complaints about,

00:14:55.048 --> 00:14:57.708
in different regions where the population

00:14:57.708 --> 00:14:59.818
in Hispanic or Black is high

00:14:59.818 --> 00:15:03.985
and yet utilization of
services seems to be unequal.

00:15:12.593 --> 00:15:15.016
So as you can see from this slide,

00:15:15.016 --> 00:15:17.433
even though Hispanic is high.

00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:23.071
They only utilize 79% of the
services that are authorized.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.724
Another interest thing that we found

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:27.460
with the White population.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.664
They use 84% but they
also are the largest user

00:15:30.664 --> 00:15:34.414
of residential services
which is interesting.

00:15:40.326 --> 00:15:42.458
So what are some of the recent changes

00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:46.480
that have come about
at the department now?

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.762
I'm sure many of you remember back in 2009

00:15:48.762 --> 00:15:50.599
when there were system wide reductions.

00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:53.901
How difficult it was to
get services for anybody.

00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.422
Now that the budget has
started to make a return

00:15:57.422 --> 00:16:00.303
and we've got a little
more funding to our system.

00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:04.470
We're able to as you can see
restore early start program.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:11.687
Restoration of prior services
provider payment reductions,

00:16:11.687 --> 00:16:13.801
rate increases for specific service types

00:16:13.801 --> 00:16:15.827
and to provide additional compensation

00:16:15.827 --> 00:16:18.635
for direct service providers.

00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:21.458
There's additional funding
for a paid internship program

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:22.736
and service provider placement

00:16:22.736 --> 00:16:26.052
incentive funding for competitive
integrated employment.

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:27.917
And I find this one to
be really interesting

00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:30.690
'cause when we did stakeholders meetings

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.989
to talk about how to implement
this paid internship program.

00:16:33.989 --> 00:16:36.667
Legislature provided $10
million for this program

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:38.496
and as I said earlier
that there was a point

00:16:38.496 --> 00:16:41.520
when we only got $20 million
for the entire system

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.431
and we were able to get $10
million for this one program.

00:16:44.431 --> 00:16:46.348
We've come a long ways.

00:16:48.276 --> 00:16:50.159
And we have additional
funding to regional centers

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:52.006
to address purchase
and service disparities

00:16:52.006 --> 00:16:54.442
for underserved populations.

00:16:54.442 --> 00:16:57.217
In fact we get $11 million
annually to address

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:59.467
that issue I just talked about

00:16:59.467 --> 00:17:02.300
between the different ethnicities.

00:17:06.338 --> 00:17:07.508
We also received increased funding

00:17:07.508 --> 00:17:11.595
to address state wide
minimum wage increases.

00:17:11.595 --> 00:17:13.453
Increase funding to facilitate development

00:17:13.453 --> 00:17:15.939
of community resources for
individuals transitioning

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:19.856
from DCs and to meet
challenging service needs.

00:17:23.843 --> 00:17:27.172
We have increased funding for
regional center operations

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.512
including reducing case load ratios

00:17:29.512 --> 00:17:32.196
and new positions at regional centers.

00:17:32.196 --> 00:17:36.103
Some of those new positions
include a cultural specialist,

00:17:36.103 --> 00:17:38.105
an employment specialist

00:17:38.105 --> 00:17:40.826
and a federal program specialist too.

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:43.180
To again ensure that regional
centers are able to comply

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.347
with home and community
based service waiver issues.

00:17:48.533 --> 00:17:50.384
As I said those dollars are going to be

00:17:50.384 --> 00:17:52.301
critical to our system.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.902
And then new DDS
priorities and initiatives.

00:18:03.902 --> 00:18:06.186
Of course one of the reasons
Nancy is not here has to do

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:08.591
with new legislation and funding

00:18:08.591 --> 00:18:12.935
so it's gonna be incumbent
upon us to operationalize

00:18:12.935 --> 00:18:17.294
and implement any new
legislation and funding.

00:18:17.294 --> 00:18:19.435
Home and community based settings.

00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:23.602
The federal rules are out
there for people to review.

00:18:25.684 --> 00:18:27.296
They're critical for our federal dollars

00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:30.479
and we need to be in compliance
with the federal home

00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:32.537
and community based settings rules.

00:18:32.537 --> 00:18:36.704
By March of 2019, we have
new community service models.

00:18:38.798 --> 00:18:40.716
Enhance behavior support homes.

00:18:40.716 --> 00:18:42.205
We have adult residential facilities

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:44.804
for persons with special
health care needs.

00:18:44.804 --> 00:18:47.982
We have added delayed egress
secure perimeter services

00:18:47.982 --> 00:18:50.526
to our residential
programs that's available

00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:52.943
for folks to use when needed.

00:18:56.596 --> 00:18:58.521
One of the things I would
say about the enhance

00:18:58.521 --> 00:19:03.354
or what is also called the (ARFPSHN)

00:19:03.354 --> 00:19:05.033
or the Adult Residential
Facility for Persons

00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:06.974
with Special Healthcare Needs.

00:19:06.974 --> 00:19:09.753
They are starting to grow rapidly.

00:19:09.753 --> 00:19:14.536
They have proven to be a
very effective and successful

00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:18.171
service for people that
are medically fragile.

00:19:18.171 --> 00:19:21.133
In fact, hopefully one of the initiatives

00:19:21.133 --> 00:19:25.421
might be to spread that
program for children

00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:27.341
that are medically fragile.

00:19:27.341 --> 00:19:30.526
That's what we're looking at next.

00:19:30.526 --> 00:19:33.780
We already have, in past
I've talked about (ARFPSHN)

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.157
program because it was modeled
after the special program

00:19:38.157 --> 00:19:42.110
for children which was
previously called Bates Homes.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.761
And the (ARFPSHN) was modeled after that

00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:45.177
but the problem with the Bates Homes

00:19:45.177 --> 00:19:46.322
is that they can only be done

00:19:46.322 --> 00:19:48.718
in small family homes or foster homes.

00:19:48.718 --> 00:19:50.511
We wanna expand that program

00:19:50.511 --> 00:19:52.127
so it can be done in a group home.

00:19:52.127 --> 00:19:53.853
So that it doesn't have to just be run

00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:56.603
by the person that owns the home.

00:19:58.893 --> 00:20:02.516
Then of course we have the
self-determine patient program

00:20:02.516 --> 00:20:03.702
and I don't know if people know.

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:05.832
We've been trying to get this
self-determination program

00:20:05.832 --> 00:20:08.459
off the ground for quite some time.

00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:10.930
Actually we're the only
state that had to apply

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.004
to the federal government for
the self-determination program

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.343
and we send our application

00:20:15.343 --> 00:20:18.510
in way back in 2014, December of 2014.

00:20:19.883 --> 00:20:21.574
And we're still responding to questions

00:20:21.574 --> 00:20:25.147
from the federal government to try to get

00:20:25.147 --> 00:20:26.801
this thing off the ground.

00:20:26.801 --> 00:20:29.798
Even once we get it off the
ground it's still just suppose

00:20:29.798 --> 00:20:33.245
to be a three year pilot
and could serve 2500 people.

00:20:33.245 --> 00:20:36.320
But we feeling like we're
getting a lot closer

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.356
to answering all their
questions and hopefully,

00:20:38.356 --> 00:20:42.523
we'll get this thing going
in a short period of time.

00:20:43.798 --> 00:20:45.832
One of the things about the
self-determination program

00:20:45.832 --> 00:20:47.291
that people may not notice that people

00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:50.347
get to direct their own budget.

00:20:50.347 --> 00:20:53.764
So depending on what their IPP needs are,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.539
they'll receive a budget to
carry out that on their own

00:20:57.539 --> 00:20:59.905
and they can choose
their service providers.

00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:01.164
Who they wanna get services from,

00:21:01.164 --> 00:21:04.497
who they want to get their support from.

00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:10.158
It should be a very interesting
program once it gets here.

00:21:10.158 --> 00:21:12.404
And then again, I wanna reduce inequities

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:14.904
and disparities in our system.

00:21:17.499 --> 00:21:19.929
Reporting on regional centers,
I don't know if people

00:21:19.929 --> 00:21:21.117
have looked at our website lately

00:21:21.117 --> 00:21:24.039
but we have a dashboard on our website now

00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:25.873
where a lot of regional center data

00:21:25.873 --> 00:21:28.745
on individual regional
centers can be found.

00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:30.275
And so you can look at our website,

00:21:30.275 --> 00:21:33.873
you can look at the dashboard
for regional centers

00:21:33.873 --> 00:21:35.653
and get a lot of data on

00:21:35.653 --> 00:21:38.733
what that particular
regional center is doing.

00:21:38.733 --> 00:21:41.867
And of course the
developmental center closure

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:43.128
and transition activities.

00:21:43.128 --> 00:21:45.543
There's a great deal of
work and activity going on

00:21:45.543 --> 00:21:47.515
to transition people appropriately

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.623
from the developmental centers.

00:21:49.623 --> 00:21:52.382
One of the big complaints
during the Coffel years

00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:55.497
was that we moved people too fast.

00:21:55.497 --> 00:21:57.069
I can tell you that that's not the case

00:21:57.069 --> 00:21:58.640
with the developmental centers closures

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.167
for Fairview, Porterville and Sonoma

00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:03.238
which are the three remaining
developmental centers.

00:22:03.238 --> 00:22:05.643
There is a lot of transition
activity that goes on

00:22:05.643 --> 00:22:07.447
with each individual that moves

00:22:07.447 --> 00:22:10.197
from those developmental centers.

00:22:11.513 --> 00:22:14.221
And regional centers are
doing a great deal of work

00:22:14.221 --> 00:22:16.560
to develop appropriate resources for folks

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.598
and see that they are moved appropriately.

00:22:18.598 --> 00:22:21.253
And once they move the quality of services

00:22:21.253 --> 00:22:25.070
they provide is appropriate as well.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.181
And then we continue to
provide community development

00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:31.406
funds to regional centers
to develop resources.

00:22:31.406 --> 00:22:33.658
Not only for people coming
out of developmental centers

00:22:33.658 --> 00:22:37.658
but for people that are
in our college hospital,

00:22:38.545 --> 00:22:40.712
jails and we still have some consumers

00:22:40.712 --> 00:22:42.703
that live out of state
that we wanna bring back

00:22:42.703 --> 00:22:43.703
to California.

00:22:43.703 --> 00:22:45.910
'Cause we believe California
is the most appropriate

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.561
and our system was developed
to serve people in California.

00:22:48.561 --> 00:22:50.363
So those folks that had
to be placed out of state

00:22:50.363 --> 00:22:52.270
for one reason or
another, regional centers

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.985
are developing resources
so that they can bring

00:22:53.985 --> 00:22:55.985
them back to California.

00:23:01.182 --> 00:23:04.432
And with that, are there any questions?

00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:10.430
Okay.

00:23:14.878 --> 00:23:19.045
- We can barrage you both
with questions afterwards

00:23:21.836 --> 00:23:22.669
so thank you.

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:25.836
(audience applauding)

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.763
And so now it's my pleasure to introduce

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.763
for the local perspective as it were.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.392
Mr. Eric Zigman who is
the executive director of

00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:46.432
Golden Gate Regional Center

00:23:46.432 --> 00:23:50.883
and give us some background
on yourself please Eric.

00:23:50.883 --> 00:23:52.550
Welcome.
- Thank you.

00:23:56.224 --> 00:23:58.974
- I'm gonna get a glass of water.

00:24:11.823 --> 00:24:13.535
Thank you Dr. Green.

00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.800
I didn't wanna do that one.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.802
Shelton was speaking because
I knew I would spill it

00:24:17.802 --> 00:24:21.219
and fall down and stuff so thanks so much

00:24:22.597 --> 00:24:25.169
for inviting us to speak today.

00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:27.788
I feel really honored.

00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:30.373
This conference has a great reputation

00:24:30.373 --> 00:24:34.123
and I know you guys will
have a great couple of days

00:24:34.123 --> 00:24:35.774
with all the sessions that are going on.

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:39.941
So I will give you a brief,
short biography of me.

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:45.824
I started in direct service in
1989 in a sheltered workshop

00:24:45.824 --> 00:24:47.371
with 110 people with intellectual

00:24:47.371 --> 00:24:49.355
and developmental disabilities,

00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:52.336
and we had about 20 folks
working in the community.

00:24:52.336 --> 00:24:56.226
And over 15 years, we shut
the sheltered workshop

00:24:56.226 --> 00:24:59.420
and got 110 people
working in the community.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.768
This was in Santa Cruz, California.

00:25:01.768 --> 00:25:06.042
It was outside of the closure
of Agnews Developmental Center

00:25:06.042 --> 00:25:09.342
and the part I was lucky to play there.

00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:10.449
The closure of the workshop

00:25:10.449 --> 00:25:11.651
and moving people in the community.

00:25:11.651 --> 00:25:15.739
Employment was certainly
one of the high water marks

00:25:15.739 --> 00:25:18.572
of the work I've been involved in.

00:25:20.178 --> 00:25:24.345
So after that I played a lot
of roles in an organization

00:25:27.424 --> 00:25:30.841
like many of the old timers in the system

00:25:32.924 --> 00:25:34.116
including Nancy Bargmann.

00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:37.765
I had a lot of different
roles that hopefully prepared

00:25:37.765 --> 00:25:40.167
me for the work we're doing now.

00:25:40.167 --> 00:25:43.876
I was involved in services
and supported employment

00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:46.178
and as I said and in supporting living

00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:47.551
and independent living

00:25:47.551 --> 00:25:50.796
and in children's rest bed
and just a broad variety

00:25:50.796 --> 00:25:52.987
of the provision of services

00:25:52.987 --> 00:25:57.099
and learned a lot from the
people we served in those years.

00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:00.116
And then I consulted for nine
years which was a shock to me.

00:26:00.116 --> 00:26:01.402
I thought I'd do it for a year

00:26:01.402 --> 00:26:03.581
but the work was just so interesting.

00:26:03.581 --> 00:26:06.252
A lot of it had to do
with the closure of Agnews

00:26:06.252 --> 00:26:10.173
Developmental Center in the
middle of those nine years.

00:26:10.173 --> 00:26:14.340
Certainly between 2004 and
2009 when Agnews closed

00:26:15.866 --> 00:26:20.033
and that included work to
help East Bay group found

00:26:21.055 --> 00:26:22.837
Algeria Community Living.

00:26:22.837 --> 00:26:26.089
Which is a wonderful
provider in the East Bay,

00:26:26.089 --> 00:26:29.049
all throughout the East Bay.

00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:33.216
Also I was director of the
quality management system

00:26:35.067 --> 00:26:37.528
for the Bay Area project which
was the closure of Agnews.

00:26:37.528 --> 00:26:41.334
Where got to see the
transformation of folks

00:26:41.334 --> 00:26:44.792
from living in an institution
to living in the community

00:26:44.792 --> 00:26:48.092
and I got to see 300 individual stories

00:26:48.092 --> 00:26:52.938
really of the stunning
changes in people's lives.

00:26:52.938 --> 00:26:56.306
People in their 60s
and 70s and 80s and 90s

00:26:56.306 --> 00:26:58.259
mostly moved out into the community

00:26:58.259 --> 00:26:59.709
and really got a new lease on life

00:26:59.709 --> 00:27:03.394
and got to do things extraordinary,

00:27:03.394 --> 00:27:06.311
sort of transformational things so.

00:27:07.236 --> 00:27:09.124
And then the last three years prior to me

00:27:09.124 --> 00:27:11.985
coming to Golden Gate nine months ago.

00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:15.658
I was the CEO of The Pomeroy Center

00:27:15.658 --> 00:27:16.786
used to be called the Rec Center

00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:18.795
for the handicapped or (RCH).

00:27:18.795 --> 00:27:22.398
A legacy 60 year old provider
in the Southwest corner

00:27:22.398 --> 00:27:26.565
of San Francisco that was
a leader in its history.

00:27:29.353 --> 00:27:31.922
Some decades around recreation and people

00:27:31.922 --> 00:27:34.582
with developmental disabilities

00:27:34.582 --> 00:27:36.139
and that was a great experience.

00:27:36.139 --> 00:27:39.543
So now I'm charged with
running one of these

00:27:39.543 --> 00:27:42.431
interestingly these
called regional centers.

00:27:42.431 --> 00:27:45.001
There's only 21 in the state.

00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:49.127
Shelton referenced that
we are 5O1c3 non profits

00:27:49.127 --> 00:27:52.685
and some of the greatest innovation

00:27:52.685 --> 00:27:54.516
from the highest highs and lowest lows

00:27:54.516 --> 00:27:55.678
have come from the fact that

00:27:55.678 --> 00:27:58.358
we are a non profit organization.

00:27:58.358 --> 00:28:00.387
Though we do much of
the work of government.

00:28:00.387 --> 00:28:04.304
We are not government
agencies, not yet anyway.

00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:08.725
So one thing that's very interesting is

00:28:08.725 --> 00:28:12.102
and I really never completely fact checked

00:28:12.102 --> 00:28:12.935
where this came from.

00:28:12.935 --> 00:28:14.645
But I believe that the
original design in the regional

00:28:14.645 --> 00:28:18.207
centers was to add a regional
center for every million

00:28:18.207 --> 00:28:21.432
in the general population in California.

00:28:21.432 --> 00:28:25.034
In which case today,
we'd 40 regional centers

00:28:25.034 --> 00:28:28.704
rather than the 21 and
then as Shelton mentioned.

00:28:28.704 --> 00:28:31.306
The other way to look at
that is just the intakes

00:28:31.306 --> 00:28:32.971
into the system.

00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:37.138
Each year about 13000,
14000 and that's the size of

00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:41.132
a medium sized regional center.

00:28:41.132 --> 00:28:44.048
So we are taking in about the equivalent

00:28:44.048 --> 00:28:46.996
of the people we serve in terms of

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:49.241
adding a regional center each year.

00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:53.408
So I am going figure out
how to use these, forward.

00:28:59.244 --> 00:29:01.265
Alright, so those are my disclosures.

00:29:01.265 --> 00:29:03.293
No products, no services.

00:29:03.293 --> 00:29:07.406
I'm not selling anything but
goodwill and civil rights.

00:29:07.406 --> 00:29:08.979
(audience laughing)

00:29:08.979 --> 00:29:12.146
(audience applauding)

00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:15.426
Alright so here's what I'll try to do

00:29:15.426 --> 00:29:17.490
in the next 20 minutes or so

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.807
and leave some time for
questions for Shelton and I.

00:29:20.807 --> 00:29:21.640
We're gonna talk a little bit

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.057
about the history of the regional centers

00:29:26.966 --> 00:29:30.422
and the Lanterman Act in particular.

00:29:30.422 --> 00:29:31.944
Some of this duplicates a little bit of

00:29:31.944 --> 00:29:36.129
what Shelton had said but hopefully gives

00:29:36.129 --> 00:29:37.818
you a little bit different perspective.

00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:42.474
I mean I think the 16th
annual conference really

00:29:42.474 --> 00:29:44.688
some of the key language around the point

00:29:44.688 --> 00:29:47.354
is to really look at
community living broadly.

00:29:47.354 --> 00:29:50.421
And transforming systems of care

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:54.282
and the history of The
Lanterman Act really is about

00:29:54.282 --> 00:29:57.569
sort of transformation of
different kind of approach

00:29:57.569 --> 00:30:00.252
than the typical government
approach to services.

00:30:00.252 --> 00:30:02.372
And like any system,

00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:04.964
it falls on hard times at different points

00:30:04.964 --> 00:30:08.596
and needs renewal and it
feels, hopefully to me

00:30:08.596 --> 00:30:10.619
that we're at the beginning
of a renewal period

00:30:10.619 --> 00:30:13.405
with the influx of funding that came

00:30:13.405 --> 00:30:15.935
into the system this year.

00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:18.172
And some of the discussions
that are going on

00:30:18.172 --> 00:30:22.005
and certainly the closure
of the institutions.

00:30:25.637 --> 00:30:29.804
So let us plow on, I always
like to quote physicists

00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:33.541
when we're doing a
conference on healthcare.

00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:36.502
No, I'm always been taken by the phrase,

00:30:36.502 --> 00:30:38.774
we stand on the shoulder of giants,

00:30:38.774 --> 00:30:42.998
and that was Isaac Newton's
phrase about Galeao, I believe.

00:30:42.998 --> 00:30:44.991
Really all the work we do is predicated

00:30:44.991 --> 00:30:46.611
on the work that comes before us.

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:49.050
And especially when we
talk about civil rights.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.275
You gotta be in it for the long haul

00:30:51.275 --> 00:30:55.748
so it's really good to
know where you came from

00:30:55.748 --> 00:30:59.897
and then it's also helpful
to know where you're going.

00:30:59.897 --> 00:31:01.708
But we do really have a 50 year history

00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:06.555
and I wanted to put a
context to what was happening

00:31:06.555 --> 00:31:10.794
when leading up to The
Lanterman Act being passed.

00:31:10.794 --> 00:31:14.461
And this slide could
really be fact checked.

00:31:17.462 --> 00:31:18.295
(audience laughing)

00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:20.646
I would like, in my revised version

00:31:20.646 --> 00:31:23.411
which is also better
that's it's not up here.

00:31:23.411 --> 00:31:25.851
Don't think you're a civil rights experts

00:31:25.851 --> 00:31:28.141
when you're not and so I
did some of this from memory

00:31:28.141 --> 00:31:29.670
and when I really looked on the internet.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.865
I was like, well I got it pretty close.

00:31:31.865 --> 00:31:34.607
I thinking I really wanted
like an organizational

00:31:34.607 --> 00:31:39.196
like New York Times or
CNN to really fact check

00:31:39.196 --> 00:31:43.210
so to make sure that it's not fake news.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.140
I'm not trying to have any fake news.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.648
But really all these things were going on.

00:31:47.648 --> 00:31:50.065
The Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:31:51.526 --> 00:31:52.916
Selma didn't have a bus strike.

00:31:52.916 --> 00:31:54.904
Montgomery, Alabama had the bus strike

00:31:54.904 --> 00:31:56.135
but Selma did have a March.

00:31:56.135 --> 00:31:57.729
So I got that half right

00:31:57.729 --> 00:32:01.624
and then the 1964 Democratic Convention

00:32:01.624 --> 00:32:04.280
did have a silent vigil for civil rights

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.571
which was fascinating
which I guess my mistake

00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:08.390
led me to more information.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:12.496
But I was really referring to
the 1968 Democratic convention

00:32:12.496 --> 00:32:14.604
where it was much less than silent

00:32:14.604 --> 00:32:16.660
and there were a lot advocates
including some people

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.751
with disabilities
protesting the Vietnam war

00:32:20.751 --> 00:32:22.756
and other social changes.

00:32:22.756 --> 00:32:25.359
The March on Washington
and the Stonewall Riots

00:32:25.359 --> 00:32:29.553
for at that time gay rights now
would be called LBGT rights.

00:32:29.553 --> 00:32:32.611
The Second Wave of Feminism,
I mean all these things played

00:32:32.611 --> 00:32:37.598
into The Lanterman Act and the
Independent Living Movement.

00:32:37.598 --> 00:32:40.125
I mean the Ed Roberts
Center is across the Bay

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:42.859
and Berkeley and I urge
everyone if they have a chance

00:32:42.859 --> 00:32:45.236
to visit it over the Ashby BART station.

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:48.909
Ed Roberts was a giant and
in moving things forward

00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:52.533
for all people with
disabilities and so certainly

00:32:52.533 --> 00:32:55.450
played a role in that due to human.

00:32:56.753 --> 00:33:00.586
Others in that movement
and so that's all that

00:33:01.977 --> 00:33:05.894
was swirling around during
that time in mid 60s

00:33:07.266 --> 00:33:09.928
when the first pilot project was announced

00:33:09.928 --> 00:33:13.606
to tri-regional centers as an alternative

00:33:13.606 --> 00:33:15.606
to institutional living.

00:33:16.905 --> 00:33:21.072
And I will say some of Shelton's
data is very powerful to me

00:33:22.302 --> 00:33:24.032
especially the chart on the reduction

00:33:24.032 --> 00:33:25.318
of people in institutions.

00:33:25.318 --> 00:33:29.485
In 1965, there were 13500
individuals with intellectual

00:33:31.347 --> 00:33:34.164
and development disabilities
in state institutions

00:33:34.164 --> 00:33:35.562
and there was waiting list.

00:33:35.562 --> 00:33:39.765
That was like we are full up,
there was no room at the end

00:33:39.765 --> 00:33:41.405
and by the end of this next fiscal year,

00:33:41.405 --> 00:33:43.168
we should be under 500.

00:33:43.168 --> 00:33:46.870
And so that's the object
lesson in civil rights change.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.662
It takes way more longer
than you would want

00:33:49.662 --> 00:33:54.464
but that is a powerful change
in our world, in our system.

00:33:54.464 --> 00:33:56.964
So in the March on Washington.

00:33:57.982 --> 00:34:00.960
The famous, I have a dream speech was done

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.877
by Martin Luther King.

00:34:02.877 --> 00:34:05.540
And one of the fascinating
little side stories

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.427
is Mahalia Jackson is a gospel singer,

00:34:09.427 --> 00:34:13.594
at the time would often sing
before Dr. King's speeches.

00:34:16.608 --> 00:34:20.659
And he had asked her to
sing a particular song

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:22.068
before the I have a dream speech

00:34:22.068 --> 00:34:24.108
and the I have a dream
speech really didn't have

00:34:24.108 --> 00:34:25.904
I have a dream in it.

00:34:25.904 --> 00:34:29.576
That was really, he took
that and extemporaneously

00:34:29.576 --> 00:34:31.710
inserted it from one
of his other speeches.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.379
He hadn't really intended
to have that part

00:34:34.379 --> 00:34:36.627
and if you watch the YouTube video.

00:34:36.627 --> 00:34:38.950
My whole theme today is
fact checking me, I think.

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:40.386
(audience laughing)

00:34:40.386 --> 00:34:43.844
If you look at the YouTube
video of Dr. King's speech

00:34:43.844 --> 00:34:46.651
or at least if it has
enough quality of sound.

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:49.126
You can hear Mahalia
Jackson in the background

00:34:49.126 --> 00:34:52.480
saying, "Tell them about the dream Martin,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.052
"tell them about the dream."

00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:56.662
And so he pivots into that section

00:34:56.662 --> 00:34:59.197
and it's very powerful for me lately

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:01.535
about what role we all play in leadership.

00:35:01.535 --> 00:35:05.736
Here's this performer who
kind of played a seminal role

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:08.046
in changing Dr. King's speech

00:35:08.046 --> 00:35:10.220
or making it this
incredibly famous speech.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.774
So I do love that story
and you can check it out.

00:35:13.774 --> 00:35:14.857
It is online.

00:35:17.007 --> 00:35:19.840
So Dr. King said that he had dream

00:35:21.042 --> 00:35:22.709
that his four little
children would one day live

00:35:22.709 --> 00:35:24.377
in a world where they were not judged

00:35:24.377 --> 00:35:26.399
by the color of their skin

00:35:26.399 --> 00:35:29.482
but by the content of their character

00:35:30.418 --> 00:35:33.638
and I think The Lanterman
Act really for people

00:35:33.638 --> 00:35:35.325
with intellectual and
developmental disabilities

00:35:35.325 --> 00:35:39.492
in California certainly was the
launch of that kind of idea.

00:35:40.778 --> 00:35:44.759
That people would be
looked at as people first.

00:35:44.759 --> 00:35:46.713
So I wanted to take a moment

00:35:46.713 --> 00:35:48.571
before I delve in The Lanterman Act

00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:52.071
to just talk about identity and disability

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.155
and the importance of language.

00:35:55.155 --> 00:35:59.754
I'm not really, language
probably not a good to say.

00:35:59.754 --> 00:36:02.337
I'm not really a stickler on language.

00:36:02.337 --> 00:36:05.806
I would like behavior and
actions to really speak louder

00:36:05.806 --> 00:36:08.586
than language but in this case.

00:36:08.586 --> 00:36:12.367
It really made an impression
on me as I learn people

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:13.968
first language and the difference

00:36:13.968 --> 00:36:18.210
between saying a disabled
person or a autistic person

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.380
and a person with autism or
person with a disability.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.140
The importance here is
it sets the individual

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.461
and the individual's identity,

00:36:25.461 --> 00:36:28.378
this core of explaining themselves.

00:36:29.873 --> 00:36:34.582
And so it's a change from
saying that the adjective,

00:36:34.582 --> 00:36:37.642
the modifier is the important
thing about the person.

00:36:37.642 --> 00:36:40.361
That they're defined by their deficits

00:36:40.361 --> 00:36:43.134
and it moves it to
saying I'm a human being

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:46.707
that whatever challenges I have in life.

00:36:46.707 --> 00:36:48.764
And whatever special gifts and talents

00:36:48.764 --> 00:36:50.561
that informs my identity

00:36:50.561 --> 00:36:53.926
but that's not the sum
total of my identity.

00:36:53.926 --> 00:36:57.941
People don't say I'm a
glasses wearing person.

00:36:57.941 --> 00:37:00.330
It's like a person who wears glasses

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.080
so that's really important to me.

00:37:05.894 --> 00:37:09.009
It connects to the Dr.
King quote that it's about

00:37:09.009 --> 00:37:12.983
the individual's identity
and we all know this.

00:37:12.983 --> 00:37:14.351
The more you work with an individual,

00:37:14.351 --> 00:37:17.566
the less you see them
as your first impression

00:37:17.566 --> 00:37:19.574
and the more you see them as sort of

00:37:19.574 --> 00:37:22.625
the core identity of who they are.

00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:24.748
That's informed by their life's experience

00:37:24.748 --> 00:37:27.748
and sometimes by their disabilities.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.292
So I wanna go a little bit deeper

00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:34.292
into The Lanterman Act Promise.

00:37:34.292 --> 00:37:36.329
It's really the promise of equal access

00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:38.423
against the promise of support.

00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:40.095
People hear the word entitlement

00:37:40.095 --> 00:37:42.280
and they think of preference
and preferential treatment

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.212
and it's important to bring them back

00:37:44.212 --> 00:37:46.117
really to a civil rights frame for me.

00:37:46.117 --> 00:37:47.924
And say it's about equal access.

00:37:47.924 --> 00:37:49.543
It's about leveling the playing field.

00:37:49.543 --> 00:37:52.791
It's about letting people
live, work and play

00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:55.622
and have an access to that as people

00:37:55.622 --> 00:37:57.900
without disabilities have access to it.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.150
It's not about any special "treatment".

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.892
I'm gonna move, I think
quickly through these slides

00:38:06.892 --> 00:38:10.778
somewhat but the first
page of The Lanterman Act

00:38:10.778 --> 00:38:13.954
is like a declaration of
independence for the country.

00:38:13.954 --> 00:38:15.761
It's really well written.

00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:18.481
Art Bolton was a staffer
for Frank Lanterman

00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:21.518
and others but Art
really played a huge role

00:38:21.518 --> 00:38:23.884
in drafting this language.

00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:25.733
And it says right at the beginning that

00:38:25.733 --> 00:38:28.237
"The State of California
accepts a responsibility

00:38:28.237 --> 00:38:30.239
"for persons with
developmental disabilities

00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:35.055
"and an obligation to them
that it must discharge."

00:38:35.055 --> 00:38:37.696
It affects hundreds of
thousands of children and adults

00:38:37.696 --> 00:38:40.008
directly and I love this part,

00:38:40.008 --> 00:38:42.624
and having an important
impact on the lives

00:38:42.624 --> 00:38:45.531
of their families, neighbors
and entire communities.

00:38:45.531 --> 00:38:48.017
Developmental disabilities
presents social, medical,

00:38:48.017 --> 00:38:51.233
economic, legal I would say issues now.

00:38:51.233 --> 00:38:55.316
They said problems in 1969
of extreme importance.

00:38:56.948 --> 00:38:58.698
So what it really do?

00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:03.397
All of this is contained
again in that first page

00:39:03.397 --> 00:39:04.318
of The Lanterman Act.

00:39:04.318 --> 00:39:08.318
The first 4501 of welfare
and institutions code.

00:39:09.759 --> 00:39:12.024
It created an entitlement.

00:39:12.024 --> 00:39:15.613
The entitlement really got rolling in 1985

00:39:15.613 --> 00:39:18.946
when the Arc of California sued the DDS.

00:39:20.946 --> 00:39:23.789
Brought a case that went
to the state supreme court.

00:39:23.789 --> 00:39:27.956
In 1985, state supreme court
decision basically says yes.

00:39:30.037 --> 00:39:32.855
That obligation means
you have an obligation

00:39:32.855 --> 00:39:37.484
both to fund the system and if
the system runs out of money.

00:39:37.484 --> 00:39:38.917
Then the Department of
Developmental Services,

00:39:38.917 --> 00:39:40.573
Shelton's gonna go back to the legislature

00:39:40.573 --> 00:39:42.352
and ask for more money.

00:39:42.352 --> 00:39:44.740
When it runs out of money
that was the original intent

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.639
in the supreme court decision

00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:49.891
and that the Department
of Development Services

00:39:49.891 --> 00:39:54.157
would have some limited
influence on regional centers.

00:39:54.157 --> 00:39:56.640
At the service level, the IPP,

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.881
the individual program
plan Shelton reference

00:39:59.881 --> 00:40:03.277
would be the driver of services
and the regional centers

00:40:03.277 --> 00:40:06.263
would be responsible to their communities

00:40:06.263 --> 00:40:08.556
to provide services in a way

00:40:08.556 --> 00:40:11.329
that best met those needs of the IPP.

00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:12.981
And the Department of
Developmental Services

00:40:12.981 --> 00:40:15.804
will play a funding role and a legal role

00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:19.194
but direct regional centers in what to do.

00:40:19.194 --> 00:40:21.447
And that really is where the flexibility

00:40:21.447 --> 00:40:23.141
in the system has come from

00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:25.278
and the ability to innovate in a way

00:40:25.278 --> 00:40:27.875
that we could never done over 50 years

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:32.640
if we were state owned and
operated, no offense Shelton.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.640
(audience laughing)

00:40:36.932 --> 00:40:41.099
It also established the IPP
which is one of my mentors

00:40:43.403 --> 00:40:44.987
who's passed away last year,

00:40:44.987 --> 00:40:47.800
Barbara Maizie of Contra Costa ARC.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.268
Just hammered about the IPP
being the legal source document.

00:40:52.268 --> 00:40:56.102
It all comes from the IPP but it's true.

00:40:56.102 --> 00:40:59.161
That's how we plan one person at a time

00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:02.320
and don't have cookie cutter
one size fits all services.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.128
We have services that are
responsive to the individual.

00:41:06.128 --> 00:41:10.811
The other things Lanterman
Act right away does is

00:41:10.811 --> 00:41:14.341
have this great language
around establishing

00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:17.959
an array of services
based on needs and choices

00:41:17.959 --> 00:41:19.718
and that will be regardless of age.

00:41:19.718 --> 00:41:22.083
And regardless of degree of disability

00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:25.577
which is a very important
thing and sometimes

00:41:25.577 --> 00:41:27.370
gets in the way when
we're trying to explain

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.139
to legislatures especially
new legislatures

00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:32.165
and give them an idea
of the people we serve.

00:41:32.165 --> 00:41:35.538
It's really helpful to
bring a vast variety

00:41:35.538 --> 00:41:37.962
of the people we serve because it's hard

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:40.042
if you haven't had an
experience of intellectual

00:41:40.042 --> 00:41:42.003
and developmental
disabilities in your family

00:41:42.003 --> 00:41:44.517
or neighborhood or friends.

00:41:44.517 --> 00:41:48.684
To really be able to talk
about just the vast diversity

00:41:50.323 --> 00:41:54.490
in difference and presenting
needs and different ways

00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:59.719
of communicating is represented
by the people we serve.

00:41:59.719 --> 00:42:01.564
And then this great phase of integration

00:42:01.564 --> 00:42:03.594
into the main stream
life of the community.

00:42:03.594 --> 00:42:07.415
Who knew the community
even had a mainstream life.

00:42:07.415 --> 00:42:11.165
But it does and we're
still chasing that goal

00:42:14.476 --> 00:42:17.909
and then another phrase
that's an awesome phrase

00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:20.700
is that and again, relates
to the equal access

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.958
not preferential treatment.

00:42:22.958 --> 00:42:26.883
The whole system is to help
people with intellectual

00:42:26.883 --> 00:42:28.331
and developmental disabilities approximate

00:42:28.331 --> 00:42:30.630
the patterns of everyday living available

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.357
to people without disabilities,

00:42:32.357 --> 00:42:33.606
and now we're seeing that language

00:42:33.606 --> 00:42:36.106
echoed in the ACBS final rule.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.305
The new federal expectations
or current federal expectations

00:42:42.305 --> 00:42:43.751
that we have to comply with,

00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:47.626
that all the country has to
comply with by March of 2019.

00:42:47.626 --> 00:42:51.417
But right there in The Lanterman Act

00:42:51.417 --> 00:42:55.982
and this great phrase
we really wanna pursue.

00:42:55.982 --> 00:42:58.499
We're not pursuing them,
they're coming to us.

00:42:58.499 --> 00:43:01.735
We really wanna help people pursue

00:43:01.735 --> 00:43:04.622
their own personal futures.

00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:07.224
And for me I always like to think of

00:43:07.224 --> 00:43:09.385
that as we're here to help people

00:43:09.385 --> 00:43:12.543
have equal access by meeting their needs

00:43:12.543 --> 00:43:17.030
but also by helping them define
and meet their aspirations.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:19.561
It's not just all about sort of

00:43:19.561 --> 00:43:22.123
Maslow's lowest levels of meeting needs.

00:43:22.123 --> 00:43:23.952
It's also higher level of aspirations

00:43:23.952 --> 00:43:27.619
so we are charged with
supporting people in.

00:43:28.467 --> 00:43:32.634
Okay so that's The Lanterman
Act script notes version.

00:43:40.796 --> 00:43:44.172
So like the Civil Rights Act of 1964

00:43:44.172 --> 00:43:47.422
and the national supreme court decision

00:43:49.315 --> 00:43:52.314
of Brown verses The Board of Education.

00:43:52.314 --> 00:43:54.029
In our country and in our culture,

00:43:54.029 --> 00:43:57.820
we often pass laws and then
we have to have court cases

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.763
that come along behind
and enforce the law.

00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:03.304
And when I went to graduate school

00:44:03.304 --> 00:44:05.702
at another university
here in San Francisco.

00:44:05.702 --> 00:44:08.829
I got to be with people
who provided services

00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:11.643
or management leadership
from disability services

00:44:11.643 --> 00:44:14.482
from all over the country
and a couple from Finland.

00:44:14.482 --> 00:44:17.796
We had two women, Helen and
Tina who were doing disability

00:44:17.796 --> 00:44:20.364
services in Finland and
when we went through

00:44:20.364 --> 00:44:24.202
this section on the Civil Rights Act,

00:44:24.202 --> 00:44:26.480
Brown verses The Board of Education.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.829
One of them raised their
hands, I don't remember

00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:32.792
it was probably Tina
not Helen and she said,

00:44:32.792 --> 00:44:36.846
"Wait, why did you need
to have a court case

00:44:36.846 --> 00:44:38.750
"to enforce the law?

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.787
"Why didn't people in your country

00:44:40.787 --> 00:44:43.052
"just follow the law
when you pass the law?

00:44:43.052 --> 00:44:45.817
(audience laughing)

00:44:45.817 --> 00:44:47.310
We all looked at each other
from the United States

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.420
and went, you must not be from here.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.423
(audience laughing)

00:44:51.423 --> 00:44:55.892
This very northern European
thing that you pass a law so

00:44:55.892 --> 00:45:00.059
follow the law so that happened
with The Lanterman Act.

00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:04.302
I mean it was in place
and it was chugging along

00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:08.004
but it was really that 1985
states supreme court decision

00:45:08.004 --> 00:45:10.254
that said no, no it's true.

00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:13.202
You got to put your money
where your mouth is California.

00:45:13.202 --> 00:45:15.473
You got to find a system
and has to be based

00:45:15.473 --> 00:45:16.493
on individual needs,

00:45:16.493 --> 00:45:19.910
not categories of cookie cutter services.

00:45:21.816 --> 00:45:24.566
So now we get into the healthcare

00:45:26.397 --> 00:45:28.780
within a social justice frame.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.849
And I learn this mostly from my friends

00:45:30.849 --> 00:45:34.655
and colleagues and that USF program.

00:45:34.655 --> 00:45:37.238
In the disability rights movement

00:45:37.238 --> 00:45:39.655
sort of writ large the people

00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:43.577
with physical disabilities in particular

00:45:43.577 --> 00:45:46.581
were very uncomfortable
with the medical model.

00:45:46.581 --> 00:45:48.255
And I remember when we're closing Agnews,

00:45:48.255 --> 00:45:51.672
we had a great RN, who may be here today.

00:45:52.845 --> 00:45:55.038
Who didn't come from the field

00:45:55.038 --> 00:45:57.192
and said why you keep saying medical model

00:45:57.192 --> 00:45:58.288
like it's a negative thing.

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:02.585
We in medicine think medical
model kind of make sense

00:46:02.585 --> 00:46:03.877
but for people with disabilities,

00:46:03.877 --> 00:46:05.486
the medical model really translated

00:46:05.486 --> 00:46:09.645
into a disempowering model in our history.

00:46:09.645 --> 00:46:13.742
Where the physician would
diagnose that the person

00:46:13.742 --> 00:46:16.142
was basically broken and needed to be fix

00:46:16.142 --> 00:46:19.456
in various different ways
and would prescribe things

00:46:19.456 --> 00:46:22.539
to help them get better and fix them.

00:46:24.398 --> 00:46:27.481
But what's even more kind of damaging

00:46:28.723 --> 00:46:31.862
was that we as human service professionals

00:46:31.862 --> 00:46:34.757
took on this quasi medical model.

00:46:34.757 --> 00:46:36.808
Where we were diagnosing

00:46:36.808 --> 00:46:40.975
that if Eric just would bathe
more, Eric would be better

00:46:42.615 --> 00:46:45.771
regardless of what Eric wanted to do.

00:46:45.771 --> 00:46:50.428
And so we kind of diagnosed
folks in the early days

00:46:50.428 --> 00:46:52.385
about what they needed to get a job

00:46:52.385 --> 00:46:55.248
in the community, for instance.

00:46:55.248 --> 00:46:58.940
Not only was disempowering
and rob people of their agency

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.374
but it also wasn't effective.

00:47:01.374 --> 00:47:05.392
We had folks who would
have to be in workshops

00:47:05.392 --> 00:47:08.339
for years and years and years
to be able to get a chance

00:47:08.339 --> 00:47:10.429
to have a job in the community.

00:47:10.429 --> 00:47:13.592
When if we found somebody
who really was interested

00:47:13.592 --> 00:47:16.812
in working in a hospital instead
of having a grooming goal

00:47:16.812 --> 00:47:18.347
and hammering on them.

00:47:18.347 --> 00:47:20.259
And what normal grooming
was we would take them

00:47:20.259 --> 00:47:22.647
to the hospital and say
if you wanna work here,

00:47:22.647 --> 00:47:25.052
you're gonna have to take a shower man.

00:47:25.052 --> 00:47:29.933
So that was huge change and I
think we're still undergoing

00:47:29.933 --> 00:47:32.959
that change in our history.

00:47:32.959 --> 00:47:36.445
Some disability rights
advocates that I was with

00:47:36.445 --> 00:47:39.844
about a year ago, two
years ago with autism.

00:47:39.844 --> 00:47:42.479
We're talking about internalized ableism

00:47:42.479 --> 00:47:45.160
which is a fascinating
sort of idea that they had

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.454
overcome in their own lives.

00:47:47.454 --> 00:47:50.175
This idea that they
weren't working hard enough

00:47:50.175 --> 00:47:53.170
to be able to pass for
somebody without a disability

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.935
and they internalized that
and it had robbed them

00:47:55.935 --> 00:47:57.852
of some of their power.

00:47:58.894 --> 00:48:00.943
So one of the things I have at the end

00:48:00.943 --> 00:48:04.037
in one of the web links is the

00:48:04.037 --> 00:48:07.511
Disability Rights Education
Defense Fund (DREDF).

00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:11.669
They have this healthcare stories website

00:48:11.669 --> 00:48:14.651
and if you think this is only in the past.

00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:16.972
This damage of that approach,

00:48:16.972 --> 00:48:18.895
prescriptive approach to people.

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:21.050
They're all kinds of
folks with disabilities

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:25.217
who are on that website
talking about their experience

00:48:26.066 --> 00:48:30.583
with the healthcare professionals
and it's fascinating.

00:48:30.583 --> 00:48:33.316
Our clients are consumer rights advocate,

00:48:33.316 --> 00:48:35.383
now wait we're dropping that language.

00:48:35.383 --> 00:48:38.842
Elizabeth Frisbie who is
a great advocate for us

00:48:38.842 --> 00:48:40.092
at Golden Gate.

00:48:41.007 --> 00:48:42.289
I think we're just saying advocate,

00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:45.214
that's what I'm proposing
to have her title be.

00:48:45.214 --> 00:48:49.414
She's on one of those stories
and they're all compelling

00:48:49.414 --> 00:48:51.914
so I urge you to look at that.

00:48:55.856 --> 00:48:57.228
So that was our past.

00:48:57.228 --> 00:48:59.959
Where is our trajectory, where
are we headed in the future?

00:48:59.959 --> 00:49:03.420
It's really and we're kind
of in the middle of this.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:07.025
From the medical model to a
person centered thinking model

00:49:07.025 --> 00:49:10.885
or nothing about us without us model.

00:49:10.885 --> 00:49:14.012
Golden Gates been a leader with along

00:49:14.012 --> 00:49:15.438
with Redwood Coast Regional Center

00:49:15.438 --> 00:49:16.907
and Tri-counties regional centers

00:49:16.907 --> 00:49:19.347
we've attempted to be a leader
in person centered thinking.

00:49:19.347 --> 00:49:22.421
It's a whole sort of
way to approach planning

00:49:22.421 --> 00:49:25.588
that really puts the individual served

00:49:27.867 --> 00:49:31.837
in the place that The Lanterman
Act says they should be.

00:49:31.837 --> 00:49:34.875
And one of the more powerful,
simple tools is just

00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:39.047
to help folks who are
facilitating those meetings.

00:49:39.047 --> 00:49:39.928
Understand the difference

00:49:39.928 --> 00:49:42.406
between what's important for someone

00:49:42.406 --> 00:49:43.442
which is sort of relates

00:49:43.442 --> 00:49:46.891
to all the prescriptive things
we know as professionals

00:49:46.891 --> 00:49:49.570
that will help somebody in their lives.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.098
But then to differentiate what's important

00:49:52.098 --> 00:49:54.827
for someone from what's important to them

00:49:54.827 --> 00:49:56.678
so that there's a space cleared for them

00:49:56.678 --> 00:50:00.845
to be able to clarify that
to the group in some way.

00:50:01.689 --> 00:50:02.700
So the people around them

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:06.312
if they're not able to articulate
what's important to them.

00:50:06.312 --> 00:50:08.381
Help really clarify what

00:50:08.381 --> 00:50:10.119
and again what they're aspirations are.

00:50:10.119 --> 00:50:12.277
Where are they're aspiring to be.

00:50:12.277 --> 00:50:13.777
Where they thrive.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:19.247
So what is healthcare within
a social justice frame

00:50:20.136 --> 00:50:22.795
means for me the individuals
get to be experts

00:50:22.795 --> 00:50:24.334
about themselves.

00:50:24.334 --> 00:50:29.098
I've already talked a lot
about needs and aspirations

00:50:29.098 --> 00:50:30.835
and that we listen to the people we serve.

00:50:30.835 --> 00:50:33.629
One of the best things
about the organization

00:50:33.629 --> 00:50:35.784
skill center that I cut my teeth in

00:50:35.784 --> 00:50:39.284
or started out in that
shelter workshop in 1989

00:50:39.284 --> 00:50:42.658
was that part of their core values

00:50:42.658 --> 00:50:44.638
was simply to listen to folks

00:50:44.638 --> 00:50:46.719
and listening is a huge
part of leadership.

00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:49.719
And it's served me well in this work

00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:58.184
and so at 10:15 I following Michelle,

00:51:01.365 --> 00:51:05.718
there's a seminar on when
listening is complicated

00:51:05.718 --> 00:51:07.486
so it really relates to that

00:51:07.486 --> 00:51:11.616
and I'm sure we'll all learn
from that seminar as well.

00:51:11.616 --> 00:51:13.696
Okay now I'm way, way over time

00:51:13.696 --> 00:51:16.440
so I'm gonna move through quickly.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.497
I talked about the healthcare stories.

00:51:18.497 --> 00:51:21.059
The intersection of
developmental disabilities

00:51:21.059 --> 00:51:23.473
and mental health and dual
diagnosis and the services

00:51:23.473 --> 00:51:26.140
is way longer than this lecture.

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.348
But I think it is really
a core sort of area

00:51:32.348 --> 00:51:35.704
that we're gonna have to
improve in the future.

00:51:35.704 --> 00:51:37.901
So where are we now

00:51:37.901 --> 00:51:41.818
and what are we building
towards in the future?

00:51:42.809 --> 00:51:47.303
The scale is just amazing and
you have a chance to look up

00:51:47.303 --> 00:51:48.625
We are Here to Speak for Justice,

00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:50.384
it is another historical piece.

00:51:50.384 --> 00:51:53.561
I swear this is the last
history lesson I'll give

00:51:53.561 --> 00:51:56.233
but if you look at that first paragraph

00:51:56.233 --> 00:51:59.357
and assume that it was divided equally

00:51:59.357 --> 00:52:02.671
between the first two
regional centers in 1966.

00:52:02.671 --> 00:52:07.417
Then Golden Gate probably had
275 individuals served or so

00:52:07.417 --> 00:52:10.543
and had a budget of about $500,000.00.

00:52:10.543 --> 00:52:12.952
Today we serve almost 9000 people

00:52:12.952 --> 00:52:15.307
and our budget is $284 million

00:52:15.307 --> 00:52:20.002
so as Shelton said that it
has really changed over time.

00:52:20.002 --> 00:52:21.991
The world we're in now is a world

00:52:21.991 --> 00:52:23.478
without developmental centers.

00:52:23.478 --> 00:52:25.845
It really is now because
it's so very difficult

00:52:25.845 --> 00:52:28.991
to get anyone in which is great

00:52:28.991 --> 00:52:30.208
from a civil rights perspective.

00:52:30.208 --> 00:52:34.597
It creates some challenges
for regional centers

00:52:34.597 --> 00:52:39.200
to make sure we can serve
everyone in the community.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.013
Sonoma Developmental Center
as some folks in this room

00:52:42.013 --> 00:52:45.763
are keenly aware is
closing December 31, 2018

00:52:46.948 --> 00:52:50.466
is the deadline set by the state.

00:52:50.466 --> 00:52:53.299
And Golden Gate has 67 individuals

00:52:54.168 --> 00:52:58.297
that we do the case
management for about 300 now

00:52:58.297 --> 00:52:59.375
living in Sonoma.

00:52:59.375 --> 00:53:03.332
So we are very focused on
moving them into the community

00:53:03.332 --> 00:53:05.399
as soon and as safely as possible.

00:53:05.399 --> 00:53:08.010
And there's lots of political
pressure around this

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.686
both from the legislature
and the federal government,

00:53:10.686 --> 00:53:14.118
the department but that's not
the reason we're doing it.

00:53:14.118 --> 00:53:17.740
The reason we're doing it
is we believe it will have

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.434
either anything from
incrementally better lives

00:53:20.434 --> 00:53:22.017
to stunningly better lives

00:53:22.017 --> 00:53:25.382
and mostly on the stunningly
better lives side of it.

00:53:25.382 --> 00:53:28.362
And so I think we owe it to the 67 souls

00:53:28.362 --> 00:53:32.236
that are in Sonoma that
we have responsibility

00:53:32.236 --> 00:53:33.903
for to move swiftly.

00:53:37.129 --> 00:53:39.073
I'm not gonna tell the Agnews story again,

00:53:39.073 --> 00:53:42.781
that's too long other than
to say I've met recently

00:53:42.781 --> 00:53:45.837
with our great Director
of Clinical Services

00:53:45.837 --> 00:53:49.355
Dr. Lin with the health of San Mateo

00:53:49.355 --> 00:53:51.476
and with with the Puente
Clinic down there.

00:53:51.476 --> 00:53:53.942
Those were both partnership.

00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:56.472
We partnered with both of those entities.

00:53:56.472 --> 00:53:57.909
The Puente clinic was sort of created

00:53:57.909 --> 00:53:59.929
during the closure of Agnews.

00:53:59.929 --> 00:54:03.284
It's really gratifying to see resources

00:54:03.284 --> 00:54:06.701
that came through the only start up money

00:54:07.907 --> 00:54:09.953
that was available since 2003 has been

00:54:09.953 --> 00:54:12.030
for developmental centers closures,

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.787
and these resources really have both grown

00:54:15.787 --> 00:54:17.811
and helped our capacity in the community.

00:54:17.811 --> 00:54:20.400
We hope to do more with them.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.678
The challenge for us now is
really and Director Bargmann

00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:26.602
of the Department of Development Services

00:54:26.602 --> 00:54:27.435
is very clear on this.

00:54:27.435 --> 00:54:29.854
(Chirping sound)

00:54:29.854 --> 00:54:34.030
Oops, I wonder if I say Director Bargmann

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:35.713
it will chirp every time.

00:54:35.713 --> 00:54:38.286
(audience laughing)

00:54:38.286 --> 00:54:40.036
Nancy is watching me.

00:54:41.679 --> 00:54:44.778
She's very great in many,
many ways in terms of

00:54:44.778 --> 00:54:45.763
her vision for the future.

00:54:45.763 --> 00:54:48.514
But she's focused on
building of a safety net

00:54:48.514 --> 00:54:51.759
in the community 'cause
without developmental centers

00:54:51.759 --> 00:54:53.192
we need that.

00:54:53.192 --> 00:54:55.081
I'm not gonna talk about
the CMS Final Rule,

00:54:55.081 --> 00:54:57.998
there's tons to talk about in that.

00:54:59.784 --> 00:55:03.387
So I'm gonna skip that
slide and then really wanted

00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:07.283
to talk a second about housing
as a component of health.

00:55:07.283 --> 00:55:09.018
There's been some studies in Hawaii

00:55:09.018 --> 00:55:13.218
and I know our partner,
non profit that develops

00:55:13.218 --> 00:55:16.195
housing Brilliant Corners
is doing some other work

00:55:16.195 --> 00:55:18.743
with the health plan of San Mateo.

00:55:18.743 --> 00:55:21.913
That really talks about
how powerful housing is

00:55:21.913 --> 00:55:23.976
in terms of impacting health

00:55:23.976 --> 00:55:27.328
and the Hawaii study
actually put dollars to it,

00:55:27.328 --> 00:55:30.274
and showed that it was a
cost savings to the state

00:55:30.274 --> 00:55:32.790
to house people rather than
to have emergency rooms

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:35.457
be flooded with our individuals.

00:55:37.213 --> 00:55:39.444
The Disparity Projects
connected to what Shelton

00:55:39.444 --> 00:55:42.687
was talking about with the disparity

00:55:42.687 --> 00:55:44.377
of purchase and service dollars

00:55:44.377 --> 00:55:47.047
in underserved ethnic
communities is really powerful.

00:55:47.047 --> 00:55:50.501
We're starting a couple
projects in Golden Gate.

00:55:50.501 --> 00:55:52.692
One with support for
families in San Francisco

00:55:52.692 --> 00:55:55.456
and then expanding them
in San Mateo counties.

00:55:55.456 --> 00:55:58.017
And they're gonna try to
have cultural brokers go into

00:55:58.017 --> 00:56:01.942
underserved communities
hiring from those communities.

00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:04.563
Health Promotora is also
to help connect families

00:56:04.563 --> 00:56:07.734
to our services and have
them use more of the services

00:56:07.734 --> 00:56:10.138
that they authorized to use.

00:56:10.138 --> 00:56:12.759
Dr. Rueben has a social
and cultural determinance

00:56:12.759 --> 00:56:14.877
of developmental disabilities
that relates that.

00:56:14.877 --> 00:56:17.627
A session coming up today at 3:30

00:56:19.234 --> 00:56:21.632
and then the self-determination
is gonna be really large

00:56:21.632 --> 00:56:25.799
and for this group, folks
are gonna be able to have

00:56:27.644 --> 00:56:29.619
a much broader choice,

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:32.271
the intent is of what
services to purchase.

00:56:32.271 --> 00:56:36.438
And so for healthcare that
might mean alternative services

00:56:38.647 --> 00:56:42.711
acupuncture, chiropractor, herbal medicine

00:56:42.711 --> 00:56:44.571
and that will have an interesting impact

00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:47.440
I think on your community.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.773
The two of the models that are happening

00:56:52.637 --> 00:56:54.926
that are exciting in Golden Gates area.

00:56:54.926 --> 00:56:58.751
The Arc of San Francisco has
a healthcare advocacy program

00:56:58.751 --> 00:57:01.243
that I became really aware of

00:57:01.243 --> 00:57:02.670
when I was working at Pomeroy Center

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.344
because we were able to kind of partner

00:57:05.344 --> 00:57:07.458
with them on some assessments.

00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:10.059
And it really plays a
role to help advocate

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:13.095
and coordinate healthcare for folks living

00:57:13.095 --> 00:57:15.713
on their own or in the family home

00:57:15.713 --> 00:57:18.880
and we found it really to be powerful.

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.301
Okay now I'm speeding along.

00:57:23.301 --> 00:57:26.254
I just wanted to end with
talking about Golden Gate.

00:57:26.254 --> 00:57:30.243
We're going through a
strategic planning process

00:57:30.243 --> 00:57:32.626
and these are all the areas of task force

00:57:32.626 --> 00:57:37.270
that my predecessors Jim
Shorter had put together,

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:39.151
that is giving
recommendations to our board

00:57:39.151 --> 00:57:41.111
for three year strategic plan.

00:57:41.111 --> 00:57:43.616
In terms of how we're
going to make decisions

00:57:43.616 --> 00:57:47.199
about investments and
resources in terms of

00:57:48.456 --> 00:57:52.347
strengthening the system
here at Golden Gate.

00:57:52.347 --> 00:57:55.264
In that Dr. Clarissa Kripke of UCSF

00:57:56.821 --> 00:57:58.961
and our Clinical Director Ingrid Lin

00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:02.378
were able to put together recommendations

00:58:03.218 --> 00:58:06.635
with a taskforce for the regional center.

00:58:07.852 --> 00:58:12.019
And those recommendations have
detail to them in the plan

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.839
and we can share that
if you're interested.

00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:17.672
But really around these four areas

00:58:18.703 --> 00:58:22.120
and they're all extremely important areas

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:28.166
to try to strengthen healthcare
for the people we serve.

00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:31.431
I did wanna mention, I didn't
talk about The CART model

00:58:31.431 --> 00:58:34.271
in the last slide but that is a model now

00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:36.841
that Dr. Kripke has been
working on for years.

00:58:36.841 --> 00:58:39.976
And is now really launching with a number

00:58:39.976 --> 00:58:41.882
of regional centers including Golden Gate

00:58:41.882 --> 00:58:44.456
to try to bring consultation to homes

00:58:44.456 --> 00:58:48.057
and training to homes around
particular individuals

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:51.390
in nursing, in psychiatry and psychology

00:58:52.673 --> 00:58:57.109
and with parent sort of
family support experts.

00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:59.969
And we are really
looking forward to having

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:02.724
that help expand our capacity

00:59:02.724 --> 00:59:06.057
and make our services of higher quality.

00:59:07.673 --> 00:59:09.702
I'll end just by referring back

00:59:09.702 --> 00:59:12.589
to Martin Luther King one more time.

00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:16.339
He says the arc of the
moral universe is long

00:59:18.355 --> 00:59:20.107
but it bends towards justice.

00:59:20.107 --> 00:59:22.529
So the fact that we are
a 50 year old system

00:59:22.529 --> 00:59:24.941
and we're still dealing with some issues

00:59:24.941 --> 00:59:26.179
shouldn't discourage us.

00:59:26.179 --> 00:59:29.641
There's plenty of evidence
of that these changes

00:59:29.641 --> 00:59:32.359
take decades and sometimes centuries

00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:34.119
and we're in it for the long haul

00:59:34.119 --> 00:59:35.386
so thank you very much.

00:59:35.386 --> 00:59:38.636
(audience applauding)
