00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.920
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: I'm gonna try to be brief
'cause I'd love to chat with you about this

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.600
general subject. I wrote a book called The
Next Convergence. It's based on the work I've

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.879
been doing for the last seven or eight years.
I can give you the flavor of it; it involves

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.200
the developing world and the emerging economies.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.070
I chaired a commission on growth and development.
Was populated by political and policy leaders,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.200
not academics like me, who had fought the
battles and won and lost and been the agents

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.750
of change and accelerating growth in the developing
world. And I learned a ton from them and have

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.650
been involved of lots of different countries:
Brazil, China, and India trying to be helpful,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.590
trying to bring international experience into
all the complicated policy decisions that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.380
they try to make to deal with accelerating
growth and poverty reduction.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.070
And so, I thought at some point for a reason
I'll mention in a minute that it was a good

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.530
time to write a book about growth in the emerging
markets. And I guess the reason I thought

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.509
that is that we are at kind of crossroads.
We're within 10 years of having the so-called

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:20.079
emerging economies. Jim O'Neill who invented
the term BRIC's; he's at Goldman Sachs has

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.659
announced we're not allowed to use the term
emerging anymore because they've emerged.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.999
And so now we're fishing around for another
term. So I'll use emerging for now. They're

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.399
gonna be more than half the global economy
and I'll give you some other data, but this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:42.159
is the point in history in which the emerging
economies are becoming systemically important

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.909
and that has all kinds of implications.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.229
The way I framed the book is I went back with
the help of Angus Maddison who's the best

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.649
known economic historian and way, way back
to the year 1,000. And if you do that, what

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.869
you notice is that for about eight centuries
there was almost no growth in the world. Countries

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.859
were rather similar; most of the people were
poor and lived in agricultural environments

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:15.909
at a subsistence basis. There were a few wealthy
people who also had power and if you compared

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.989
countries and asked yourself how different
were they the answer was not much.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.510
In the Ming Dynasty, China was slightly richer
than Europe and then that all changed with

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.959
the British Industrial Revolution and at that
point income started to rise, you had real

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.980
growth. It wasn't breathtaking by our standards,
welcome, was like 1½% a year in real terms.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.111
And the British Industrial Revolution spilled
over into continental Europe and into what

00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:52.900
Angus Maddison calls the European offshoots
that would be us and Canada and Australia

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.549
and New Zealand. And we grew at a breathtaking
pace of 2½% and this went on for 200 years.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.469
And at the end of that 200 years the 15% of
the world's population that lives in what

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:10.780
we now call advanced countries had incomes
and wealth that were on the order of 40 to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.890
50 times what everybody else had, the other
85%, because for lots of reasons they didn't

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.290
participate in this.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.460
And then after World War II a bunch of very
wise people with the United States, the dominant

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:33.709
sort of survivor of that event, decided that
they would not reproduce the sort of disastrous

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.200
policies that followed World War I where the
vanquished were supposed to be crushed and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.359
that lead essentially to a depression and
World War II, they did something different.

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.260
They decided they would rebuild the vanquished
economies in Europe and Japan, open the global

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:59.109
economy, and then with a huge tailwind from
technology, what amounts to what you do, this

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.530
global economy turned into an opportunity.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.639
And so what the book is about is, this century
that we began after World War II, in which

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:16.459
I believe what we're in process of seeing
is: the expansion of the people who live in

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.700
high income countries with the kinds of opportunities
and so on, that we have expanding from 15%

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.780
of the world's population to something like
80% and maybe more if things go well in certain

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.830
parts of the developing world.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.990
And so the book I've written is an attempt
in the first part to explain that evolution

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.750
doesn't happen very often in the history of
the world, I thought it might be kind of interesting.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.700
And then I focus on how this high speed growth
that we've seen actually occurs. So, if you

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.300
look at the developing world in the period
since World War II you discover there's 13

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.940
economies that have managed to sustain growth
rates of 7% or more for 25 years or more.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.730
Now that's the kind of thing if it's sustained
that changes economies and people's lives

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.520
because if you're growing at 10%, which is
roughly where China's been recently, you're

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.250
doubling every 7 years. It means in a 30 year
period you're 16 times as well off as you

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.280
were before unless you have an awful lot of
population growth.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.380
I won't spend a lot of time this morning but
I get asked by investors and other people

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.250
a lot who are interested in, "Well, they're
growing fast can they keep this up? Are they

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.320
driving toward a brick wall," and so on. And
the only way to answer that is to try to understand

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.120
both the policies and the economic dynamics
that work.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:49.490
The economic dynamics are not mysterious;
they're sort of a version of what Hal described

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.870
a minute ago, Schumpeter's Creative Destruction.
But the key element in the global economy

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:01.500
that's enabled this growth is its openness
and that causes, if you think of this 200

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.010
years of divergence followed by this converging
pattern for a century, the gap in terms of

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.690
the knowledge and technology base of these
economies was enormous, the advanced versus

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.870
developing. And what's happening is that the
technology that's been developed over these

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.030
200 years and continues to be developed is
rapidly imported essentially through multiple

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.950
channels into emerging economies. And so the
potential of the economy to produce output

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.460
of a variety of kinds grows enormously. So
that, growth is really about knowledge and

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.260
knowledge transfer is what it comes down to.
And you all and others have made this easier.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.750
The second critical component that goes with
this kind of high speed growth is the global

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.320
economy size and demand. I think the easiest
way to see it is in a poor country no matter

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.710
how many people there are if the per capita
income is $500 the economy's small. And if

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.310
you look at the demand side of the economy
it's not just small but its composition is

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:18.260
uninteresting from the point of view of specialization
and exporting things. In a very poor country

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:26.840
the lion's share of income and output is devoted
to food, shelter, energy. Once you've added

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.820
up those two things there's not a whole lot
left. So you can't grow an economy by trying

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.510
to produce for that economy alone.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.970
Then you switch over to the global economy
and if you're a small country and you've found

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.510
something where you can compete, what economists
call comparative advantage, and you have a

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:51.990
sort of 2% market share and you miraculously
grow by 50%, then you have a 3% market share

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:58.570
in the global economy so you can't impact
the global economy. The way that impact would

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:05.880
show up in an economic model is you would
start to affect the prices and you would turn

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.130
the terms of trade against yourself.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:13.450
That basically doesn't happen and so the third
component since you have this almost unlimited,

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:19.020
think of it as infinite market to sell into,
then basically you can grow as fast you can

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:25.040
invest. And high speed growth of this type
requires investment rates as a fraction of

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:34.149
GDP of about 25 to 30%. So if an economy falls
short of that then they will slow down. You

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:40.409
just can't, the capital output ratios in economies
are two and a half to three, you've gotta

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.710
get the investment rate up or you can't keep
the growth. When you're poor that's very hard.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:51.130
Part of that probably 5 to 7% is public sector
investment in education and infrastructure

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:57.540
and most economies find it difficult to do
that for the understandable reason that if

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.410
somebody comes along and says, "I've got a
great deal for you. You're household income

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:08.671
is $500 a year. You're not gonna spend a third
of it, we're gonna invest it so that your

00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:13.380
children and grandchildren are better off."
It's an amazing inner temporal choice that

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.830
gets made and in some countries they manage
to make it.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.550
The other thing I guess I wanted to report
to you on this front is that when I started

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.480
this I thought this was mostly about sort
of fairly complicated high speed dynamics,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.650
economic dynamics. Now I think it's a lot
about leadership and politics and so on. So

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:42.390
if you look at the cases where economies grow
and succeed, you can usually find leadership

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.680
in the form of bringing people together, leadership
in the form of picking the right model. The

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.840
institutions aren't there to kind of help
do this in the early stages of growth.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.360
We looked at the 13 high growth economies
and said, "What do they have in common?" They

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.170
have certain economic ingredients in common.
What they don't have in common is governance,

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:09.390
in the form of governance. So you have India
which is about to join the group, China, a

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:15.110
very different system, Botswana, a tiny little
democracy that's succeeding landlocked somewhere

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:21.020
in Southern Africa. And if you look at the
countries that are struggling, you can find

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.700
failing democracies with pathologies like
vote buying and chasing after natural resources,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.730
the kind of things that Paul Collier describes
so well. And then you can find autocratic

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:38.090
systems that fail so you're all quantitatively
oriented. If you have a two by two box with

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:44.030
high and low economic performance and somewhere
between democratic and autocratic on the other

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:49.000
dimension, you can fill in all the boxes.
And so I think the correct conclusion is not

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.860
the form of governance that matters. And it
turns out what it does matter is making correct

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:02.900
choices but more importantly intend and long-time
horizons but intending to benefit all the

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.230
people in the economy.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.230
[pause]

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.340
I will now undercut myself, economists are
lousy forecasters. [laughs]

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.340
[laughter]

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.960
And so you shouldn't believe anything I say
about --

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960
[laughter]

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.960
the future.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.890
In the 1950's and 60's development economists,
the leading people in the field, were asked,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:26.120
"How is the developing world gonna go?" And
for the most part they said that Africa would

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.090
be the star performer and Asia would be the
basket case. Now that's about as close to

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.210
dead wrong as you can get I think.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:41.029
And the reason, but the more interesting things
is the reason they said that. They said it

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:47.710
because we believed incorrectly that enduring
wealth and value creation depended on natural

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:54.170
resources in the developing world and not
on people. Africa is way more wealthy in terms

00:11:54.170 --> 00:12:01.180
of natural resources than any other part of
the world, and Asia isn't. So in Asia, people

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:08.680
and Asia was the poorest part of the world
in 1950, by some fairly large amount. And

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.730
basically people looked around and said, "Well,
what have we got here?" And the answer was,

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.550
"We've got people, they can be educated, and
we can turn loose this thing." And now we

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.529
have completely different conception of what
sustained growth and sort of well-being is

00:12:23.529 --> 00:12:25.200
based on.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.770
Last part of the book I sort of turn my attention
to the future because as I said minute ago,

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:35.570
this is sort of a crossroads and you have
the developing economies becoming large and

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:42.661
having systemic impacts and there's all kinds
of dimensions of this, there's natural resources

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:48.940
in the environment and sustainability. We
talk a lot about that but this is serious.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.870
I mean a reasonably conservative estimate
is the global economy measured in terms of

00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:02.220
GDP, which is somewhere between $55 and $60
trillion and big enough to cause worries about

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:09.400
whether the planet we live on will sustain
this, is set to at least triple in the next

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:17.170
20 years. To something on the order of 160
or sort of and that's not the end of the growth.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:22.860
So there are real questions about this and
I'll say a word about the Asian view of this

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.860
in a minute.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:30.880
There's questions of stability in governance.
So for most of the period that we've been

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:39.000
involved in up 'till now developing economies
could focus more or less intensively on the

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.380
complicated domestic job of growth and development
and they had external effects. The policies

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:53.399
that were adopted had external effects but
they weren't big enough to cause a major problem

00:13:53.399 --> 00:14:00.399
in the global economy but at a certain scale
this is no longer true.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:04.550
One of the things I had to do is teach myself
to think about size as distinct from growth.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:11.290
So 20 years ago China started growing in 1978
when Deng Xiaoping decided with his colleagues

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:19.040
that they were gonna do somethin' different
and they set off on a pretty intelligent market-oriented

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:26.580
growth path, freed up agriculture to sell
at market prices and so on. And after 10 years

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.380
the economy was growing at a nice pace, 9
or 10%. But if you asked, "What was the increment

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:38.430
to the global economy?" At that point the
answer was relatively very small in fact,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.160
notwithstanding the numbers of people, 1.3
billion.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.450
Fast forward another 21 years and they've
been at this 31 years and they have the second

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:53.560
largest economy in the world. And when China
grows at 10% it is a major event in the global

00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:00.029
economy. I mean that's just an illustration
of this point that China is now in a very,

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:07.540
very complex set of transitions that are important
to everybody. It is the engine of growth not

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:13.180
just for itself and a good chunk of the global
economy but virtually all of the emerging

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.500
economies.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:23.860
The major export destination for Brazil, India,
Korea, and a long list of countries is China.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.731
So if we were 10 years ago and investor's
thinking about what is the developing world

00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:34.860
depend on? It would be our growth, America
and Europe, now the answer is they're kind

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:41.010
of a little bit independent of us, not completely.
If we take a nose dive that will hurt them,

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:46.440
but they're really dependent on the Chinese
growth, so a lot is riding on what's going

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.080
on in China.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.010
China's in the middle income, what's called
the middle income transition. This is a term

00:15:53.010 --> 00:16:01.220
you may not have heard. It's the phase of
growth that comes at about $4 or $5 thousand

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:07.839
to $10 thousand of per capita income. And
the reason it's so interesting and treacherous

00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:13.511
is that the engines of growth that have been
running in the export sector: labor intensive,

00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:21.950
process-oriented manufacturing and some services
aren't competitive anymore. And so Schumpeter's

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:28.230
Creative Destruction which is mostly creation
and diversification of the economy, which

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:35.400
it occurs for the first 20 years or so, sort
gets added to by having the destruction come

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:42.740
into the model as well. And there's a very,
very strong tendency to resist that change.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:49.980
I remember being in Korea in the 1980's; Korea
was one of the more effective high speed transitions

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.550
through the middle income, and the journalists
came rushing up and said, "The wages are going

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.980
up." And I said, "Yep, that's good." And they
said, "And we're becoming uncompetitive in

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.070
this high quality, low cost manufacturing."
And I said, "Yep." And they said, "Well then

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:09.610
we have to hold the wages down." I said, "Wait
a minute. I thought the whole purpose of this

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.369
exercise was to have incomes and so on go
up." And they said, "Well that's true."

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:19.980
And what people find very difficult to understand
is that growth in this sense and structural

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.490
change are basically the same thing and you
can't halt the structural change without halting

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:31.119
the growth process. And so you have to, and
in the middle income transition, domestic

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:35.909
demand becomes more important, the market
decides more and the government decides less,

00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:40.831
it's more hands off, it's more like an advanced
economy. Innovation becomes more important

00:17:40.831 --> 00:17:45.360
than it is in the early stages where you're
mostly importing technology.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.679
Unless this sounds sort of theoretical, if
you take those 13 economies you'll find 'em

00:17:50.679 --> 00:17:57.919
in the book and in the Growth Commission Report
only five managed to sustain high growth through

00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:03.059
the middle income transition and everybody
else stalled out or slowed down dramatically

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:10.140
or even worse. In the case of Brazil which
was an early high growth country in the mid-70's

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.529
it literally stopped, became a dictatorship,
had several rounds of hyperinflation, turned

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:22.940
inward, all kinds of things went wrong. Those
five countries are Japan, Korea, Taiwan, I

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:28.700
guess you'd think of Taiwan as an economy
now not a country, Hong Kong, also part of

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:34.820
China now, and Singapore. So that's the, it's
treacherous and it's not a done deal.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:39.149
I have found it interesting and I tried to
share some of it in the book, try to help

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:44.340
the Chinese government think through the policies
that are associated with this transition and

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.350
they're pretty well embedded in what was just
passed. It's called The Twelfth Five-Year

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.239
Plan in China.

00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:54.820
So let me close on the sort of environmental
and natural resources front with something

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:04.919
I learned since I wrote the book. If you look
at Asia, its 3.8 billion people east and south

00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:13.201
and about 60%of the world's population, slightly
less. In absolute terms, most of the growth

00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:21.369
in the global economy I adverted to a minute
ago is gonna occur in Asia because it's high

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:26.769
growth. It contains the two future economic
giants China and India assuming nothing goes

00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:31.989
wrong with the growth process. We're talking
decades' long processes but they're well on

00:19:31.989 --> 00:19:33.539
the way.

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:44.519
And so when they confront the question of
whether or not the growth model that we used

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:53.450
to achieve our current status and that all
their predecessors used in getting to be where

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:59.159
Korea is or Taiwan is and so on and ask themselves
the question, "Can we just use that growth

00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:05.230
model to complete the journey in the rest
of this century so that we're in this category

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:11.179
living the way we do?" The answer they come
up with is probably not. That it just doesn't

00:20:11.179 --> 00:20:19.590
scale. That you cannot run economies with
85%of the world's population living the way

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:24.649
we do at energy, intensities and so on.

00:20:24.649 --> 00:20:31.799
And so they are going to set off on a course
to try to reinvent, at least at the margin

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:39.160
the growth model, so it is sustainable in
this dimension. And this is new. I mean this

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.330
is I think we haven't confronted this question
before, but what's interesting about it is

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:51.290
this isn't a global issue for them. This is
a long term growth strategy issue, that it's

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:57.950
a question of their own success with China
in the lead. But if China and India at their

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:04.559
scale, 40% of the world's population in two
countries, internalize this the rest of Asia

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:13.830
will and it'll completely change the dynamics
of the global economy in the next 30, 40 years.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:20.369
And I expect Asia actually to be increasingly,
because of the incentives, to be in a leadership

00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:28.989
role in driving toward less impactful growth
paths than we've had before.

00:21:28.989 --> 00:21:33.279
In Asia, for those of you who know it well,
you'll recognize that when start talking about,

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:40.059
this they start talking about lifestyles.
For a Westerner when you hear the term lifestyle

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:50.340
you think, "What are you talking about?" Lifestyles
for us are the choices you make: a Google

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:56.580
T-shirt, sandals, Spence in a suit in this
huge territory that we have allocated to individual

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:01.050
choice and freedom. And then there's another
subset of stuff we acknowledge where our choices

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:06.590
are constrained, but by and large we think
that second class should be as small as possible

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.590
and this should be huge.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.590
[pause]

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:16.730
What they mean by lifestyles is not what we
mean. It's not this sort of funny little stuff

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:25.559
in big territory. It means how we go forward,
it means how cities are built, and whether

00:22:25.559 --> 00:22:30.470
you can drive a car, it even means how many
kids you can have 'cause these all have very

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:35.360
large external affects if people are just
making their own choices. And because there's

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.489
so many people involved and lying behind it
the sustainable question, the Asian countries

00:22:41.489 --> 00:22:48.989
do and will continue to just draw and redraw
that line in different places. And this causes

00:22:48.989 --> 00:22:55.210
tremendous communication problems because
this idea that this belongs sort of constitutionally

00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:04.590
in the area of sort of free choice is an idea
that's deeply imbedded here, and not the same

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:10.309
concept as there. So when you hear talk about
lifestyles you're really hearing talk about

00:23:10.309 --> 00:23:14.760
sustainability, something that actually works
when you scale it up.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:24.570
I'll conclude by saying I find China fascinating,
its per capita income is $4,000; it's very

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:30.009
pragmatic. The highest speed learning environment
I've ever been in in terms of picking stuff

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:32.909
up is quite amazing to watch.

00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:40.429
But China is the only country ever at $4,000
a per capita income, which less than tenth

00:23:40.429 --> 00:23:45.309
of ours, to have systemically important effects
on the rest of the global economy. It's just

00:23:45.309 --> 00:23:50.179
never happened before. Most countries that
become, like Japan, that become systemically

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:56.200
important get there at something like four
or five times that level of per capita income,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.629
so there's a very big challenge in China,
it's sort of a tension.

00:24:02.629 --> 00:24:07.009
There's a subset of people who say, "Look,
we haven't really completed this journey yet

00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:11.649
and we're gonna focus on our domestic growth
and development agenda." And there's another

00:24:11.649 --> 00:24:16.559
set of people both internally and externally,
and this second set is right, who are saying,

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:21.510
"No, you can't do that. It's sort of too bad
that you've reached this point where you have

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:27.489
to balance global stability and other issues
in the policies you adopt with the domestic

00:24:27.489 --> 00:24:32.999
growth and development agenda, but it's not
in your interest to ignore these set of external

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:34.359
effects."

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:38.470
And so we're entering a world in which the
emerging economies are gonna be part of the

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:43.929
governance of the global economy in the context
of the G-20. The G-20 is gonna have to learn

00:24:43.929 --> 00:24:54.950
how to be effective or we're gonna have a
long period of unmanaged and unregulated growth

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:59.749
and interaction in the global economy. And
I think actually that's inevitable.

00:24:59.749 --> 00:25:05.269
The kinds of shocks and things that we're
starting to experience now I think are gonna

00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:10.989
be a regular feature of the global economy
for some time. Because the sort of governing

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:16.039
it with the starting point being national
identities and national decision making units

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:20.950
is just not gonna happen overnight. In fact
I think it's probably the work of a generation.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.990
The only thing I regret is that I probably
will not see the end of the century I've just

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:31.470
written about. Maybe if I get lucky, I'll
see most of it. But if you stand back from

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:40.570
it's pretty extraordinary phenomenon and where
so many peoples' opportunities to be productive

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:46.659
and creative are expanding so fast that it's
pretty exciting just to see part of it.

00:25:46.659 --> 00:25:53.950
Well, let me stop there and turn it over to
you.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.200
[applause]

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.620
I've decided the dog can ask the first question.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.620
[laughter]

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.419
[people talking in background]

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:05.660
That's right, food. [laughs]

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.340
This is great.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.730
&gt;&gt;male #1: So let me, let me ask an economic
history question.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.730
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Sure.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:10.730
&gt;&gt;male #1: You jumped over that pretty quickly.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:11.730
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: I did.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.730
&gt;&gt;male #1: So everybody agrees [bad audio,
lots of talking in background]

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.730
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Um-hum.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.730
&gt;&gt;male #1: [bad audio, people talking in background]
permeated in England and Europe. But what

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.730
do you think the reasons are that it didn't
impact [bad audio] or that the rest of the

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:32.690
world [bad audio]

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:48.950
&gt;&gt;Michael Spense: This won't be a complete
answer Hal, but surely there were asymmetries

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:56.519
built into the colonial structures that where
it's reasonable to guess, without being a

00:26:56.519 --> 00:27:02.609
thoroughly trained economic historian, were
the main reason why developing countries,

00:27:02.609 --> 00:27:11.950
what we call developing countries, were parts
of large colonial empires and their role was

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:20.979
simply to supply natural resources and absorb
a very small amount of sort of output. And

00:27:20.979 --> 00:27:27.940
that was imposed pretty rigidly and where
it broke, it broke in the American case by

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:34.529
having a continent that wasn't pre-populated
so that, it was but we didn't treat them very

00:27:34.529 --> 00:27:40.070
well. And basically it became a European off
shoot as Angus Maddison says and then broke

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.960
free and then sort of joined the party. But
in most of the world that didn't happen.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:52.799
So the collapse of the colonial empires after
World War II, of their own weight, was probably

00:27:52.799 --> 00:28:00.049
the major factor in freeing this thing up
and then you got the opening of the global

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:06.519
economy, and that took time. I mean it opened,
it took Barry Bosworth and others who have

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:12.009
studied this it's fun to go back and look
at the gap and the steps in the gap and see

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:19.379
what was opened when. But manufacturing wasn't
the first step and that's the territory where

00:28:19.379 --> 00:28:22.460
they found the chance to grow and create a
modern economy.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.460
Yep.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.460
Yes, sir.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.600
&gt;&gt;male #2: If you could just repeat the question.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:32.130
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Yeah, no loud as he can.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:39.470
&gt;&gt;male #2: What's your point of view on particular
stability. We look at [bad audio] China and

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:45.080
also Argentina [bad audio] their dictatorship
and [bad audio] governments and then those

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.830
appears as actual countries that were really,
really [bad audio] well --

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:50.850
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Yeah.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.850
&gt;&gt;male #2: So what's your take on these [bad
audio]

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:52.850
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:57.720
The question is: you have countries that have
been relatively authoritarian in varying dimensions

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:05.119
and growing fast. What's my take on all of
that?

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:11.340
Let me preface this by saying I think there
is a body of work lead by young colleagues

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.849
of Hal's and mine in the area of political
economy that's really terribly important and

00:29:16.849 --> 00:29:23.379
making progress in understanding the interactions
of sort of economic processes and political

00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:28.210
and governance processes. And I think it's
made significant progress and will have at

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:34.679
least another 10 years. Having said that let
me do the best I can with it.

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:43.389
There are people who believe, I think correctly,
that if you have benign authoritarian enterprise

00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:48.710
that's also competent, meaning they know what
they're doing and their intentions are good,

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:55.740
they can move more quickly. And so the fact
that China, once it changed direction, could

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.940
move very quickly to a set of policies that
supported nine to ten percent growth. Whereas

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:06.330
India, probably the world's most complicated
democracy, is getting there but it's just

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:12.960
harder in that political system to get there.
So you can say that.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:20.169
On the other hand, most people believe, and
I think this is also true, that the cost of

00:30:20.169 --> 00:30:26.760
democratic processes which is harder to make
changes is also a benefit because if you're

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.899
going in the wrong direction there are more
brakes that stop you, it's safer. Now Marcus

00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:39.399
[inaudible] says you don't have many famines,
I think he says any in a democratic environment

00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:47.539
and so if you have a non-benign inclination
in the part of people who are currently in

00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:53.289
power democracy has a better chance of getting
them out, if it's working. Then you go around

00:30:53.289 --> 00:30:57.330
and look and discover that there are democracies
that aren't working.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:04.600
A number of the Asian countries that are now
in the advanced income category including

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.799
Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were relatively autocratic
in the sense that they had dominant single

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:18.529
parties and the structure was put together
to keep them that way, and they've all evolved

00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:23.879
somewhere between middle and high income into
full multi-party democracies.

00:31:23.879 --> 00:31:31.859
I was in Singapore two weeks ago, they had
their first [laughs] it was hilarious. I called

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:39.490
it political campaigning kindergarten [laughs]
but they had their first real campaign. And

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:46.489
the people, friends of mine in the dominant
party, were kinda nervous and a little bit

00:31:46.489 --> 00:31:51.700
upset that somebody would actually stand up
and criticize them. So they may be in this

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:57.070
transition as well, I mean it's too soon to
tell. But I think that's kind of where we

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.070
are.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.919
The way I said it when I was talking is that
I think the thing that you can be sure of

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:07.169
is that the form is not the decisive factor.
And then you can get on to thinking about

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:13.419
benefits and costs. It's surely true that
China is pragmatic and moves with incredible

00:32:13.419 --> 00:32:20.529
speed, and you have to. At 10% growth, you
wake up in the morning and discover that there

00:32:20.529 --> 00:32:26.120
isn't enough electric power and there's 120
ships outside the port in Shanghai where you

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.259
don't have any way to process them. And you
can't avoid that, there are just bottlenecks

00:32:30.259 --> 00:32:35.369
all the time so you have to just move fast
and deal with it.

00:32:35.369 --> 00:32:39.279
The other thing that China's done, I think
you all probably know the investment rate

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:45.119
in China when it started growing fast jumped
to 35%, so that was the upper end of the known

00:32:45.119 --> 00:32:52.429
range and it's now at 45% and the savings
rate over half of the GDP. These are completely

00:32:52.429 --> 00:32:57.330
on the right tale of the distribution; not
always a good thing.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:03.249
But China uniquely has been able to build
infrastructure to support the growth even

00:33:03.249 --> 00:33:11.440
at advance of the need, like the high speed
trains, with a kind of a public sector balance

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.509
sheet that's big enough to do it whereas most
countries struggle to get the investment levels

00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:18.179
up. So China's unique in that respect.

00:33:18.179 --> 00:33:19.179
Yeah.

00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:20.179
&gt;&gt;male #3: You mentioned Korea's [bad audio]
Do you see, I mean just with the sheer size

00:33:20.179 --> 00:33:37.590
and population do you see them having the
same problems [bad audio]

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:45.669
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Yeah I do. So this is actually
a very important question that scares the

00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:48.359
Chinese as well as puzzles outsiders.

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:53.190
We got in the habit in small economies of
thinking that the export sector drove growth

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.749
and the labor intensive part was where you
had a comparative advantage and that's how

00:33:56.749 --> 00:34:01.170
you got all those people in the agricultural
sector into cities in the modern economy.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:07.119
I didn't say it, but urbanization occurs at
a tremendous pace in the course of this. In

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:13.569
China and India, as long as the growth stays
up and there's still, in the case of China,

00:34:13.569 --> 00:34:19.079
50 plus percent in the agricultural sector,
in the case of India it's closer to 70%, they'll

00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:24.200
basically have to build Los Angeles every
year for the next 30 or 40 years; each of

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:31.210
them, not together. Sort of 13 to 15 million
people flowing in, not a big fraction of the

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:36.230
population. And so that whole process goes
on.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:43.669
Now China, so what worries people in China
is the coastal wages started to rise very

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:52.389
rapidly last summer after the Foxconn suicides
and the strikes in the Honda plants and so

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:57.030
on. And of course they were waiting for this
they want the household income to rise, so

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:02.220
this is a big tailwind in speeding up the
creation of the middle class. But then somebody

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.369
sticks up their hand and says, "Well what
about the people who are still on the lower

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:13.089
end of the skill and education spectrum in
the rural areas? If they can't get into the

00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:17.131
labor intensive export sector 'cause it's
moved on up the value added chain, where are

00:35:17.131 --> 00:35:22.539
they gonna go?" And you have to have an answer
to that. You need an employment engine running

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:30.450
and the answer probably is the urbanization
process will create gigantic urban service

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:36.150
sectors. And so the urban service sectors
will be the avenue into the modern economy

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:42.640
that formerly was provided almost entirely
by the export sector. And if that engine fails

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.329
then this whole process will stall and it
will create a kind of dual economy structure

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:51.349
of the type that you see in parts of Latin
America.

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:58.760
And Brazil is doing very well now but what
happened in Brazil is that first of all, unlike

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.900
China and much of the rest of the developing
world, in Latin America and parts of Africa

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:10.510
there was never any reform in the ownership
of assets, particularly land. So there's very,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:16.300
very concentrated ownership of assets which
allows you in the agricultural sector, you

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.400
don't have to do land consolidation you can
mechanize it.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:28.710
So in Brazil agriculture became modern and
capital intensive and the people weren't needed

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:34.559
so they went to the cities not for opportunity
but for lack of opportunity where they were.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:40.670
And in Brazil they ended up living in little
tin cans up on the sides of hills called favelas.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:45.180
That's the wrong kind of urbanization. That's
the kind of urbanization that scares the wits

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.619
out of the Chinese 'cause of the numbers of
people involved.

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:53.640
And so the only way to make a process that's
always somewhat chaotic a little healthier

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.580
is they have it driven by the pull of employment
opportunity rather than the push of the absence

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:06.710
of opportunity. And so this service sector
is gonna be the employment destination for

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.140
the remainder of the people.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:14.380
The other thing that will happen is they will
keep the labor intensive parts of the export

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:20.069
sector alive a little longer by building enough
infrastructure that it can move inland where

00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:24.740
the country is not as rich as it is on the
coast. So basically what you're gonna see,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:30.930
simultaneously in the next 10 years, is the
labor intensive activities are gonna move

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:35.640
to other countries, probably Viet Nam, India,
Bangladesh, and so on. They'll move inland

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.250
and they'll move up and down the coast a little
bit. The companies will, a lot of them will

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.720
move with them. We saw that in the case of
Korea.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:49.210
I tracked the Nike supply chain over a lot
of years 'cause I used to be on the board.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:56.230
It started in Japan, almost unimaginable now.
Japan moved on and it moved to Korea and Taiwan,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:01.859
almost unimaginable now. And then it moved
to China and then Viet Nam and Indonesia which

00:38:01.859 --> 00:38:06.660
had a bad patch in the '97, '98 crisis.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:13.510
I say this because when you watch the global
economy it's just constantly in motion. And

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:18.869
the architects of these global supply chains
are multi-national companies like this one.

00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:25.549
This is who decides where the opportunities
lie in terms of the supply chain and the matched

00:38:25.549 --> 00:38:27.170
markets. But I think that's the answer.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.170
Yep. Yes sir.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.170
&gt;&gt;male #4: So I would like to have your take
on the growth in Western Asia and North Central

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:30.170
Asia especially like Middle East and resource
rich economies and your comments on what some

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.119
people call the curse of natural resources
which is gonna generate growth but in a competitive

00:38:32.119 --> 00:39:06.380
fashion and not benefitting the entire society.
Where do you think that part of the world's

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.380
gonna be?

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.280
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Well, first of all there's
a high correlation between natural resource

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.890
wealth and failures of governments. It's well
documented by lots of people including Paul

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:23.089
Collier in Africa which is his focus. So it's,
while I think that economic sort of theory

00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:28.579
and analysis will catch up with this I mean
natural resource wealth tends to distort political

00:39:28.579 --> 00:39:34.900
incentives to the zero sum game version where
you get your hands on the wealth and that's

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:40.400
good enough as opposed to there's not much
here we better make it bigger, which is where

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.390
the growth orientation comes from.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:49.299
There's a fairly significant set of initiatives
under way to help countries manage natural

00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:55.300
resource wealth even if they get by the sort
of we're gonna fight over it kind of version

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:00.270
of it, one of which is led by Paul and a number
of other people and I'm involved in called

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.089
The Natural Resource Charter.

00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:09.210
So even if your intentions are good it's pretty
hard to get this done and you have to sort

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:14.140
of take the natural resource wealth, invest
a chunk of it outside so you don't so your

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.600
exchange rate doesn't put you out of the market,
the so-called Dutch Disease Effect. Then you

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.970
have to take the remainder and build enough
infrastructure and spend it on the public

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:31.619
sector investment portfolio that drives growth,
sorry, doesn't drive growth, it enables the

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:34.299
private sector engine to start running.

00:40:34.299 --> 00:40:38.339
And lots of countries just don't know how
to do that. They don't have the human resources

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:43.519
to do that and so you go look at what happens
and the procurement fails and the infrastructure

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:49.910
construction is bad. One of the reasons the
Chinese are now the largest investor in Africa

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:54.480
is they're making deals with African countries
in which they basically have access to the

00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.500
natural resources which they and others need
and in return they'll apply the expertise

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.529
they've acquired to sort of building infrastructure.

00:41:04.529 --> 00:41:10.650
So this is, I talk about it in the book. On
the scale of things this is a reasonably important

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:13.559
set of problems especially for the subset
of countries.

00:41:13.559 --> 00:41:20.930
Now in the Middle East, the management has
gotten better over time but the problem I

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:25.770
think in the Middle East, well this is sort
of too simple. We could spend the afternoon

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:36.730
on the Middle East. I believe a very important
reason for the recent sort of revolts is that

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:42.240
these economies were proceeding in which young
people had very little future and they finally

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.960
said enough. The youth unemployment problem
is fairly large in certain parts of the world

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:55.380
but it's gigantic through most of the Middle
East. How this is gonna come out I think is

00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:00.200
honesty compels one to say we don't know.
It could come out very well with different

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.109
governance structures and agendas.

00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:08.619
I spent quite a lot of time in Egypt. Egypt
has been moving in the right direction but

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:14.890
too slowly. It was an economy dominated by
the government where young people went to

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:19.700
university and if you ask, "What are you studying?"
They said, "Anything that'll get me a government

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:25.369
job eventually." You don't run a high speed
growth economy with people investing in their

00:42:25.369 --> 00:42:32.180
ability to track down a government job. And
they just weren't unwinding this fast enough

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.410
and the dynamism that we talked about a few
moments ago just didn't start running and

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:43.010
eventually the young people sort of said,
"There's not enough opportunity here," among

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:50.950
the women where there was prominently a huge
non-amount of opportunity. I'm hoping this

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:54.970
comes out well, that is that they get back
on track with governance systems that are

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.819
stable, but you'd have to say that's not a
done deal yet.

00:42:57.819 --> 00:42:58.819
Yes sir.

00:42:58.819 --> 00:43:04.200
&gt;&gt;male #5: What sort of take on growth and
the distribution of the income because different

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:11.150
countries clearly have different points of
pay scale --

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:12.890
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Yeah.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:13.890
&gt;&gt;male #5: and there is an insight on --

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:17.440
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Yeah, I'll try to be brief
on that. The Growth Commission said and the

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:26.519
members of it believed that paying attention
to what the Indians call inclusive growth,

00:43:26.519 --> 00:43:33.190
which is equality of opportunity, not blocking
people out, managing the degree of inequality

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:38.269
and the outcomes in terms of incomes and access
to resources, and protecting people through

00:43:38.269 --> 00:43:43.549
the transitions that occur in this kind of
high speed structural change, that that's

00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:49.750
an inherent part of a successful growth strategy,
it's not an add-on. And if you lose control

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:57.240
of it or fail to pay attention to it with
a very high probability, you will fail. And

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.740
I don't think there are any exceptions to
that.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.450
Now having said that if everybody's poor and
you start growing everybody doesn't increase

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:09.309
at the same time. So measured income inequality
goes up, but if it goes up enough it gets

00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:14.310
to be a problem. I would say China and the
United States are at the margin with Gini

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:22.380
Coefficients of somewhere between.4 and .45,
that's just the standard measure of income

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:29.359
inequality. If it's one, one person has all
the income [laughs] and if it's zero we're

00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:31.900
all equal.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:37.210
There are a collection of countries that have
higher Gini Coefficients and they're in Latin

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:43.460
America and Africa, for the reasons that we
talked about in relation to land and that

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:50.740
causes big problems. You have high Gini Coefficients
like with concentrated income and ownership

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:56.430
of assets; they control the political process
for a while and then people get fed up and

00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:03.180
you get a populace revolt and the pendulum
swings a long way. And then usually economic

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.750
and other policies are adopted that don't
work and there's a kind of crisis of some

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:14.680
kind and then there's a swing back. And this
pendulum swing back from populism to whatever

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:21.710
the special interests of the dominant wealth
are doesn't do anything good for growth. I

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:26.789
mean would be I think, on the political economy
side, an important factor in the struggles

00:45:26.789 --> 00:45:29.839
that have occurred in Latin America to get
things going.

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:35.839
The bottom line is you have to pay attention.
Can I do a little advertising? After I wrote

00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:41.140
the book I started to decide to pay attention
to the distributional effects of globalization

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:47.240
in the advanced countries and wrote a paper
with Sandile Hlatshwayo that you can find

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:52.400
on the Council and Foreign Relations website
that's about the structure of the American

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:57.670
economy and its evolution. And it's a little
worrying. I'll give you one line from it in

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:02.740
the hope that it might interest you. I don't
have time this morning but I think were at

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.630
this crossroads where these effects are big.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:09.140
So if you look at the American economy in
the 20 years roughly coming into the start

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:15.390
of the crisis and ask, "Where did the employment
come from?" The answer is we created 27 million

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:24.210
jobs and almost all of those, 98% net, meaning
netting, I mean Google puts people out of

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:29.359
business, we have job destruction, job creation
all the time. But so these are net increments

00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:31.269
by industry sector.

00:46:31.269 --> 00:46:35.869
If you take the United States economy and
divide it into tradable, goods and services

00:46:35.869 --> 00:46:42.809
that you can trade internationally where you
all live and non-tradable: government; health

00:46:42.809 --> 00:46:50.200
care; construction. I mean you guys are making
the tradable sector bigger and that's nice,

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:56.760
but that's gonna take time. Ninety-eight percent
of the incremental employment in the United

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:02.910
States economy was in the non-tradable sector,
the tradable sector didn't employ any incremental

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:09.079
people. It did fine in value added and highly
educated people came in and did very well,

00:47:09.079 --> 00:47:12.480
and as the global economy gets bigger and
there's all kinds of growth out there it's

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:20.170
a pretty fun place to play. But that's not
where the middle class is employed.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.710
So within our own country the distributional
effects or the impacts of globalization and

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:33.630
technology are very different at different
levels in the income and educational hierarchy.

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:38.410
And I think it's a major problem for us. In
fact it's a miracle that we didn't have an

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:44.380
employment problem before. If we hadn't had
excess consumption, huge growth in health

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:49.859
care, and substantial growth in government
we probably would have had an employment problem

00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:55.579
before the crisis. Anyway there's all kinds
of dimensions to this and I think we should

00:47:55.579 --> 00:47:56.670
pay attention.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:01.660
My next project is gonna go look at the reforms
Germany undertook in the last 10 years 'cause

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.560
they're performing very, very differently
from us right now. And then sort of try to

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:12.349
triangulate. I think I'm gonna collaborate
also with the McKinsey Global Institute on

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:17.990
sort of trying to figure out for all the major
economies in the world where we are and where

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:24.769
we've been in terms of their structural evolution.
I think we're, bottom line is we're missing

00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:30.130
a complete picture of the structure of the
global economy and we need to do it dynamically

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:31.130
and kind of figure out what's going on.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:32.130
&gt;&gt;commentator: I think we have time for just
one more question.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.130
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Okay.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.130
&gt;&gt;Male #6: So it's good to talk about India
and China but I think most of the world is

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:40.890
[bad audio] democracy but poor [inaudible]
so would you consider countries like Sri Lanka,

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:51.300
Bangladesh for example [bad audio]?

00:48:51.300 --> 00:49:09.339
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: You gotta do it case by
case. So, Chile is functioning very well.

00:49:09.339 --> 00:49:14.680
Its growth is a little bit lower than they'd
ideally like because they periodically run

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:20.339
into the natural resource curse with copper
being the driving force, but by and large

00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:28.920
it's extremely well managed. It's democratic
now and it looks like it's an important case.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:37.660
It's not as important as Brazil because of
the scale and so on. Sri Lanka, what can I

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:47.369
say? Jury's out I guess. It's not been particularly
high performer yet but if they have some version

00:49:47.369 --> 00:49:55.210
of the internal conflict taken care of then
it could easily, and especially the big economies

00:49:55.210 --> 00:50:01.269
matter because they pull, they expand the
opportunity set for others. So if you get

00:50:01.269 --> 00:50:13.880
Egypt and North Africa, Brazil in South America,
India in South Asia, and then China in Asia

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:20.690
going in the right direction the spillover
effects in other countries will be very large.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:28.390
If you look at the G-20, the G-20 is more
than 85%of the global GDP and it's 66% of

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:33.750
the world's population. So if you stop paying
attention to the high growth cases and flip

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:40.089
it over then you've basically got a third
of the world's population with all of the

00:50:40.089 --> 00:50:46.460
low growth and thus far non-performing sort
of parts of the world, not all but a fairly

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:54.180
large fraction, and probably somewhere around
12% of global GDP.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:51:00.710
So the question mark at the end of this century
is will that rather substantial number of

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:08.279
people and huge number of countries, I mean
there's probably 180, 190 countries in the

00:51:08.279 --> 00:51:13.030
world. The G-20 even if you add all the ones
in Europe together 'cause Europe's in the

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:21.589
G-20 as a unit, as well as a few countries.
But I guess the central question that we don't

00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:27.359
know the answer to is: are they late starters
but in the process of joining the party or

00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:30.539
not? And we won't know the answer to that
for another 10 years.

00:51:30.539 --> 00:51:35.950
I think the signs are good. I mean I'm an
optimist about Africa. I think the leadership

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:41.559
is young, smart, and responsible in the sense
of taking ownership. They stand up and say

00:51:41.559 --> 00:51:46.809
clearly to their fellow citizens and others,
"This is our thing. We gotta solve this problem

00:51:46.809 --> 00:51:53.550
but we're gonna do it." They've built from
very tough starting points a sense of national

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:58.310
identify which is just the rock bottom foundation.
They were handed a bunch of countries that

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:04.750
made absolutely no sense, that were just boundaries
with several tribes in them and great leadership

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:09.359
and other things have allowed them to pull
it together. I mean people like Nirerie and

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:15.789
Mandela and others and I think the growth
shows it; it's accelerated. They've even come

00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:16.789
through the crisis pretty well.

00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:17.789
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay. How about a round of
applause for Michael Spence?

00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:18.789
[applause]

00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:19.789
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Thank you very much.

00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:20.789
[applause]

00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:21.789
&gt;&gt;Michael Spence: Fun being with you.

00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.790
[applause]
