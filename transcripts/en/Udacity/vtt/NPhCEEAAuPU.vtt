00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.383
[MUSIC]

00:00:03.383 --> 00:00:05.424
When you complete this
program in person,

00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:08.100
you spend most of your
time in classrooms.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.590
Online, we use a variety of tools
to mimic the classroom experience.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.340
We'll spend the bulk of this orientation
covering the tools that you'll

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.200
use during your time in
the Master's program.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.180
&gt;&gt; We'll talk about tools you'll use for
registering for classes.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.320
We'll talking about the learning
management system you'll use for

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.240
submitting assignments, retrieving
syllabi, and accessing class resources.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.670
We'll talk about tools you'll use
to interact with your classmates,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.820
professors and teaching assistants.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.410
We'll talk about tools you'll use
to access lecture materials and

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.330
course notes.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.730
And we'll talk about tools you'll use to
attend office hours, retrieve grades,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.500
take exams and
manage your Georgia Tech account.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.450
&gt;&gt; We know that all this information
may be overwhelming right now.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.310
You don't need to worry about
completely understanding every tool

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.980
we talk about today.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.360
We have just two goals.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.604
One, to give you some initial experience
with the tools you'll be using.

00:00:56.604 --> 00:01:01.450
And two, to make you aware of the
options and resources available to you.
