hey guys welcome back to another episode
of awesome build where today we're going

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830
of awesome build where today we're going
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.829
of awesome build where today we're going
to be making a rubber mold and then

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
to be making a rubber mold and then
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.350
to be making a rubber mold and then
casting it using some casting resins so

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
casting it using some casting resins so
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.820
casting it using some casting resins so
first off what's the purpose in making

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
first off what's the purpose in making
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.890
first off what's the purpose in making
them whole well as you saw in some of my

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
them whole well as you saw in some of my
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.560
them whole well as you saw in some of my
past videos like where we stab Malcolm

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
past videos like where we stab Malcolm
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.019
past videos like where we stab Malcolm
in the eye with that pen and blood at a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
in the eye with that pen and blood at a
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.189
in the eye with that pen and blood at a
squirt out and stuff I had to make a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
squirt out and stuff I had to make a
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.560
squirt out and stuff I had to make a
prosthetic so I made a rigid mold using

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
prosthetic so I made a rigid mold using
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.960
prosthetic so I made a rigid mold using
plaster and then I could pour latex into

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
plaster and then I could pour latex into
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.470
plaster and then I could pour latex into
it

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
it
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.089
it
pull out the latex and then use that

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
pull out the latex and then use that
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.889
pull out the latex and then use that
prosthetic I basically did the same

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
prosthetic I basically did the same
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.819
prosthetic I basically did the same
thing when I had to build the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
thing when I had to build the
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.740
thing when I had to build the
prosthetics for Doug when he did the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
prosthetics for Doug when he did the
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720
prosthetics for Doug when he did the
plant of the Apes review I sculpted the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
plant of the Apes review I sculpted the
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.780
plant of the Apes review I sculpted the
features using some clay and then built

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
features using some clay and then built
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.979
features using some clay and then built
a box out of cardboard basically around

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
a box out of cardboard basically around
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.930
a box out of cardboard basically around
it and then pour it in my plaster so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
it and then pour it in my plaster so
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760
it and then pour it in my plaster so
that I could get my negative and then I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
that I could get my negative and then I
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500
that I could get my negative and then I
could pour my latex into this and that's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
could pour my latex into this and that's
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.900
could pour my latex into this and that's
how I made the prosthetics for his

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
how I made the prosthetics for his
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.389
how I made the prosthetics for his
monkey mask so plaster molds or rigid

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
monkey mask so plaster molds or rigid
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.970
monkey mask so plaster molds or rigid
molds are great for that kind of process

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
molds are great for that kind of process
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979
molds are great for that kind of process
where you're pouring something into it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
where you're pouring something into it
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.560
where you're pouring something into it
that is flexible that you can pull out

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570
that is flexible that you can pull out
 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.820
that is flexible that you can pull out
but if you're going to be making

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
but if you're going to be making
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920
but if you're going to be making
something that's rigid and going to stay

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
something that's rigid and going to stay
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.740
something that's rigid and going to stay
rigid and you want to duplicate it

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750
rigid and you want to duplicate it
 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.960
rigid and you want to duplicate it
silicone molds are a better option but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
silicone molds are a better option but
 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789
silicone molds are a better option but
when you're casting something or making

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
when you're casting something or making
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.340
when you're casting something or making
something that's rigid that can't bend

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
something that's rigid that can't bend
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.600
something that's rigid that can't bend
and stuff like that you want to make a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
and stuff like that you want to make a
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.910
and stuff like that you want to make a
mold that's flexible or make a silicone

part molds with a two-part mold you have

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
part molds with a two-part mold you have
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.170
part molds with a two-part mold you have
two separate pieces that you can pour

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
two separate pieces that you can pour
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.789
two separate pieces that you can pour
your plastic into and then you have a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
your plastic into and then you have a
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.490
your plastic into and then you have a
three dimensional copy of whatever it is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
three dimensional copy of whatever it is
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.080

build we actually are going to be making
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.550
build we actually are going to be making
a two-part mold as part of the build so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
a two-part mold as part of the build so
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.660
a two-part mold as part of the build so
I wanted to give you guys some kind of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
I wanted to give you guys some kind of
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.449
I wanted to give you guys some kind of
an introduction into mold making before

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
an introduction into mold making before
 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.850
an introduction into mold making before
we tackle that project so that's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
we tackle that project so that's
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.140
we tackle that project so that's
basically today we're just going to keep

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
basically today we're just going to keep
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400
basically today we're just going to keep
it simple and just make a one

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
it simple and just make a one
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.390
it simple and just make a one
our mold using the umma 30 and mostly

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
our mold using the umma 30 and mostly
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.360
our mold using the umma 30 and mostly
because the umma 30 is really easy to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
because the umma 30 is really easy to
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.840
because the umma 30 is really easy to
use it's a one-to-one by volume ratio

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850
use it's a one-to-one by volume ratio
 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.210
use it's a one-to-one by volume ratio
which just means you have equal parts a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
which just means you have equal parts a
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.090
which just means you have equal parts a
and B that you mix together to make your

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
and B that you mix together to make your
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.470
and B that you mix together to make your
mole so the type of mole we're going to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
mole so the type of mole we're going to
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.030
mole so the type of mole we're going to
be making up today is what I call a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
be making up today is what I call a
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.610
be making up today is what I call a
scrap mold and what that means is when I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
scrap mold and what that means is when I
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.010
scrap mold and what that means is when I
am making a larger mold and I'm pouring

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
am making a larger mold and I'm pouring
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.580
am making a larger mold and I'm pouring
my resin plastics into it I generally

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
my resin plastics into it I generally
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.380
my resin plastics into it I generally
want to make sure that I have enough so

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
want to make sure that I have enough so
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.420
want to make sure that I have enough so
I usually make a little bit more than I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
I usually make a little bit more than I
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.450
I usually make a little bit more than I
think I need so that I don't run out but

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460
think I need so that I don't run out but
 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.700
think I need so that I don't run out but
it cures very quickly and casting resins

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710
it cures very quickly and casting resins
 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.260
it cures very quickly and casting resins
aren't really that cheap and I would

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270
aren't really that cheap and I would
 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.930
aren't really that cheap and I would
rather not waste it so I create a series

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
rather not waste it so I create a series
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.470
rather not waste it so I create a series
of these scrap molds where I can pour

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
of these scrap molds where I can pour
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.290
of these scrap molds where I can pour
the excess resin plastic into it and let

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
the excess resin plastic into it and let
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.660
the excess resin plastic into it and let
it cure and then I have some of these

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
it cure and then I have some of these
 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.520
it cure and then I have some of these
random parts and stuff like that that I

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530
random parts and stuff like that that I
 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.590
random parts and stuff like that that I
can use for other builds and other stuff

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
can use for other builds and other stuff
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600
can use for other builds and other stuff
down the line like this one is just

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
down the line like this one is just
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.140
down the line like this one is just
simply a bunch of bolt heads and screw

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150
simply a bunch of bolt heads and screw
 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.700
simply a bunch of bolt heads and screw
heads and machine screws and stuff like

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710
heads and machine screws and stuff like
 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.320
heads and machine screws and stuff like
that I just took a bunch of bolts and

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330
that I just took a bunch of bolts and
 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.610
that I just took a bunch of bolts and
machine screws and push them into a

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
machine screws and push them into a
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.680
machine screws and push them into a
piece of clay I mixed up a rubber mold

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690
piece of clay I mixed up a rubber mold
 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.210
piece of clay I mixed up a rubber mold
poured it in and basically it fit like

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220
poured it in and basically it fit like
 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.020
poured it in and basically it fit like
this when it secured I could pull it out

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
this when it secured I could pull it out
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.900
this when it secured I could pull it out
and now I can pour my resin in there

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
and now I can pour my resin in there
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.660
and now I can pour my resin in there
when I have excess and then I have all

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670
when I have excess and then I have all
 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.630
when I have excess and then I have all
these little parts these different

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640
these little parts these different
 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.210
these little parts these different

machine screw heads and bolt heads and
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.120
machine screw heads and bolt heads and
stuff like that that I can use for

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130
stuff like that that I can use for
 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.100
stuff like that that I can use for
dressing up other things for instance

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110
dressing up other things for instance
 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.470
dressing up other things for instance
the spaceship corridor that we just

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
the spaceship corridor that we just
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.570
the spaceship corridor that we just
built a lot of those different paneling

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580
built a lot of those different paneling
 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.490
built a lot of those different paneling
and pieces and stuff like that a glue a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
and pieces and stuff like that a glue a
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530

a cool look and texture it makes it look

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200
a cool look and texture it makes it look
 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.310
a cool look and texture it makes it look
more industrial and you don't have to

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320
more industrial and you don't have to
 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.420
more industrial and you don't have to
waste real hardware this so essentially

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430
waste real hardware this so essentially
 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.140
waste real hardware this so essentially
that's what we're going to be doing

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
that's what we're going to be doing
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.199
that's what we're going to be doing
today we could be making just a another

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209
today we could be making just a another
 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.030
today we could be making just a another
scrap mold instead we're going to be

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
scrap mold instead we're going to be
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.020
scrap mold instead we're going to be
making a box using some scrap foam board

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030
making a box using some scrap foam board
 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.979
making a box using some scrap foam board
and we'll glue our objects down to it

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989
and we'll glue our objects down to it
 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.440
and we'll glue our objects down to it
make the box using some hot glue seal it

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450
make the box using some hot glue seal it
 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.659
make the box using some hot glue seal it
up so that it's sealed tight pour in our

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669
up so that it's sealed tight pour in our
 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.010
up so that it's sealed tight pour in our
mold and then give it about a day to

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
mold and then give it about a day to
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.110
mold and then give it about a day to
cure and then we're going to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120
cure and then we're going to
 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.000
cure and then we're going to
open it up and see what we've got so

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010
open it up and see what we've got so
 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.110
open it up and see what we've got so
we're just going to be using a bunch of

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120
we're just going to be using a bunch of
 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.510
we're just going to be using a bunch of
these random scrap plastic pieces and

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
these random scrap plastic pieces and
 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.560

I got these but some sort of a end cap

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740
I got these but some sort of a end cap
 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.469
I got these but some sort of a end cap
or something like that alright but I've

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479
or something like that alright but I've
 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.060
or something like that alright but I've
got a few of these I think they have an

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070
got a few of these I think they have an
 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.400
got a few of these I think they have an
interesting look in shape and for some

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410
interesting look in shape and for some
 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.409
interesting look in shape and for some
of our future builds like their

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419
of our future builds like their
 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.120
of our future builds like their
spaceship or door and stuff like that

spaceship or door and stuff like that
 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.370
spaceship or door and stuff like that
we're going to be making robot or gonna

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380
we're going to be making robot or gonna
 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.050
we're going to be making robot or gonna
be building model spaceships or and

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060
be building model spaceships or and
 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.610
be building model spaceships or and
stuff like that from scratch we'll have

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620
stuff like that from scratch we'll have
 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.200
stuff like that from scratch we'll have
all of these different kind of parts

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210
all of these different kind of parts
 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.780
all of these different kind of parts
that I can use very ambiguous and you

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790
that I can use very ambiguous and you
 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.340
that I can use very ambiguous and you
can use them for multiple applications

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350
can use them for multiple applications
 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.680
can use them for multiple applications
and they're flat on one side which makes

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690
and they're flat on one side which makes
 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.400
and they're flat on one side which makes
them ideal for a one part mold so we're

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410
them ideal for a one part mold so we're
 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.690
them ideal for a one part mold so we're
going to cut out a chunk of our foam

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700
going to cut out a chunk of our foam
 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.189
going to cut out a chunk of our foam
board here and we can glue our pieces on

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199
board here and we can glue our pieces on
 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:38.469
board here and we can glue our pieces on
to and then make our walls and now you

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479
to and then make our walls and now you
 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.940
to and then make our walls and now you
can use a little bit of hot glue or some

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950
can use a little bit of hot glue or some
 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.000
can use a little bit of hot glue or some
double-sided tape to kind of just glue

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010
double-sided tape to kind of just glue
 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.680
double-sided tape to kind of just glue
these down there probably use hot glue

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690
these down there probably use hot glue
 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:54.450
these down there probably use hot glue
for this one

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460
 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.719
I'm going to seal up all my edges so

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729
I'm going to seal up all my edges so
 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.800
I'm going to seal up all my edges so
then we pour

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810
 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.440
with with rubber into it doesn't seep

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450
with with rubber into it doesn't seep
 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.320
with with rubber into it doesn't seep
out make sure that you get all the

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330
out make sure that you get all the
 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.220
out make sure that you get all the
little stringy pieces out of there so

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230
little stringy pieces out of there so
 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.750
little stringy pieces out of there so
that they're not laying across any of

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760
that they're not laying across any of
 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.850
that they're not laying across any of
the pieces in your mold because the mold

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860
the pieces in your mold because the mold
 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.409
the pieces in your mold because the mold
will actually capture every single

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419
will actually capture every single
 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.070
will actually capture every single
surface detail alright now that we have

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080
surface detail alright now that we have
 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.950
surface detail alright now that we have
our box made and all of our pieces glued

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960
our box made and all of our pieces glued
 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.140
our box made and all of our pieces glued
into the bottom of it we're ready to mix

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150
into the bottom of it we're ready to mix
 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.750
into the bottom of it we're ready to mix
our rubber mold and pour it in

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760
our rubber mold and pour it in
 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.360
our rubber mold and pour it in
alright safety first make sure that when

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370
alright safety first make sure that when
 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.350
alright safety first make sure that when
you're handling the stuff you wear

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360
you're handling the stuff you wear
 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:46.350
you're handling the stuff you wear
gloves and eye protection to stuff up

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360
gloves and eye protection to stuff up
 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.280
gloves and eye protection to stuff up
so we have our Part A Part B container

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290
so we have our Part A Part B container
 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.719
so we have our Part A Part B container
to mix it in some mixing sticks I would

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729
to mix it in some mixing sticks I would
 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:56.860
to mix it in some mixing sticks I would
suggest if you guys are going to use

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870
suggest if you guys are going to use
 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.120
suggest if you guys are going to use
this stuff plan on using it all at once

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130
this stuff plan on using it all at once
 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.000
this stuff plan on using it all at once
once you open it up and even if you

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010
once you open it up and even if you
 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.379
once you open it up and even if you
don't mix it together but you just have

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:05.389
don't mix it together but you just have
 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:07.420
don't mix it together but you just have
equal parts open you don't use

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430
equal parts open you don't use
 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.250
equal parts open you don't use
everything I would use it within the

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260
everything I would use it within the
 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.159
everything I would use it within the
next few days of when you open it

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169
next few days of when you open it
 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.780
next few days of when you open it
because it does not have a very long

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790
because it does not have a very long
 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.490
because it does not have a very long
shelf life at all so whatever your

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500
shelf life at all so whatever your
 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.969
shelf life at all so whatever your
project is I would try and make it so

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:18.979
project is I would try and make it so
 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.190
project is I would try and make it so
that you're using all of the product up

do them at the same time or within a day
 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.590
do them at the same time or within a day
or two of each other because you don't

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:32.600
or two of each other because you don't
 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.770
or two of each other because you don't
want to waste this stuff a box like this

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780
want to waste this stuff a box like this
 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.690
want to waste this stuff a box like this
cost roughly about twenty to twenty-five

so tomorrow we'll see what we've got
 

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.970
so tomorrow we'll see what we've got
we'll pull our box apart pull our rubber

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:51.980
we'll pull our box apart pull our rubber
 

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.130
we'll pull our box apart pull our rubber
mold out and see what happens

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:57.140
 

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.960
all right so we've let it cure overnight

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:58.970
all right so we've let it cure overnight
 

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.240
all right so we've let it cure overnight
so now we're going to tear open our box

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.250
so now we're going to tear open our box
 

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:16.769
so now we're going to tear open our box
and see what we got yeah so I've got our

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:16.779
and see what we got yeah so I've got our
 

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:26.130
and see what we got yeah so I've got our
pieces here we can pull out of our mold

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.140
 

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.470
so now we're ready to mix and pour in

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480
so now we're ready to mix and pour in
 

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.940
so now we're ready to mix and pour in
our resin plastic all right so what

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:33.950
our resin plastic all right so what
 

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.699
our resin plastic all right so what
we're going to be using is smooth-cast

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:35.709
we're going to be using is smooth-cast
 

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:40.180
we're going to be using is smooth-cast
325 it's again it's another 1/2 1 by

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.190
325 it's again it's another 1/2 1 by
 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.690
325 it's again it's another 1/2 1 by
volume ratio of Parts A and B and so

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:43.700
volume ratio of Parts A and B and so
 

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.449
volume ratio of Parts A and B and so
it's super easy to use really easy to

00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:46.459
it's super easy to use really easy to
 

00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:48.220
it's super easy to use really easy to
mix up and stuff like that and the

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.230
mix up and stuff like that and the
 

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.900
mix up and stuff like that and the
reason what we're using the 325 is

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:49.910
reason what we're using the 325 is
 

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.300
reason what we're using the 325 is
because you can add pigment to it you

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.310
because you can add pigment to it you
 

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.980
because you can add pigment to it you
can add a colorant adding a little bit

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:53.990
can add a colorant adding a little bit
 

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.990
can add a colorant adding a little bit
of black to it if you don't have to add

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000
of black to it if you don't have to add
 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.290
of black to it if you don't have to add
any color into it you can just use it it

00:09:59.290 --> 00:09:59.300
any color into it you can just use it it
 

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.660
any color into it you can just use it it
comes out kind of with like with a

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:01.670
comes out kind of with like with a
 

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.050
comes out kind of with like with a
little bit of a translucent to it but

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:05.060
little bit of a translucent to it but
 

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.060
little bit of a translucent to it but
then you can paint the surface any color

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.070
then you can paint the surface any color
 

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.930
then you can paint the surface any color
you want does really matter so all right

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:10.940
you want does really matter so all right
 

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.490
you want does really matter so all right
so let's start mixing all right don't

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:12.500
so let's start mixing all right don't
 

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.600
so let's start mixing all right don't
forget your gloves and your safety

touch this stuff with your bare hands
till after it cures so again we're just

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560
till after it cures so again we're just
 

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.319
till after it cures so again we're just
going to add equal parts of a and B into

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:23.329
going to add equal parts of a and B into
 

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:25.900
going to add equal parts of a and B into
some cups I'm going to add a little bit

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:25.910
some cups I'm going to add a little bit
 

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.880
some cups I'm going to add a little bit
of the colorant into Part B before we

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:27.890
of the colorant into Part B before we
 

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.860
of the colorant into Part B before we
mix and then once we mix it up into a

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:29.870
mix and then once we mix it up into a
 

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.470
mix and then once we mix it up into a
separate cup get a good mix going pour

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480
separate cup get a good mix going pour
 

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.960
separate cup get a good mix going pour
it right into our mold and about 20

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:34.970
it right into our mold and about 20
 

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.389
it right into our mold and about 20
minutes to a half hour we should have
