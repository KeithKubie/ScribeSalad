00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:02.656
- [Instructor] So we have the graph

00:00:02.656 --> 00:00:05.466
of y is equal to g of x right over here.

00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.904
And I wanna think about what is the limit

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.821
as x approaches five

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:11.802
of g of x?

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:15.056
Well we've done this multiple times.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.052
Let's think about what g of x approaches

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:19.769
as x approaches five from the left.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.763
g of x is approaching negative six.

00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:26.364
As x approaches five from the right,

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:29.266
g of x looks like it's
approaching negative six.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.099
So a reasonable estimate
based on looking at this graph

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.630
is that as x approaches five,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.649
g of x is approaching negative six.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.833
And it's worth noting

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.271
that that's not what g of five is.

00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:43.639
g of five is a different value.

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:45.613
But the whole point of this video

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:48.399
is to appreciate all that a limit does.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.791
A limit only describes
the behavior of a function

00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:53.020
as it approaches a point.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.899
It doesn't tell us exactly
what's happening at that point,

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.200
what g of five is,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.057
and it doesn't tell us much

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:00.683
about the rest of the function,

00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:02.494
about the rest of the graph.

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:05.745
For example, I could construct
many different functions

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:08.252
for which the limit as x approaches five

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:09.669
is equal to negative six,

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.200
and they would look very
different from g of x.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.033
For example, I could say the limit of

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.542
f of x

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.096
as x approaches five

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:20.652
is equal to negative six,

00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:23.136
and I can construct an
f of x that does this

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:25.040
that looks very different than g of x.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.341
In fact if you're up for it,

00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:28.013
pause this video and see
if you can so the same,

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:30.219
if you have some graph paper,
or even just sketch it.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.191
Well the key thing is that
the behavior of the function

00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.558
as x approaches five from both sides,

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:37.672
from the left and the right,

00:01:37.672 --> 00:01:39.646
it has to be approaching negative six.

00:01:39.646 --> 00:01:40.896
So for example,

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:45.915
a function that looks like this,

00:01:45.915 --> 00:01:48.028
so let me draw f of x,

00:01:48.028 --> 00:01:51.674
an f of x that looks like this,

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:53.694
and is even defined right over there,

00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:57.339
and then does something like this.

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:58.756
That would work.

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.335
As we approach from the left,

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:01.380
we're approaching negative six.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.750
As we approach from the right,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.747
we approaching negative six.

00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:07.510
You could have a function

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.093
like this, let's say the limit,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.408
let's call it h of x,

00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:15.706
as x approaches five

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:18.307
is equal to negative six.

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:19.770
You could have a function like this,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.767
maybe it's defined up to there,

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.042
then it's you have a circle there,

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.527
and then it keeps going.

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:31.148
Maybe it's not defined at
all for any of these values,

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:33.052
and then maybe down here

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:36.813
it is defined for all x values
greater than or equal to four

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:39.600
and it just goes right
through negative six.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.854
So notice,

00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:42.293
all of these,

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:44.801
all of these functions
as x approaches five,

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:46.566
they all have the limit defined

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.145
and it's equal to negative six,

00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:52.440
but these functions all look
very very very different.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.484
Now another thing to appreciate is

00:02:54.484 --> 00:02:56.132
for a given function,

00:02:56.132 --> 00:02:58.083
and let me delete these.

00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.801
Oftentimes we're asked to find the limits

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.704
as x approaches some type
of an interesting value.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:03.795
So for example,

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:05.467
x approaches five,

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:06.883
five is interesting right over here

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:09.948
because we have this point discontinuity.

00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:10.993
But you could take the limit

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:12.827
on an infinite number of points

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:15.057
for this function right over here.

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:17.007
You could say the limit

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:17.840
of g of x

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:21.024
as x approaches,

00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:24.024
not x equals, as x approaches,

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:26.481
one, what would that be?

00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:28.315
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:29.569
Well let's see,

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.959
as x approaches one
from the left-hand side,

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.116
it looks like we are
approaching this value here.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:40.715
And as x approaches one
from the right-hand side,

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:43.037
it looks like we are
approaching that value there.

00:03:43.037 --> 00:03:46.195
So that would be equal to g of one.

00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:48.377
That is equal to g of one

00:03:48.377 --> 00:03:49.979
based on that would be a reasonable,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.626
that's a reasonable conclusion to make

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:54.089
looking at this graph.

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.620
And if we were to
estimate that g of one is,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.382
looks like it's approximately negative 5.1

00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:02.132
or 5.2, negative 5.1.

00:04:05.096 --> 00:04:07.510
We could find the limit

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.997
of g of x

00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:10.830
as x approaches pi.

00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:15.336
So pi is right around there.

00:04:15.336 --> 00:04:17.774
As x approaches pi from the left,

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:19.980
we're approaching that value

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.046
which just looks actually pretty close

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.463
to the one we just thought about.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.134
As we approach from the right,

00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:26.203
we're approaching that value.

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:27.503
And once again in this case,

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:31.032
this is gonna be equal to g of pi.

00:04:31.032 --> 00:04:32.843
We don't have any interesting
discontinuities there

00:04:32.843 --> 00:04:34.655
or anything like that.

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:36.837
So there's two big takeaways here.

00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:39.090
You can construct many different functions

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.224
that would have the same limit at a point,

00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:44.221
and for a given function,

00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:46.659
you can take the limit
at many different points,

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.608
in fact an infinite number
of different points.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:52.209
And it's important to point that out,

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.672
no pun intended,

00:04:53.672 --> 00:04:56.760
because oftentimes we
get used to seeing limits

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.036
only at points where something

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:01.536
strange seems to be happening.
