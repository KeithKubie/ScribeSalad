00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.833
I recognized the roles
that were placed on me very early.

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:20.982
One persistent concept that I observed --

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.363
existing in our language, in our media --

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:28.378
was that women are not only
supposed to have children,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.222
they are supposed to want to.

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:34.503
This existed everywhere.

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:38.552
It existed in the ways
that adults spoke to me

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:42.536
when they posed questions
in the context of "when."

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.458
"When you get married ..."

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.156
"When you have kids ..."

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:51.806
And these future musings
were always presented to me

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.631
like part of this American dream,

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.344
but it always felt to me
like someone else's dream.

00:00:57.368 --> 00:01:01.599
You see, a value that I have
always understood about myself

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:04.360
was that I never wanted children.

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:08.837
And as a kid, when I would try
to explain this,

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:12.670
this disconnect between
their roles and my values,

00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:14.310
they often laughed

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:17.519
in the way that adults do
at the absurdities of children.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.548
And they would tell me knowingly,

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:22.127
"You'll change your mind."

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:27.382
And people have been saying
things like that to me my whole life.

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:31.782
Otherwise polite conversation
can turn intrusive fast.

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.088
"Does your husband know?"

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:37.919
(Laughter)

00:01:37.943 --> 00:01:39.292
"Do your parents know?"

00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:40.466
(Laughter)

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:42.886
"Don't you want a family?"

00:01:44.463 --> 00:01:46.639
"Don't you want to leave anything behind?"

00:01:48.106 --> 00:01:53.977
And the primary buzzword
when discussing childlessness,

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.443
"That's selfish."

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.585
There are countless reasons
a woman may have

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.705
for choosing to abstain from motherhood,

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.594
the majority of them
not self-prioritizing.

00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:14.396
But it is still socially acceptable
to publicly vilify women as such,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.054
because none of these reasons
have made it into the social narrative.

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:24.165
When I was little and learning
about the inevitability of maternity,

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.932
it was never explained to me

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:29.987
the commonness of these factors
that women consider,

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.131
like the risk of passing on
hereditary illness,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:37.313
the danger of having to stop
life-saving medication

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:39.276
for the duration of your pregnancy,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.428
concern about overpopulation,

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.214
your access to resources,

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.918
and the fact that there are
415,000 children

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:53.870
in the foster-care system
in the United States at any given time.

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:58.748
Reasons like these, many more,

00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:03.724
and the fact that I don't like to leave
things of this magnitude to chance,

00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:06.106
all informed my decision

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.889
to become surgically sterilized.

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:12.409
I began my research eagerly.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:14.024
I wanted to fully understand

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:19.453
all that was going to come
with undergoing a tubal ligation,

00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:22.278
which is just another word
for getting your tubes tied.

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:26.139
I wanted to know approval to aftermath,

00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:28.824
satisfaction rates, risks, statistics.

00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:32.505
And at first, I was empowered.

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:36.251
You see, the way the narrative
has always been taught to me,

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:40.543
I would have thought that women
who didn't want children were so rare,

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:44.346
and then I learned
one in five American women

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.687
won't be having a biological child --

00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:49.544
some by choice, some by chance.

00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:50.757
(Applause)

00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:53.144
But I was not alone.

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:57.907
But the more I read,
the more disheartened I became.

00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:00.738
I read women's stories,

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:03.476
trying desperately to get this procedure.

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:10.929
I learned how common it was
for women to exhaust their finances

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:16.429
appealing to dozens of ob-gyns
over many years,

00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.783
only to be turned down so many times,

00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:22.738
often with such blatant disrespect
that they just gave up.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:30.165
Women reported that medical practitioners
were often condescending

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.514
and dismissive of their motivations,

00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:36.189
being told things like,

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:38.434
"Come back when you're married
with a child."

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:44.853
But women who did have children,
who went to go get this procedure,

00:04:44.877 --> 00:04:46.501
were told they were too young,

00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:51.048
or they didn't have enough children,

00:04:51.072 --> 00:04:53.025
which is very interesting,

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:59.310
because the legal requirements in my state
for getting this kind of surgery were,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.811
"Be at least 21 years old,"

00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:06.225
"appear of sound mind,
acting of your own accord,"

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.106
and "have a 30-day waiting period."

00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:14.758
And I was perplexed that I could meet
all of these legal requirements

00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:19.178
and still have to face a battle
in the exam room

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:20.669
for my bodily autonomy.

00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:23.638
And it was daunting,

00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:25.719
but I was determined.

00:05:26.664 --> 00:05:31.496
I remember I dressed so professionally
to that first appointment.

00:05:31.988 --> 00:05:33.165
(Laughter)

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:34.856
I sat up straight.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.450
I spoke clearly.

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:42.165
I wanted to give that doctor
every piece of evidence

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.292
that I was not the date
of birth in that file.

00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:49.124
And I made sure to mention things like,

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:50.839
"I just got my bachelor's degree

00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:53.426
and I'm applying
to these doctoral programs,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.381
I'm going to study these things."

00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:59.543
And "my long-term partner
has this kind of business,"

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.993
and "I've done research
on this for months.

00:06:03.017 --> 00:06:05.325
I understand everything
about it, all the risks."

00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:10.323
Because I needed the doctor to know
that this was not a whim,

00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:12.308
not reactionary,

00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:15.784
not your 20-something
looking to go out and party

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.928
without fear of getting knocked up ...

00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:19.920
(Laughter)

00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:22.858
that this supported something
integral to who I was.

00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:26.877
And I understand informed consent,

00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:33.015
so I fully expected to be reeducated
on how it all worked, but ...

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:39.790
At one point, the information being
given to me started to feel agenda'd,

00:06:39.814 --> 00:06:44.917
interlaced with bias
and inflated statistics.

00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:48.023
The questions began to feel interrogative.

00:06:49.885 --> 00:06:52.347
At first they were asking me questions

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.830
that seemed to understand
my situation better,

00:06:55.854 --> 00:06:59.267
and then it seemed like they were
asking questions to try to trip me up.

00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:03.639
I felt like I was on the witness stand,
being cross-examined.

00:07:04.651 --> 00:07:06.580
The doctor asked me about my partner.

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.223
"How does he or she
feel about all of this?"

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.937
"Well, I've been with
the same man for five years,

00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:16.793
and he fully supports any decision
I make for my body."

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.720
And he said, "Well,
what happens in the future,

00:07:19.744 --> 00:07:20.895
if you change partners?

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.109
What happens when that person
wants children?"

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:28.919
And I didn't quite know
how to react to that,

00:07:28.943 --> 00:07:30.959
because what I was hearing

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:37.956
was this doctor tell me that I'm supposed
to disregard everything I believe

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.780
if a partner demands children.

00:07:40.804 --> 00:07:43.964
So I told him not to worry about that.

00:07:43.988 --> 00:07:47.232
My stance on childbearing
has always been first date conversation.

00:07:47.597 --> 00:07:53.684
(Laughter)

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:54.858
(Cheering)

00:07:54.882 --> 00:07:58.803
(Laughter)

00:07:59.253 --> 00:08:01.666
He then asks me to consider

00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:07.793
how "in 20 years, you could really
come to regret this" ...

00:08:08.848 --> 00:08:10.309
as though I hadn't.

00:08:11.654 --> 00:08:16.132
I told him,

00:08:16.156 --> 00:08:19.381
"OK, if I wake up one day

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:23.603
and realize, you know,

00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:26.349
I wish I'd made a different
decision back then,

00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:31.871
the truth is, I'd only removed
a single path to parenthood.

00:08:32.973 --> 00:08:35.506
I never needed biology
to form family anyway."

00:08:36.356 --> 00:08:43.356
(Applause)

00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:48.677
And I would much rather
deal with that any day

00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:51.669
than deal with one day waking up,

00:08:51.694 --> 00:08:55.663
realize I'd had a child

00:08:55.688 --> 00:09:01.609
that I didn't really want
or was prepared to care for.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:04.180
Because one of these affects only me.

00:09:04.873 --> 00:09:07.340
The other affects a child,

00:09:07.364 --> 00:09:09.650
their development, their well-being --

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:13.333
(Applause)

00:09:13.357 --> 00:09:15.531
and human beings
are not to be gambled with.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:24.085
He then tells me why no one
was going to approve this procedure,

00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:25.624
certainly not he,

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.887
because of a concept
called medical paternalism,

00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:33.976
which allows him,
as my well-informed provider,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.230
to make decisions for me ...

00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:40.294
based on his perception
of my best interest,

00:09:40.318 --> 00:09:43.024
regardless of what I,
as the patient, want or believe.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.785
He takes this opportunity to step out

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:51.705
and discuss my case
with my potential surgeon,

00:09:51.729 --> 00:09:57.006
and through the door, I hear him
describe me as a little girl.

00:10:01.137 --> 00:10:02.851
I was so offended.

00:10:03.434 --> 00:10:04.984
I wanted to defend myself.

00:10:05.412 --> 00:10:09.833
I wanted to explicitly explain
to each one of these providers

00:10:09.857 --> 00:10:11.177
how they were treating me,

00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:13.626
that it was belittling and sexist,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.411
and I didn't have to take it.

00:10:19.082 --> 00:10:20.232
But I did take it.

00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:24.756
I swallowed every sharp word in my throat,

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.538
clenched my jaw, and instead

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:34.766
answered each one of their condescending
questions and statements.

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:40.577
I had come here looking
for objectivity and support

00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:44.668
and instead I felt dismissed and silenced,

00:10:44.692 --> 00:10:46.061
and I hated myself for it.

00:10:46.085 --> 00:10:50.681
I hated that I was letting people
disrespect me repeatedly.

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:53.736
But this was my one shot.

00:10:57.424 --> 00:11:01.908
That was one of multiple consultations
that I had to go to.

00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:07.189
At one point, I had seen five or six
medical professionals in the same hour.

00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:11.415
The door to the exam room
felt more like the door to a clown car.

00:11:11.439 --> 00:11:12.805
There's my primary,

00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:14.637
there's his colleague,

00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:17.154
the director, OK.

00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:22.574
It felt like I was asking them
to infect me with smallpox

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:27.001
instead of, I don't know,
obtain birth control.

00:11:28.787 --> 00:11:33.129
But I didn't waver,

00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:35.400
and I was persistent,

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:41.797
and I eventually convinced one of them
to allow the procedure.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:48.060
And even as I am in the room,
signing the consent forms

00:11:48.084 --> 00:11:52.457
and getting the hormone shots
and tying up loose ends ...

00:11:53.556 --> 00:11:57.515
my doctor is shaking
his head in disapproval.

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:00.850
"You'll change your mind."

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:06.781
I never really understood

00:12:06.805 --> 00:12:11.161
how strongly this society
clings to this role

00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:12.502
until I went through this.

00:12:13.556 --> 00:12:19.611
I experienced firsthand, repeatedly,

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:24.542
how people, be it medical providers,

00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:28.445
colleagues, strangers,

00:12:30.554 --> 00:12:36.213
were literally unable
to separate me being a woman

00:12:37.261 --> 00:12:38.744
from me being a mother.

00:12:40.191 --> 00:12:44.780
And I've always believed
that having children

00:12:44.804 --> 00:12:47.287
was an extension of womanhood,
not the definition.

00:12:48.728 --> 00:12:51.404
I believe that a woman's value

00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:55.910
should never be determined
by whether or not she has a child,

00:12:55.934 --> 00:13:00.078
because that strips her
of her entire identity

00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:01.521
as an adult unto herself.

00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:06.026
Women have this amazing ability
to create life,

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:09.296
but when we say that that is her purpose,

00:13:11.414 --> 00:13:15.897
that says that her entire existence
is a means to an end.

00:13:20.995 --> 00:13:25.151
It's so easy to forget the roles
that society places on us

00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:27.408
are so much more than mere titles.

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.996
What about the weight
that comes with them,

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.249
the pressure to conform
to these standards ...

00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:35.335
the fear associated with questioning them,

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:38.827
and the desires that we
cast aside to accept them?

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.223
There are many paths
to happiness and fulfillment.

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:46.193
They all look very different,

00:13:46.217 --> 00:13:50.940
but I believe that every one

00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:53.948
is paved with the right
to self-determination.

00:13:57.951 --> 00:14:04.824
I want women to know that your choice
to embrace or forego motherhood

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:10.317
is not in any way tied
to your worthiness or identity

00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:14.439
as spouses, as adults, or as women ...

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.158
and there absolutely is
a choice behind maternity,

00:14:20.182 --> 00:14:21.984
and it is yours

00:14:22.008 --> 00:14:23.158
and yours alone.

00:14:23.645 --> 00:14:24.796
Thank you.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:31.820
(Applause)
