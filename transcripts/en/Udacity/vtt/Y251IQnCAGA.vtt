00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We've created a list using the square brackets

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that contains 5 strings.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Each one is a 1-letter string spelling out the word "Hello."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And we've stored that in the variable p.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We could do the same thing we did with strings.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We could reassign p to a new value.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And if we did that, that would create a new list

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
containing the letters Y-E-L-L-O

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and assign that to the variable p.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What we're going to do instead is mutate the list that we already created,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we can do that by modifying the value of its elements.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here we have an assignment where on the left side of the assignment

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we have p[0].

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This means select from the list that p refers to.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Find position 0.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Instead of getting the value at that position, though,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
since it's on the left side of an assignment now,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we're going to replace that value with what's on the right side of the assignment,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in this case, the string containing the single letter y.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's see what that looks like.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When we created the list initially,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we had a list like this, and I'm going to draw the list showing boxes.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This is a list.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Each box is 1 element of the list,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and after the initial assignment, the value p refers to is this list.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now when we do the assignment where p[0] is on the left side,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
well, p[0] will find this position.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The assignment will replace what's there.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, replace the H with the Y.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Note that we did not create a new list.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
P still refers to the same list. We didn't have to change the arrow.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But we've changed the value of that list.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I've created a list with the elements being 5 strings

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
spelling out the word "Hello."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I can see that that's the value of p.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now I'm going to use the assignment expression

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to replace the value in the first element

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and print p again.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now when we run, we see that for the first print

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the value of p is Hello.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
For the second print, the value of p is Yellow.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We can change other values the same way,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
so now we've changed the value in position 4

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to an exclamation point, and we can see

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the third line printed out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We have "Yell!"
