00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.161
 In the previous video about protein structure 

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.620
 We talked about different structure sequences 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.260
 Start with the initial structure 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.020
 - All we are talking about now is a review - 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.430
 The primary structure is just a sequence of amino acids 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.686
 But then we can start thinking 

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:17.990
 In how they are formed, by thinking about the secondary structure 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.890
 Which are interactions 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.870
 The infrastructure, we dig a little deeper 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.746
 In the video induction, where we talked about 

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:30.720
 Some traditional secondary structures 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260
 We talked about parallel beta sheets 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.400
 Here I have two basic structures 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.100
 Directed in the same manner 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.630
 Nitrogen, carbon alpha, carbon carbon 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.260
 Now the side strings are drawn as general sets with the R code 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 What we have seen is that it is possible to have a hydrogen bond 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.300
 Among these infrastructures, these are 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.890
 Parallel plate 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.630
 And if the two structures are mixed 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.320
 These are towards nitrogen, carbon alpha, carbonyl carbon 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.168
 These are carbon carbon, alpha carbon, and nitrogen 

00:00:57.168 --> 00:01:00.360
 Our sheets become reversible parallel beta 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.390
 Again, these are the interactions of the infrastructure. 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.590
 Or we can have an alpha spiral like this 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.190
 Where there are hydrogen bonds between 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.800
 Different layers of the coil. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.390
 Then we get to the triangular structure, 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.400
 When talking about the triangular structure 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.630
 Side chain interactions are mentioned 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.090
 And start thinking 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.640
 What are these R groups and how 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 These groups affect the overall shape of the protein? 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.140
 As an aid to think about it, 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.471
 Some pictures are painted here below 

00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:34.260
 Thus it is possible to imagine 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.700
 To imagine this thread 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.060
 The orange curve you painted here, 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.050
 Suppose, for the sake of perception, 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.560
 That this curve is the peptide series 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.120
 I remind you of the review 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.290
 We can think of the first level, 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.550
 The primary structure, which is a 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.200
 I have this amino acid, then this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.730
 Then this 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.510
 This sequence is the primary structure 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.039
 It is possible to have interactions within the infrastructure 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.560
 Thus it is possible that these are here, 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.220
 Parallel reverse beta plate 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.390
 Here is where we have hydrogen bonds 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.900
 I try to draw a dotted line but it is very small 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.478
 Where we have hydrogen bonds 

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:23.130
 Here between these two basic structures 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.384
 I did not draw the side chains here 

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:26.960
 We could have an alpha screw here. 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.510
 Again, we have hydrogen bonds 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.350
 Between the layers of the coil. 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.460
 But let us now talk about the tripartite structure 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.130
 Which relate to the side chains. 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.890
 One example of a tripartite structure, 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.130
 A number of side chains are drawn here. 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.260
 This is from the amino acid "Valin", I did not draw the initial shape. 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.590
 The infrastructure is on top here. 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.830
 It is clear that nothing was painted according to the ladder 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.190
 But the Palin side chain, its R range is 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.250
 Hydrocarbons are pure, therefore they are water-resistant 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.620
 So, one of the common interactions we can see 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.850
 The side chains are that the strings are waterproof 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.960
 Can not be outside 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.160
 Of the protein molecule present in aqueous solution 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.330
 Which is exposed to water. 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.192
 But it is possible to rally towards the center, 

00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:12.890
 Thus may affect the curvature 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.100
 The polypeptide series 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.080
 Or in the form of protein as a whole. 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.270
 These, for example, may be water-threatening. 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.590
 These here may be watery 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.760
 Gather away from water. 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.100
 I paint everything in two dimensions only, 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.630
 But of course the proteins are present in three dimensions, 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.290
 Making their forms interesting, 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.210
 It is often difficult to catch up. 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.964
 It is possible to have the amino acid Cyrine, for example 

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:42.100
 With a hydroxyl group in its side chain. 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.630
 Since the hydroxyl group polarity, 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.798
 We know that oxygen has an electrically negative much greater hydrogen, 

00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:52.197
 Thus it will have a partial negative charge 

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:54.590
 This hydrogen will have a positive molecular charge 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.528
 Which will allow for this side chain 

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.320
 To be more attractive with water, so it is possible to be oriented outward 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.190
 To become in contact with the water solution. 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.820
 Or can form hydrogen bonds 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.520
 With other side chains. 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.130
 So, let's say we have side strings like this. 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.041
 And again, I do not draw it by the right standards. 

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:18.110
 The size of these side chains is larger than reality. 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.019
 But we can have another side chain, 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.060
 I will draw it this way, 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.760
 We have another side chain that contains 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.490
 At some point, you know, on many things 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.000
 I will draw some points here. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.120
 This series contains many things, among them 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.000
 Oxygen associated with hydrogen. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.590
 Linked to hydrogen. 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.350
 There may be some hydrogen bonds 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.250
 In this way, that will also help 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.630
 Install the structure. 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.405
 It is possible that we have cases 

00:04:52.405 --> 00:04:55.700
 Side chains (ionic), Loaded side chains 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.850
 You may have this sidebar here, for example, 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.950
 Positive shipment. 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.528
 And the structure of polypeptide 

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:08.030
 I will be adding such a fancy 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.134
 It is possible that we have another side chain 

00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:12.371
 Another side chain has 

00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:15.420
 Total negative charge, therefore 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.290
 These two chains will be attracted to each other, 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.420
 And we will have a charismatic association (Ionian). 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.231
 It is also possible to have covalent bonds between the side chains 

00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:29.160
 This, for example, is a traditional covalent bond 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.750
 It can be formed between two side chains of cystine, 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.780
 Both contain sulfur. 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.320
 When they leave 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.990
 Each one of them 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.960
 We are talking about cysteine, consisting of nitrogen 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.390
 Carbon alpha, and carbonyl carbon 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.360
 I'm trying to draw the cystine part 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.400
 So, when this sulfur is not in any binary bond 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.390
 With another sulfur it will form 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.000
 Covalent bond with hydrogen. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.460
 However, when appropriate conditions exist, 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.100
 Will form a covalent association with another sulfur. 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.350
 In this case, this sulfur is in a side chain of another cysteine 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.260
 Here, this line between them 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.060
 Is a double-sulfur bond 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.260
 Or what may also be known as a two-sulfur bridge. 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.800
 If we can imagine, for example 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.490
 Systeine ​​acid, this part of the infrastructure 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.150
 This is cysteine, this is systeine 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.360
 We can imagine that their two lateral chains can form 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.100
 This two-sulfur link, which creates 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.270
 A kind of networking between 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.593
 This part of polypeptide. 

00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:32.800
 I hope that gives you some kind of appreciation 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.500
 For all the interactions that you can get 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.740
 To give the protein a particular structure. 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.600
 Last but not least, of course, 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.800
 We have a quaternary structure, which is 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.596
 How do we combine polypeptide chains together? 

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:48.230
 And all this series of videos, 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.250
 Are just to give you some kind of appreciation, 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.630
 For various forms and possible interactions, 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.890
 For protein 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.620
 Even if we know his peptide series, 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.260
 This is what distinguishes proteins in their complexity 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.890
 Beauty, and abilities to do 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.590
 In all these functions: stimulating reactions (enzymes) 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.200
 Signaling (hormones) and strengthening cytoskeleton 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.220
 And help transport oxygen as it is 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.480
 With hemoglobin protein. 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.291
 This is a broad area of ​​research. 

00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:16.030
 Even if we know the peptide series of protein, what is its shape? 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.660
 On this basis, 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.300
 How can we use it to think? 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.190
 How to manipulate this protein in different ways 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.660
 Or even other questions 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.260
 It's really an attractive field of research!
