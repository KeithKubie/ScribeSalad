00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.700
Eh, listen, in high school we used to choke each other out. That's like a thing.

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.650
Peter, go ahead. Jump me off on air. No, no, no, no, no. Please don't. Please.

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.950
I'm not scared. Let's do it. No, no, no. Eddie don't. Please don't choke them.

4
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:17.790
Unconscious. Do it now. Please try. Let's go. You know what?

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.510
Touch not be pussies. Choke me out. You know what?

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.170
Let me tell you a story. Back when I used to work at the Strip club,

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.950
you only takes like 20 seconds back when that was a blue belt.

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.630
1995 I worked at the Strip club in, in um,

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.510
there was this girl I was dating. She was a bartender.

10
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:39.670
She was seriously four foot 10.

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.340
And why are the bartenders and waitresses always the special?

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.950
You can strip clubs, let them, I will. She was,

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.680
she was 92 pounds bartender,

14
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.900
the smallest girl spinner and I showed her how to do a rear naked choke.

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.540
She was tiny. Her name was Kimmy.

16
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.020
And the Strip club manager was your size big like used to be buffed butt fat

17
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:04.850
ass. Yeah, but used to be buck.

18
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.080
You can tell you used to be buff football player type, big manager.

19
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.580
And he didn't believe in Jujitsu at all. And he said,

20
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.570
if she choked me out with one of them Jujitsu moves,

21
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.300
I'll give her the keys to my corvette.

22
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.380
So she had to literally get on a Barstow and had to go around them and she went

23
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:25.390
like this, Eh, and he was just like this.

24
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.800
And then he went out, lights out.

25
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.680
So he hit the ground and then he pops back up

26
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.610
and he didn't know what the fuck happened. I was just sitting there going,

27
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:40.090
don't you [inaudible] I thought he faked it.

28
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.640
People usually don't hit the ground and pop back up.

29
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.460
Usually they hit the ground, they're done and they need an ambulance.

30
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.060
But he popped right back up and he's like, what happened? Like bitch,

31
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:53.440
you need to give her your core val pop right back up. It was a gold corvette.

32
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.530
Oh, this was a thing I didn't know about this about in seventh grade.

33
00:01:56.531 --> 00:01:59.410
During lunch, some of the kids would choke each other out.

34
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:00.700
You put your hands up on their neck,

35
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.870
but then it'd be like the cheerleaders wanting to be choked out and they would

36
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.750
show us out. If all you did about three times you go to school.
