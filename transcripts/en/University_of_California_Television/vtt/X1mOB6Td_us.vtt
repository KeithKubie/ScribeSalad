Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670

still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled

We shape the future from our shared

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.280
- [Philip] We've heard a lot at this point
about the evolution of hominids in Africa.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.570
It's a complicated history for sure. Let
me at this point just cut to the chase and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.270
say that humans moved out of Africa
probably just after 2 million years ago

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.650
and it will be that part of the record
that I want to emphasize this afternoon.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.180
The site of Dmanisi in the Georgian
Caucasus is very important, records the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.550
oldest known, at this point, the oldest
known occupations of Eurasia beginning

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.990
before 1.85 million years ago. We don't
actually have human remains that are that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.910
old, but certainly there are stone tools
approaching that date. The good part about

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.110
Dmanisi is that in fact we have not just
scraps of headlamp and bumper and so

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.370
forth, but virtually whole skeletons and a
number of them. Now we have five skulls in

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.840
various states of repair or disrepair.
Along with them, there are post cranial

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.270
bones associated with one juvenile
individual particularly perhaps but not

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.720
clearly associated with one of the adults.
Also the material is extremely

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.460
well-preserved. We're very fortunate in
that respect. Along with the humans, of

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.410
course there are animal bones and many,
many of them and there is a very complete

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.100
lithic record to go along with this
material which is well-preserved, as I

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:49.830
say, in a very carefully studied
stratigraphic context. Several of the

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.140
specimens from Dmanisi have been in the
past likened to African Homo erectus but

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.560
the skeletons are quite primitive. One of
them in particular is strikingly so, Skull

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.860
5 which I will talk about. At the moment,
I think it's fair to say that the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.700
taxidermic identity and the
paleobiological significance of the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.010
Dmanisi materials remain controversial.
Certainly there have been plenty of

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.900
suggestions and I'm afraid I've been
responsible for some of them but we'll see

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:34.120
where things go. Dmanisi is situated in
Georgia. Georgia is stuck there between

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.640
the Black Sea and the Caspian with
Azerbaijan off to the east. From Tbilisi,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.960
the capital, it's about an hour and a
half, an hour and 45 minutes ride. Roads

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.760
are pretty good these days. Roads were
terrible 15 years ago. Things have

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.970
improved. Down to the site, Dmanisi is
just a few kilometers from the Armenian

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:09.000
border. This is the obligatory excavations
in progress slide. There are about four

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.670
meters of sedimentary deposits at Dmanisi.
Much of this stuff is volcanic in origin,

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.310
it's very ashy. There are some other
sediments and silts, but ash is always a

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:29.440
primary component which is a good thing.
The stratigraphy is complex, all of the

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.390
sediments are piled atop the Mashavera
basalt which is about 1.85 million years

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.980
old, that's the bottom of the site, the
earliest record, 1.85 million years is the

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.820
date obtained from radiometric
methodology. It is secure. The

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.030
stratigraphy at the site is complex
partially because there are a number of

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.240
piping features. Water was present near
the site during periods of heavy rain and

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.440
so on. Pipes formed underground and then
progressed through breaching to collapse

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.350
towards the surface filled with sediments
then got buried again. So it's been a

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.530
mess, it's been very hard to sort it out.
Our geologist, Reid Ferring, has done a

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:30.660
huge amount of work in this respect, huge
in the Trumpian sense. But there have been

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:41.350
problems. The first traces of human
material were found at Dmanisi in 1991.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.160
Excavations in fact have been underway at
the site for quite a period of time before

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.690
that. The site is underneath an old
medieval town that was on the Silk Road.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.670
The archeologists were busy at Dmanisi for
some time poking around the foundations of

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.020
the old buildings and eventually they
began to dig up stuff that didn't seem to

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:11.520
belong there, not just the goats and fish
bones from medieval suppers, but things

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.920
that looked quite antique indeed. The
paleontologists came in and ascertain that

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:27.650
yes, the material was ancient, deeper
excavations got underway and in 1991, the

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:35.600
folks at Dmanisis were rewarded with this
jaw, the D211 mandible. It's remarkably

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.470
complete, not all of it is there. But what
there is remarkably well-preserved. It's a

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:48.970
small jaw and in a number of respects, it
does look like Homo erectus. You've seen

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:55.930
one reference to this specimen already.
The teeth are about right for Homo erectus

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:02.340
as are the proportions of the mandible
itself. The cranium which turns out to be

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:10.990
the match to the little mandible was found
later in 1999, D2282 is a small cranium,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:20.060
very small capacity, surprisingly so for
Homo erectus. Only a bit more than 650 CCs

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:27.770
in this case. Despite the small brain, the
thing does share a number of

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:37.810
characteristics with particularly early
African erectus. This hulk turned up at

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:46.260
the site in 2005. It's way down at the
bottom of the site and within a few days

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.250
after the fossil had been uncovered and
cleaning was underway prior to trying to

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:57.230
lift it out, there was a very heavy rain.
Things were very nearly washed out. Of

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.650
course we have a cover over the site,
there is protection, but it rained so much

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:07.190
and so long that water began to trickle in
around the sides of the excavations and

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:14.100
things were dicey for a while.
Fortunately, D4500 survived. There it is

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:23.980
all cleaned up. It turns out that the
cranium found in 2005 is a perfect match,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.790
once again, to a mandible, D2600, which
had been found earlier in the year 2000.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:38.930
The upper and the lower, the cranium and
the mandible simply clicked together once

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.650
the stuff have been cleaned off, there was
no doubt at all. There is some pathology

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:48.200
on the mandible that matches, comparable
pathology in the region of the ear of the

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:57.080
cranium so there is no doubt about the
match. More than other Dmanisi hominins,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:05.740
Skull 5, as this one is known, exhibits
very robust morphology. It's pretty

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:12.580
clearly a male individual. Determining sex
in the case of these fossil hominins is

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:19.200
often tricky, often can't be done very
accurately. But in this case, we think we

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:28.290
have a match, the skull says male all
over. Such a pattern given the fact that

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:37.230
it has the smallest brain of all the
Dmanisi hominins because it is unexpected.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:44.700
Normally for other primates, humans too of
course, but for primates, higher primates

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:50.390
generally, males tend to exceed the
females in brain size by something like 8

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:59.160
to 10 to 15%. So, having the tiniest brain
attached to the most robust cranium and

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:10.880
jaw is a bit surprising. You can see that
there is a good deal of variation within

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.770
the Dmanisi assemblage. The little jaw
goes with a smallish brain case which is

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:26.680
quite gracile in its construction. We peg
that one Skull 2 as likely a female. Skull

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:33.460
5, on the other hand is much more robust,
clearly distinctive in a number of

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:43.030
respects. Number 1 is like Homo erectus,
number 4 is a small individual. That one

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:48.530
seems to have lived to a ripe old age
since it had lost almost its entire

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:54.240
dentition, maybe one tooth was still in
place at the time the individual died.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.320
That one may or may not be male, we're not
sure. Anyway, there is a great deal of

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:07.840
diversity at Dmanisi. The crania do look
different. This raises the question of

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.810
"How many species might be documented at
the site?" This is a question that's been

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:21.360
plaguing us for some time. I think myself
on the basis of the shared anatomy among

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.700
the Dmanisi individuals, they have a
common bow plan extending not just to the

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.270
cranial vault but to the face insofar as
we have it represented. And also to the

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:41.870
details of the cranial base suggest, the
common bow plan suggests that all of the

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:48.700
individuals are drawn from just one group.
We've done extensive resampling analysis

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:54.220
as well which cause us to come to the same
conclusion that really, in fact, the

00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:00.000
skulls, the post-cranial remains that go
with them, are drawn from just one

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.900
population. Now there is stratigraphic
evidence relating to this question. It

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:11.160
doesn't solve the question of course, but
it's important information. It's good to

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:19.450
know that the material was all washed into
these deposits or arrived in the site by

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:25.550
one means or another at about the same
time that is the duration here can't be

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:31.250
more than a few hundred or perhaps a
thousand years or so according to the best

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:38.600
analyses conducted by the geological side
of the team. We'll say, then, that it's

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:44.500
very likely that the Dmanisi assemblage
samples a population belonging to a single

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.180
species. I know there may be objections to
this. I'm sure there will be, there have

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:57.790
been in the past. If it's true, then such
a situation is quite rare. Of course, at

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.700
most localities where hominins are
discovered, you've heard a lot about East

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:11.580
Africa at this point, Koobi Fora, Olduvai.
Also at Sangiran in Java where there are a

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:17.000
number of fossils. The material is
scattered through a very long sequence of

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.840
deposits covering a long period in time.
Time as a contributor variation just

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:34.430
cannot be discounted. If the Dmanisi
fossils document what we can call a

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:40.620
population in the past extending over
quite a number of years of course, then

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:45.660
the next question, the next important
question is how the Dmanisi sample may

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:53.230
relate to the hominin taxa that have
previously been recognized. Skill 5 of

00:14:53.230 --> 00:15:02.010
course has a very small brain case, a very
large projecting face in the vault. Also

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:07.140
in the basal cranium, there are some
resemblances, not a lot, but some

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:14.920
resemblances to Homo erectus. Skull 3
which I have not shown you a picture of

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:21.550
before is the sub-adult from Dmanisi.
Skull 3 is pictured here down below. Skull

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:28.070
3 is similar to Homo habilis. This is true
for the bow ridge, the extended brow ridge

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.430
development. It's true particularly for
the shape of the vault, the rounding at

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:41.440
the back and for the mid-facial profile.
Skull 3, I must point out, is sub-adult so

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.040
we must allow for some extra growth to
have occurred if the individual had grown

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:52.700
up. It might have looked, had it grown up,
a bit more robust and a bit like the skull

00:15:52.700 --> 00:16:02.820
to the left there, Homo habilis KNM-ER
1813. Skulls 2 and 4 also have their

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:08.380
peculiar aspects, of course. They have a
number of primitive characters that they

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:19.530
also share some features with Homo
habilis. So, which species? There is, as

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:28.040
I've pointed out, much variation within
the Dmanisi paleodeme. This is not an easy

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:35.350
question, the question as to which species
may be represented. Skull 5, the very

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:41.610
small brained and very robust and very
primitive looking individual does indeed

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.670
share some characters with
Australopithecus as well as Homo. So

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:53.460
perhaps in this case, the line, the
division between Australopithecus on the

00:16:53.460 --> 00:17:01.650
one hand and earlier Homo on the other is
not so clear cut after all. Many of these

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.770
shared similarities are primitive
characters and unfortunately they don't

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:11.790
help us much in answering key questions
about phylogenetic affinities. Other

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:19.770
characters expressed in the Dmanisi
materials are Homo erectus-like and pretty

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:24.090
clearly they are specialized characters,
characters that have changed during the

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:30.950
course of evolution, characters that are
said to be derived. These characters

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:36.460
include the form of the brow ridge for
example which is larger and bar-like, a

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:43.240
little bit of midline, keeling on the
vault, details of temporal bone

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.670
construction, things of that sort on the
underside of the vault. Indeed, when

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:54.840
Skulls 1 and 2 were first described back
in the year 2000, they were grouped with

00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:03.860
early Homo erectus from the Turkana basin.
If the fossils are included with Homo

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.730
erectus, clearly that's one way to deal
with the material is simply to lump it

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:15.850
with Homo erectus. If that is the course
we take, then it must be recognized that

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:22.980
the boundaries between Homo erectus on the
one hand and other early Homo taxa will

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:30.310
become less distinct. It will be
particularly difficult to distinguish

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:37.590
early Homo erectus, African Homo erectus
from specimens attributed to earlier Homo

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:45.680
to Homo habilis in particular. Homo
habilis is considered apart from Homo

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:54.800
rudolfensis. So, to sum up at this point,
here is again a speciose view of Hominin

00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:02.680
phylogeny done by Bernard Wood with Meave
Leakey several years ago. You can read the

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:10.540
caution sign. To sum up then, there is
apparently no simple answer to the

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:17.300
question as to which species may be
represented at our site. Indeed this

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.770
question is often a tricky one. It's been
a hard one for paleoanthropologists to

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:32.370
deal with for a long time. In one view,
this view expressed on the slide, Dr. Wood

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:39.350
showed you another version of this very
spaciose hominin phylogeny. In that view

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:45.880
hominin evolution has produced a veritable
flowering of lineages over more than 6

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:53.470
million years. Such bushiness, as it were,
is particular evident for the 2.5 to 1

00:19:53.470 --> 00:20:00.700
million year ago interval. This interval
in which Paranthropus on the one hand,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:11.310
Australopithecus and Homo are represented
by multiple species for each group. At

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:17.690
Dmanisi the fossils seem clearly to be
Homo. Now there are some points of overlap

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.610
with Australopithecus as I pointed out,
but I would say unbalanced the evidence

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:28.130
favors grouping all of our fossils with
the genus Homo, very little doubt about

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:35.870
that. At the same time, the assemblage at
Dmanisi does not fall neatly into one of

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:44.230
the taxonomic packages that have been
proposed: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:51.730
Homo ergaster, Homo erectus and so on. If
I were pressed and I do feel pressed at

00:20:51.730 --> 00:21:00.220
this point, given the morphological
resemblances of Dmanisi to both Homo

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:08.290
habilis in a very strict sense, just those
fossils allocated to Homo habilis, not to

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:15.160
Homo rudolfensis. Given the resemblances
of our material to Homo habilis, and to

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:22.420
early Homo erectus, particularly African
Homo erectus, I would probably argue, I

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:29.450
will argue, that it is most reasonable to
place all of these fossils within a single

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:38.060
evolutionary species. I would say that the
Dmanisi fossils constitute just one

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:46.700
population within this unbranched lineage.
Now, this is not to raise the specter of

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:52.490
just one species at a time, or to suggest
that there isn't a great deal of diversity

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:57.590
in the hominin record, clearly there was
particularly in that interval after, about

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:05.960
2.5 million years. But as far as our
evidence is concerned, it seems to me the

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:12.210
best way to go, simply to place all the
fossils within one evolutionary species.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.310
Then of course we'd have to argue about
what to call it, but this is not the place

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:21.126
for that. So, with that, thanks for
listening. Thanks very much.
