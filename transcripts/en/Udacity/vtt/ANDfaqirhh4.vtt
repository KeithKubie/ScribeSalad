00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Obviously, there is an equilibrium at 0--f stays 0 once it becomes 0.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is not nothing but an equilibrium and there's two more--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
one is at 0.55 million tons and the other is at 1.45 million tons.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The first one is obvious, but now let's look into where these two other equilibria come from.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If we reach an equilibrium, the amount has to become constant.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The rate of change becomes zero, which means that the gain

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
per time has to balance the loss per time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The loss per time is constant but the gain per time depends on the current amount.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's build this type of diagram to show how the gain depends on the amount.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If you look closely, you see that this has to be a parabola.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If the amount of fish is zero, we are multiplying by zero here and the gain will be zero.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That's no surprise. If there is no fish, there is no growth. We know this point.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When the amount of fish is equal to the maximum carrying capacity, this factor becomes zero.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The product is zero again so we know this point.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
As a parabola is symmetric, the maximum has to occur in the middle between the zeros.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This maximum sits at an amount of 1 * 10⁶ tons.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We can plug this value 1 million tons into this expression

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and get that the gain here is 2.5 * 10⁵ tons per year, which is a little more than the loss,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which is 2 * 10⁵ tons per year.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We have one equilibrium here and one equilibrium there.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
At both of these points the gain and the loss, the gain and the loss balance each other.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If you want to, you can solve this quadratic equation

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to find that this equilibrium sits at 0.55 * 1 million tons

00:02:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and this equilibrium sits at 1.45 * 1 million tons.
