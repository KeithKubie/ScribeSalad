00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] The following graph

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.220
shows a proportional relationship.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.110
What is the constant of proportionality

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.730
between y and x in the graph?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.750
Pause this video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.210
All right, now let's do this together,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.500
and let's remind ourselves

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.630
what a constant of
proportionality even is.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.150
If we know that there is a
proportional relationship

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.600
between y and x, then
there will be a constant

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.950
of proportionality
between these variables,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.270
and what this is, is it is a number

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.860
that I would have to
multiply x by to get to y.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.600
So I could make a little table here,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.080
as we often do when we describe
proportional relationships,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.470
x and y.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.053
We know that when x is zero, y is zero.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.660
But if I multiply zero by
anything, I'm gonna get zero.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.950
But then when x is one, what is y?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.980
When x is one, y is three.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.940
They mark it right over there.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.570
When x is two, what is y?

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.070
X is two,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.470
we see that y is six.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.480
So our constant of proportionality is

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.283
what are we multiplying x by to get to y?

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.900
Well, let's see, to go from one to three,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.860
I have to multiply by three.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.540
To go from two to six, I
have to multiply by three.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.140
Another way to think about it is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.150
we could write the equation y is equal to

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.190
something times x.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.530
The number that we multiply x by to get y

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.340
is our constant of proportionality.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.730
And we've seen, in all
of these situations,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.360
this should be true for
any point on this line.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.660
You give the x, you multiply
it by three, you get your y.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.620
So the relationship here
is y is equal to three x.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.863
So three is our constant
of proportionality.
