00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:02.460
Now this quiz is an open-ended quiz. And in

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.272
this, I am giving you the same example, the

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.780
my fun example of me purchasing a trip to

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.100
got to India for the Christmas holidays. And, so I

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.866
am showing you all the communication events. The communication

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.051
events are shown by these lines here, A to

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.271
B, C to D, and so on. And this

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.090
is a textual ordering of events. In, that same process.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.470
So these are eventually the same process. And the question

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.285
that I'm going to ask you, like I said, it's an

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.940
open-ended question. I want you to identify all the events,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.198
that are connected by, the happened-before relationship. I told you that

00:00:38.198 --> 00:00:41.339
this is the notation that I'm using for happened-before relationship.

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.566
So I want you identify all the events. And I'm showing

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.750
you a whole bunch of events starting from A working

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.123
your way through to L. So all these events. And what

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:52.469
I want you to do is identify all the events

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.486
that are connected by this happened before the relationship. You can

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:59.666
choose to connect both events that are directly connected that

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.106
happened before, as well as

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:04.769
transitively connected what happened before relationship.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.520
And in the second box, I want you to identify

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.037
all the events. That are concurrent events in the system. So

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:12.333
there's a whole bunch of events here, and I want

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.447
you to identify the events that you think are concurrent events.

00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:18.333
Meaning there is no way for, for us to assert

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.930
that there is any ordering of the events in the system.
