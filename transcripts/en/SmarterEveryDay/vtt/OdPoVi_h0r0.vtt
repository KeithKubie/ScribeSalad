00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.580
- Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.170
Smarter Every Day this is a really big day

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.100
because I live in a hometown where

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.480
there's a gigantic rocket plant

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.810
owned by United Launch Alliance.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.050
They make a vehicle called the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.329
Delta IV Heavy right over there.

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.730
It's about to throw the fastest

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.540
man made object in the history

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.260
of all the objects, into space to go

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.093
touch the sun.

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:21.920
Which is difficult, because it's harder

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.230
to go to the sun then it is to go

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.063
to Pluto.

00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:26.590
You gotta be screamin', you gotta go fast.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.440
It has to do with Delta
Vs and stuff like that,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.370
trust me it's hard.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.297
But they can do it, because
it's a really big rocket

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.540
and it's a really little probe

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.190
called the Parker Solar Probe.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.490
I got an email inviting me to

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.450
the actual pad just before roll back.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.830
And if you don't know what that is

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.663
it's a big deal.

00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:42.800
Especially since the CEO
of United Launch Alliance

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.240
is gonna be on that tower with us.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.670
I'm excited and I'm gonna
try to be very professional

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.503
when we do it.

00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:50.110
But I'm stinkin' excited.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.943
Let's go.

00:00:50.943 --> 00:00:54.540
(fun funky music)

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.550
how you doing Sir.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.383
- Good to meet ya.

00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:57.216
- Ya you as well.

00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:58.500
Thanks for inviting me to your shot here.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.740
- Oh, we're happy to have you.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.707
- That's pretty cool.

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:01.886
- I love your channel.

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:02.719
- Thank you very much.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.604
- I am a subscriber.

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:05.420
- I like your hard hat there.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.404
Is that actually a hard hat.

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:07.436
- It is a hard hat.

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:08.269
(laughter)

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:09.645
- That's pretty good.

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:11.780
So you're actually gonna let us go up

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.910
with you on roll back.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.743
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:15.510
- It's a big-- that's a treat.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.880
- It is, we're gonna
ride a 10 million pound

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.250
building 30 stories high while it

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.900
heads to the other end of that pad.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.733
- Really?

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.680
What's the speed of that thing?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.513
It's gotta be pretty slow.

00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:28.860
- Well it's you know, it's a blistering

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.520
third of a mile per hour.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.840
- [Destin] You studied at Cal Poly right?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.673
- I did yeah.

00:01:32.673 --> 00:01:33.860
- [Destin] So aerospace engineering.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.693
- Mechanical

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:35.526
- [Destin] Mechanical.

00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:36.764
That's my undergrad too.

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:37.880
There we go.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.750
Three segments, the way I understand

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.488
the two on the side,
they're 100% the whole time.

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:43.321
- Yes.

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.804
- [Destin] But the one in the center core

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.560
you throttle that back.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.393
- Right.

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:48.300
- [Destin] And that's
just to conserve fuel

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.570
so you can have a better
performance, right.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.310
- We're gonna empty the
ones on the outside first,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.750
then we're gonna shed those and then

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.960
without that weight,
with that weight gone,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.920
we go to full throttle on the center core.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.236
And in a very short amount of burn

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:03.940
we'll almost double the velocity.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.600
- [Destin] Okay so you get through Max Q

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.289
with all three, all three cores.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.110
Is that the correct terminology?

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.943
The cores.

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:11.660
- Yeah, we call 'em cores or common cores.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.493
- [Destin] Okay.

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:13.510
- So you can think of kind of like

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.960
Kerbal Space here.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.270
So we're just bolting
three rockets together.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.370
- [Destin] Once you ramp it back up

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.470
you have a better Propellant Mass Fraction

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.700
with what's left of---

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.550
- Exactly.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.590
- [Destin] Right, okay,
that makes perfect sense.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.740
- So on all of our rockets we us Cryo

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.760
on the upper.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.790
Delta has Cryo on the lower and of course

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.053
Atlas uses Kerosine.

00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:31.886
- [Destin] It's my understanding

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:33.214
you have a kicker stage at the end there

00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:34.670
that's solid right?

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.840
Now that's abnormal.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.380
- That is, that's very unusual.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.370
And that's because Parker Solar Probe

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.330
has to have so much energy and make

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.610
so much velocity to get to the sun.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.690
Because of course as you know

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.270
you and I we're in orbit right now

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.250
around the sun, 67,000 miles an hour,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.620
you got to take that energy out

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.090
to get any closer.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.670
It's actually really hard to go in.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.370
Much easier to go out.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.610
Roll the rocket out
here, so all three cores

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.970
came out in a giant truck, flipped it up

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.770
vertical into that building then we

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.090
finished it.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.300
And then when we're ready the building

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.980
rolls away.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.350
- Man, yeah, I'm able to comprehend

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.750
less and less about what you're saying

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.682
as we walk closer.

00:03:14.682 --> 00:03:16.932
(laughter)

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.687
for you this is old hat.

00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:22.390
But I mean, imagine studying this stuff

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.100
in school and like actually seeing it

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.699
for the first time.

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:28.847
It's pretty rad.

00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:30.431
- I'll let you in on a secret.

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:31.264
- What's that?

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.890
- I'm coming up on my 400th launch

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.753
and it feels the same every time.

00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:35.710
- [Destin] Does it really.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.720
Ignition starts, you start thrust

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.256
- Then we release and then now the rocket

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.500
is under Thrust Vector Control

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.550
to keep it oriented in the right way.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.200
- [Destin] Right, and I've gotta imagine

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.413
that TVC is way easier with a Heavy.

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.740
Because you have a larger moment arm

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.573
from the center.

00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:53.970
- That's right, that's right.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.851
- [Destin] Okay, awesome.

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.684
- Yeah, very good.

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:56.990
- We've got everybody in position

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.360
for the tower roll.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.550
So when guys go up there very important

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.650
that you don't distract or talk

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.200
or disrupt the guys are gonna

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.660
be on a headset.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.610
So they're gonna be focused on the job,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.030
so just do that.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.330
And the last thing, you guys are gonna

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.400
be up on level 6 for your briefing.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.906
Be careful up there and stay safe.

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:15.437
- [Destin] Yes Sir, thank you very much.

00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:16.270
- Alright, thank you.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.450
- [Destin] So these clamps
open up pneumatically

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.949
and then the whole thing pushes back.

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:21.782
- You got it.

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:22.615
- [Destin] And we're gonna be up there

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:23.448
when it happens.

00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:24.281
- Yes we are, we're gonna ride it.

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.223
- [Destin] That's awesome, let's do it.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.191
(steam hissing)

00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:32.950
(clunking shoes hitting metal)

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.783
- [Destin] Wow.

00:04:33.783 --> 00:04:34.905
(high pitched humming)

00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:35.738
(equipment noise drowns out speaker)

00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:36.711
- We're good.

00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:38.121
- Good to see you.

00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:41.371
(high pitched humming)

00:04:42.237 --> 00:04:43.576
- We're gonna walk down here so we don't

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:45.060
distract these guys.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.893
- [Destin] 'Cause they're in the middle

00:04:45.893 --> 00:04:46.726
of an operation.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.360
- Alright so here you are.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.650
This is the top of one
of those side cores.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.559
- [Destin] Right.

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.560
- And you can see here,
here's the center core

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.250
so the second stage is gonna be basically

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.980
inside there.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.570
And then up she goes.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.460
- Wow.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.650
So, you're saying you have to point

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.430
with Cryo and you point the solid.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.940
- And we're gonna point the solid

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.370
so when the Cryo burns out,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.700
we're gonna light the solid.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.460
- Because you don't have
Thrust Vector Control

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.640
on the solid.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.530
- This one does.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.459
- Oh, how does that work.

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:21.292
- So it has a vectorable nozzle,

00:05:21.292 --> 00:05:22.970
so it has it's own actuators that

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.150
can point the nozzle.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.770
When that's burned out whatever about

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.400
44 or 45 minutes from lift off,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.300
that's it, we separate the spacecraft

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.570
and it will arrive in its first Perihelion

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.090
out in November.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.800
And then it will be seven years

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.823
of doing that loop.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.370
So 24 passes on the sun and about

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.540
every third pass it's
gonna get close enough

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.470
to Venus to affect it's trajectory

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.180
and pull it in closer
and closer and closer.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.106
- You really, you really live and breathe

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:54.820
this stuff don't you.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.682
- That's what we do.

00:05:55.682 --> 00:05:57.400
- No, you do.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.450
- Oh yeah, sure.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.319
I love rockets.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.820
I've been doing rockets my whole life.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.980
- Really, that's awesome.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.810
What was your first rocket launch.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.120
- First professional launch or

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.190
my first launch.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.552
- First launch.

00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:08.430
- Okay, I was---

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.740
- [Destin] That counts the same to me.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.340
- Alright, I was nine years old.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.810
And I'm old enough to have
seen the moon landing.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.940
So I was pretty stoked by that.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.900
And so I'm out in the back
of my grandmothers barn

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.900
and I find a case of 80
year old moldy dynamite.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.250
And I figured there's only
one thing to do with that

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.320
you know so I'm gonna
build rockets out of it.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.153
- [Destin] Wow.

00:06:31.153 --> 00:06:31.986
- So I took the sticks you know,

00:06:31.986 --> 00:06:33.420
I cut them open with my pen knife,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.020
I made my own rockets,
and I'm proud to tell you

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.840
that even at nine years
old, some of my rockets

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.570
made it partly into the sky before

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.756
they detonated.

00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:43.589
(laughter)

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:44.527
- [Destin] That's fantastic.

00:06:44.527 --> 00:06:45.360
- And I got all 10 fingers.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.380
- [Destin] Now that's the true measure

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.250
right there.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.410
So I spoke of the scientists involved

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.930
and they told me about Andy here.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.940
Do you know the backstory there.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.580
- So Andy's pretty special to this mission

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.430
because it's so hard to get to the sun

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.430
and do a mission like this.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.010
The original designs
for this type of probe

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.050
are just impractical.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.590
And this gentlemen Andy he came up

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.350
with the innovative approach,

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.530
the trajectory that we're gonna use,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.300
that really made this mission possible.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.050
Without him we would not be standing

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.820
here today talking about this.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.990
- So we just started roll back right.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.120
- Yes.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.224
- [Destin] So I can see
that we're physically moving

00:07:23.224 --> 00:07:24.990
away from that.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.490
It's very slow.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.460
How many tons are moving right now?

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.459
- This building weighs 10 million pounds.

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:31.940
- [Destin] Okay, wow.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.740
- We're gonna move it about 300 feet.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.670
- Really.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.750
Okay, and so is it gonna
go at this velocity

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.730
the whole time.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.063
- It's actually gonna
speed up a little bit

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:41.210
in a few minutes.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.043
- [Destin] Really.

00:07:42.043 --> 00:07:44.140
- But it's not exactly blistering speed

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.190
as you can imagine.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.400
It's a gentle trip.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.040
It'll take us about 45 minutes

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.142
to make that 300 foot journey.

00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:52.140
- [Destin] What kinds of things

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.860
are you looking at right now.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.890
Like, you kind of just understand

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.980
this rocket at this point right.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.630
- Yes, okay so of course we have

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.840
the big center core and the reason

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.240
you see the Orbital ATK emblem on there

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.570
is because Northrop
Grumman was Orbital ATK

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.170
fabricated that extra third kick station

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.260
we don't normally use
that Parker Solar Probe

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.590
needs for that extra umph of velocity.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.460
You're seeing these big
horizontal struts here

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.660
those are carrying the loads from

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.890
these side cores mechanically and

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.216
transmitting that into the center core.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.231
- [Destin] Is there a
dampener there as well.

00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:32.440
- No, no, this is really a rigid

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.564
structural frame that we're looking at.

00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:36.730
And that's actually the cleanest way

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.670
we can do that dynamically and be able

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.200
to steer and control the rocket.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.190
And each of these cores at full power,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.940
their throttlable but at full power

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.878
they have the same
engine, same propellants

00:08:47.878 --> 00:08:50.070
and they can put out the same level

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.940
of thrust.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.660
Together about 2.2 million pounds

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.950
or something a little
over 700,000 pounds each.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.519
- I'm having an optical
illusion right now.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:01.360
I feel like the rocket's moving away

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.193
from us.

00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:03.026
(laughter)

00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:03.859
I really do.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.597
(mellow guitar music)

00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:34.260
- [Destin] Can you see
that gap right there,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.760
so they've got inches
of clearance over there.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.670
So I'm gonna level with you.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.910
That's a really, really cool rocket okay.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.990
And it's gonna touch the sun,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.100
it's gonna be the fastest man made

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.300
object ever in the
history of objects right.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.280
But what's really, really cool to me is

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.110
Tory Bruno's wife is
also a rocket scientist

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.960
and as they back away, she comes

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.260
to the launchpad with him,
they're having a discussion

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.333
about how it works.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.520
Like I went and eavesdropped in there

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.150
and they're talking about
the different stages,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.050
how they work, why they're using solids

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.770
over Cryos in certain---

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.820
like this is a very technical discussion.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.570
And I really like that, like a lot.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.152
It's kind of a moment.

00:10:13.152 --> 00:10:13.985
- You caught us--

00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:15.140
- I caught you having a
rocket moment together.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.398
It was pretty good.

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:18.180
(laughter)

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.270
so I feel very honored to be where I'm at

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.750
right now.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.550
This is huge moment in the life

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.650
of many of these people.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.250
I mean it's a huge moment period

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.550
but like for some people this is decades.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.979
- Yes, yes well of course for us you know

00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:34.830
we love our rocket and we put a lot of

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.400
blood, sweat and tears in it.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.660
But the rocket is only
hear for the payload.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.990
And so when we're launching
a mission like this

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.040
Parker Solar Probe this
is someones life's work,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.232
and the people who
worked on that spacecraft

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:48.700
same kind of thing.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.730
It's the pentacle of their career.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.770
They've been at it for
at least a dozen years

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.960
many of 'em, so that's a
pretty big responsibility

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.786
and it weighs heavy on our guys.

00:10:58.786 --> 00:10:59.619
(beep)

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:00.460
- Okay I gotta text from Felipe

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.420
about two weeks after launch.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.348
That said the trajectory insertion

00:11:02.348 --> 00:11:04.850
of the Delta Force Heavy was so good

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.250
that the Parker Solar Probes first

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.490
trajectory correction maneuver

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.590
dropped to 10 meters per second.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.730
Which is astounding.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.990
That means they get to
save a bunch of fuel

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.650
and they just extended the life

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.496
of the mission because
ULA hit the bullseye

00:11:16.496 --> 00:11:18.740
and got the probe exactly where it

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.573
needed to be.

00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:20.406
That's a big deal.

00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:21.920
Because you only get one shot at that.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.580
And the other thing you
only get one shot at

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.290
is your privacy online.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.100
Which was a perfect segue
into the new sponsor NordVPN.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.350
Now listen, yes, I'm about to do an ad

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.330
but this is different because

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.560
I'm gonna tell you something that really

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.393
happened to me.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:36.320
I fell victim to identity theft.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.640
Apparently I was buying
thousands of dollars

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.110
of makeup and having it drop shipped

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.500
to a hotel in Florida.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.530
My credit card information was stolen

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.460
online probably when I was on some hotel

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.670
wifi or something like that.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.760
I've since changed my tactic to an

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.832
offensive defense if that makes any sense.

00:11:50.832 --> 00:11:53.210
I'm now using NordVPN.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.650
A virtual private network,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.290
it's a virtual tunnel where your computer

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.630
is encrypted and protected all the way

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.530
to the host that you're trying to contact.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.400
It's a really simple thing to use.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.412
And you can get it by going
to NordVPN.com/smarter

00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:08.300
or use the promo code smarter.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.500
Let's say somebody tells you your

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.475
contents been stolen
in a different country.

00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:13.741
Oh look at this, not
available in your country.

00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:16.642
Ha, NordVPN can do this, check this out.

00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:19.600
We're just gonna go virtually, tunnel up

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.603
through the internet and
end up right here in Germany

00:12:22.603 --> 00:12:24.280
and let's go back to the website

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.187
and let's refresh this thing

00:12:25.187 --> 00:12:26.860
and see what happens now.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.820
Oh look, what do you know.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.505
My stuff, except in a different language.

00:12:29.505 --> 00:12:32.660
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.310
I mean yeah that's a weird usage case

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.700
but imagine you living somewhere

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.260
and needing to pop up in a place

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.940
where Netflix is allowed but you can't

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.330
have it in your home country.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.586
You can use NordVPN and just pop up

00:12:44.586 --> 00:12:46.310
in a different place on the internet.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.730
Not only does this work on your laptop

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.300
you can even use it on your Apple device,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.680
your Android device whatever.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.580
Just download the app, pick from the map,

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.970
there's thousands of servers in over

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.110
60 different countries.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.760
This is super simple to use.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.593
Here's the upshot.

00:12:57.593 --> 00:12:58.720
NordVPN is legit.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.710
The only VPN rated with a perfect score

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:01.980
according to PC magazine.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.090
Based out of Panama, which
is an excellent thing

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.220
because they're not required to keep

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.220
your internet history there.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.690

That's less than 100 bucks for three years

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.830
of online internet data protection.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.000
I'm asking you to do this now,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.320
'cause that helps Smarter Every Day

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.944
and more importantly it protects you.

00:13:19.944 --> 00:13:21.500
It's a smart thing to do.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.360
I really like geeking out with rockets

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.290
and this was a really cool opportunity

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.123
to do that.

00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:28.490
Thanks to you ULA for making it happen.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.790
- [Destin] Tory, thank you.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.794
- Oh, you bet.

00:13:30.794 --> 00:13:31.650
- [Destin] I mean this is an opportunity

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.483
of a lifetime for me.

00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:33.361
Thank you very much.

00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:34.194
- It was my pleasure.

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:35.027
- [Destin] I really appreciate that.

00:13:35.027 --> 00:13:35.860
So we'll get out of your hair and

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.810
let you go shoot your rocket.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.060
If you want to see more of the interviews

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.429
I'll leave that over
on the second channel.

00:13:39.429 --> 00:13:41.460

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.537

getting Smarter Every Day.

00:13:46.113 --> 00:13:47.869
Have a good one, bye.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.110
(bells ringing)

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.543
You have a cool job man.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.243
- Yes I do.

00:13:52.243 --> 00:13:55.193
