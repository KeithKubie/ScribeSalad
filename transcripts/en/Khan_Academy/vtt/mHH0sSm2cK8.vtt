00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.260
- [Instructor] An
investigation was carried out

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.310
on four different plant species

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.460
to determine which of three species

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.170
was most closely related to
an unknown plant species.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.680
The results of the investigation

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.040
are shown in the data table below.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.080
Which plant species appears
to be most closely related

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.910
to the unknown species?

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.620
Support your answer.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.160
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.400
Alright, so here in
this data the first row

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.290
is for our unknown species.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.100
We know that it tests
positive for Enzyme M.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.030
This is blanked out because this says,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.670
how many differences in amino
acid sequences are there

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.980
between the species in that
row and the unknown species,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.970
and of course the unknown species

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.020
would have zero differences
'cause it is itself.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.480
And then this is the gel
electrophoresis banding pattern.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.580
So what we wanna do is look for

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.160
as many similarities as possible

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.920
to our unknown plant species.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.530
So first, if we looked at the enzyme,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.220
whether we test positive for it,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.430
species one does not test positive for it,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.960
species two and three do.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.050
So species one is not looking good.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.970
If we look at differences
in amino acid sequences,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.720
species one, once again,
has the most differences

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.810
in amino acid sequences,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.960
so that confirms our belief

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.680
that it might be the most different

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.470
from the unknown plant species.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.550
But then if we look between
plant species two and three,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.370
plant species two has fewer differences.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.270
So right now, plant species two

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.090
is looking like the leading candidate.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.400
Plant species three has more differences.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.233
And then when we look

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.860
at the gel electrophoresis
banding pattern,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.540
plant species two has
the exact same pattern

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.700
as our unknown plant,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.980
and it's the only one with
the exact same pattern.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.130
And so because of that,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.750
I'm feeling really good saying

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.960
that two is most closely
related to the unknown species.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.960
Two, because same banding pattern,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.900
and we could say, and least
different amino acid sequences,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.363
and tests positive for Enzyme M.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.880
Let's do another question like this.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.640
Scientists attempted to determine

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.260
the evolutionary relationships

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.000
between three different
finch species, A, B, and C.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.050
In order to do this,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.250
they examined the physical characteristics

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.730
and DNA of these species.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.800
DNA was extracted from all three species

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.240
and analyzed using gel electrophoresis.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.040
The results are shown in the diagram.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.963
And then they ask us,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.870
which statement best describes
the method used above

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.700
to determine the
evolutionary relationships

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.500
between three species of finches?

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.790
So the first choice is,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.530
examine the structure of
the beaks and compare them.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.170
Statement two, observe behavioral

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.760
and physical characteristics
of all the finches

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.720
and group them by similarities.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.570
C, obtain molecular evidence
from all three species

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.540
and identify similarities.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.660
Four, compare common ancestors
of all three of the species

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.980
and see if they are the same.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.113
So pause this video and
see which choice you like.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.740
Alright, well clearly they're
looking at molecular evidence.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.370
They're taking the DNA
of the different species,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.480
they're amplifying them,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.020
which means they're
making a bunch of copies

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.780
of certain sequences of that DNA,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.140
and then they're running a gel,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.140
which means they allow
those different segments

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.260
to separate on this gel.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.690
The smaller segments are
going to migrate down further,

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.740
the larger segments are
going to migrate less far.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.430
And the more similarities you have

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.830
on this gel electrophoresis
right over here,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.133
this banding pattern,

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:04.133
the more similar that DNA probably is.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.780
And so they're definitely
using molecular evidence,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.940
and three is the only one that talks

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.740
about molecular evidence,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.320
so I will go with choice three.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.310
They did say in the beginning

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.260
that they examined
physical characteristics

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.110
and DNA of these species,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.610
and so you could maybe say

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.460
examine the structure of
the beaks and compare them,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.470
but that's very specific,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.850
and it didn't say for sure
that they're doing that,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.060
that may be one of the
physical characteristics

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.060
that they're looking at,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.860
but we know for sure

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.720
that they're obtaining molecular evidence

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.240
from all three species,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.010
and they're identifying the similarities.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.180
So now, this next part, it says,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.220
based on the data they collected
using gel electrophoresis,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.550
label the branching tree diagram below,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.120
writing the letters A, B, and C

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.040
to represent the possible
evolutionary relationships

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.380
between species A, B, and C.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.260
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.573
and I'll show you the
banding pattern again.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.010
Alright, so down there,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.760
and actually I'll redraw it up here,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.330
they draw a tree that looks like this,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.910
and they want us to put A's, B's, and C's

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.530
in these blanks here.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.060
And one way to think about it is,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.730
these two are more closely related.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.950
They have a more recent common ancestor

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.250
than from this one over here.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.210
So if we look at the banding patterns,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.230
it's pretty clear we have
this similar band on A and B,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.980
we have this similar band on A and B,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.390
and they have this band
right over here in common,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.400
although C here has that one as well.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.870
The only other band that
A shares in common with C

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.470
is this one right over here,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.250
and B doesn't share anything
else in common with C.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.410
So it's pretty clear that A and B

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.880
share the most common banding patterns.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.100
So I would write that A and B

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.710
have the most recent common ancestor,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.903
and that C is more distant.
