00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.240
Let's say that I have some
object, and when it's outside

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.970
of water, its weight
is 10 newtons.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.850
When I submerge it in water-- I
put it on a weighing machine

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:26.690
in water-- its weight
is 2 newtons.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.440
What must be going on here?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.670
The water must be exerting some
type of upward force to

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.640
counteract at least
8 newtons of the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.890
object's original weight.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.450
That difference is the
buoyant force.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.600
So the way to think about is
that once you put the object

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.630
in the water-- it could be a
cube, or it could be anything.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.540
We know that we have a downward
weight that is 10

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.230
newtons, but we know that once
it's in the water, the net

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.070
weight is 2 newtons, so there
must be some force acting

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.460
upwards on the object
of 8 newtons.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.620
That's the buoyant force that
we learned about in the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.250
previous video, in the video
about Archimedes' principle.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.380
This is the buoyant force.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:38.320
So the buoyant force is equal
to 10 minus 2 is equal to 8.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.140
That's how much the water's
pushing up.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350
And what does that
also equal to?

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.520
That equals the weight of the
water displaced, so 8 newtons

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.780
is equal to weight of
water displaced.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.990
What is the weight of
the water displaced?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.510
That's the volume of the water
displaced times the density of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.460
water times gravity.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.350
What is the volume of
water displaced?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.910
It's just the volume of water,
divide 8 newtons by the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.130
density of water,
which is 1,000

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.790
kilograms per meter cubed.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:28.930
A newton is 1 kilogram meter
per second squared.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.450
Then, what's gravity?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.730
It's 9.8 meters per
second squared.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.820
If we look at all the units,
they actually do turn out with

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.430
you just ending up having
just meters cubed, but

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.470
let's do the math.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:03:03.870
We get 8 divided by 1,000
divided by 9.8 is equal to 8.2

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.510
times 10 to the negative 4.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:16.650
V equals 8.2 times 10 to the
minus 4 cubic meters.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.420
Just knowing the difference in
the weight of an object-- the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.760
difference when I put
it in water-- I can

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.710
figure out the volume.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.340
This could be a fun game
to do next time your

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.670
friends come over.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.970
Weigh yourself outside of water,
then get some type of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.700
spring or waterproof weighing
machine, put it at the bottom

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.965
of your pool, stand on it, and
figure out what your weight

00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:41.490
is, assuming that you're dense
enough to go all the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.150
way into the water.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.330
You could figure out somehow
your weight in water, and then

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.390
you would know your volume.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.940
There's other ways.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.170
You could just figure out how
much the surface of the water

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.850
increases, and take
that water away.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.630
This was interesting.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.760
Just knowing how much the
buoyant force of the water was

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.610
or how much lighter we are when
the object goes into the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.800
water, we can figure out the
volume of the object.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.880
This might seem like a very
small volume, but just keep in

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:17.100
mind in a meter cubed, you
have 27 square feet.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:28.020
If we multiply that number
times 27, it equals 0.02

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.650
square feet roughly.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.280
In 0.02 square feet, how many--
in a square foot,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.210
there's actually-- 12 to the
third power times 12 times 12

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.630
is equal to 1,728 times 0.02.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.060
So this is actually
34 square inches.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.560
The object isn't as small as you
may have thought it to be.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.280
It's actually maybe a little bit
bigger than 3 inches by 3

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.500
inches by 3 inches, so it's
a reasonably sized object.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.840
Anyway, let's do another
problem.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.840
Let's say I have some balsa
wood, and I know that the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.780
density of balsa wood is 130
kilograms per meter cubed.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.440
I have some big cube of balsa
wood, and what I want to know

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.040
is if I put that-- let
me draw the water.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.400
I have some big cube of balsa
wood, which I'll do in brown.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.570
So I have a big cube of balsa
wood and the water should go

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.910
on top of it, just so
that you see it's

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.410
submerged in the water.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.640
I want to know what percentage
of the cube goes below the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.590
surface of the water?

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.160
Interesting question.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.790
So how do we do that?

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.625
For the object to be at rest,
for this big cube to be at

00:05:57.625 --> 00:06:02.080
rest, there must be zero net
forces on this object.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.140
In that situation, the buoyant
force must completely equal

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.510
the weight or the force
of gravity.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.550
What's the force of gravity
going to be?

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.130
The force of gravity is just the
weight of the object, and

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:27.110
that's the volume of the balsa
wood times the density of the

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.950
balsa wood times gravity.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.130
What's the buoyant force?

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.960
The buoyant force is equal to
the volume of the displaced

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.090
water, but that's also the
volume of the displaced water

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.200
and it's the volume of the cube
that's been submerged.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.170
The part of the cube that's
submerged, that's volume.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.400
That's also equal
to the amount of

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.690
volume of water displaced.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.970
We could say that's the volume
of the block submerged, which

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.330
is the same thing, remember,
as the volume of the water

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.300
displaced times the density
of water times gravity.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.820
Remember, this is density
of water.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.880
So remember, the buoyant force
is just equal to the weight of

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.000
the water displaced and that's
just the volume of the water

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.230
displaced times the density
of water times gravity.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.560
Of course, the volume of the
water displaced is the exact

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.710
same thing as the volume
of the block

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.850
that's actually submerged.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.710
Since the block is stationary,
it's not accelerating upwards

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.490
or downwards, we know that
these two quantities must

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.900
equal each other.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.340
So V, the volume of the wood,
the entire volume, not just

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.210
the amount that's submerged,
times the density of the wood

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.450
times gravity must equal the
volume of the wood submerged,

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.610
which is equal to the volume of
the water displaced times

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.580
the density of water
times gravity.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.890
We have the acceleration
of gravity.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.140
We have that on both sides,
so we can cross it out.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.400
Let me switch colors to
ease the monotony.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:07.360
What happens if we divide both
sides by the volume of the

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.610
balsa wood?

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.050
I'm just rearranging
this equation.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.850
I think you'll figure it out.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.300
We divide both sides by that,
and you get the volume

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.080
submerged divided by the volume
of the balsa wood-- I

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.450
just divided both sides by VB
and switched sides-- is equal

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:35.590
to the density of the balsa
wood divided by

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.970
the density of water.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.549
Does that make sense?

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:43.140
I just did a couple of quick
algebraic operations, but

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.100
hopefully that got rid of
the g, and that should

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.200
make sense to you.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.270
Now we're ready to solve
our problem.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.520
My original question is
what percentage of

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.450
the object is submerged?

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.160
That's exactly this number.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.530
If we say this is the volume
submerged over the total

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.450
volume, this is the
percent submerged.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.030
That equals the density of
balsa wood, which is 130

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.550
kilograms per meter cubed,
divided by the density of

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.940
water, which is 1,000 kilograms
per meter cubed, so

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.180
130 divided by 1,000 is 0.13.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.370
Vs over VB is equal to
0.13, which is the

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.370
same thing as 13%.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.730
So, exactly 13% percent of this
balsa wood block will be

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.140
submerged in the water.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.660
That's pretty neat to me.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.470
It actually didn't have
to be a block.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.490
It could have been shaped
like a horse.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.450
I'll see you in the
next video.
