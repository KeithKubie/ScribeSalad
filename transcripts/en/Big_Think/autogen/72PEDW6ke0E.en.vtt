people we're building a small pilot

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
people we're building a small pilot
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.700

which will be about the size if you can

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710
which will be about the size if you can

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.000
square meters the engineers are saying
it shouldn't be a single platform it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010
it shouldn't be a single platform it
 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.890
it shouldn't be a single platform it
should be multiple smaller platforms so

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900
should be multiple smaller platforms so
 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.670
should be multiple smaller platforms so
maybe 12 platforms of 625 so about 625

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680
maybe 12 platforms of 625 so about 625
 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.249
maybe 12 platforms of 625 so about 625
square meters so imagine a platform 25

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259
square meters so imagine a platform 25
 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.880
square meters so imagine a platform 25
meters by 25 meters next to another one

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890

with connecting bridges and the reason

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670
with connecting bridges and the reason
 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.220
with connecting bridges and the reason
for smaller structures is that we're

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230
for smaller structures is that we're
 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.880
for smaller structures is that we're
going to be inside the reef within a

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890
going to be inside the reef within a
 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.529
going to be inside the reef within a
lagoon of an island and what you don't

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539
lagoon of an island and what you don't
 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.799
lagoon of an island and what you don't
want is to cast a shadow on the bottom

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809
want is to cast a shadow on the bottom
 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.540
want is to cast a shadow on the bottom
of of the lagoon that will obviously

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
of of the lagoon that will obviously
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.040
of of the lagoon that will obviously
impact photosynthesis which means we'll

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
impact photosynthesis which means we'll
 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.509
impact photosynthesis which means we'll
have a problem with with the environment

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519
have a problem with with the environment
 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.209
have a problem with with the environment
so we need smaller platforms in order

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219
so we need smaller platforms in order
 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.770
so we need smaller platforms in order
for light to penetrate and we need deep

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780
for light to penetrate and we need deep
 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.509
for light to penetrate and we need deep
lagoons so we had to literally do an

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519
lagoons so we had to literally do an
 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.039
lagoons so we had to literally do an
inventory of all of the depths of the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049
inventory of all of the depths of the
 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.300
inventory of all of the depths of the
lagoon around the main islands we're

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310
lagoon around the main islands we're
 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.220
lagoon around the main islands we're
interested in we found certain lagoons

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230
interested in we found certain lagoons
 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.540

environmental consultants are saying

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950
environmental consultants are saying
 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.970
environmental consultants are saying
that between 25 to 30 meters of depth we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980
that between 25 to 30 meters of depth we
 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.660
that between 25 to 30 meters of depth we
will be very we won't have an impact on

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670
will be very we won't have an impact on
 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.750
will be very we won't have an impact on
on the light situation so that's that's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760
on the light situation so that's that's
 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.550
on the light situation so that's that's
one of the elements of location now in

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
one of the elements of location now in
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.810
one of the elements of location now in

don't anticipate being able to be
completely self-sustaining on food we

completely self-sustaining on food we
 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.770
completely self-sustaining on food we
can be completely autonomous on on

our grey and black water do all of that

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020
our grey and black water do all of that
 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.530
our grey and black water do all of that
and deal with our trash what we're not

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540
and deal with our trash what we're not
 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.600

that's involved in trying to look at

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250
that's involved in trying to look at
 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.710
that's involved in trying to look at
these technologies and what we could do

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720
these technologies and what we could do
 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.990
these technologies and what we could do
and we're looking at all sorts of stuff

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000
and we're looking at all sorts of stuff
 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.520

meters deep you bring in

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
meters deep you bring in
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.530
meters deep you bring in
cold deep ocean water so it's similar to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540
cold deep ocean water so it's similar to
 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.660
cold deep ocean water so it's similar to
the seawater air-conditioning systems

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
the seawater air-conditioning systems
 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.890
the seawater air-conditioning systems
there's been two of them for the first

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900
there's been two of them for the first
 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.559
there's been two of them for the first
two have been put into resorts in French

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
two have been put into resorts in French
 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.210

Polynesia so those are installed and

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220
Polynesia so those are installed and
 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.759
Polynesia so those are installed and
working the difference here is that you

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769
working the difference here is that you
 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.530
working the difference here is that you
run the cold water through copper pipes

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
run the cold water through copper pipes
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.589
run the cold water through copper pipes
so small little capillaries that you

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599
so small little capillaries that you
 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.040
so small little capillaries that you
bury under soil so the air in inference

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050
bury under soil so the air in inference
 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.320
bury under soil so the air in inference
barney's is very humid and warmer so

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330
barney's is very humid and warmer so
 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.020
barney's is very humid and warmer so
when that warm air warm moist air hits

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
when that warm air warm moist air hits
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.759
when that warm air warm moist air hits
these tiny capillaries even under the

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769
these tiny capillaries even under the
 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.220
these tiny capillaries even under the
ground what happens is obviously you get

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
ground what happens is obviously you get
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.229
ground what happens is obviously you get
condensation and moisture around those

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239
condensation and moisture around those
 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.539
condensation and moisture around those
tubes and what you do then is you plant

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549
tubes and what you do then is you plant
 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.110
tubes and what you do then is you plant
cold weather plants you know fruits

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120
cold weather plants you know fruits
 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.420
cold weather plants you know fruits
vegetables strawberries raspberries and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
vegetables strawberries raspberries and
 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.080
vegetables strawberries raspberries and
the roots actually will go down to these

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090
the roots actually will go down to these
 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.610
the roots actually will go down to these
tubes and they'll pick up the moisture

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620
tubes and they'll pick up the moisture
 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.220
tubes and they'll pick up the moisture
so you've got a system that uses very

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
so you've got a system that uses very
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.259
so you've got a system that uses very
little energy to create fresh water for

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269
little energy to create fresh water for
 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.289
little energy to create fresh water for
your agriculture and it seems that the

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299
your agriculture and it seems that the
 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.150
your agriculture and it seems that the
vegetables are tricked by the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
vegetables are tricked by the
 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920
vegetables are tricked by the
temperature at the roots and not the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930
temperature at the roots and not the
 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.690
temperature at the roots and not the
temperature at the leaves so you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
temperature at the leaves so you
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.910
temperature at the leaves so you
basically get the sunlight from tropical

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920
basically get the sunlight from tropical
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.680
basically get the sunlight from tropical
environment but you get the cold the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690
environment but you get the cold the
 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.509
environment but you get the cold the
fruit you know the strawberry thinks

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519
fruit you know the strawberry thinks
 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.289
fruit you know the strawberry thinks
it's in Maine but suddenly it's

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299
it's in Maine but suddenly it's
 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.000
it's in Maine but suddenly it's
producing very quickly so this this is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010
producing very quickly so this this is
 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.710
producing very quickly so this this is

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560
technologies we're looking at to have
 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.590
technologies we're looking at to have
some vegetables on the sea stat itself

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
some vegetables on the sea stat itself
 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.509
some vegetables on the sea stat itself
we're looking at algae there's a number

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519
we're looking at algae there's a number
 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.680
we're looking at algae there's a number
of comestibles algae out there I'm not
