00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.640
Today probably you're a bit anxious maybe about

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.180
some work you have to finish, people you have to see, some chores you've neglected

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.440
Anxiety often appears to be about particular things

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.240
promising us that if only they can be overcome, we'll reach a stage of long-lasting serenity and security

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.800
but really, if we are frank about how we function

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.800
the problem really seems larger and more fundamental.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.340
Beyond any specific thing we happen to be worrying about

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.820
looked at overtime we're simply anxious

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.780
to our core in a very basic make up of our being.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.560
Through we may focus day-to-day on this or that particular worry creating static in our minds,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.300
what we're really up against is anxiety as a permanent feature of life:

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.680
something irrevocable, existential, dogged and responsible for ruining a dominant share

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.020
for our brief time on earth.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.680
Tortured by anxiety, we naturally fall prey to some powerful fantasies

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.080
about what might finally bring us calm.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.740
At certain points especially in the north, the fantasies latch on to travel.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.320
Here at last there would be peace under the clear blue sky,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.220
on the island eleven and half hours from here seven times zones away,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.580
with the warm water lapping at our feet

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.580
and with access to the seaside villa on pontoons.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.180
It's just the matter holding on for a few more months and parting with a extraordinary sum

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.860
or perhaps we be calm if the house could be really as we wanted with everything in it's place

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.420
no more clutter, pristine walls, ample cupboards, stripped oak, limestone

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.160
or perhaps we'll be calm when one day when we reach the right place in the company

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.920
when the novel is sold, or the film is made, or our shares worth hundreds of millions

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.580
and we can walk into a room full of strangers now know at once who we are

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.540
or, and this one we might keep on private

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.780
the might become if we have the right sort of person in our lives

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.160
someone who can properly understand us, a creature with whom wouldn't be so difficult

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.040
would be kind and playful and sympathetic with a thoughtful compassionate eyes

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.820
and in whose arms we could lie in peace almost like a child, but not quite.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.200
Travel, home, status, love: the four great contemporary ideals around which fantasies of calm collect.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.580
Yet despite the promises and the passion expended in the pursuit of these goals, none of them will work.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.240
There'd be anxiety in the beach, in the pristine home, after the sale of the company

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.920
and in the arms of anyone you could ever seduce.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.920
Anxiety is a fundamental state for well-founded reasons:

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.540
because we are intensively vulnerable physical beings,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.500
a complicated network of fragile organs all binding that time before eventually letting us down catastrophically;

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.460
because we got insufficient information, upon which to make most major life decisions

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.160
we're steering more or less blind, because we can imagine so much more than we have

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.280
and living a mediatized societies where envy and restlessness is always a constant;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.800
because we're the descendants of the great warriors of the species, the others having been trampled and torn apart by wild animals

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.880
and because we still carry in our bones into the calm of the suburbs the terrors of the savannah.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.620
All of which isn't to say that aren't better or worse ways to approach anxiety.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.700
The single most important move is to accept that we'll always be anxious.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.460
There is no need on top of everything else to be anxious, that we're anxious.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.220
That mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong, merely that we're alive.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.680
So we should be more careful when pursuing things will imagine spare us  anxiety.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.960
We can pursue them by all means but for other reasons than fantasies of calm

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.100
and with perhaps a little less vigour and a little more skepticism.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.460
We should also spare us of the burden of loneliness:

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.260
we're far from the only ones with this problem, everyone is more anxious  than they're inclined to admit.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.980
Even the tycoon or the couple in love are suffering

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.340
We've collectively failed to admit to ourselves what we truly like.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.460
We should learn to laugh about our anxieties, laugh to be the exuberant expression of relief

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.040
when a hitherto to private agony, is given a well-crafted social formulation in a joke.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.220
At last we should hug, not the forced intimacy of most modern hugs

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.100
but the melancholy, sympathetic way Botticelli's angels do it -

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.540
having come down to Earth to offer comfort to humans for the brute facts of earthly existence.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.800
We must suffer alone, but we can at least hold out our arms

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.620
to a similarly tortured, fractured and above all else, anxious neighbours

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.140
as if to say in the kindest way possible, I know!
