00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.754
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:04.960
- Thank you.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.186
Thank you everyone from
coming out on a rainy day.

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm glad you're
here because this

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.050
is an incredible opportunity
for me to be sharing some

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.890
of my experience over
the past few years,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.510
and also some
ideas that I really

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.670
want to discuss with you
after the presentation.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.810
Thank you, Mary, for the
wonderful introduction.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.850
I'm afraid you probably
raised the bar a bit too high.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.360
So I really hope
that I can somehow

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.650
meet what people are
expecting after what you said.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.690
I'm going to take you--

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.310
it's strange for me working
with Doctors Without Borders

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.434
to be talking about Europe.

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:43.900
I mean you know the organization
from working elsewhere

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.752
around the world.

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:45.710
And it's a bit bizarre.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.300
How do a bunch of doctors
end up rescuing refugees

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.970
in the Mediterranean Sea?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.260
So I'm going to tell you
this story, not because

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.900
of the rescue, not
because of what we did,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.720
but because I'm interested
in drawing some conclusions

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.320
and thinking together about
how did that come about,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.447
how did it start, how
it is coming to an end,

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:07.030
and what's happening
in the background

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.520
politically in
Europe and elsewhere.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.310
So I'll take you through
a couple of slides.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.130
I'll try to make it fast.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.490
Don't worry, it's not a lecture.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.050
Stay.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.170
It's a conversation.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.490
This what was worrying us.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.640
Governments don't take figures.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.391
There's no official figures for
deaths in the Mediterranean.

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:31.390
But the International
Organization for Migration

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.940
has been collecting reports
of people's death at sea.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.830
These figures are sketchy.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.630
There are many deaths
that go unreported.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.200
There are many people
that go unaccounted for.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.340
So nevertheless, it's
pretty well documented

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.369
that at least 35,000
people have died

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.910
trying to cross the
Mediterranean Sea

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.050
since the turn of the century.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.630
That's a pretty high number.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.960
If you could draw a geography
of deaths and suffering caused

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
by borders around
the world, that

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.740
would be the absolute center.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.259
So that's what was
worrying us when we

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.150
thought about this operation.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.810
These images became
sadly familiar.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.550
Small numbers of deaths
every week, every month

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.180
became acceptable.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.470
Things were going
on over the years,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.450
and we kept seeing it
on TV, but there was not

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.570
much visibility beyond that.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.420
There was not much outrage.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.647
So why does this happen?

00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:41.730
Why are these people on
these boats to begin with?

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.490
I mean, wouldn't it be
safer to get on a plane?

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.332
If you want to go for
North Africa to Europe,

00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:48.540
why don't you get on a plane?

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.590
It's cheaper.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.520
It's faster.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.090
It's safer.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.570
Why would you risk your
life and your family's life

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.910
on an overcrowded boat?

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.510
And the reason is because,
for certain kinds of people--

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.680
and this is central
to the message--

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.460
certain kinds of people
that is not possible.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.130
It's not that European
borders are closed.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.010
Many of you have been
in Europe recently.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.850
Right?

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.650
I have been living
in Europe for--

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.670
I'm not from Europe.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.787
I've been living in Europe
for a number of years.

00:03:16.787 --> 00:03:18.120
European borders are not closed.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.130
They are closed for
certain types of people.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.160
And that's an important thing.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.570
Mediterranean.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.460
Border controls passports have
existed since the 19th century.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.240
They have evolved
over time in Europe

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.890
they are not a new thing.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.670
But what has happened over the
last 10, 15 years in Europe--

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.350
there's a new graph here.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.550
This is the growth of European
expenditure on defense.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.320
This is Frontex.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.110
This is the agency for
border control in Europe.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.950
Every year, no matter what
the crisis, what budget cuts

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.460
have to be made elsewhere,
the border defense industry

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.080
is thriving.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.470
Every year there is more
money poured into it.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.040
For next year, it's planned to
be tripled to 33 billion euros.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.410
And it's projected that by
2027, the number of staff

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.030
that work in Frontex
is going to be

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.910
multiplied by a factor of 10.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.420
It's clear what
priorities are, right?

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.570
So these results on a red line
on the map, which obviously

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.930
doesn't look like a red line.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.560
How does the border
control happen?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.520
They are not
physical necessarily.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520
There are border fences.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.810
There are walls.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.200
But this is not the main
tool to keep people out.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.610
The main tools are
administrative and legal

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.860
obstacles that are put there.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.080
It's difficult to get visas.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.830
They are carrying
sanctions on airlines

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.080
to make sure that they check
that certain people don't

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.400
get on planes.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.160
So what causes differential
mobility at the border?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.750
What happens here is movement
is simply an unequal thing.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.590
I mean their right to
move across borders

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.400
is not for everyone.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.380
And this is especially aimed--

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.750
and I'm using the word aim--

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.700
I could say this
disproportionately

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.210
affects people from
Africa, the Middle East.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.560
I think these measures are aimed
at certain groups of people.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.900
So how did we get into this?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.690
2011 there was a very well
organized-- over the years

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.720
Europe has been spending
money in partnerships

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.200
with what they call countries
in the periphery to make sure

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.020
that those countries do the job
of stopping people before they

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.250
actually get on boats.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.550
This was happening with Libya.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.633
The Berlusconi administration
spent a lot of money

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:37.980
and a lot of diplomacy
to make this happen.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.890
Now what happens when you
get Gaddafi out of Libya?

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.270
There was NATO led
intervention in Libya

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.000
that was supported by
European countries,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.430
but resulted in an
unintended effect.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.670
The war that was put there,
the incarceration of people,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.910
and then interception of
boats stopped happening.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.050
There was a breakdown of
state control in Libya.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.210
The country got divided.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.970
There were warring
factions vying for control.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.280
So basically the people that
those routes existed forever.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.760
But you had a perfect storm.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.520
You had nobody at the gate.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.600
By 2011, you had famine
in the horn of Africa.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.160
You had war in South Sudan.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.570
You had war in south of Somalia.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.040
You had war in Congo.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.340
You had conflict in northeast
Nigeria with Boko Haram.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.970
You had a number of
issues going on there,

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.890
and nobody watching the door.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.550
So that little cross there
slowly but surely became

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.870
the epicenter of
migrant drownings.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.440
That's when we really started--
that's what you mentioned.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.030
This was the first that we
said can we really do something

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.420
there?

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.920
No.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.820
We said no.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.120
I mean, we discussed, and we
were really struggling with it.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.560
This was what we were thinking.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.860
There are push factors that are
really forcing people to move.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.350
There are closed borders.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.360
There's a booming smuggling
business growing in Libya.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.250
We have people preying
on people's desperation

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.100
to put them on
boats, charge them

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.840
a horrendous amount
of money, and then

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.810
put them on the same
boats and push them north.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.180
And of course, people are dying.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.550
That was our analysis, and we
said can we actually do that?

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.790
Can we rescue people?

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.680
And it took us a long time to
actually venture in to do it.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.400
It was not such
an easy decision.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.030
But I'll tell you about that.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.330
What was happening while
people were drowning?

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.070
And this is the
background of this story.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.482
I'm talking about two Europes.

00:07:34.482 --> 00:07:35.440
There are many Europes.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.650
When you say Europe, there are
many countries inside Europe.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.170
There are in every country
different political positions,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.800
political parties.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.189
So there are
millions of Europes.

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:46.980
It's a generalization
to talk about Europe.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.330
But for this talk, I want
to talk about two Europes.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.900
There's one Europe of
solidarity, empathy,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.560
refugees welcome Europe.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.890
And there's the
other Europe of what

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.120
are these people doing here?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.290
Refugees go home.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.310
Why are they coming?

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.900
We cannot take care of everyone.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.220
Why are we rescuing them?

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.815
Why are we actually
putting resources

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:09.750
and getting people out of the
sea and bringing them here?

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.320
And those two Europes will
be throughout this story

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.000
that I'm going to tell you.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.850
Because those two
forces have influenced

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.050
decision-making--
political decision-making

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.420
that actually has influenced
thousands of people's lives.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.240
So shall we rescue them or not?

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.310
Shall we help them or
not was the dilemma.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.655
And that's Lampedusa 2013.

00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:34.530
Those Italians in the
audience remember that.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.669
Right?

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.710
A boat-- it was
the largest number

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.799
of deaths in a single incident.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.780
It turns out that there
was a distress call.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.820
It turns out that
the Maltese Coast

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.240
Guard says no, it's the Italians
who have to rescue them.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.948
They tell us, no.

00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:51.930
It's the Maltese.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.340
So who should do it?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.720
Finger-pointing.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.330
In the meantime,
360 people drowned.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.630
So there was outrage
across Europe.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.455
Every single European leader
was saying this needs to stop.

00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:04.830
They all came up
with a statement

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.040
saying why are people
drowning in the 21st century

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.260
at our doorstep?

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.540
Why is this happening?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.690
When I say European
leaders, even the Pope

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.380
came up with a statement.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.550
And the Pope in Italy,
it's an important thing.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.860
Let's put it that way.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.280
So what does Italy do?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.670
Italy 10 days later,
they deployed the Navy.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.650
They deployed the
Coast Guard closer

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.530
to the Libyan shores,
Operation Mare Nostrum.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.940
We need to save people's lives.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.550
This is unacceptable.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.570
They put a lot of resources
into that for an entire year.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.640
They rescued over 100,000 people
and brought them to Sicily.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.980
Of course, that
couldn't last very long.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.565
It very quickly
came under scrutiny.

00:09:53.565 --> 00:09:56.700
It very quickly came
under criticism.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.170
It was considered a pull factor.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.259
If we rescue people,
more will come.

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:03.050
That was the logic.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.510
Why are we exacerbating
the problem

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.650
by saving people's lives?

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.050
The counter argument to
that is, OK, let them drown

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.550
and maybe they don't come.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.130
But it was under criticism.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.610
Italy asked after one year--
they asked the European Union,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.090
would you help us fund this?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.750
Nope.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.000
So [INAUDIBLE] said let's
put Triton in its place.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.340
Let's take the Mare Nostrom
and let's put Triton.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.191
The ships look pretty
much the same, right?

00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:32.440
They are just military assets.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.070
There's a Navy.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.191
There's a Coast Guard.

00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:36.190
But they have a fundamentally
different mission.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.330
Mare Nostrom is deployed
close to the African coast.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.030
That's where people
are drowning.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.970
Trying to retreat 30 miles
from the Italian shore.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.145
Clearly a different purpose.

00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:53.020
One was there to rescue
people, the other one

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.742
was to protect the border.

00:10:54.742 --> 00:10:56.200
And that was made
very, very clear.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.630
Of course, it was
said, OK, if we

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.540
come across boats in distress
we will of course rescue people.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.212
We are obliged to do that.

00:11:03.212 --> 00:11:05.170
But if you make sure you
are in the wrong place

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.100
at the wrong time, you
will not find a boat.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.550
So I'm saying this--
it sounds like I'm

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.850
blaming European governments.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.560
But this is a quote from the
Frontex assessment report

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.570
when they were
planning the operation.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.180
"It was known the
withdrawal of boats

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.520
would result in a higher
number of fatalities."

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.740
The decision was
made in spite of.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.600
So that's when we said, OK,
should we rescue people at sea?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.200
It took us probably three
minutes to figure out that.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.120
Yes, of course we should.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.660
Why?

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.396
Because it's the
right thing to do.

00:11:41.396 --> 00:11:43.520
What do you do when there
are human beings drowning

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.550
and you can put a boat and
take them out of the sea?

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.510
Do you have really a choice?

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.870
Do you have a
justification not to do it?

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.060
Of course not.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.490
We didn't ask what was
their legal status.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.020
We didn't ask them are you a
refugee or an economic migrant?

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.790
What's your religion?

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.210
Are you black or white?

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.240
We didn't ask that.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.480
We said let's go into this,
don't ask the question,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.010
but also we were not naive.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.610
Should we?

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.450
Yes.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.414
Could we?

00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:20.820
We didn't know.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.320
And these were
the questions that

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.040
really took us a lot of time.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.010
It's like, OK, we were
used to rescuing refugee--

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.520
to assisting refugees around
the world and in Europe.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.750
We had at that time projects
in Italy and in Greece,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.280
small projects for the
people that had arrived.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.389
But what about those
trying to get to Europe?

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:42.180
For us it doesn't matter
their legal stat--

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.460
but for states it's
a fundamental thing.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.886
Will they allow us to do it?

00:12:46.886 --> 00:12:48.510
Or will we be accused
of the same thing

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.840
that Mare Nostrum was accused?

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.000
Will the Italians work with us?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.050
Will they allow us to work
with their rescue coordination

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:06.450
center or any rescue city
and disembark people in Italy

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.340
as they have been doing it?

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.110
Could we do it?

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.630
We knew that in the
early 2000s there

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.890
were fisherman, commercial
vessels, and one small NGO that

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.080
had been prosecuted in
Italy for doing this.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.580
Why?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.735
Because they had
come across a boat.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:23.610
The boat was sinking.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.830
They had taken people on board.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.950
They had sailed back to Sicily.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.669
And they were either stuck
outside the port saying,

00:13:31.669 --> 00:13:33.210
no, you are not
allowed to enter port

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.600
because you have people without
the right papers on board.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.180
Or they were allowed to
dock, and they were then

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.110
taken to court and prosecuted
for aiding illegal immigration.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.620
So we're like are we going
to be prosecuted as well.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.520
Will they dare to prosecute us?

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.460
Can we actually do this or not?

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.510
We were marginally
worried about that.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.010
We were more worried
about what will

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.420
be the reaction of
those two Europes?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.190
And when say those two
Europes we mean politicians,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.330
we mean public opinion.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.500
We mean the people who actually
give money to MSF in Europe.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.040
Right?

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.270
I mean we would face a
stampede of calls saying,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.250
sorry, I don't want to
donate money to MSF anymore.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:24.550
We had when we did for another
way that happened for a period.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.970
So our fundraising department
were not very happy

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.820
that we actually went with the
decision to go with a boat.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.300
But luckily we don't--

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.612
the fundraising
departments in MSF

00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:36.195
don't make decisions
about operations.

00:14:36.195 --> 00:14:38.590
So that was out of the way.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.017
But we had all
these trepidations.

00:14:41.017 --> 00:14:42.850
Luckily, the Italians,
much to our surprise,

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.010
they said, OK, we will
cooperate with you.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.480
In the end the Coast Guard and
the Navy, they are sea men,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.740
they felt that there was
something to be done there.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.144
So they said, yes.

00:14:53.144 --> 00:14:55.060
The reactions of the
rest we couldn't predict.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.620
We thought it was
going to be bad.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.170
We never knew it was
going to be this bad.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:05.210
So we said, OK, if we're going
to walk into a minefield,

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.070
let's be prepared for it.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.900
Let's not give the
others the opportunity

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.330
to explain and
manipulate what we do.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.091
Let's explain it ourselves.

00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:14.090
Let's explain ourselves.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.260
Let's be clear.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.950
And let's have a very clear
argument of what we're doing.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.060
And we started to tread
very, very carefully.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.850
We are Doctors Without
Borders, but we

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.410
didn't go for criticizing the
existence of border controls.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.750
We said what we
are objecting to is

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.590
the human cost of those
border controls happening

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.910
in the Mediterranean.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.950
It's a difficult line to tread.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.965
We didn't say go
open the borders.

00:15:38.965 --> 00:15:40.340
We said these
people are drowning

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.460
because they don't have any safe
or legal alternatives to get

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.510
to Europe.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.540
You have to change
that if you want

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.299
to stop people from drowning.

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:50.840
And of course, if you have the
resources, you have to rescue.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.720
We shouldn't be doing
this job ourselves.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.100
How to convey this message?

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.500
You do have to take
journalists on board.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.480
Well, we had if we
wanted this to be known.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.700
But we knew that
we were never going

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.670
to be able to
control the message,

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.110
to control how this was
going to be reported.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.480
We have our own guidelines
in terms of we're

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.460
not going to show certain
kinds of pictures.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.670
We're not going to exploit
people's suffering.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.670
We're not going to--

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.130
we're going to let people who
want to talk the opportunity

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.650
to talk and give
their testimony,

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.150
but we're not going
to force anyone.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.510
We're going to protect
people's privacy.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.500
But how much can
you do that when

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.930
you have camera crews on board?

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.040
We weighed the two things and
said, we have to just do it.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.940
This needs a bit of
visibility if it's

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.250
going to have any effect on
putting pressure for change.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.400
So here we go.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.790
We launched that
boat on April 2015.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:56.120
From then on the situation went
literally out of our hands.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.000
We tried to be clear
in what we-- these are

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.010
some of the snippets.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.670
I'm going to go through this
quickly because you don't want

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.230
to read MSF press releases.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.536
But basically [LAUGHS]
what we said is, look,

00:17:07.536 --> 00:17:09.410
we're doing this because
people are drowning.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.650
It's the right thing to do.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.760
And we also are going to be
critical of European policy

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.700
towards refugees
and asylum seekers.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.750
So we made that clear.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.250
We had to give context to it.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.520
We couldn't do the
NGO trick of saying

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.339
there are people drowning,
give me money, I'll save them.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.480
We didn't want that role.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.510
We wanted to say, look,
we want context in this.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.810
This needs to be explained.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:35.420
The photo without the caption,
it's not going to do it.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.720
This needs context.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.000
This needs an explanation.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.130
And we need to do
justice to what's

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.170
happening in the Mediterranean.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.360
So we went with that.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.770
Two days after we
launched the operation

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.410
and completely unrelated
to it, this happens.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:57.020
They are 12,000 lives lost in
two incidents in the same week

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.245
because the oil tankers
that were in the area.

00:18:01.245 --> 00:18:02.120
They tried to rescue.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.260
They are big boats, small boats.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:10.270
They are 1,200 people
dead in a single week.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.190
Of course the media
went all over it,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.760
and the situation by then
already it was bigger than us.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.730
Much bigger than us, than
our little boat in the Med.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.340
So how to navigate this?

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.310
There was massive
public controversy

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.629
and what the EU
does, they come, they

00:18:27.629 --> 00:18:29.170
start pointing
fingers at each other.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.737
They say, OK, let's launch an
operation to fight smuggling.

00:18:31.737 --> 00:18:33.070
There was nothing about rescues.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.861
We have to fight those
smugglers that bring

00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:37.270
the people into the country.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.120
By May, June we said,
OK nobody is jumping in.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.750
We're going to put two more
boats in the operation.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:44.530
We scaled up.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.770
We had three boats at that
point in the Mediterranean.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.410
And this fourth
thing that we never

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.950
expected in different
countries in European society,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:00.440
in Germany, in France, in
Spain, groups of citizens

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.880
started organizing and
copying our model of rescue

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.180
and trying to charter boats to
put boats in the Mediterranean

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.890
to go and rescue people.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:15.090
So we had in a year there
were 10 NGO-run boats

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.210
in the Mediterranean.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.030
We never anticipated
this result.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.660
We talked about controlling
the message of the narrative.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.570
There was a cacophony of voices
in the Med talking about this.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.380
There were journalists
on all boats.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.220
And it seemed the positive
side of it, it was like,

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.020
well it seems that
it's appealing

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.140
to some part of Europe
that actually feels--

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.730
citizens feel that they have
to do something about that.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.991
So here you go.

00:19:44.991 --> 00:19:47.240
I'm going to show you a
three-minute video to give you

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.590

Each one had a story,
a hope, a dream.

00:20:08.036 --> 00:20:10.747
Over just six days, we'll
witness the intensity

00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:11.705
of the rescue attempts.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.580
The helplessness
of the migrants,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.002
and the hopelessness of the
effort to end the crisis.

00:20:19.002 --> 00:20:19.710

- I just had to cut it
there because it gets worse.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.410
But anyway, it conveys
a reality at sea.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.780
It uses language that
you can question.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.450
It uses-- But that's
what the media--

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.540
that's how it started
to look in the media.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.880
The hopelessness
of the migrants,

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.187
and the helplessness of the--

00:21:01.187 --> 00:21:01.770
The other way.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.330
The helplessness of the
migrants and the hopelessness

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.280
of the effort to end the crisis.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.500
What crisis?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.160
Let's see.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.410
So Med.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.310
What do I have here?

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.069
Yes, this is really important.

00:21:13.069 --> 00:21:13.860
The eastern border.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.360
This is what's happening in the
center of the Mediterranean.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.670
Libya, eastern border.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:23.010
Three, four months later, you
had a raging conflict in Syria.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.490
You had the extension of
the conflict into Iraq.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.140
You had war in
Afghanistan for years.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.510
You had the announcement
or the sense

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.450
that Europe is going to
start closing the borders.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:40.020
You have people starting to
move through Turkey into Europe.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.329
So these images
on the European--

00:21:43.329 --> 00:21:44.370
or call it Eastern Front.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.460
I don't like the language.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.262
I mean this military
language to use now

00:21:48.262 --> 00:21:49.470
when we talk about migration.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.960
The Eastern Front makes
me very suspicious.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.550
But this is what Europe's
Eastern Front look like.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:03.430
There are images of people with
headscarves behind barbed wire

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.770
fences.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:11.050
The misery of those camps in
Greece next to beach resorts,

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:16.810
the soldiers at the fence,
the people behind it.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.900
It really became quite--

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.150
the pressure on European
governments was really, really,

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.580
really high.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.270
So that's when the
migration crises

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.510
became the term to define this.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.110
And that's when the
migration crisis took over.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.890
There was a crisis
at the borders.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.400
And this is some of the images.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.080
I'm going to just go behind.

00:23:08.835 --> 00:23:11.050
So that quickly became
the central issue

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.460
for the upcoming elections for
several European countries.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:20.230
That was the main concern
by politicians from all ends

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:21.790
of the political spectrum.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.180
Migration became the weapon
in which those elections

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.550
were going to be fought.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.270
It was a problem.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:33.719
The deaths and suffering you
see had a political cost.

00:23:33.719 --> 00:23:35.260
But the arrival of
migrants in Europe

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.718
also had a political
cost, and they

00:23:36.718 --> 00:23:40.060
were right wing
anti-immigration parties

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.550
really pressing their agenda,
and making electoral gains

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.230
with it.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.770
So politicians in
power like America

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:51.887
and others, some countries their
response was not coordinated.

00:23:51.887 --> 00:23:54.220
Some countries said, at the
beginning, more were coming.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.386
Then they quickly realized
that this was problematic

00:23:56.386 --> 00:23:57.730
and they went backwards.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.100
But there was quite an
uncoordinated response,

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.510
and this grew in the background.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.490
So there was really an
urgency to end the crisis.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.760
But what crisis are
we talking about?

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.020
Whose crisis?

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.780
What is the problem that
we're trying to solve?

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.840
And that's when September,
just a couple of months

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.362
later, the boy on the beach.

00:24:21.362 --> 00:24:22.570
I don't even need to show it.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.250
But you know what
that is, right?

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:34.580
That became cover in
newspapers around the world.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:40.250
That became the poster
child of the crisis.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:44.090
It became exploited by everyone.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.820
Everyone.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.722
So this was painful.

00:24:47.722 --> 00:24:48.680
This was heartbreaking.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.202
This pulled everyone's
heartstrings.

00:24:51.202 --> 00:24:53.660
No matter what you thought
about migration, about migrants,

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.877
this was a child.

00:24:55.877 --> 00:24:57.210
This could have been your child.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.180
This could have been our child
people thought in Europe.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.430
It became the crisis
human-- the crisis became

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.090
human, visible, immediate.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.500
It appealed to
something that was not

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.580
a theory, that was not numbers.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.680
It was something else.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.440
There was really
true feeling there

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.900
for a period, an
outpour of compassion.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.420
That photo came with a caption.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.660
Alan had come with
his mom and his dad

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.720
and his little brother
from Aleppo, Syria.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.120
Not from Aleppo, sorry,
from Kobani, Syria.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.540
And that's how Kobani looked
by the time that they had fled.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.230
So we all understood.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.090
The plight of Syrian
refugees was validated.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.320
Right?

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.860
If I lived in Kobani,
I would have also left.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.660
I would have also
got on that boat.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.330
I would also pay
$5,000 to a smuggler

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.580
to put me on a flimsy boat
and try to get to Europe.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.680
We knew that Alan had died.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.230
We also knew that his
entire family had died

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.470
and the father was
the only survivor.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:08.340
But there's an outpouring
of grief and compassion.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.530
But what to do with it?

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.030
What to do with those feelings?

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.940
Yes, a lot social
media around it.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.520
A lot of demonstrations.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.900
A lot of clicks.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.670
The world refugee and migrants
went crazy on Twitter.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:25.890
People took an interest.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.880
But what else do with it?

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.280
And this is what I cannot resist
quoting a bit of Susan Sontag.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.980
She has a wonderful book on
regarding the pain of others.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.880
And I'm going to read you
that quote of compassion

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.820
that I really like.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.000
"Compassion, " she says,
"is an unstable emotion.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.180
It needs to be translated
into action or it withers.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.060
The question of what to
do with the feelings that

00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:01.080
have been aroused, the knowledge
that has been communicated.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.180
If one feels there's nothing
we can do, but who is that we?

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.451
And nothing they can do
either and who are they?

00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:16.380
Then one starts to get
bored, cynical, apathetic."

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.970
That was what we
were discussing.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.720
Where is this going to go?

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.280
It was short lived.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.080
Two months later, you get that.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.300
You get a brutal
terrorist attack in Paris.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.040
You've got 130 people dead.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.340
You get the media
all over it again.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.920
You get ISIS
claiming the attack.

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:47.860
And you get a French
prime minister

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.230
that very quickly says
the terrorist threat has

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.340
slipped in across the border.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.170
They have taken advantage of
the migration crisis to slip in.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.512
The threat has
come from outside.

00:28:01.512 --> 00:28:02.970
That, by the way,
wasn't even true.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.490
And the police investigation
would reveal something else.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.960
It was not even--

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.860
But who cares?

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.160
Once it has been said,
how do you unsay it?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.510
Right?

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.689
So where do we go now?

00:28:14.689 --> 00:28:16.730
Oh, yeah, let me show you
a bit about these guys.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:17.396
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:20.139
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.970
- Every week, every
day, every hour ships

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.970
packed with illegal
immigrants are

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.410
flooding the European border.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.650
An invasion is taking place.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.120
- This mass
immigration is changing

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.250
the face of our continent.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.550
We're losing our
safety, our way of life,

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.270
and we will become a
minority in our own country.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.590
Our future is under attack.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.450
- It all starts right here
at the European borders.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.020
- Right here the illegals
make the first step

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.920
on European ground.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.230
Right here the NGOs
and human traffickers

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.770
are endangering the
future of our people.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.460
Right here our governments
are betraying and failing us

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.200
by letting this happen.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.320
- From all across Europe,
we gather here in Sicily

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.670
to take action.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.650
Our mission is clear and
simple, to defend Europe.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.340
- We want to expose the
so-called humanitarian NGOs.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.530
They cooperate with
human traffickers

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.750
who live from people's misery.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:28.120
We want to protect our borders
and face those criminals

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.500
on the sea.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.670
- This is just the beginning.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.820
We are preparing a
big rescue mission

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.070
on the Mediterranean Sea.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.960
- It's a mission
to rescue Europe

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.460
by stopping illegal immigration.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.970
We want to get a
crew, equip a boat,

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.130
and set sails to
the Mediterranean

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.990
to chase down these
enemies of Europe.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.700
To start our mission,
we need your help.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.740
The immigration lobby is funded
with hundreds of thousands

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.100
of euros from the government
and from big donators.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.270
We on the other hand depend
only on you to fund this mission

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.410
and to defend Europe.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.150
- Where the governments,
fail we step in.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.580
Because this land is ours.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.687
It starts here, and
it has to end here.

00:30:12.687 --> 00:30:14.800
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:29.164 --> 00:30:31.120
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.930
- The plot thickens, right?

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.900
The plot becomes ever
more interesting.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.050
We also didn't anticipate this.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:43.300
We didn't anticipate that it
was going to be another boat

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.140
to rescue Europe.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.680
These people, by the
way, in the video,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.130
they are there
with a small boat,

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.060
with megaphones and launching
flares against our boat.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.190
That's our boat,
the Catania post.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.650
They did this action against
an MSF boat very quickly.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.880
We decided just not to
give them the airtime.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.000
So we didn't really
denounce it or anything.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.610
So that was still there.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.010
Who wants to know
how this ended?

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.615
I mean it's--

00:31:15.615 --> 00:31:17.770
It was short lived too.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.020
Here you go.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.860
So these guys
crowdfund 50,000 pounds

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.292
to put a boat in the Med.

00:31:23.292 --> 00:31:24.250
They managed to get it.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.770
They chartered a boat called
the C-Star in Djibouti.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.660
And they start sailing
towards Europe,

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.980
towards the Mediterranean,
trying to stop the NGOs.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:38.740
And the irony is of it they
touched land in Cyprus--

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.760
They landed in Cyprus, and
five of their crew members

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.370
who had been recruited--
they were from Sri Lanka,

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.550
they applied for
asylum in Europe.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.490
So the police gets
on board of the boat,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.236
and they say, what
are you doing?

00:31:55.236 --> 00:31:57.610
And they find that the rest
of the crew, another other 25

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.640
guys, are also from Sri Lanka,
and they don't have any papers.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.041
So they're taken to court, and
they are deported from Cyprus

00:32:04.041 --> 00:32:04.915
for people smuggling.

00:32:04.915 --> 00:32:08.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.800
Then they go to Italy.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.800
In Catania, they face
a canoe demonstration

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.240
by just a bunch of Italians
that get on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.170
They get on the sea and they--

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.695
then they try to get to Tunis.

00:32:21.695 --> 00:32:23.859
And there are Tunisian
fisherman saying

00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:25.150
we don't like this racist boat.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.910
We don't want it to land here.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:32.620
And to add insult to injury,
I think the best part of this,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.650
they get an engine
break down, and they

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.300
had to be rescued
by one of the NGOs

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.591
they were trying to bring down.

00:32:37.591 --> 00:32:40.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.270
It's funny.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:46.770
We laughed a lot at the time
when Defend Europe went down.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:47.940
There was social media.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.710
We had a bit of a
laugh with these guys.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.150
But what they were saying
really condensed some discourse

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.540
that was really installing
itself in the narrative.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.030
They were not alone.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.600
These are young
people around Europe.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.290
They are not that important.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.640
But what they say
echoes with many people.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.770
So they had to do something.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.520
Imagine yourself, you're
a European prime minister.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.080
You have the MSF
of the world saying

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:13.870
you have to rescue people.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.745
You have to open safe
and legal alternatives.

00:33:15.745 --> 00:33:20.620
And you have these other people
saying stop the invasion.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.580
So what do you do?

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.570
You cannot agree
within yourselves.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.390
When people arrive--

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.010
Italy's saying we
need to be helped.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.500
The other countries need to
be taking immigrants as well,

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.220
and we need to distribute.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.719
The other countries all want
to look in the other direction.

00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:33.900
The Italians say why us?

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.560
Greece the same.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.340
So what do you do?

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.210
You cannot fix that.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.350
You have Greek camps that
really look appalling.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.200
Some of the worst
camps I ever seen.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.940
You have people at the fences.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.390
You have all the coverage.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:48.640
So what do you do?

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.490
You pass the buck.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.600
The magic bullet.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.750
That was the first group
photo of European politicians

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.965
throughout the crisis.

00:33:56.965 --> 00:33:58.090
There were going to be two.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:58.990
That was a first one.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.406
The first time they actually
managed to agree and announce

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:02.020
something.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.640
And the announcement
was that they

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.440
have got Turkey to agree on
taking the refugees back.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.840
How much would it
cost for Turkey

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.520
to agree to take
the refugees that

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.090
have crossed to Greece
and to Eastern Europe

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:19.960
back into Turkey,
control their border,

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.540
and prevent further
departure of boats?

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.370
What do we need to give them?

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:25.199
It was easy.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.750
It was $6 billion
euros over three years.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.130
And the problem is that the
Turkish citizens will have easy

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:37.449
access to Europe through a
quicker system getting visas

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.770
or a visa-free--

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.100
And once all this was
sorted, maybe there

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.070
was going to be
a orderly program

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.889
to resettle some of the Syrian
refugees that had arrived back

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:52.120
into Europe once they determine
how that was going to--

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.760
Very few of those things
actually remained fulfilled.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.592
But that was what can
we do if we don't agree,

00:34:58.592 --> 00:34:59.800
and we don't want the people?

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.330
We just pass it back
to something else.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.110
Just push it out.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:11.640
By the way, that moment is
when we knew we were losing.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.270
We knew we had no traction.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.740
But that moment we knew
that there was no hope.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.540
We were meeting with
all those people.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.490
We had access to those people.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:25.800
We had a powerful campaign going
on with other organizations.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.260
We had media coverage,
everything we wanted with it.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.670
But we were getting no traction.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.985
The solution was not going
to come by rescuing people

00:35:34.985 --> 00:35:36.410
or providing better conditions.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.060
Europe, no.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.810
The solution was to
pass the buck outside.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:40.580
So at that moment we knew.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.500
This is lost, and
search and rescue

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.930
is on the way to being
terminated as well.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:47.430
Why?

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:51.760
Because if you want people
to really remain in Libya,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.490
you cannot have NGOs rescuing
people and bringing them

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.990
to Italy.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.730
There's no way
you can have that.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.600
So we knew we were an obstacle.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.260
What we said is keep going.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.610
There are two things we can go.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.109
We're not going to
stop voluntarily.

00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:07.290
Just keep going and let's
see if they stop us.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.890
And let's expand our
operations into Libya.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:10.830
And why Libya?

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.100
I'm going to tell you
this very quickly.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.480
We had been talking
to the people

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.880
we have rescued for
two years by then.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.940
And they were telling us about
horrible conditions in Libya.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.402
People were arbitrarily
retained, extorted for money.

00:36:23.402 --> 00:36:25.110
There were stories
about sexual violence.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.560
There were stories
about torture.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.440
There were stories about
overcrowded prisons.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.170
There were stories about the
appalling living conditions,

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.922
no proper water, no
food, no sanitation.

00:36:36.922 --> 00:36:38.880
So we had been discussing
this for a long time.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.840
Can we actually do
something about that?

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.670
And the same with sea, it
was like how do we do that?

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.990
There was no witnesses.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.360
Jordans didn't get visas
to enter into Libya.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.090
Only a few people had
managed to sneak in by then.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.730
And we said, OK, [INAUDIBLE]
are also not going there.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.460
Can we actually negotiate
access so they are involved.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.380
Let's negotiate with
the Libyan people

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.480
managing detention centers.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.350
Can we work there?

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.520
Why would they
allow us to do that?

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.850
So could we convince them that
we can go and serve a purpose?

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.000
Let's agree to be used to
improve detention conditions.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.700
Because we could do something
for the people of Libya.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.070
We could actually improve
food, improve water,

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.209
improve sanitation.

00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:23.750
But at the same
time, we're not going

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.249
to do it at the
price of not showing

00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:27.187
what's going on in there.

00:37:27.187 --> 00:37:29.520
So we wanted to really use
that presence to bear witness

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.640
with what was going on.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.334
And can we keep our team safe?

00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:34.750
When we are at
sea, you're at sea.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.360
But if in Libya, you get
kidnapped in two minutes.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.180
You get a death
threat, and you're out.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.000
You get one staff
killed and you're out.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.440
So that was a bit
of a trade off.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.480
Can we actually do this safely?

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.170
We decided to go with it and
with accepting that challenge.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:53.230
How do you actually
operate there

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:57.170
without being co-opted into
a white-washing exercise?

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:58.450
Now you are there.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.852
Yes, you can feed
people properly.

00:38:00.852 --> 00:38:02.810
You can give them proper
water, and say there's

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:03.847
your medical care.

00:38:03.847 --> 00:38:05.680
What are you going to
do when they bring you

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.920
the same person twice
with wounds that

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.479
are consistent with torture?

00:38:10.479 --> 00:38:11.770
Are you going to say something?

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.830
Or are you just going
to put a patch again?

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.020
So we started this very
difficult relationship

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.810
with the legal authorities,
but they allowed us to be in.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.880
And it was very,
very, very tense

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.540
and very difficult to
manage that operation.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:29.980
So we launched
this in June 2016.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.280
Just a few months
later or a year later,

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.640
the second group shot came
from the European leaders.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.580
They had managed to find a
deal again to pass the buck.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.980
Let's work with the Libyans
to make sure that people

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.960
don't depart from the shores.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.420
And Libya was much more
difficult than Turkey.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.920
You can't talk to
Erdogan in Turkey.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.890
Erdogan sort of controls
Turkey pretty well.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.940
In Libya, there are
different factions.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.520
It was much more
difficult to control that.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.420
And they had to--

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.920
how are you going to really
prevent people from going?

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.820
And what they said at that
point was this mixed discourse.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.500
Let me read it
because I get confused

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.240
when I read these things.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.198
"With hundreds already
having lost their lives,

00:39:11.198 --> 00:39:13.960
the EU is determined to
take additional measures

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.520
to reduce migratory flows."

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.330
So the notion is like let's make
sure that more lives are not

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.240
lost at sea.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.620
Let's keep them there.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.500
If they don't get on
boats, they don't drown.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.570
Right?

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.836
Pretty simple.

00:39:27.836 --> 00:39:30.105
Whose crisis are
we trying to solve?

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.810
So Europe under threats.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.220
That media-- that was the
total of the reporting by them.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.500
And who are those guys in there?

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.950
That's the EU funding and
training the Libyan Coast Guard

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.220
to intercept and return.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.006
So search and rescue came.

00:39:48.006 --> 00:39:49.630
The plan was let's
get rid of the NGOs.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.430
Hand it over to the
Libyans to make sure

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.230
that they search, they rescue.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:57.300
You see the caption there?

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.930
They are rescued
to be brought back.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:03.670
So it's an interception
and return operation.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.120
We knew our boats at sea
had very little time to go.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:12.390
We decided to, OK,
let's go all out.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:17.760
We had a report, let's go all
out accusing the EU of funding

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.230
torture in Libya.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.860
We did everything we could.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.490
I mean this is just one example.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.770
And we, of course, tried
to facilitate media

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.150
reporting as much as we could.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.816
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:27.816 --> 00:40:29.370
- At this detention
center in Surman,

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.310
an eerie silence prevails.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.980
Most of the 250 young
women here tried

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.440
to cross the Mediterranean
to reach Europe,

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.520
but they didn't make it.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.890
Cynthia from Nigeria
was in a boat that

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.061
was stopped by security forces.

00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:47.310
They brought her to this camp.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.010
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.840
- She says they
were caught at sea,

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.060
and their boat
came under gunfire,

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.980
and that it's God's
will that she survived.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.770
Cynthia was heavily
pregnant at the time.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.590
Today, she has to use the
detention center toilet

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.600
to change her baby's diapers.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.506
And she doesn't know if
the child will survive.

00:41:10.506 --> 00:41:12.100
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.400
- She says she can't nurse
her daughter because she's

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:19.470
been unable to produce any milk
since her daughter's birth.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.840
German diplomats have
compared the conditions

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.150
in many Libyan detention centers
to Nazi concentration camps.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.460
They've just gone public
with their report which

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.588
says the young women are often
beaten and raped by the staff.

00:41:34.588 --> 00:41:36.324
- There is no phone here.

00:41:36.324 --> 00:41:39.930
Since five months, I have not
spoken to my parents, nobody.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.753
We are just here.

00:41:42.753 --> 00:41:48.498
- What we are begging them for
[INAUDIBLE] That is all we need

00:41:48.498 --> 00:41:50.690
here.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.530
- The managing
staff in some camps

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.020
are even accused of
human trafficking.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.560
The camp director in
Surman disputes this.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.799
He accuses western countries
of ignoring the horror.

00:42:02.799 --> 00:42:06.010
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.680
- Reporters show the problems
and the poor conditions here,

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.330
but no one is stepping
up to help us.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.580
We're not getting any support.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.811
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:21.180
- The staff says medical
aid is urgently needed

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.950
at this detention center.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.110
But even if it's
delivered, no one

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.760
believes that will make
much of a difference.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.110
[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.040
- That was it.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.171
The game is very clear.

00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:34.670
Libya is saying,
just give us money.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:35.900
We'll detain people properly.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.720
We'll improve conditions.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.560
Today, you have
UNHCR working there.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.690
You have the IOM.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:46.310
That's how aid is being used
today to just prop this up.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.440
The question for me is
not whether to provide aid

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.070
there or not.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.800
The question is at what
price do you provide aid

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.700
and how critical
you remain for this?

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.685
And how do you
make that balance?

00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:01.160
And this is the last slide.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.870
I have two more minutes to go.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.280
Last couple of slides.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.220
So the last step was
very clear to everyone.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.870
Let's get rid of the NGOs.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:11.404
So it was a quick succession.

00:43:11.404 --> 00:43:13.320
There was a smear campaign
very, very quickly.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.780
It's like the
water taxis, it was

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.550
installed by Italian
politicians saying,

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.980
OK, these water taxis
are bringing the illegals

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:20.784
into Europe.

00:43:20.784 --> 00:43:22.200
They are colluding
with smugglers.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.660
You heard what the guys from
Defend Europe were doing.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.760
That really got traction.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:31.600
There were prosecutions
again to NGOs.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.860
They didn't prosecute us.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:39.100
But the smaller NGOs that had
been born for a single purpose,

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.300
to rescue people
at sea for this,

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.320
were really affected by both
the credibility issue of being

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.150
cooperating with smugglers.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:53.710
Their funding went like this,
and some of them disappeared.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.170
The rest had their
boats impounded at sea,

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:58.750
at Italian ports and
in Malta in Italy.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.332
Some of the boats
are still there.

00:44:00.332 --> 00:44:01.290
Some people prosecuted.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.632
Nobody has been
condemned for anything.

00:44:03.632 --> 00:44:04.840
There's very little evidence.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.089
There's been a massive effort.

00:44:06.089 --> 00:44:09.050
There's been intelligence
agents infiltrating

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.490
on some of the NGO boats.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.710
Even satellite eavesdropping
interception of calls.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.900
There's been a massive
intelligence effort

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.990
to just try to prosecute
the people that

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.921
were rescued at sea.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.360
Then intervention from
the Libyan Coast Guard.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.400
The instances of the
Libyan Coast Guard

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.160
coming and threatening
NGO boats on the radio,

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.310
opening fire on an
MSF boat or other.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:35.809
[INAUDIBLE] are well-documented.

00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:36.850
You can just Google them.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:37.850
They're all out there.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.740
We all denounced
this as it happened.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.680
The Libyan Coast Guard
got increasingly violent.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.830
And we all got a
letter-- all the NGOs

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.120
from their coordination
in Rome, saying, sorry,

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.740
we can no longer guarantee
your security at sea.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.020
So the message was clear.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.170
By the summer of 2018,
there was one boat.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:59.930
From the 10, we went
back to one boat.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.349
And that was our boat.

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:02.265
That was the Aquarius.

00:45:05.695 --> 00:45:07.070
The big boat in
the background is

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.250
the Aquarius, that orange boat.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:13.600
That was the last
boat standing by 2018.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.230
That's when Matteo Salvini gets
elected in Italy on this slogan

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.160
of stop the invasion.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.920
There's an invasion
taking place.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.820
Italians first.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:29.284
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Italians
first, stop the invasion.

00:45:29.284 --> 00:45:30.700
The succession for
this-- and this

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:35.520
is since I was leaving my
job and I came to Radcliffe,

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.670
all this happened
over the summer.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:41.910
You got June 2018,
we had rescued

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:45.490
629 people were not allowed
to dock in Italy anymore.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.520
The ship was adrift
at sea for a week

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.725
until we managed to get
an offer from Valencia.

00:45:50.725 --> 00:45:52.450
We had to go all
the way to Spain

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.420
to be able to disembark people.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.740
In August 2018,
again another rescue.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:04.050
We were not allowed to disembark
anywhere, not even in Valencia.

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:07.880
In August 2018, we were
sailing under a Gibraltar flag.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.030
Under the UK pressure, that
flag was stripped from the ship.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:13.970
So the ship was
without registration.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:14.850
We took three weeks.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.480
We registered again the boat
under the Panamanian flag,

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.200
the only country that
would give us a flag.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.170
In September, we did another
rescue, over 58 people

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:25.784
on board.

00:46:25.784 --> 00:46:27.450
They told us, you
cannot disembark here.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.870
You have to hand over people
to Libyan Coast Guard.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:31.520
We said, no way we're
going to do that.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.390
We keep people on board.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:33.890
We know where people
are going back.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.720
We cannot possibly do that.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.770
So our flag was stripped again.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:42.470
Italy put pressure on Panama,
and the second flag was--

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:44.290
the ship today
doesn't have a flag.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:46.840
There's a campaign
running to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.520
There is no state that
has been willing to put

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.610
a flag on that ship, so the
operation is virtually halted.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.690
The ship is on port.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.770
What Mary had said,
in three years

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:03.490
there were around 425
operations by MSF alone.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.626
77,000 people
assisted in our boats.

00:47:07.626 --> 00:47:10.880
Today, there are no search
and rescue boats in the Med.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:16.330
So far 2000 people have died
in the Med this year alone.

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.187
And of course arrivals
in Italy have reduced.

00:47:19.187 --> 00:47:21.020
They are probably being
taken back to Libya.

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:29.072
What does this is little
story mean for us?

00:47:29.072 --> 00:47:30.780
What does this story
of search and rescue

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.250
mean for us in the Med?

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.550
What does it say
about the way we

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.530
frame this crisis, how
we conceptualize it,

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.150
how we think of it?

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.460
There are a couple
of questions that I'm

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.418
exploring at Radcliffe.

00:47:46.418 --> 00:47:47.850
And this is very, very raw.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.257
There's no much
thinking about it.

00:47:50.257 --> 00:47:52.590
But these are the questions
that strike me as important.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.157
How do we frame this problem?

00:47:54.157 --> 00:47:55.240
How do we talk about this?

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.750
How do we talk about them?

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:02.430
We talk about them as
an undifferentiated mass

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.530
of people.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.050
We talk about them
as a natural disaster

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:11.580
that is about to strike us,
that it's a threat that we

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.440
need to defend ourselves from.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:20.910
How does this language that
we use to talk about them

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:24.300
allow us to dehumanize
people and strip them

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.680
from any attributes
that would actually

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.420
question what we are doing?

00:48:33.246 --> 00:48:34.870
I couldn't resist
putting this this big

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.560
because it's from this morning.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.567
With this crisis, not what
do we talk about them,

00:48:40.567 --> 00:48:41.650
what does it say about us?

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.840
That's much more
interesting, right?

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.770
What does it say about us, how
we're framing the immigration

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.090
problem?

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.170
When we other people--

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:53.490
when we define the other--
when a group of insiders

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:57.450
decides that the other is
the threat and the enemy.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:58.890
We know that trick, right?

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:00.990
We saw it throughout history.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.060
We don't need to be
lazy to think oh, what

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.310
about Germany 1930s?

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.630
We had the Jewish question.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.350
Now we have
immigration question.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:16.510
We don't need to go to how
Jim Crow's America defined

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.410
the Negro problem.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.310
That said, much more
as James Baldwin said,

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:28.520
that said much more about white
America and African-Americans.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:34.265
What does this say about
how we think about people

00:49:34.265 --> 00:49:37.250
and who we are today?

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.610
Here in Europe or in Australia.

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.770
This guy there is saying
we need a final solution

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.330
to the immigration problem--

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:47.660
to the Muslim
immigration problem.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.730
Then these people.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.520
Isn't it much more
dangerous this retreat

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:57.290
into ethnic nationalism,
tribalism, hate?

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:01.050
That kind of speech
makes Sweden great again.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.200
Isn't it much,
much more dangerous

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.510
than openness to the world?

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:13.980
How do we define a notion
of us that transcends

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.990
barbed wire, border
walls, ghettos,

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:21.500
and has a more egalitarian
and humanist aspiration?

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.130
Can we do that?

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.600
Shouldn't we try?

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.610
What are our values in
these turbulent times?

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.640
What are we doing?

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.770
Can we afford to be
indifferent and at what price?

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.270
Thank you for listening.

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:44.120
