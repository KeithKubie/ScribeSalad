00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:16.269
STUDENT: All right.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.255
STUDENT: Yup.

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:17.880
Here we go.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.379
STUDENT: OK.

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:18.920
You're going to play?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.503
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:20.500
I'm going to try.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.239
STUDENT: OK.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:23.822
STUDENT: Whoa.

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:23.941
Whoa.

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:24.061
Oh.

00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:25.269
STUDENT: So this is our game.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.680
[AUDIENCE OOHING AND AWING]

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.440
STUDENT: Gonna over time.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.000
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.500
OK.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.442
So we had a lot of stages
of development in this game,

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:36.000
just because we changed
our plans about 10 times.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.590
At first, I created this really
cool mountain texture that--

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.544
so yeah.

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:42.460
This mountain texture.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.860
But then we had to trouble with
it being diagonally oriented,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.735
so we had to restart.

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:47.710
What was kind of
interesting about this

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.790
is that we have
the trees actually

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.160
angled so that it looks
like you're going downhill.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.216
But really, you're on
a flat surface, which

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:58.878
makes it a lot easier to code.

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:01.298
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:07.106
We already talked a little
bit about the structure

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.580
for the trees.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580
Automatically, what
it sets it to is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.130
it goes around the entire
tree, including the branches.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
And so the big castle
is like basically

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.510
would occupy the entire forest,
so we had to manually narrow it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.880
down onto trees.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810
In the future, we
would like to have--

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.320
in the other version that we
had to scrap, there were coins.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.374
So you could-- they
were spinning kind of

00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:33.373
like the rollable coins.

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:37.507
And you could traverse
and try and collect them.

00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:40.409
In the future, we'd like to have
an actual person, instead of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.604
the cube.

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:43.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.120
STUDENT: Budget cuts.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.730
We can't risk real lives
on a mountain like this.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.007
STUDENT: No.

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:50.506
Yeah.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:52.120
It was really big.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.870
I don't know if how
many of your games

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.925
dealt with the terraforming
feature in Unity,

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:58.280
but it's so cool.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.960
You can mingle these mountains
to the right in 10 seconds.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.210
It's super easy.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.575
And it's very, very fun.

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:06.530
STUDENT: I want to see if I
can hit that invisible wall.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.860
Yeah.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.810
So there's this invisible
wall that keeps you

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.299
in the playing field on the
right side, which, I guess,

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.590
is kind of cheating, because
we didn't put trees there.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.090
But--

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.758
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:17.144
STUDENT: Well.

00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:17.643
Oh!

00:02:17.643 --> 00:02:18.480
There's a tree.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.930
[LAUGHTER]
