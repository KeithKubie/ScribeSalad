changing the spark this is such weird

00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339
changing the spark this is such weird
 

00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:04.700
changing the spark this is such weird
shit but like that odd a distinction to

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:04.710
shit but like that odd a distinction to
 

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:07.339
shit but like that odd a distinction to
make yeah it's funny too how many of

00:59:07.339 --> 00:59:07.349
make yeah it's funny too how many of
 

00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:10.670
make yeah it's funny too how many of
those things are like tied to a practice

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680
those things are like tied to a practice
 

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.180
those things are like tied to a practice
and they become symbolic but but but

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:14.190
and they become symbolic but but but
 

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.609
and they become symbolic but but but
their actual origin is not something
