00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:04.087
- [Voiceover] Which picture
divides a rectangle in half?

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:06.827
So to divide something in half we need to

00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:10.612
divide it into two equal sections.

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:13.027
Over here we're divided into two sections

00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:14.240
but these aren't equal.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.034
These don't have the same area.

00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:18.913
This part has a much
larger area than this one.

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:20.980
So this isn't divided in half.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.162
This one's also divided into two sections

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:24.300
but they're not equal.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.226
This one is much bigger than this one.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.478
This is divided into equal sections,

00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:30.917
but it's not two equal sections.

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:33.425
This is divided into three equal sections,

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:35.283
so this isn't divided in half.

00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:39.067
Here we're divided into
two equal sections.

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.553
One, two sections, and they

00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:43.456
are the same size, the same area.

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:44.965
So I'd pick that one.

00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:46.822
Let's keep going. This is a lot of fun.

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:49.771
Which picture divides
a circle into halves?

00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.791
Once again, two equal sections.

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.300
This one, this one, and this one divide

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.413
into three sections,
and actually these two

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:58.848
right over here, the three
sections aren't even equal.

00:00:58.848 --> 00:01:01.124
Then here, this is three equal sections

00:01:01.124 --> 00:01:03.538
but that would be thirds not halves.

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:06.069
Halves would be two equal sections,

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:09.134
so it'll be that, right over there.

00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:11.688
Which picture divides
a square into fourths

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:12.989
or sometimes people might say

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.946
divides a square into quarters.

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:19.474
Well fourths or quarters
would be four equal sections.

00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:21.110
Well this is two equal sections.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.036
This is one section,
this is just one whole.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:27.612
This is two equal
sections, right over here.

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:28.830
Or I guess you could say this one

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.583
actually is just not divided at all.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:34.112
This right over here
is two equal sections.

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:37.200
This is four equal sections,
so this is fourths,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.195
or you could say this is
divided into quarters.

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:41.612
Let's keep going.

00:01:41.612 --> 00:01:43.330
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.627
Which picture divides a circle in half?

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:48.624
So this circle isn't divided.

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:52.176
This is a circle divided into
thirds, three equal sections.

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:54.661
This is a circle divided into two pieces,

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.656
but they're not equal, so this
isn't divided into halves.

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:59.769
This is two equal
sections, right over here,

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:01.975
so that one is halves.

00:02:01.975 --> 00:02:03.832
Let's do one more.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:07.315
Which picture divides a
rectangle into halves?

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.242
Well, it has to be two equal sections.

00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:11.100
This is three equal sections.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.283
This is three not even equal sections.

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:16.069
This is three equal sections,
so this would be thirds,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.042
just as this one would be thirds.

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:20.550
This one over here is two equal sections,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.161
so that is halves.
