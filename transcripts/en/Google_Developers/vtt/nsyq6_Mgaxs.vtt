Kitagawa: One tip I have
is to use

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.667
and look
into the event preview.

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.701
So by registering
a event preview,

00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.334
you're able to register
a global listener

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:12.934
for all events that
are occurring in the browser.

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.767
This, um--events such as
mouse movements,

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:19.167
um, various mouse clicks,
left/right mouse button,

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.133
um, and scroll wheel events.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:26.167
Regardless of which widget
is in focus,

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:28.734
you're able to see
and register those events,

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:30.434
and then be able
to take action on it.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:31.934
So this is a way
that you could implement,

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:34.467
like, a global key listener
or something like that.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.667
So if you wanted to have
an application--

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.634
that control-S or something
does something--saves--

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:42.634
you're able
to do it using that.
