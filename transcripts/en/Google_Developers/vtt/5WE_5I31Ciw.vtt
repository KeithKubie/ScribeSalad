LAURENCE MORONEY:
Today I'm having

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.500
coffee with Ian Lake
from the Android team

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.050
to talk about what's new
in Android N for users

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.830
and developers.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.770
So, Ian, Android
N, I know you're

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.280
working on this, lots of new
stuff, lots of exciting stuff.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.370
Can you tell me all about it?

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.869
IAN LAKE: Yeah,
actually lot of good

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.210
features both for developers
and users in this release.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.130
But I have to say my
personal favorite has

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.640
to be multi-window.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.130
So here you'll be able to run
two apps kind of side-by-side.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.770
So you can imagine this being
great for phones, where you're

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.510
trying to read a
review while chatting

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.840
with someone about where
you want to go for dinner,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.340
or on a tablet, where
you're watching a video

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.790
and wanting to get through
your emails at the same time.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, I watch
a lot of videos on my tablet.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.120
But then I need
like another device.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970
IAN LAKE: Right, you
have a phone and tablet

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.062
at the same time, and
it's just much better

00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:50.270
to have it all on one device.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: And the
guy beside me on the plane

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.183
gets really annoyed.

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:54.060
IAN LAKE: I'm sure he'll
be much happier now.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
and Joanna put together

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.120
this DevByte talking about some
of the new developer features.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.900
IAN LAKE: Yeah, a
whole whirlwind tour

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.060
of kind of all what's
new in Android N.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, should
we take a look at the video?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.064
IAN LAKE: Yeah.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:04.830
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.600
-Welcome to What's New
in N-- not the real name.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.870
-But we can talk about all
of the new features added

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.510
in this version of Android.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.530
For example, Marshmallow
brought you Doze an App Standby.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.360
And now N is bring
you Doze again.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.667
But it's so much more.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:20.250
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.249
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
at the end of that video,

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.610
you spoke a little
bit about Doze

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.400
and how do those
works in Android N.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.200
Could you brief me a
little bit on that?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.570
IAN LAKE: Yeah, so it's a
lot of the expansion of what

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.630
we did in Marshmallow to
kind of save user's battery

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.130
life by kind of batching
things together.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.560
And N takes it to
the next level.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.260
Rather than trying to focus on
just be totally stationary case

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.670
on the table, now it's
whenever the screen is off,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.760
after a certain time,
we'll be saving battery

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.840
by chunking as much
as we can together.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.120
So hopefully it will be a huge
win for users, and actually

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.190
without any more
work from developers.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.390
The same things used for
Marshmallow, like high priority

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.892
GCM messages and stuff, will
actually still apply in N.

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:05.100
Should be an easy transition.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if I'm
just building things the way

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.740
that I had done for M,
I'm getting advantage

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.229
of all that nice new stuff.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.490
IAN LAKE: Good to go.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.530
Yeah, it'll be great.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.200
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, there's got

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.110
to be a lot of new
developer APIs in there.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.070
IAN LAKE: Yes.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.028
LAURENCE MORONEY: We
spoke earlier a little bit

00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:17.990
about the multi-screen.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.990
How does that work from
a developer perspective?

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.500
IAN LAKE: Yeah, a
lot of it, again,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.070
should be, if you've been
doing it right all along,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.530
it should just work.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.990
A lot of the things that
we've built into the resource

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.380
system on Android right
from the beginning actually

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.960
still work on Android
M. So if you're

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.770
supporting phones and
tablets right now, then,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.230
as your window gets resized,
then your app will just

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.520
continue to use kind of those
layouts you already have.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.380
We actually put out a blog
just the other day about

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.830
preparing for multi-window,
which has a lot of the things

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.990
you can already do right now,
before even needing Android N

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.460
APIs to really kind of
take it to the next level.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: So we've
spoken about windowing,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.220
and we've spoken about Doze
and some of the great things

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.969
that are available for
developers in that.

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.650
But I see there's lots
of great new notification

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.580
stuff in Android N. Can
you tell me about it?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.111
IAN LAKE: Yeah, we did both, a
whole kind of visual refresh,

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:11.110
try to make it a little
bit easier to figure out

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.700
who actually are sending
those notifications.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.910
But I think some of the
coolest new features

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.740
are kind of a direct reply,
where you actually, instead

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.850
of having to go app and hit the
button and type your reply in,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.420
now directly in the
notification you can reply.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.220
If it has a reply
button, then you'll

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.820
be able to type your reply,
hit send without actually

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.272
having to go into the app.

00:03:33.272 --> 00:03:34.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.730
IAN LAKE: In addition,
kind of the new bundling

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.660
notifications
together, so you can

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.820
imagine like you get 10 emails.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.440
And you really only need to
check two or three of them,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.660
or maybe you want to use direct
reply to reply to one of them.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.830
Now you can actually
expand that list out

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.190
and get individual
notifications in there,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.470
so you can swipe to dismiss just
individual ones or direct reply

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.470
to another one.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.000
IAN LAKE: Should
be really awesome.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.208
LAURENCE MORONEY: I actually
also like the new larger

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:01.167
UI that's on them.

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:03.500
Because a lot of times, for
me, when I get notifications

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.291
and I'm really interested
in notifications,

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.160
when I'm doing something
else, like driving,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.070
and with a larger UI,
it's a quick glance

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.780
at my phone to see
the notification,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.580
rather than maybe squinting
to see something small--

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.200
IAN LAKE: Yeah,
hopefully it will

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.980
be a lot easier to figure
out what apps are sending you

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.954
notifications, as well as kind
of who is actually sending you

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:19.870
a notification, right?

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.865
That's the hugest
part of notifications

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:23.382
is who it's actually
coming from.

00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:24.840
LAURENCE MORONEY:
If I want to look

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.030
at all these other
extra features

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.488
and start building for these,
where do I go to get started?

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:30.870
IAN LAKE: Yeah, so we actually
built a whole preview site

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.320
at
developer.android.com/previewm

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.120
as you might expect.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.900
And that goes through a kind
of all of the API overview

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.940
as well as some of the
behavior changes and how

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.990
to get everything setup.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.475
LAURENCE MORONEY: Should be
easy to remember that site.

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:45.350
OK, well thanks, Ian.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.290
I'm going to get
started right away.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.140
So lots of great new features
in Android N for you to enjoy

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.390
and lots of stuff if you're
a developer for you to get

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.889
started.

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.980
Take a look at the URLs
and the links below.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.250
We've also got all these
great videos on the Android

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.870
and Google Developers channels.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.650
Thank you.
