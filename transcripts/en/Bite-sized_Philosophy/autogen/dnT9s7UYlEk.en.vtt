fence and that's really something to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
fence and that's really something to
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.760
fence and that's really something to
that's really something to think about

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
that's really something to think about
 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.230
that's really something to think about
and it's also something I believe to be

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
and it's also something I believe to be
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.449
and it's also something I believe to be
true because I see that stasis is

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459
true because I see that stasis is
 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.760
true because I see that stasis is
utterly destructive because there's no

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
utterly destructive because there's no
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.290
utterly destructive because there's no
progress all there is is movement

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
progress all there is is movement
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.890
progress all there is is movement
backwards there's aging

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
backwards there's aging
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.020
backwards there's aging
and suffering and no progress and so did

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030
and suffering and no progress and so did
 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.479

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000
all transgressions to commit means to
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.640
all transgressions to commit means to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650
put your body and soul into something to
 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.589
put your body and soul into something to
offer your life as a sacrifice means

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599
offer your life as a sacrifice means
 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.970
offer your life as a sacrifice means
that you're willing to make a bargain

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980
that you're willing to make a bargain
 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.309
that you're willing to make a bargain
with fate and the bargain is I'm going

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319
with fate and the bargain is I'm going
 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.280
with fate and the bargain is I'm going
to act as if I give it my all

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
to act as if I give it my all
 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.619
to act as if I give it my all
then the best possible thing will happen

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629
then the best possible thing will happen
 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.550
then the best possible thing will happen
because of that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
because of that
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.729
because of that
and to to not see the analogy between

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739
and to to not see the analogy between
 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.880
and to to not see the analogy between
that and the the active faith in God is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890
that and the the active faith in God is
 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.410
that and the the active faith in God is
to misunderstand the story completely

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420
to misunderstand the story completely
 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.050
to misunderstand the story completely
and it has to be an active faith because

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060
and it has to be an active faith because
 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.319
and it has to be an active faith because
how are you going to know you can look

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329
how are you going to know you can look
 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.119
how are you going to know you can look
at other people but that isn't going to

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129
at other people but that isn't going to
 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.339
at other people but that isn't going to
do it it's at Kierkegaard was very clear

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349
do it it's at Kierkegaard was very clear
 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.569
do it it's at Kierkegaard was very clear
about this sort of thing there's certain

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579
about this sort of thing there's certain
 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.920
about this sort of thing there's certain
sorts of truths that you can only learn

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
sorts of truths that you can only learn
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.170
sorts of truths that you can only learn
for yourself through experience and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180
for yourself through experience and
 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.729
for yourself through experience and
that's of course why Abram also has to

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739
that's of course why Abram also has to
 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.440
that's of course why Abram also has to
go out alone right he has to leave this

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450
go out alone right he has to leave this
 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.839
go out alone right he has to leave this
kenneth's it's an individual it's the

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849
kenneth's it's an individual it's the
 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.020
kenneth's it's an individual it's the
individuation process like dying it's

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030
individuation process like dying it's
 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.000
individuation process like dying it's
something that you do alone there's no

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
something that you do alone there's no
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.069
something that you do alone there's no
way you can tell what is within your

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079
way you can tell what is within your
 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.199
way you can tell what is within your
grasp let's say unless you make the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209
grasp let's say unless you make the
 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.929
grasp let's say unless you make the
ultimate sacrifice and there's no way of

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939
ultimate sacrifice and there's no way of
 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.429
ultimate sacrifice and there's no way of
finding out without actually making it

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439
finding out without actually making it
 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.220
finding out without actually making it
and so that's the sacrificial act right

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230
and so that's the sacrificial act right
 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.740
and so that's the sacrificial act right
that's that's really active Abram being

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750
that's that's really active Abram being
 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.720
that's that's really active Abram being
called upon to sacrifice Isaac you think

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730
called upon to sacrifice Isaac you think
 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.729
called upon to sacrifice Isaac you think
about that is Abram he's been doing he's

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739
about that is Abram he's been doing he's
 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.189
about that is Abram he's been doing he's
been like breaking himself into pieces

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199
been like breaking himself into pieces
 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.860
been like breaking himself into pieces
trying to progress forward to starvation

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870
trying to progress forward to starvation
 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.199
trying to progress forward to starvation
and tyranny and war and deceit and the

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209
and tyranny and war and deceit and the
 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.970
and tyranny and war and deceit and the
potential loss of his wife and child

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980
potential loss of his wife and child
 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.890
potential loss of his wife and child
lessness and like everything that can

really befall you in some sense and
 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.270
really befall you in some sense and
finally God grant some Isaac when he's

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280
finally God grant some Isaac when he's
 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.219
finally God grant some Isaac when he's
old it's impossible he gets Isaac his
