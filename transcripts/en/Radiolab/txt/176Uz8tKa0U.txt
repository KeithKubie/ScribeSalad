Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Radiolab on Jad Abumrad. A couple days ago, Joe Frank passed away one of the greats in our business. Huge inspiration for me. But a guy whose work you may not know, he was one of the originals. Nobody told stories like Joe Frank, nobody tells stories like Joe Frank, no one. He, he is still anyhow, you know what I'm gonna do. I want to take this podcast to play for you a little bit of his work cause it's so good. It's so good. And also play for you. A few conversations I've had recently about Joe Frank and the impact of that work starting with, um, a conversation I had with Brooke Gladstone from on the media. She recently interviewed me about, uh, the impact that show had on radio lab, which is significant. So let's start there. This is an excerpt of a conversation that I had with Brooke Gladstone that they use for on the media. And I believe it starts with a clip. Hey, let me play a clip or maybe a couple of them get your reaction

Speaker 2:          01:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:12          when you hug people goodbye after a social event, perhaps a dinner party or a gallery opening, there was always that moment when they squeeze you more forcefully than before. A polite way of letting you know they are about to withdraw. Usually the one who disengages first is the one who cares less. When this used to happen to me, I felt rejected and humiliated. I'd come home with a lonely, sick feeling and that's why in order to assume the power position and gain the psychological advantage, I now hug people very briefly, perhaps one or two seconds before freeing myself. Sometimes if I detect any resistance, I'll push the person away. In one instance, I caused a woman to fall backwards over a chair injuring her back, which led to her hospitalization, but I have no choice. It was a matter of self preservation. That is classic Joe Frey. It's really, really

Speaker 1:          02:22          good writing. You know, he writes these like scenarios. They're like demented talk of the towns in the way, like they're just these little fragments of dark experience, which are beautifully realized. Very vivid, kind of funny, but kind of also troubling. How do you think he influenced you? Because you are always a great producer, always technically adept. You had tons of musical composition training, you understood the rhythmic possibilities of radio. What did he do that you don't think you could've done without him? It's a lot of different things. This was way at the beginning for me when radio lab was just a three hour thing on the am station one back, how far we're going back to the stone age. So January, February, 2002 somewhere around there. Really at the beginning. And everybody here who knows the beginning of radio lab knows that I didn't deserve that show.

Speaker 1:          03:19          It was just too soon. And I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't have a style. I had this, I had the like unfortunate thing that we all had back in 2002 is that I would just want it to be IRA glass. Everybody wanted to be hourglass. Right? And I was still trying to figure out like, okay, so who am I? What do I want my stuff to sound like? And so I would every Sunday night I'd have to put it three hours. And it was an anthology show at that point. And it was literally take the best documentaries from the BBC, the CBC in Canada, the ABC in Australia, radio, Netherlands, all the stuff and packaged them into three continuous hours. And I would sort of narrate in and out of different segments. And so from eight to 11 I'd be playing my show and I was bored hopping at the time, which means I wasn't just making the thing, but I had to sit at the board, hit play on the CD, and then between hour one an hour to an hour to an hour three, I would have to say the weather, right?

Speaker 1:          04:12          So I was doing the whole thing and after me, Joe Frank would come on and he was part of my shift. And every time I'd just be like, what the F is this stuff? I would just be sitting there listening to him and just like amazed and like mentally taking notes, being like, oh, this guy has a feel and a, there's a surreality and a disorienting newness to his stuff that I just just really fascinated by and I was like, oh, I want to, I want to do that. Can we play that one that we said that we can't play?

Speaker 3:          04:49          [inaudible] there was a time when I danced on a street corner dressed as a chicken. My job was to draw attention to a furniture store down the block. One evening when my shift was over still wearing my chicken outfit, I walked into a bar across the street. I ordered a Bombay Martini, straight up olives on the side. A prostitute sat down next to me. She was young Willoway at a far away look in her eyes. Her name was Meredith. We talked about our careers, the importance of networking, setting goals, focus. Then I excused myself, walked into the men's room, entered a stall and sat down on the toilet and had a bowel movement. The broken tube and half of it was still hanging out of me. So I had to wipe myself 50 times repeatedly checking to see if there was more left on the toilet paper and written on the wall with the words, know that someone is suffering anonymously and unknown and that by the time you read this,

Speaker 1:          05:58          I'll be dead. Oh, that's good. That's really good. Wow. There's nothing wrong with playing that clip. Actually. He's not using any bad words. True. I mean, there's no FCC violations there and it's simply growth. And yet you tell me that there was this person on the planet too that hasn't, Joe Frank always had the quality of like he's coming from inside your head out and then back in again. He has that kind of quality, which it sounds like he's somehow like the voice in your head, but broadcast back into your head. Um, I, there's something about that quality, which like I, that's what I want from the radio. It's what I want from podcast. I want someone to be speaking from inside me in a way. Have you ever talked about Joe Frank too? I give this talk 30 40 times a year where I have like an extended Joe Frank excerpt.

Speaker 1:          06:58          I have an image of Joe Frank that I show a, yeah, all the time. The vast majority of our listeners of the people listening to this, I'm going to have to assume they never heard of Joe Frank and he was always available on podcast, but he was like this mystery to people who weren't willing to sort of follow the breadcrumbs to him. You know, I'll tell you, I mean when I give this talk that I, that I often give and I go through the series of people who've influenced me. I'll always ask any Joe Frank fans in the house, these will be like audiences, but 2020 500 people and like one time someone clapped. One time I remember like there was a clap in the far right and I was like, oh my God, a Joe Frank Fan. It always broke my heart a little bit because no one ever knew his stuff. Like amongst us, our little sort of posse radio people. He's a legend, but nobody on the outside ever knew him. You know, this is going to be their chance. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          08:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:06          last night I dreamt I was lost on an elevator. All the floors were the same. Then I realized the elevator was moving horizontally, so I tried another elevator, but the express, but it just got me more lost faster. People kept getting on and getting off. They were all wearing green galls over their heads and we're smoking ice cream cones. I said, please let me off of 39th street, and the conductor said, this is 35th street. You'll have to walk three blocks and take the escalator. But when I got to the escalator, it was just a phone booth. So I made a call. I called my father, I said hello and lost on 39th street looking for an escalator and I can't find it anywhere. And he said, I'll be right there and there he wants. And the phone booth started moving forward very slowly with my father and I in it. And I didn't know where it was going or why. And he said, don't be afraid. This phone booth will take us home. And I said, but we have no home. And he said, we live on the eighth floor apartment. Why? And I said, why? And he said, yes.

Speaker 4:          09:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:44          that was a condensed version of a conversation I had with Brooke Gladstone for on the media. You can find the full conversation on the media.org.

Speaker 4:          09:55          Okay,

Speaker 1:          09:56          well return with one more Joe Frank recollection in just a moment.

Speaker 1:          13:20          I'm jet I boom Rod, this is radio lab a. We're paying tribute to Joe Frank in this podcast. Joe Unfortunately lost a battle with colon cancer just a few days ago after my conversation with Brooke Gladstone from on the media. Um, I ended up having later that same day another conversation about Joe Frank, this time with IRA glass from this American life. Hello. Hey. How's it going, man? It's going okay. It's good. Okay. We can do better line reading. There were two entirely different. Okay. It's just done for the purposes of this conversation I'm doing. I'm doing just all right. Hey, did you know Joe Frank? No, I had one interaction with Joe Frank, which was, um, it was almost perfectly Joe Frank in that, uh, I met him once at third coast and he, I asked him something and he looked at me for a long time and then just walked away without speaking. And that was my one Joe Frank interaction.

Speaker 1:          14:20          So do you remember what you asked him? I think I might have said something utterly like not my place cause I had just started the show and I was like, Hey, if you have any work that you want to like, you know, get on, get on the show, let me know. And he just looked at me like you have the goal and just walked away. And so that was it. Yeah. Yeah. That's showed you. So what do you remember about him? I'm curious like what, what you saw, cause you, you worked with him, right? Yeah. Basically when I was, when I was 20, uh,

Speaker 8:          14:52          I had my first paid job at MPR and I was the production assistant to this guy whose job it was to invent new ways to, to do radio for NPR. And he had a regular show and he would do different things in different weeks and, and he brought Joe Frank down from New York and that was the thing we were doing for awhile. And I was Joe's production assistant as my very first paid job at NPR. And I had never heard them on the radio. I mean, he wasn't like, you know, on national radio. So, um, they have like a few various specific memories for sure. And um, the best way I can explain it is like, um, I've had the experience a number of times over the years where people tried to tell me like, oh, the first time I heard your show was this. And generally the thing they're trying to say to me is like, I didn't know that the radio could do that.

Speaker 8:          15:41          You know what I mean? Like I didn't realize it. Like, oh, radio could be like, tell a story like that. No, it feel like this. And I myself had that exact experience. And the person who I had it with was Joe Frank. And um, and I remember there was a day early on and I was standing in the old control room at MPRs original studios. Like the original two studios they had, there was a studio one studio two on the first floor of 2020 m street and we were in studio two and I was standing by the reel to reel tape machine, you know, the Bank of them. And I remember Joe was telling one of his stories and I remember feeling like, Oh, I've never, I've never heard this before. I just remember feeling like, like this, like this thing, like I, and, and, and, and it just sorta like to feel like totally caught up in a story and you don't exactly know why you're so caught up with it and you don't know where it's going and, uh, and you just want to stay with it in the sound of his voice. He's such like an incredible radio performer, like much better than you or me. You know what I mean? Like do you remember what the story was that you were listening to? I don't remember which specific story it was. I do remember I have gone back because there was one story in particular called the elevator.

Speaker 9:          16:57          Then in fact, I've gone and dug up that I remember at the time I thought like, this is it. This sums up the whole thing and literally what it is, I'm riding up the elevator of my building is he gets on an elevator. I'm standing there sharing the small space with a terrific looking girl. He totally gets a crush on this woman, but I feel shy, uncomfortable. I scratch my head, I sigh, I gaze up at the numbers of the floors, lighting up one after another and he starts to imagine their life together at everything that they will be. He seems like the kind of person I really like and he cannot bring himself to stand there silently, not looking at each other, say a word to her, and so he pulls out something from his pocket. I reach into my pocket and draw out a scrap of paper, which I unfold.

Speaker 9:          17:50          It turns out to be a cash register tape from the A and P, but I scrutinize it as if it's very important before putting it back in my pocket. That's a detail of the stray I remember seeming so real. It has a guy very magnetic forward motion and it's like four or five minutes long and the entire thing happens in the elevator and he would always just describing the floors going up and all the feelings he has. You go through your life looking and looking, and sometimes you see her though the woman you might've loved with, who might've loved you at a bus stop. You know, in a museum across a smoky room, at a party in the lobby of a theater online at the supermarket in an elevator. When she leaves in a panic, you want to run after her calling out, stop. Stop. It's me. The person you were meant for. Don't you recognize me? Don't I look familiar? I may seem like a stranger, but I'm the person you've been waiting for the one in your dreams, but you just stand there and watch her leave. This happens to me with a different woman about once each day. And I remember

Speaker 8:          19:07          when I was 20 hearing that and being like, this is it. This, this guy is doing a thing. Like I want to know, I want to know how you do this. Yes. For me the equivalent thing was have you heard his rent? A family trilogy? No. God, I'd be hard pressed to, to summarize the story, but it's essentially it's this whole world in which families can be rented. Uh, for occasions. Well, I saw this ad

Speaker 9:          19:34          and Annie said,

Speaker 6:          19:36          rent a family. We have certain um, package programs where an individual can experience over the course of a 12 month period. A pretty considerable range of, of families. Hi. Hi Christa. It's your father from the agency come here. And it's all like in his very documentary format and it's done really well. So you actually sometimes like aren't totally sure that what you're hearing is a drama. It sounds super real. We kind of deny that the society is, is, seems to be speeding up before our very eyes. The whole idea of renting things, it has to do with the people's desire to not have a permanent commitment to them. I think it's important to recognize the depth of loneliness that, uh, must be addressed to you and I, and in the end it

Speaker 8:          20:29          doesn't resolve at all. You'll just left with like 12 different feelings that you don't even know what to do with. I mean, I think in a way like that's, that's what he represents. You're like thrown in the middle of the action and it's gritty and you don't understand. It's kind of dark and it's not all going to get resolved. All the answers aren't going to be given to you and you're going to have like weird feelings. You don't know what to do with. And often it's going to overreach and it's not even going to work. But it was still kind of cool. You know, like all of that is completely content. It's completely seventies film turned into radio. So what is it that you think you took with you from Joe Frank and put into this American life? I mean, there are a couple of things.

Speaker 8:          21:05          Honestly, the first thing is just what he gave me the most important thing, which was desire to do it. You know what I mean? Like hearing him made me want to make stories and then I spent over a decade trying to figure out how to do it with facts and with reporting. The thing that started me with that ambition was him. So that's one thing. A second thing is I'm just, the way he would use music and the way that the music would pull the story forward and create a mood, but also kind of like push you into the dream of it. The notion that you'd use music as a kind of cinematic scoring, which is not the way, you know, music would be used in old time radio dramas and certainly not the way music was being used on anything on NPR. And, um, the way he uses music is so built into me that a couple of years after this American life was on the air, Joe was already living out in California, had been for years and still doing his show.

Speaker 8:          21:54          And uh, like mutual friends let me know like Joe is so angry with you. And I was like, why is Joe so angry with me? You know what I mean? Cause he was my like, he was like, why is he so angry? And then it turned out that Joe thought that I was listening to his show and stealing the music. Oh yeah. And then got in touch with him and he's just like, it's so petty. He said, this is so petty. You could be choosing any music and you're listening to my show. He's like, it takes me so long to find decent music and I edited so carefully, you know, it's such a part of the identity of the show and that you just listen to my show and rip me off, like do a little work brother. And I was like, Joe, it's so much worse than that.

Speaker 8:          22:35          Like the fact, it's like I haven't had your show in years. I haven't heard it. I'm so sorry. And what happened is I just learned how to use music from you. And so when Pat Mathenia comes out with a new record, I hear the same track you do and hear the same possibility in it. And I just do the same thing because like it's so built into who I am. So in a way like I am totally stealing from you, but I swear I didn't know it. No. Did you ever, did you ever like land that in a good place with him? He was fine at the end of it, I think. I think it was just something about the, it was just, it seems so like, it seems so small to him, you know what I mean? Like what, you're listening to my showing, you're stealing my music. Like what, what's the matter with you? You know what I mean? Just seem cheap. Yeah. So there was that. And um, what else carries forward from him? I mean, I mean it's, it's

Speaker 8:          23:29          honestly there's a thing or two that he does that I have never figured out how to imitate that in the back of my mind I still feel like I'm going to steal that. And one of them is this thing that came up last week. I was talking to Parker, one of the, like the younger producers here and she was talking about a thing she wanted to do and kind of a moment she really loves and she used to be a film professor and is like a super cinematic thing. She was shooting for us. Like, you know what, you should really listen to this Guy Joe Frank at, you never heard of him. And I downloaded last week I bought and downloaded a the 80 yard run. Which have you heard that one? No, no one I haven't heard. Oh my God, it's a super early one. In fact, I think it's just an air check of one of his WBAI broadcast before he was national. I think it's an actual live radio show. I'm done late at night and it's just him and a microphone with music. And he's telling this story of what he keeps referring to as,

Speaker 10:         24:16          because I like to call it my infamous 80 yard run is a rather twisted, convoluted tale.

Speaker 8:          24:21          Now, before I get to the full story of my ADR run,

Speaker 10:         24:24          I hope that you will bear with me.

Speaker 8:          24:26          There's a few things you need to know first. And the first thing you need to know is about this fight

Speaker 10:         24:29          between Luis Rodriguez and Ruben, Hurricane Carter.

Speaker 8:          24:34          You know, it's, there's a lot of that. And then he tells you like a series of professional fights that happened over the years and tells them so well

Speaker 10:         24:42          he absorbed an awesome, terrible beating, standing propped up unconscious.

Speaker 8:          24:49          And then there comes a point where he's like, you're like six or eight minutes into the thing and he says, um, but before I can tell you that part of the story you need to in this next thing. And I will tell you that

Speaker 10:         24:58          after a brief interlude during which I will drink some tea

Speaker 4:          25:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          25:06          and they're like, what are you, like the music comes up and then he just leaves. And I was like, oh my God. And like I've spent 30 years trying to figure out how to steal that. You want to have a team moment. I don't even know how to do it. I honestly, I honestly,

Speaker 1:          25:26          I don't know man. I mean, I mean like, like I'm going to figure it out, but first I'm going to go make myself some tea.

Speaker 4:          25:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:41          that's IRA glass from this American life thanks to him. Thanks also to brook class, tune from on the media and to Sarah, Cari, and Kelly prime of the more perfect crew who produced this tribute. Also a very special thanks to Michael Story. If you want to hear excerpts of Joe Frank's work, which I would highly recommend, go to Joe frank.com his entire archive is there. We'll also link you to it from radiolab.org and one of the things that you will hear, I think if you listen and Ira and I talked about this, is that even though he's a guy who has inspired so many of us to get into the business of telling stories, nobody sounds like him still

Speaker 8:          26:18          because it's completely impossible to imitate you into the hundreds of thousands of podcasts that are happening now. There's nobody doing anything as

Speaker 1:          26:27          um,

Speaker 8:          26:29          caring and competent at the same time. Yeah. Like literally like it's so singular, you can't really imitate it very well. And I'm personally not one who, who believes that matters. Like if your work lives on past you, you know what I mean? Like I feel like fuck people in the future, you know what I mean? Like these are radio shows, you know, like, like they meant to be enjoyed, like, you know, like right now. And then like if no one ever listens to them again after we're gone. Like, well, fuck them. Anyway, like walking around and being alive while we're dead. First of all, fuck all those people being alive and having sandwiches and meeting for lunch while we're dead and not existing. Like I hate them already. They can fuck themselves. Um, but it seems if it seems sad that, that, that, that other people like won't know this weird thing that I know is so special, you know, like, he's so outpacing everybody. Even now, even now, there's like this army of people making podcasts and trying to invent something that's like nobody else is doing. He still is. He still has outpaced every single one of them from the grave. That's a perfect place to end. Okay. Bye. Bye.
