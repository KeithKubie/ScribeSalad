To summarize all this, sometimes you need a means to precisely express exactly

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.630
what the functionality of a required system is. There are a variety of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.720
formal languages, and accompanying tools exist for writing such specification.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.970
Many of these are industrial strength. That means they're used in industry, and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.550

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.090
rework, resulting from misunderstood requirements
