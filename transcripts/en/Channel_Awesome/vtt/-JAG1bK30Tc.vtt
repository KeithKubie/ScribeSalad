00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.010
Ra ra ra you need to have a CG animated movie about toys written by next week ra

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.119
Oh man, how am I gonna make a movie about talking toys any good?

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.120
MUSE

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.180
I've got it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.320
Bla blah blah. I want a cinematic Lego commercial written by tomorrow morning!

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.360
How am I going to make a giant ad for building blocks good?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.940
MUSE

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.420
Got it!

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.880
Ba blah ba blah! I want an Angry Birds Movie written by the end of the day. SLAM!

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.960
MUSE

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.780
It's Angry Birds

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.740
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to. Who says there can't be good video game movies

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.380
Goddamn Angry Birds does

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.400
Based on the hit game from 2009 Angry Birds was a phenomenon that practically took over the world

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.029
Everybody loved its simple premise easy gameplay and quirky style

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.229
So, of course Sony leaped at the opportunity to make a film at the height of its popularity nine years later. Yeah nine years

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.509
What took them so long? Were they actually waiting for this to get nostalgic to cash in on it or hey?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.559
Maybe they just really wanted to get it right before unleashing their cinematic opus

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.059
well judging by what we got Angry Birds probably spent as much time on its story as

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.590
Well Angry Birds

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.470
It's remarkably lazy in so many ways but apparently was still a big hit

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.919
even warranting a friggin sequel why because to quote friedrich nietzsche god is dead and you killed him.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.850
With Angry Birds we never knew what he meant by that last part, but now we do

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.160
Despite it making a ton of cash

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.829
There are so many critics and audience members that just hated this movie ever since it was announced

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.469
I had people asking me to review it and ever since it came out

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.529
I had even more people asking me to review it sadly. It's both popular enough and bad enough to warrant attention

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.048
Let's take a look at what these bird brains came up with. This is Angry Birds the movie

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.289
So we start off this barrel of fresh ideas with the incredibly original opening of somebody running late

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.890
well

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.589
If this fresh new idea worked in Back to the Future, Green Lantern, Lilo &amp; Stitch, Girl who Leapt through Time Big Fat Liar Buffy

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.380
The Vampire Slayer, Alice in Wonderland, Tommy Boy, The Cat Returns, Spider Man 2, Brazil, Four  Weddings and a Funeral, Gremlins, Mulan, and an anime trope

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.040
So well known there's countless images of people running late with toast in their mouths. Why not one more?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.380
This is Red played by Jason Sudeikis who's on his way to be a clown at a birthday party

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.460
Like I said, he arrives late... or does he? I'm not late look at the time see the order said before noon

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.500
Ok. Now you're late

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.900
You missed the party. So wait they said arrive before noon it's noon and the party's over

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.380
Let me look at the script

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.290
Oh wait, I'm sorry. These are the studio notes

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.970
I tried to keep my body between the ground and the box, but well

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.970
I think I got a little bruised see anything back there

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.119
Hmm don't know which one of these to go with

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.239
Why not both?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.230
Red finally loses his temper and smashes the cake into the parents face gluten-free cake. What the heck  is gluten?

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.230
I mean does gluten even exist?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.279
What? But he slips on a squirrel destroying the egg behind him? Congratulations?

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
It's a boy

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.909
Um, did we just witness a murder? What's his clown name? Pigeonwise?

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.839
As the credits roll we see Red has some anger issues as it confusingly cuts back and forth between him being a child and him

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.490
Being an adult with literally no segue or reason. I didn't even notice it the first time

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.889
I know that doesn't sound like much but it's not like it's showing him growing up establishing who he is it just kind of

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.759
Randomly cuts to him as a kid. We just cut to him as an adult then a kid then an adult then him being born

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.150
What the hell's the flow of conciousness here?

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.719
In fact, the whole intro seems out of sequence

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.450
It says the title then it says the studios present then it cuts two random points in his life in no particular order

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.730
Like I said ending with him being born and then it cuts back to him with the family

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.460
He visited absolutely none of it ties together

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.839
It's literally random scenes in random order. It makes no sense. And that was my review of Angry Birds

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.290
Oh, I'm sorry

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.569
Did my sloppy half-ass editing confuse you?

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.059
Well, if someone can make 352 million dollars off of it, I might as well exploit it while skipping the tough parts too

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.949
The parents take red to trial because he was the first thing their child saw being hatched

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.700
Oh, by the way

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.799
You want to hear the weak-ass reason why they use slingshots in this movie instead of just flying why don't birds fly

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.470
I'm gonna tell you why where else would we ever want to go?

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.310
Not a good joke

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.960
One of the many lines I don't think was in the script and was just the actors talking without knowing the microphone was on

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.770
This terrifying star of your nightmares tonight is a judge that sentences red to anger management, but red reveals

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.199
The judge is just two birds to make him seem taller

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.359
What does this have to do with anything going on even with the judge ignoring that reveal? Mr. Red given the severity of the crimes

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.360
Look! The mime talked! Oh my god

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.739
We set him up for about two seconds So this punchline really pays off

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.650
Hey compared to the time they put in for the other jokes. Two seconds is long

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:37.309
Anger management class. pluck my life. He means the f-word kids

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.530
Nope oh

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.390
I just let that pause because I know you're laughing so hard at the idea of a bird not giving another bird a hug

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.930
What you're not laughing at that? Well, you should it's

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.829
Repeated all throughout the movie. I don't even think I really understood it the first time but the movie is tiny

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.850
It's funny over and over so I should leave the appropriate amount of space for laughter

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.909
Is it too late to get that creepy girl from hereditary in this?

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.760
It's been a while since something unfunny happened actually. No it hasn't but here's another one anyway

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.239
He's attacking a sign he doesn't like I

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.350
Guess this could be humorous if anybody acted like they cared about anything

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.970
That's probably the biggest problem. I get throughout this entire film. Look at this slapstick, there's energy but no creativity to it

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.379
Look at these expressions, they're big but nothing clever is being done with them heron

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:46.580
Pigeon even the performances particularly from our lead all sound like they just took the first take and never asked for another it sounds

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.299
Unbelievably like autopilot. Okay, I guess that's art that's

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.890
garbage and

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.720
that's

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.100
exotic

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.100
Everybody feels like they're just doing the bare minimum

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:05.179
Sometimes not even that Maya Rudolf plays the same smiling weirdo. She always does Josh GAD plays the same hyper dummy

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.970
He always does and I don't really remember what character Danny McBride

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:13.459
Usually has which is fitting because I don't really remember what character he's supposed to have here either. I guess he just blows

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.059
What are you doing down there? exactly what you think I'm doing down here

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.100
Believe it or not

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.350
There is an actual funny moment when they reveal why everybody is there at anger management and one of them is so bad

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.390
They can't even say it out loud

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.410
Tarrance seems to have had an

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.180
incident

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.250
We never find out what he did. It's left entirely to the imagination

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:51.080
And what makes this even funnier Sean Penn plays this part and what makes this even funnier is he never says a word?

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.390
He just groans

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.059
How the hell did we get a joke that works on three different levels

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.739
In a movie where the jokes don't even work on one level. Was there just a day

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.620
where really good writers were brought in for like two seconds

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.080
Okay, you're the finest writers in Hollywood. We need some really good jokes for our movie

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.289
Oh, we already wrote one while you were talking. Oh, I guess that's why you're the best in town

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.729
What is this movie called by the way Angry Bird? You're already gone, aren't you? Yeah

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.210
Well, at least we got one joke out of it. Mmm back to our usual writer

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.899
It's a pleasure watching you work . Gonna need some Mexican food to do the sequel

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.719
Tell us your story Bomb. Well, sometimes when I get upset I literally blow up

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.480
Okay, I explode like a bomb

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.860
Yeah, remember that level in Angry Birds where they just sat around and did therapy

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.550
They were trying new ideas. Like what Mario did in fact that might actually be a Mario game

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.140
Do it!

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.889
No can do I just went boom-boom before class. poop!

00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:03.508
The other birds want to hang out with red, but he gives them the cold shoulder. Um

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:09.839
Busy, too. You're not good at this buddy. It's charming up to a point and now it's just sad again

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.839
I'm pretty sure he was just talking about the script

00:10:12.129 --> 00:10:14.309
Let's do that. Incredible hug joke again

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
No means no

00:10:18.129 --> 00:10:24.059
You know, there's running jokes and then there's yeah I'm definitely gonna be there for the marathon yeah, I'm definitely gonna train so hard

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.469
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna show my support. Yeah, I'm definitely gonna be there. Eh, I'll just donate to the cause

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:30.819
jokes

00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:34.829
Give him credit at least this random cut to his childhood includes bad exposition

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:41.279
When's Mighty Eagle gonna come back? Didn't your parents ever tell you Mighty Eagle isn't real? He doesn't have parents

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.969
They were killed in the great Disney genocide of dramatic convenience

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.339
But troubles on the literal horizon as a ship full of pigs arrives destroying Reds house

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:56.159
Well more damages the side of it because destroying the whole thing would be funnier and Lord knows we can't have that in the movie

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.779
Greetings. we saw your Island across the sea and we thought

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:07.349
Wonder what they're up to these things look like the minions banged whatever animal died to give us green eggs and ham

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.720
Except we had the luxury of that meat being dead

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.289
There's no other place besides here. We call it

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:16.138
Piggie island. Oh my god

00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:20.819
You know this movie would be half the length if they didn't keep repeating the same goddamn jokes

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:26.938
What did you run out of the bad hugging jokes? Uh, no, you still slipped in that gem again. Oh that relatable

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:30.389
Nobody wants to hug me humor. In the industry we call that the Iggy Pop

00:11:31.089 --> 00:11:36.359
The birds welcome the pigs but red doesn't trust them because they destroyed his house at least

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.509
That's how it's supposed to come across but obviously it sounds more like he has some deep-seated racism with other cultures

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:43.680
They don't have feather

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:51.020
Our king sends his warmest regards. King? out of the friendship between the pigs and the birds start. who cares

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.880
Hey look! They destroy more of the stuff we worked hard to build. Hey if you got the night off

00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:01.919
Why don't you fix my house? Well their religion better not be different from ours. Everyone knows there's just one. Gotcha, man

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.920
your friends the pigs proudly give you the

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:12.960
slingshot we present to you a flimsy pretext to make a game not meant to be a movie seemed like it was meant to be

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.460
A movie don't worry by the end. You'll all see this as a weapon of mass destruction

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:19.889
So Red sneaks into the pigs boat and finds?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.980
little green men from Toy Story

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.320
OOOOH!

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.340
By the way, why do I get the feeling this book on the pigs boat is just a variation of this I

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.480
Snuck on to their boat. He confronts the pigs about their being even more of them as well as the strange devices

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.709
He doesn't recognize any questions

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.350
Nobody needs that in their lives

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.480
(whispers) Nobody needs that in their lives

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:52.820
My cousins are simple folk watch ABC

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Nothing see nothing

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:03.840
Wow that was amazing. Amazing you could literally put anything there and it would have gotten the laugh but you decided to go with nothing so you get nothing

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.980
Literally any joke could have worked there watch ABC

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.940
Thor

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.100
ABC cabbage

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.100
ABC John Cena!

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:19.199
Okay, maybe not anything

00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:21.599
The leader says his cousins weren't smart

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.219
So he wanted to be sure it was a safe place before he revealed them the birds believed him and everybody

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:31.619
Celebrates with not the worst Pig jokes ever written but what the hell am I  comparing it to yeah

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:34.949
These are the worst pick jokes ever written. It was Pig Latin. piggyback rides. Instaham!

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.249
Somebody needs to be punished and with sharp things

00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:44.068
Speaking of pig puns. I think I can come up with a few more after this disturbingly confusing subtext

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:49.649
That's how our children are born you guys don't lay eggs? I wish we did

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:52.649
Enchante!

00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:01.380
Yeah, how about piga file bigger ass better ham bacon generate hog deviant Stein offender

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.630
I could think of more but I don't want to think of this in general. The pigs are actually intending to eat them

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.700
Shame on you!

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:16.919
But nobody seems to catch on to that except for red who everybody continues to mock.Continue the tour!

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.039
That went well if you're me

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.870
Dummy

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:29.940
Whoa, I mean, wow, I couldn't write a line like that. I mean that's ingenious. How long did it  take them to put that together

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.799
Look  that's like the greatest insult since much other bucks. You fart Ghost of Don Rickles. I think we found your replacement

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.069
So Red gets an idea to find Mighty Eagle so he can stop the pigs evil plan

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.090
Right before a confusing out-of-nowhere fantasy. The other birds have about him

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.620
Mighty Eagle!

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.200
Peek a boo!

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:17.410
Josh GAD I never thought I'd say this, but you're really getting typecast as kids films characters who need to come out of the closet

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.340
while climbing mountains imagining what the Eagles battlecry is

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:27.850
Like they thankfully cast aside the obnoxious annoying writing and just dive directly into obnoxious annoying sounds

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.429
What would a Mighty Eagle battle cry sound like?

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.579
Why torture your intellect when mere ear bleeding is more than enough

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:59.470
You paid  to see this folks could have used that money to buy a collection of barn animals barking themselves to death

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:05.049
But instead you went for this to their credit both of these sound very similar, but there's some joy to this

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.919
They get to where the Eagle lives and they decide to swim in his pool

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:09.880
and again

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.970
we partake in a

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:17.470
fascinatingly botched joke. two of them take a long time swimming in the pool in slo-mo only to have the Eagle come out and

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.470
Take his daily piss on it

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:36.230
Okay, so bad enough they hold uncomfortably long on this piss taking only geniuses steal from norm of the north

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:42.920
But if this joke was gonna work and that's a big goddamn if they should have shown them in the pool while he was pissing

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.569
And red tries to warn them about what's going on. Then the slow-mo would make sense

00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:51.409
We would want it to go slower to soak up. So to speak the humor of the situation

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:59.928
Here, it's just slow-mo for no reason dragging out what isn't set up properly yet again every joke seems weirdly

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:03.889
Backwards I keep expecting to see one of them in a flower shop saying, that's me

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:10.940
But that couldn't happen because that film actually made me laugh the Eagle voice by Peter Dinklage spots the birds and chats with them

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.080
You have passed the first test!

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.640
You have drank my piss

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.819
It's a weird test

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:22.369
So they go inside his cave and find a warped mirror. Hey, hey, they look like the game

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:26.689
That'd be funny if they didn't already do that. Throw that in the pile of other shitty repeated jokes

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:32.089
But if repetition to the point of self-decapitation is your game. Don't worry they give themselves a dance party

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.569
The fourth one in this movie so far

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.000
Yeah, you know how most animated films nowadays end with a dance party to sell a soundtrack?

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.449
They made a whole goddamn movie about it. Okay?

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:52.340
Okay, maybe I'm jumping the gun just because you have 4 dance party sequences in your movie doesn't necessarily mean it's lame or manipulative

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.939
Five on the other hand. Oh, yeah right after they find out the Eagles too. Lazy to help him

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.120
They go back to interrupt another dance party going on

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.780
The 5th Freakin one!

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.770
I don't think "Dirty Dancing" had this much dancing in it and I ironically feel as dirty watching it

00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:15.379
So the pigs take all the eggs while distracting them with their fifth dance party and sail back to their Island

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:22.039
So Red, through shitty writing and unfunny jokes I mean why break the norm here tries to inspire everybody to go after him

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:28.159
They stole our kids. I mean, who does that have you ever stolen anyone's children? Have you?

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.239
I mean you look like you would you know, this running gags already not funny

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.240
Don't maybe think about seeing him on To Catch a Predator

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.380
So they build a ship to chase after the pigs who are back on their Island celebrating

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.720
Snouts up!

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.240
Man, it's a snout staircase! Who thinks of that?

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:54.300
Nobody because it's not clever or funny or worth mentioning. Did anybody turn in a second draft?

00:18:55.030 --> 00:19:00.599
The birds get to the island and try to figure out a way to attack and you can all guess where this is going. Oh

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.979
Jesus that'd be awesome now, they start launching themselves like in the game

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:14.310
Funny. they took a long time establishing the bomb bird's ability to blow up and even create a character arc for him

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.429
But the first time we find out about this birds weird power is... well how about that. My teacher can shoot fireballs out of her butt

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:29.310
How'd that song go from the Rankin/Bass version of Return of the King it's so easy not to try

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.910
How did that not make it on to the soundtrack

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.570
Well, I guess it's a little less obvious than hog topic let's just agree though everybody's in pain somehow

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.959
Gee, I wonder if the mimes gonna say oh my god. It's

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.480
Oh my goooood!

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:58.199
it's like they say.  If at first you don't succeed this isn't funny! Red, Chuck and Bomb make it into the castle where they come across

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.460
Red! Rum!

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.700
Never mind

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.380
Uh...

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.400
People that happened we let it happen. We must never let it happen again

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.260
Join me in thinking of ways of preventing that from happening in the future

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.669
Chuck rips off the Quicksilver scene from x-men that x-men would later rip off themselves themselves as they get closer to the eggs

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:23.340
everyone fights in a climax that is so desperate and so banking on your kids low attention span that it's

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.440
Actually hard to find a shot that is over two seconds long I shit

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:34.049
You not watch these scenes uncut and see if any of them. Hold on a shot for more than two seconds

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.560
My eggs!

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.120
Don't forget Chuck and Bomb!

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.620
Who?

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.580
Those guys!

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.660
Uh oh!

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.900
No

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.960
Think explosive thoughts!

00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:58.269
The whole climax is like this folks freaking scary

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:04.028
Christ fast editing is fine, but you need a variety to care look at two towers

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:06.939
It had fast editing but it also knew to give sweeping shots

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.539
And moments focusing on characters taking in what's going on?

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.080
Because they like you audience and they want to give you something good

00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:19.778
this clearly just wants to wave its keys at the low attention span it thinks you have and wants to

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:26.110
Encourage you to keep I think this films actually worse than binge drinking because you lose more brain cells and vomit at a greater level

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.480
So the eagle comes in to save the eggs leaving it to Red and King Pig to fight

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.240
This is dynamite

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.180
It's so easy not to try

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:46.760
But he  outsmarts the pig blowing up the kingdom as everyone gets their seemingly smaller pile of eggs back Jesus

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.860
How many did they lose? That pile

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.800
Was a lot bigger before Angry Birds got dark one family seems to be missing theirs though

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.940
But red comes in with the final one, I think these belong to you. Oh, oh

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:04.869
We can only afford to raise two we'll have to eat one of them. Oh look he's blushing

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.710
I'm not blushing. I'm just red

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.430
That was the big cheering and laughing line

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:20.429
Feel like you could have put pretty much anything there. "we're corporate shills in Hollywood's playground"

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.170
I bet The Emoji Movie is looking pretty good right now

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.980
That's too much, man!

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.460
Let's see if this ever got funny

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:44.028
Well, it's not quite the genius of King Koopa ordering a pizza, but it still disappoints

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:50.090
Red makes it look like he still doesn't want to hang out with Chuck and Bomb but tells them he was just kidding guys

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:56.389
I'm just messing with you get in here. I can't end this movie without sharing the blame with others

00:22:57.269 --> 00:23:01.489
Jeez, with all the dance party sequences I'm surprised it didn't end on one...ah! here we go

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.940
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.780
Oh, trust me I Will Survive is the perfect musical choice for this film this was

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.880
unbearable

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:19.100
It it doesn't even feel done. A lot of bad comedies just tell jokes that don't work

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.709
This just tells sentences that don't work

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:27.980
It's hard to remember in recent memory a film this lazily written lazily acted and lazily

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.760
Directed nothing feels unique. Nothing feels passionate nothing feels earned

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.379
It comes across as rushed awkward and just not caring

00:23:36.379 --> 00:23:37.129
I mean

00:23:37.129 --> 00:23:43.039
I know every movie takes a lot of time and effort to make which is why it's a shame when a film is so bad

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.730
None of that comes across

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:50.179
I'm sure a lot of work and time did go into making this but it never comes across in the viewing experience

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.319
It just feels like one long incredibly unentertaining

00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:58.309
Commercial if you want to play the games that makes sense help

00:23:58.309 --> 00:24:01.189
Mostly you'll probably playing the game while watching this damn movie

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:07.580
But if you want to check out this obnoxious piece of bird shit on its own I say fly away as fast as possible

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.300
I'm the Nostalgia Critic and you know, where's a muse when you need one?

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.300
I am back from the dead to inspire once more

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.620
Oh good. I was just talking about the Angry Birds movie.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.360
I shouldn't have remembered it so she didn't have to

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:50.060
Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.660
Wow about that, my teacher can shoot fireballs out of her butt

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.830
Hey Doug Walker here doing the charity shout out now. I'm not repeating the same charity

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:44.720
Uh, but this charity does also have a connection to Red Nose Day. It is comic relief

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:52.640
Both comic relief USA and their sister organization comic relief a UK share a vision of a world free from poverty

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.850
Driving positive change through the power of entertainment

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:02.779
They make grants to charity partners that support people living in poverty in America and in some of the poorest communities in the world

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.630
Since they first set up shop in 1985

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:11.839
They've been doing three main things raising millions through two big fundraising campaigns Red Nose Day in sports relief

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.130
Spending that money in the best way possible

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.149
To tackle the root causes of poverty and social injustice

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:22.010
And using the power of that brand to raise awareness of the issues that need the most

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.949
Attention if you look at their site in their YouTube channel

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:31.610
you can see all the good people as well as celebrities who have come together to raise awareness of the good you can do and

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.580
usually in the most memorable of ways check them out and see how you can donate to a cause that can bring a smile to

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.980
anyone's face
