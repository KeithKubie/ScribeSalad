I never put him

when I come home,

where I haven't

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.579

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.155

who's a pitcher
for the Detroit Tigers.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.793
Yeah, he's not--he's not here.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.162
Um...

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.664
The Tigers were in town
playing the Royals.

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:40.766
And, uh, they had a night off.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.503
So Justin and I went out
for some drinks.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.071
While we were out, he said,

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.839
hey, man, I think I know that
girl over there.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.508
I think she's an actress.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.443
I'm pretty sure
my girlfriend and I saw her

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:51.911
in a movie last month.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:54.147
I should go get
my picture taken with her,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.282
send it to my girlfriend.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.285
I said, hey, man,
we're in Kansas City.

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:02.822
No fucking way
that chick's an actress.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.627
He said, nah, man.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.162
He calls the waiter over.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.464
He said,
who's the chick over there?

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.766
He goes, man,
I don't know who the chick is,

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.936
but everyone at that table is
with Mumford &amp; Sons.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.106
They're here playing
the arena tomorrow night.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.175
And they're here having dinner.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.511
Justin says,
well, send them a bottle on us.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.314
Meaning him, right?

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.716
I'm not paying for that shit,
okay?

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.453
A: Not a huge
Mumford &amp; Sons fan.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:37.223
B: When I hang out
with super rich people,

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.625
I don't pay for shit, okay?

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:43.396
Sorry, you fly private.
You're buying my shit.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.397
All right?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.998
If he pays for my shit,

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.067
it doesn't even show up
on his register.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.204
If I pay for my shit,
I can't buy shoes next month,

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.374
and I'm gonna be pissed.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.678

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.047
They come over
to say thank you.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.016
Turns out,
it's not Mumford &amp; Sons.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.186
It's just "&amp; Sons."
All right?

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.023
I don't know where Mumford was,
but he wasn't there.

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.259
I assume he was back
at the hotel

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:15.394
writing a song that at
some point goes,

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:17.730
[vocalizes]
"Ah-ah--ah."

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:22.568
So, "&amp; Sons" come over.

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:25.204
Start talking to
the Detroit Tigers.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:29.175
I'm not really involved,
so I kinda tune it out.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.744
When I come back into focus,

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:37.016
Ampersand Sons are talking shit
to the Detroit Tigers

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.884
about beer pong.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.353
Like they're like, hey, we'll
whoop your ass

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.787
at some beer pong.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.422
And the Detroit Tigers
are like,

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:47.493
we get paid very handsomely
to put balls places...

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.467
Fuckin' bring it.

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:56.936
So I said, hey, fellas.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.705
My parents live about
eight minutes from here.

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.574
We could settle this.

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.644
And I said that
because I know full well

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:08.214
that both "&amp; Sons"
and the Detroit Tigers

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:11.984
have a complete foyer
at both of their hotels

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:14.587
where they can do whatever
the fuck they wanna do.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.223
So there's no reason to come
to my parents' house.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:22.762
It was complete,
fake hospitality.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:25.131
Until they turned around
and said, fuck yeah!

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:28.668
Let's go to your parents' house
to play beer pong.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.737
Aw, shit!

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.273
It's 1:30 on a Sunday night,

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:36.442
technically Monday morning.

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:39.979
My parents aren't Gypsies,
all right?

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:43.983
They got real jobs,
with real responsibilities

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:47.353
that start in about four hours.

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:49.955
But I also can't look
at these dudes, and be like,

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:54.694
you guys, my parents.

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:58.497
So I just said, fuck it.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.033
Let's roll the dice,
and see what happens.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.435
So we start leaving.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.503
About the time
we're heading out,

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:06.839
my sister texts me,
and says,

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:08.974
hey, I'm out and about.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:12.712
If you get home before I do,
will you walk my dog?

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:13.879
And I said, hey,

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:15.348
unless you're out and about

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.817
with the goddamned
Dave Matthews Band,

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.785
you better get your ass home,

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:24.857
'cause shit's about to go down
at Ma and Pa's house.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:32.631
So we roll into my parents'
house, like 12 deep

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:37.870
and start throwing beer pong,
and shit got weird.

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:40.506
Like, weirder than
I've already described.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:46.078
Like, my sister, who's 30,
ended up in her prom dress.

00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.013
Like--I don't know.

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:49.648
I don't know how that happened.

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:52.651
God bless her for still being
able to fit in it.

00:05:52.684 --> 00:05:56.322
But also, the fuck, right?

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:58.458
So...

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.361
At one point in the evening,

00:06:02.394 --> 00:06:05.698
I decided I needed to step out
and smoke some weed.

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:09.168
"&amp; Sons" come with me.

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.370
But since it was
the middle of the season,

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:14.273
the Detroit Tigers
could not partake,

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:18.411
so they had to pretend like it
was the playoffs, and watch.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:19.712
[crowd groans and laughs]

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.214

00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:25.585
Thank you.

00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:30.890
So we come back in
from smoking weed.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:34.059
My dad's downstairs,
and he's pissed.

00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:35.961
Apparently,
while we were outside,

00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:39.732
we got a little loud,
woken Mom and Dad up.

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:42.368
So, I walk inside.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.603
Dad's like,
the fuck's going on?

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:47.473
I said, hey, Dad, uh--

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:52.077
That's "&amp; Sons,"
of Mumford &amp; Sons.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.448
And this is half
the Detroit Tigers' bullpen.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.818
And we're playing beer pong.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.254
And it was in this moment that
I realized that my dad

00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:06.492
was not incredibly sure
if he was actually awake.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.265

in the middle of the night,

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:16.735
sees a bunch of weird dudes
that he kinda recognizes,

00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:18.938
and my sister's
in her prom dress.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.439
All right?

00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:22.675
Shit's weird.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.811
Dad's obviously befuddled.
He's just like:

fuckin' Justin Verlander?

00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:33.786
Yes, sir, it is.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.289
And he just went,
ah--whatever.

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:39.291
And he just
went back upstairs.

00:07:39.324 --> 00:07:42.294
And that was the last
we saw of him.

00:07:42.327 --> 00:07:43.863
The whole next day
I'm freaking out.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:47.833
He's at work.
I obviously slept in.

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:50.636
My parents have done
a lot for me over time.

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:52.004
I can't be fucking up
like this.

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:53.472
So I gotta make amends.

00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:55.608
So, I'm like, I'm gonna
take him out to dinner.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.009
I'm gonna buy him drinks.

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:58.944
I'm gonna do good by him.

00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:00.713
But then Dad walks in the door

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:03.782
like he's had the greatest day
of his goddamned life.

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:05.284
He walks in like,
[imitates door slamming open]

00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:06.852
What's up, everybody?

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:09.121
How are you doing?
How are you doing?

[imitates laser gunshot]
All right.

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:16.128
I looked and I go,
the hell happened to you today?

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:19.331
He said, I fucking hated you
this morning.

00:08:19.364 --> 00:08:21.066
I woke up on four hours' sleep.

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:23.869
And I cursed your name
all the way to work.

00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:27.339
But then I got to work,
and we had our morning meeting.

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:28.807
And everyone started asking me

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.410
why I looked
so tired and exhausted,

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:33.479
and I started bitching
about my kids
