00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.420
Opera, that's a good one.
That's good. It was opera,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.850
yes. What opera? No, it wasn't
Wagner, but that's a good guess.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.280
It's certainly a reasonable style,
way over the top. That was Maria

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.710
Callas singing La Mamma Morta from
Andrea Chenier,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.140
which was written in 1895,
and premiered in the spring of 1896

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.570
exactly at the time when the world
was going nuts over this mysterious

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:10.606
form of radiation that can see
inside the human body.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:01:02.660
So, I thought that was a good match.
The thing's best in class. That's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.330
Maria Callas. This is opera for
those of you who don't like opera.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.990
This, by the way, some of you may
recognize if you saw the movie

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.660
Philadelphia. This is the piece
that's playing when the Tom Hanks

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.330
character visits the loft,
or excuse me, the Denzel Washington

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:40.126
character visits the loft of the Tom
Hanks character.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:31.090
And this is playing.
It's a fantastic piece,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.180
way over the top. And this is Maria
Callas who is the woman that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.270
restored melodrama to opera.
It's fantastic. So go and listen

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.360
to it. Enjoy it.
And, there's Bertha Roentgen's hand,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.450
reminding us of the fact that you
always irradiate the one

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.730
you love. [LAUGHTER]
All right, so I have a few

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.190
announcements.
Next week, a week from today,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.660
there will be no lecture, instead,
celebration of learning.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.130
Celebration number two,
Wednesday the 27th, coverage through

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.590
today's lecture.
We'll go through the generation of

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.060
x-rays but we won't touch anything
to do with the use of x-rays and

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.530
indexing crystals,
Bragg's law, any of that stuff.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:36.593
So, anything we talk about today I
think is fair game.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:23.900
And, we'll go back to the early part.
So, I think last time we said up

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:43.133
until the 22nd.
So, I'm going to say the 22nd is

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.700
fair game. We started talking about
the properties of ionic compounds

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.600
and electron transfer,
octet stability. So, we'll go

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.500
through all of these.
We've covered a fair bit of ground,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.400
and will end with x-ray spectra, but
not Bragg's Law.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.300
OK, second thing I want to remind
people that I had a staff meeting

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.200
yesterday, and many of my recitation
instructors said that some of you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.100
are puzzled to learn that there's
more than one book,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.000
that the text is, in fact,
three volumes.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:03:02.850
And right now,
the x-ray readings are coming from

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.710
this volume here called the course
supplement. So,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.560
you need to be aware of that,
and also some of the best material

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.420
is in the archive notes on the Web,
and also all of these images that I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.280
show, they get posted as well.
So, some of you are feverishly

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.140
taking notes. And that's good,
but if you miss something, you can

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:40.813
go and take it off the
website as well.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Last point that came out of the
staff meeting last night,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
a number of people are becoming
tardy about taking the weekly

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
quizzes. You are allowed to miss
the weekly quiz for either health

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
reasons or some crisis in the family,
but not because she just decided to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
sleep in or you decided you'd like
to take it at a later time.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, I'm giving the TAs discretion
to deny you the right to take a make

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:53.680
up unless it's proper.
I'm not asking that you come with a

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.050
medical certificate or anything;
we'll take you on your honor.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.420
But I do expect you to take those
tests when they're offered.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.780
If you can't, take it on the day,
you can take a makeup up to one week.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.150
After that, we want to close the
books on it. And,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.520
we're not going to allow you,
as is the practice in other classes,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.890
to throw away your bottom two or
three scores. If you don't take

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.260
them, you'll get zeros,
and that gets averaged in to your

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.620
homework grade.
I want you to have the discipline

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:40.306
of weekly homework and weekly
homework quizzes.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, I know that recitation
instructors are announcing this,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but I want you all to hear it from
me as well. It's good for your

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
mental health to take those tests,
you know? It keeps you sharp. So,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
last day we talked about Roentgen
and the discovery of x-rays.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Roentgen was working in this
laboratory studying gas discharge

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
tubes. And, his special take was
high-voltage and low pressure.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:59.270
And, under these circumstances,
he was generating, unbeknownst to

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.540
him until the night of November 8,
1895, photons of wavelength

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.810
approximately one angstrom.
And, we looked at the relevant

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.080
physics and concluded that we could
explain the generation of x-rays by

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.360
this energy level diagram,
which is the energy level diagram of

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.460
the target.
This is the anode.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.380
Remember the gas discharge tube has
a cathode, which is charged

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.300
negatively? And,
electrons are made to boil off the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.220
cathode, accelerate from rest,
and they crash into the anode over

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.150
here. And, we think when these
electrons crash into the anode,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.070
they cause a set of operations that
ultimately result in the admission

00:05:50.070 --> 00:06:07.940
of photons in the x region
of the spectrum.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So, this is the energy levels of the
element here in the target.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And, we reasoned that these
incident electrons coming with

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
kinetic energy imparted by
acceleration voltages in the range

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of tens of thousands of volts have
enough energy to come in and

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
actually dislodge inner shell
electrons. And,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in the extreme, N equals one,
K shell electrons.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:28.620
And when that happens,
there's vacancies that invite a

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.240
cascade. So, we have a cascade of
electrons in the anode target from

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.870
higher levels down to lower levels.
And, as you know, going back to the

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.490
early part of 3.
91 when electrons move from

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.120
high-energy to low energy,
photons are emitted. And these

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.740
photons are the source of the x-rays.
These are the x-rays here.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.370
So, we saw that if we had a vacancy
in the k shell,

00:06:50.370 --> 00:07:10.606
we could get electrons moving from L
shell down to K shell.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:58.830
And, such a photon was termed a K
alpha photon, K because the photon

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.660
came from an electron cascade into
the K shell, alpha because it came

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.490
from one shell above K.
There's a slight chance that the

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.330
electron may fall from N equals
three down to N equals one.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.160
That's a greater energy difference.
And, we will get a K photon, but K

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:37.853
beta, K beta indicating that the
photon fell to K from two levels up.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:26.370
And, even just to complete the
picture, I put K gamma.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.740
Well, if there is vacancies in the
K shell, if we have enough energy to

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.120
dislodge electrons from K shell,
we certainly have enough energy to

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.490
dislodge electrons from L shell.
Vacancy here would invite a cascade

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.870
from N equals three to N equals two.
This would be L alpha because L is

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.240
the destination shell,
alpha meaning you came from one

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.620
shell above. And,
in the event that you fall from two

00:07:46.620 --> 00:08:06.440
shells above, N equals four
down to N equals two.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
This will be an L beta photon,
and thus was the way we left it last

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
day. And, the last thing was that
the instant energy values here,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and therefore, the instant
wavelengths are determined by the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
chemical identity of the target.
If I change the composition of the

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
target, I have a different internal
energy structure,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and I'll get a different set of
emissions.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:24.280
So, that's what was left at the end
of last day. So,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.560
now the question is,
is there a quantitative relationship

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.850
between any of this,
specifically, is there a

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.140
quantitative relationship between
the chemical identity of the target

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.420
and any of these wavelengths that
are observed? And the answer is yes.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.710
And for that,
we go back to Manchester and the

00:08:45.710 --> 00:09:05.620
person of a young graduate student
at the name of Henry Moseley.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:54.930
He was a graduate student working
under Rutherford in 1913,

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.860
1914. And, he was conducting a
study, what we call a systematic

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.790
study. For those of you who intend
to become graduate students,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.730
I want to let you know this is a
very dangerous word.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.660
What systematic means,
it's polite talk for tons and tons

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.590
of measurements,
systematic. His systematic study

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.530
was to take the x-ray generator and
change the chemical identity

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.700
of the target.
And, he conducted a study of no

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:48.233
fewer than 38 elements,
systematically changing the chemical

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.500
identity of the target,
and measuring the spectrum,

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:45.900
the emission spectrum for 38
elements. He started as low as

00:09:45.900 --> 00:10:04.433
aluminum and went all the way up to
gold, stopping 38 places

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:56.380
along the way.
And, he measured the wavelengths of

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.150
these x-rays, and he found a pattern.
What he found was that as the

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.920
molecular weight or as the atomics,
and we are just dealing with

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.680
elements, as the atomic weight rose,
the wavelengths fell. So, I'm

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.450
comparing apples and apples.
So, let's compare all of the K

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.220
alpha lines. So,
the lambda, K alpha,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:39.173
would fall as the heavier and
heavier elements were used.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:29.360
And, here is the plate from one of
his papers. This is a beautiful

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.720
piece of work.
These are the photographic plates

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.090
along the lines of the Balmer series,
only this is from the x region of

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.450
the spectrum. So,
here's calcium, titanium,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.810
vanadium, chromium, manganese,
iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.820
brass.
Here's where he's going.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.460
There's calcium; didn't have
scandium. It was too rare,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.110
and still to this day, very,
very expensive. So, now he's moving

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.760
across the transition metals.
He gets to copper, and he can't use

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.400
zinc for reasons I'm going to show
you very shortly,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.050
namely that the energy in that tube
is so high that he's going to melt

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.700
the zinc. So,
he says instead I'll use brass which

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.350
is an alloy of copper and zinc.
And, so this is the data from his

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:35.966
study. And, so here's the first
page of the paper.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:24.790
"The author intends to make a
general survey of the principal

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.590
types of high-frequency radiation,
examine the spectra of the few

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.390
elements in greater detail.
The results already obtained show

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.190
that such data have an important
bearing of the question on the

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.990
internal structure of the atom and
further support the views of

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.790
Rutherford and of Bohr.
This is what he's putting up here

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:53.590
for us. And, what I want to show is
that when he took his results this

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:58.660
is what he found.
He tried to get a better

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.990
functionality of this relationship
between wavelengths and atomic

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:09.330
weights. And here's what he found
worked best. He found that if he

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:14.660
plotted not the wavelength but the
wave number, which we've seen before,

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:32.386
the wave number as a function
of proton number.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:25.070
And, in fact, the square of the
proton number he got a linear

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:30.150
relationship. So,
and let's just say this would be L

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.220
alpha, L beta,
K alpha, K beta.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.300
Let's say you are at copper.
So, copper would be 29 squared.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.380
So, he would get data for the L
alpha line of copper,

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.460
the L beta line of copper,
K alpha line of copper, K beta line

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.140
of copper.
He might not get all four lines for

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.420
every element,
that he would take sets of data and

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.710
plot them out.
And he found that if he plotted the

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.990
reciprocal of the wavelength versus
the square of the proton number,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.280
the points lay on a line. So, over
here would be aluminum,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.570
and over here would be gold.
And, this was extremely important.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.850
This changed so much because look
at what he's able to conclude here.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.230
Let's read his paper here.
"We have here a proof that there is

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.690
in the atom a fundamental quantity
which increases by regular steps as

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.150
we pass from one element to the next.
This quantity can only be the

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.610
charge on the central positive
nucleus of the existence of which we

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.070
have already definite proof.
And, remember, when Mendeleev

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.530
enunciated the law of periodicity,
he said that the properties of the

00:13:47.530 --> 00:14:05.993
elements are a function
of the atomic weight.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And, people were perplexed by the
fact that potassium is less massive

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
than argon. But no one would put
argon under sodium.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
When Mendeleev's law is that you
arrange things by atomic mass.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Cobalt and nickel are reversed.
What to do? Here's Moseley. "We

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
are therefore led by experiment to
view that N, his capital N is what

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
we call proton number,
is the same as the number of the

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
place occupied by the element in the
periodic system."

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
"This atomic number,
he's coining the term.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
"This atomic number is then for
hydrogen one, for helium two,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
for lithium three, for calcium 20,
for zinc 30, etc. We can

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
confidently predict that in a few
cases in which the order of the

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
atomic weights A clashes with the
atomic order of the periodic system,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
the chemical properties are governed
by N, while A itself,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
probably a complicated function of N.
This is brilliant.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:59.830
This is a graduate student in 1913
correcting Mendeleev.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.660
So, what are the implications?
What are the implications? So,

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.490
this proton number, we're not going
to give it its due.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.330
We are going to call it Z,
the atomic number. This is the

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.160
Social Security number of every atom,
the atomic number.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:37.053
So, what's the significance of this
paper?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:29.590
First of all, corrected Mendeleev,
not to say that Mendeleev was bad.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:35.190
Mendeleev was brilliant in what he
did. But there were a few things

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:40.790
that Mendeleev couldn't account for.
So, now we know in the post-Moseley

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:46.390
world, that periodicity,
that is, the periodic variation in

00:15:46.390 --> 00:16:03.646
properties is not a function
of atomic mass.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:57.450
It's no longer a function of atomic
mass as per Mendeleev,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.900
but rather a function of the atomic
number. OK, and this now resolves

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.360
the problems with argon,
potassium; cobalt, nickel; tellurium,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.810
iodine, these three were known.
These three were known. And,

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:19.270
Mendeleev kept saying go and measure
them again. The atomic

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:37.540
masses are wrong.
And, he was right in certain

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
instances. They did find a number
of incorrect values.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But these weren't among that group.
And lastly, a pair that they

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
wouldn't have known: uranium and
neptunium are in the wrong order.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
All right, so you say, OK, well
that's cute. But let me show you

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
something else.
By understanding that the atomic

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
number is the critical factor in
determining where something belongs

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
in the periodic table,
he was able to place the lanthanides.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:56.300
If you look on the periodic tables
from the early part of the 20th

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.610
century, they don't know where to
put the lanthanides.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.920
They are trivalent, so they tend to
put them under aluminum,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.230
maybe under scandium. But they
don't know what to do with them.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.530
So, with this, he was able to place
the lanthanides,

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.840
and more importantly,
he was able to predict that there

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.660
are 14 of them.
There are 14 in all.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.990
Now, how do you do that?
It's really simple. Lanthanum was

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:33.330
discovered in 1839.
Lanthanum was discovered in 1839.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:38.660
It has an atomic mass of 138.91,
and there were various other

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.990
lanthanides that had the discovered.
And, I'm going to put in lutecium,

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:49.330
which had been discovered only
recently in 1907. And, its

00:17:49.330 --> 00:18:08.460
atomic mass is 174.97.
So what? What can I learn from this

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
about how many elements lie between
lanthanum and lutecium?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
It's anybody's guess. But,
with Moseley, Moseley comes along

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and he says, this isn't the critical
figure. The critical figure is the

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
atomic number.
I'm going to tell you because we

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
can do the experiment.
And, we can determine that

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
lanthanum has an atomic mass of 57,
and lutecium has an atomic mass of

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
71. Now, I ask you, how
many elements are there?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:26.610
How many elements are there to be
discovered? With the atomic number,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.220
everything is resolved. In fact,
once you know that the atomic number

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.840
of uranium is 92,
you can say with surety that there

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.460
are 92 naturally occurring elements
up to uranium.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.070
They couldn't do this before
Moseley. And,

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.690
he kept going. He didn't stop with
this. Who else was in town

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.430
in 1913 in Manchester?
Niels Bohr. So,

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.310
Moseley looks at these data,
and he says, I wonder if I can fit

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.180
these data to a line?
So, he said, well, Bohr is in the

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:09.050
building. I'll go talk to Bohr.
And he says, why don't I use a

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.930
Rydberg-like equation?
And this is what he writes.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.800
The nu bar varies with the square
of the proton number in the

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.680
following manner: R,
the Rydberg constant,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.560
one over N final minus one over N
initial, each of them squared,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:47.386
times Z squared.
But he knew those lines don't all go

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:37.600
through the origin.
They don't go through the origin.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:56.266
So, it's Z minus some nonzero
constant squared.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:46.400
So, wave number goes as the square
of the proton number,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:20:05.733
but there's a little bit of an
offset. And this is called

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:55.420
Moseley's law.
This is Moseley's law.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.260
So, it's a Rydberg type equation.
It's essentially a Bohr adaptation

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.100
for the x-ray spectra that he had
measured. And so,

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.940
for example, you can have a
Lyman-like series.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.780
The Lyman-like series would be two
to one, right,

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.630
N equals two down to N equals one?
So that means, that's all of the K

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:24.470
alpha. So, the wave number of any K
alpha line is equal to,

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:29.310
if I plug in one over two squared
minus one over one squared,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.150
this will come out to give me three
quarters times the Rydberg constant

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:51.900
times Z minus, pardon
me, sigma squared.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:42.800
Well, he keeps going.
Let's see what he does.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.600
He goes through, and he rewrote the
thing in a slightly different form.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.400
But ultimately, if you read the
highlighted passage here,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:21:09.933
hence the frequency nu varies as N
minus K squared,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.000
and N for calcium is really 20,
then K equals one.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:21:02.540
He solves for this thing,
solves for it. And look at this

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.080
little sort of very delicate,
extremely important statement.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.630
But, very typical British
understatement: "there's good reason

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:16.180
to believe that the x-ray spectra
with which we are now dealing come

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.720
from the innermost ring of
electrons" because he knows

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.900
he's way down inside.
So, sigma equals one,

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:31.720
in this case, for K alpha.
And, there is a Balmer like series.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.540
This is to x-ray what Balmer was to
hydrogen. And that would be lines

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:43.360
three to two. And,
so that would be by definition the L

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.180
alpha lines. And that would be one
over three squared minus one over

00:21:49.180 --> 00:22:07.893
two squared, which gives you 536
times R times Z minus sigma squared.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:22:01.250
And, it turns out that sigma equals
7.4 for L alpha series.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:18.666
So, this is really good.
Now, let's go into the physics.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:22:13.750
Let's try to understand, what is
this sigma? Where does it come from?

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:30.633
So, for that, let's look
at this little cartoon.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.500
Here's my K shell.
This is K shell. Here's the L

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:11.000
shell. Here's the M shell.
Now, K shell, I've got maximum.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.500
I've got two electrons max, filled.
OK, L shell I've got eight

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.000
electrons max.
And, out here I've got 18 electrons

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.500
max. Let's look at,
first of all, sigma equals one.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:33.000
That involves transitions from L
down to K.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:57.710
So, for transitions from L down to K,
normally I've got two electrons in

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:02.420
the N equals one shell.
If I'm going to have cascade,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:07.140
one of these is missing. There's a
vacancy down here.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.850
So let's go up here.
I've got one, two, three,

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.570
four, five, six, seven, eight.
Now the eight of these electrons

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:21.280
are feeling the positive attraction
of the nucleus mediated by the

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:40.426
presence of the one electron.
So, you see plus Z minus one.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:18.500
So, we say that the attractive force
of nucleus is mediated.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:31.000
Or, we say the electron screens the
attractive force of the nucleus.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:54.870
So, the outer electrons are going to
fall down, don't get the full brunt

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.740
of the positive force of the nucleus.
And, there's only one electron here.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.620
So, instead of Z,
it's Z minus one. It makes sense.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.490
It makes sense. And, how about,
let's do the next one.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.370
The next one would be from three to
two. So, out here,

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.240
I've got electrons. If they are
going to go from three to two,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.120
I need at least one vacancy. I
could have a vacancy here.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:38.240
So, there's maybe, instead of eight
electrons there is seven.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.500
Here, there's either one or two
electrons. Suppose there's two here

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.000
and there's seven here.
That's nine. Suppose it is only

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.500
one here. Well,
one plus seven is eight.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.000
But, maybe I've blown both of these
out. Maybe I've blown more than one

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.500
of these out so,
you put it all together,

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.000
and it turns out that the number has
to be somewhere on the order of what?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.500
Eight, seven,
something like that?

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.000
And, sure enough, the number is 7.
.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:55.840
So, there is a physical basis for
the screening factor.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:01.690
Sigma is termed the screening
factor. The screening factor

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:07.530
defines a Z effective,
not the Z. There's a Z effective.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:13.380
It's what's mediated. And to show
you, just to get a sense of how

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:19.230
powerful Moseley was,
here's the thing. I told you that

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:25.070
I've had it drilled into my head
that the lambda of copper K alpha is

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:30.450
1.5418 angstroms.
There's not many things I know of

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.360
five significant figures.
I know my Social Security number to

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.270
nine significant figures.
But I know this one to five

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:45.170
significant figures.
And, if you use Moseley's law,

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.080
lambda of copper K alpha for Moseley
is 1.546 angstroms.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:26:08.693
And, the delta here is 0.
%, one third of one percent.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.500
There's no question this man should
have won the Nobel Prize.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.000
He should have won it right away.
But he didn't. Mosley was very

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.500
politically active.
And, he decided when World War I

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.000
broke out to enlist in the British
military. And,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.500
Rutherford was furious.
Rutherford called the Secretary of

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.000
War and tried to get Moseley a desk
job and keep him in London.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:26.110
And, Moseley refused.
So, he ended up in the military,

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:30.230
and one of the major battles of
World War I was the Battle of Suvla

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.350
Bay, which was part of the Gallipoli
campaign, which was managed by none

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.460
other than Winston Churchill.
This cost Churchill his political

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.580
capital. It took him years to
recover from the debacle of the

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.700
Battle of Gallipoli.
The Battle of Suvla Bay took a

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.820
quarter of a million lives on the
Allied side, and about a third of

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.940
the million lives on the Turkish
side, over half a million people

00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:13.613
killed in that campaign.
And, on August 8,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
1915, at the age of 27,
Moseley was killed in action.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And, they don't give the Nobel
Prize posthumously.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
So, no Nobel for this,
one of the most brilliant pieces of

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
work in those early days of the 20th
century. Bohr said that World War I,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
he called World War I a horrible
spectacle inflicting great

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:23.300
losses on humanity.
But the number one loss to the world

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.920
was Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley.
So, that's why you won't see

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.530
Moseley's name among the physics
Nobelists. Well,

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:37.150
this is brilliant work.
Is there any data? What's the data?

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:41.760
Well, what should this look like?
If we take this set of lines and we

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.380
make a spectrum,
the spectrum will be intensity,

00:27:46.380 --> 00:28:04.826
right, intensity versus some energy
coordinate.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:55.570
OK, so we should have something that
looks like this: K alpha,

00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:00.140
K beta, and then over here,
L alpha, L beta. That's what it

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.710
should look like.
And, so just to be clear,

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:09.280
we have an emission spectrum that is
quantized. It's quantized because

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.850
the energy levels are quantized.
So, we have a quantized emission

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:18.420
spectrum. That's what we should
expect to find.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:37.306
It's a function of the atomic
number of the specimen.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:28.400
And, so we say that this spectrum is
characteristic of the target,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:47.333
or of the anode. And, I told you
last day, if I walked into a room

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.200
and I saw an x-ray spectrum,
and I saw that this was 1.54 Å,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:44.600
I go its copper because as Z changes,
so does the element.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:29:02.400
In fact, look at how sensitive this
technique is.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.500
It's additive.
Look down here at brass.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.000
Brass is an alloy of copper and
zinc. So, there's the copper lines.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.500
And in brass, you see the copper
lines, and you see the zinc lines.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.000
So, by this technique, I could give
you an alloy consisting of three

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.500
elements. And,
you could see from where those lines

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.000
are what the elements must be that
are present in the alloy.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.500
And, the relative intensity of the
lines must be related to the

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.000
relative concentrations of this
constituents that are present.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:31.530
This is so important.
It's amazing. All right,

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:37.070
so let's look at the data. Here's
the data. This is data from

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:42.610
molybdenum. Now,
remember, this is what we are

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:48.150
expecting, and this is what we've
got. So, it's there's something

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:53.690
else going on here.
It looks as though what we have is

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:59.230
a combination of,
it looks like we've got a

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:04.870
combination of this plus this.
So, this here is our characteristic

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:10.620
spectrum. It's as though our
characteristic spectrum is imposed

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:16.370
upon something else.
And this something else is

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:22.120
continuous, right?
There's no break in this curve.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.260
So, this is a continuous spectrum.
This is a continuous spectrum.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.790
There are various ways of
describing the shape.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:36.330
It's certainly asymmetric.
But since we're in New England,

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:40.860
we call this whale shaped. It's a
whale shaped. And,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.390
it's got a very steep,
it's got a vertical rise here.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.930
I want you to note the shape. It's
not just arbitrarily drawn.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.460
It's a steep vertical rise,
and then an asymptotic tail, and of

00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:12.453
course a maximum skewed
asymmetrically.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000
So it's not quantized.
And, furthermore, if you look at

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000
this figure carefully,
you'll see that there is a family of

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000
these. There is a family of these,
and they are enveloping one another.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:25.450
They envelop one another as shown
here so that as the plate voltage

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:30.900
increases, the height increases and
the minimum wavelength decreases.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:36.360
So, if this is wavelength
increasing from left to right,

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.810
this means that energy is increasing
from right to left,

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:47.270
which makes sense. As you go to
higher plate voltage, you

00:31:47.270 --> 00:32:05.740
go to higher energies.
But, what's going on here?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
What's the physics of the spectrum?
Oh, by the way, and the highest one,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
you see the K alpha,
K beta designation? If you didn't

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
know what they were,
you just took the value of K alpha,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
it looks like it's around, oh, about
three quarters of an angstrom by my

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
eyeballing it.
It looks like it's about three

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
quarters of an angstrom.
And, if you take the calculation of

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Moseley's Law for lambda
of molybdenum K alpha.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:24.280
You know that molybdenum is Z equals
42 for Moly. Z equals 42; plug them

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.560
in and you get 0.
2 Å. So, that seems to be OK.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.850
So, in other words, Moseley is
predicting the peaks.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.140
And, the peak, by the way,
is I'm drawing a straight line like

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.420
this. But in reality,
these peaks have some finite width

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.710
because real materials are not
perfect. And so,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:33:05.820
there's going to be some variation
in the spacing and the energies.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
OK, so what's going on here?
How can we explain this? What's

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
the underlying physics here?
Well, let's take a look. Here's a

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
body centered cubic crystal,
as is molybdenum. So, let's say the

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
plane of the table is the anode.
And, the electrons are zooming in

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
from the cathode in the ceiling.
So, the electrons are coming down.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
They're coming down, and smashing
into this. And,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
something's going on that causes the
emission of x-rays

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:22.210
in all directions.
And, we've just seen,

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:26.640
it's OK, you've seen in the central
board, there, what those energies

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.070
should be, the discrete energies.
But let's see what else is going on.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.490
Let's zoom in at the free surface
of the molybdenum.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:39.920
Here's body centered cubic.
And, the electrons are coming in.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.350
Let's say electrons coming in from
the top, and electrons charge

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.780
negatively. And,
we know that this is net neutral.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.940
But, there is an electron cloud.
And so, we've seen Born repulsion in

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.840
the past. We're going to see it
again. The mutual repulsion of the

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.730
electrons in the molybdenum atom
with the incident electron that's

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.620
just arrived long distance from the
cathode is going to cause some

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.520
repulsion. And it's going to be a
deflection. Another electron might

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.410
come in a little closer.
If it comes in closer, it might be

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:16.310
deflected more.
Now, when a charged particle

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:20.200
changes direction,
you know, any particle,

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.100
forget charged particle,
a change in speed or a change in

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:42.600
direction represents
an acceleration.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:34.390
But, when a charged particle
accelerates, that causes emission of

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:40.790
radiation. So,
every one of these changes in

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:47.190
direction, change of direction we
term acceleration.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:53.590
That's point one. And,
point two, charge accelerating

00:34:53.590 --> 00:35:10.380
produces radiation because
it's an energy change.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:35:05.250
So, what kind of radiation?
Every one of these comes off.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:24.266
They give off a photon. And,
different deflections mean different

00:34:50.500 --> 00:35:15.750
energy differences.
Modest deflections,

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:34.300
modest difference, intense
deflection, intense difference.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
You might even get one that comes in
sort of a la Rutherford that comes

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
in and gets turned around.
So, what do we see? That could

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
explain what's going on here,
where we have at the one extreme,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
this is very low. This is a high
wavelength, low energy.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
So, this is low energy; this is low
angle deflection.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
And, this is the most common.
This is the most common angle.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:36:01.660
And, over here is very high angle,
and there aren't many of them. And

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.330
we can't predict what this line is.
There's no way we can calculate

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.990
that curve except for one point on
it. And, that's the remote

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:15.660
possibility that an electron comes
in dead-on, stops,

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:20.330
is captured by the molybdenum atom,
and gives up all of its kinetic

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:38.260
energy and converts it
to photon energy.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:30.160
And, that one we can calculate,
for that one we know that if we take

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.330
the energy of the incident electron,
the total energy. Total kinetic

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:40.490
energy is equal to what?
The product of the charge on the

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:45.660
electron times the plate voltage.
The charge on the electron is the

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:50.830
elementary charge,
and convert that into the energy of

00:36:50.830 --> 00:37:09.126
the emitted photon,
which is equal to hc over lambda.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:37:01.390
If we do that,
we can invert this and get the value

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:06.790
for this point here,
which is lambda of the shortest

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:12.190
wavelength, which is the wavelength
represented by the conversion of the

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:17.590
total kinetic energy of the incident
electron, lambda of the shortest

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:35.246
wavelength, then, will equal
hc over e times V.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:27.660
And, if you plug in Planck's
constant, speed of light,

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.330
elementary charge, you end up with
12,400 over plate voltage in

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:36.990
angstroms. You know I am not fond
of the nanometer.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:41.660
I insist on using the angstrom in
defiance of Systeme International.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:46.330
So, it's 12,400 divided by plate
voltage. So, you can see that if

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:50.990
you have on the order of 10,
00 volts, 10,000 V will give you a

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:55.660
shortest wavelength of 1.
4 angstroms, smack dab in the middle

00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:15.086
of the x region of the spectrum.
And that's what you're seeing up

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.500
here. There is another term for
this phenomenon of changing

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.500
directions. And it comes from the
idea that we are decelerating the

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:55.500
incident electrons,
decelerating not by changing

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.500
velocity, but by changing direction.
And, it's the German term

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:26.110
Bremsstrahlung.
Brems means to brake as in putting

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:32.330
on the brakes of your car.
Brems means to brake, and strahl is

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:38.550
the word for ray.
Strahl means ray.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:44.770
So, this literally means braking
radiation. It's the radiation from

00:38:44.770 --> 00:39:02.273
the braking of the incident
electrons, braking radiation.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:56.160
So, the bremsstrahlung plus the
characteristic spectrum give us what

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.330
we see in the figure up here.
Last topic I want to cover is

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:06.490
something on instrumentation and
safety. A number of you approached

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:11.660
me after the last lecture and asked,
with incredulity, how could these

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:16.830
people work with these generators
exposed to x-rays?

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:35.860
These were clear glass tubes
emanating in all directions x-rays.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Well, the answer is it was unsafe,
and many of them died as a result of

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
the radiation exposure because they
didn't know at the time what was

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
going on. So,
I want to show you several things

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
that have been done in order to make
things a little bit safer,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
and also to be more efficient.
And, what I'm going to show you is

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
the design by Coolidge in 1913.
And Coolidge made the following

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
improvements. And,
I think I've got a cartoon up here.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:53.550
This is taken from one of your
readings out of the supplement.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.100
This is out of the Stout and Jensen
book. So, this is figure 1.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.660
. What I did is I turned it on its
side so it would look like all of

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.210
our gas tubes.
Every gas tube I've ever drawn for

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:07.770
you has the anode on the right.
So, just to orient it I lay it on

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.330
its side. And so,
the anode is on the right.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.880
The cathode is on the left.
And now, what I want to do is

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.440
highlight what the improvements have
been. So, the first thing that

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:38.013
Coolidge did is he used a
bona fide vacuum tube.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
He got the gas pressure way,
way down. And, this did two things.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
First of all, there's no glow in
the visible. And secondly,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
it's a much higher efficiency
because when you have glow,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
what it means is that some of those
electrons leaving the cathode are

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
not getting to the anode.
They are colliding with gas

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
molecules and consuming their energy.
So, by the time they get to the

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
anode, they don't have enough punch
to kick out inner shell electrons.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:53.750
So, the vacuum tube is an
improvement. The second thing is

00:40:53.750 --> 00:41:13.600
hot cathode. What happens with a
hot cathode? You know,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:41:01.250
you have to rip the electrons out of
the cathode. And the electrons are

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:21.100
bound. So, if you raise the
temperature of the cathode,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:41:08.750
the thermal energy then weakens the
bonds. And so,

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:28.600
it takes less Coulombic force to rip
the electrons out.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:41:16.250
Now, how's he going to heat the
cathode? Let's think about this.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:36.233
You can't use a torch because
you've got a vacuum inside.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:23.330
So, a torch won't work in a vacuum.
So, I wonder, maybe if I passed a

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:26.660
current, and sure enough,
what he does is he's got a second

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.990
power supply. You see,
here's the anode over here.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:33.320
Here's the cathode, and there's the
30,000, 40,000 volts between the

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.660
cathode and the anode.
And, the electrons boil off here

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.990
and zoom from left to right.
And, he's got a second little

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:43.330
circuit here. You can put more than
one electrical signal through an

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.660
item. So, let's put a second
circuit through here.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:42:06.253
And, this circuit is a little
heater circuit.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And, all it does is it makes this
cathode filament through joule

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
heating, raise its temperature.
And that makes the electrons less

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
tightly bound,
so it's easier to boil them off.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
So, the hot cathode, by raising
temperature, reduces binding of the

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
electrons. And,
you're trying to get rid of them.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
The third thing he did was water
cooling.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
You've got all of these electrons.
They've zoomed across at an

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
acceleration voltage of 30,
40, 50,000 volts. They're crash,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
crash, crash, crash, hitting that
copper or molybdenum anode.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Where is that kinetic energy going?
Some of it's going into light, and

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
some of it's going into heat.
And, the temperature of the anode

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
is rising to the point where you
could melt this.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
So, what Coolidge did is he put the
anode on a hearth, and

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:52.460
the hearth is copper..
And underneath,

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.380
there's water running through copper
tubing. So, by water cooling,

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.300
he's able to keep the anode cool,
so, dissipate heat, and the second

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.220
thing, remember,
Roentgen used pulse power.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:12.150
It was eight times a second: bam,
bam, bam, bam. If you've got water

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:17.070
cooling, now you can go to
continuous power,

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:35.873
dissipated heat, and allowed for
continuous current flow.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.500
If you've got continuous current,
that means you've got continuous

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:13.000
x-ray emission.
You don't want an x-ray flashbulb.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.500
You want an x-ray beam. And, the
last thing he did is probably the

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:24.000
most important thing is he put lead
shielding, which I've indicated in

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.500
yellow, he put lead shielding and
beryllium windows.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.000
Beryllium windows for efficiency,
and lead shielding for safety.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:58.850
OK, now let's think about it.
Let's think about why we would

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:02.710
choose these. Why would you choose
lead for the shielding and beryllium

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:06.560
for the window?
For that, I decided,

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.420
why don't we go back to our friend
the periodic table?

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.280
Look at where beryllium and lead
lie on the periodic table.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.140
Beryllium is the lightest practical
element. Hydrogen and helium are

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:37.880
gases, and lithium as a metal is
unstable in moist air.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Beryllium is the first metal that
can be used sensibly in our

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
atmosphere. And,
look at lead. Lead is down here.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
And remember, it's 1913 so forget
about the actinides.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
So, you've got bismuth,
polonium, and astatine. So,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
lead is effectively the heaviest
practical element.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Why would you choose this?
Why would you choose lead as your

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
shielding? What do we know about
the energy levels in lead?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
First of all, there's lots of them
because you have not

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:58.840
only K, L, M, and N.
You've got n. You keep going,

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:04.530
oh. So, you've got plenty of levels.
And, the levels are very closely

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:10.230
spaced. So, if you've got lots of
energy levels,

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:15.920
and they're closely spaced,
then that means when an x-ray comes

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.610
in, you'll have excitation and
cascading down into much,

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:27.300
much longer wavelengths. So,
because of the extra energy levels,

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:44.933
this causes the lead to act as a
frequency shifter.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:36.690
So, it moves you out of the x region.
You still get radiation,

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.380
but it's not so toxic. I mean,
you have conservation of energy here.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.070
But, I mean, you don't have things
coming at you into x region of the

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.760
spectrum. So,
if there were a shortage of lead,

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.460
or, let's say, for the man or woman
who has everything,

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.150
when he or she goes to the dentist,
what would be a really chi-chi

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:59.580
material to make the vest out of?
Mercury is a liquid at room

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.740
temperature, bad choice.
Thallium: toxic. How about gold?

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.910
How about a vest made of gold? It
would work. That would be a classy

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:15.080
vest. Now, how about up here?
Beryllium window: beryllium is the

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:20.240
inverse. Beryllium has very few
energy levels and they are far apart.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.410
So that we don't want the x-rays
absorbed as they are

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:30.070
going to the window.
So, if you had a window that wasn't

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:34.230
crystalline beryllium,
you run the risk of losing some of

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:38.380
your x-rays. So,
your efficiency goes down.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.530
So, you choose a low z element for
the window, and the high z element

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.690
for the shielding for those reasons.
It all goes back to the internal

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:50.840
structure energy levels.
OK, well, let's take a look at

00:46:50.840 --> 00:47:09.080
another use of x-rays,
x-rays in art.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:47:01.750
This painting,
anybody recognize this one?

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:19.600
The Angelus by Jean Francois Millet
painted in 1857-1859 on commission

00:46:48.500 --> 00:47:15.250
for an insurance company in Boston.
Millet was very popular with Boston

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:32.566
Brahmins because he painted rural
life in 19th century France.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:25.290
This painting was commissioned and
hung here in Boston.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:28.580
It's now at the Musee d'Orsay.
Salvador Dali had to paint this as

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.880
part of his art education.
He hated this painting, and in 1963,

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.170
it was hanging in the Louvre.
And he had the painting x-rayed.

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.470
He said there's something spooky
about this painting.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.760
Well, Dali had such authority that
he could ask for the x-ray,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.050
and they x-rayed it. And they
discovered that,

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:48.350
indeed, the painting had been
painted over. It's

00:47:48.350 --> 00:48:08.100
not an art forgery.
It turns out that this zone down

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
here, the little basket of potatoes
was not the basket of potatoes in

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
the original painting.
The original painting depicted the

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
casket of a baby.
This is showing the poverty,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
the futility, of peasant life in
France. And, these people are so

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
poor that they just lost their baby.
Now, you can imagine that this

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
painting comes to Boston.
They unveil it, and they say,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
my God, we can't hang this in the
lobby of an insurance company.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:24.130
So, my theory is that they sent it
back and Millet painted it over,

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:28.260
put a basket of potatoes. But,
their heads are not bowed in the

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.390
form of saying a prayer thanking God
for this miserable bounty of

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:36.530
potatoes. It doesn't make sense.
So, x-rays figured out what was

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:40.660
going on. So then,
Dali got a chance to paint.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.790
And this is his revenge. This is
his painting in 1935.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:48.930
This is Dali, and this is his
father. You notice in this case,

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.700
the man is taller than the woman.
Here, the woman is taller than the

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.110
man. There's all kinds of Freudian
stuff going on with where he's got

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:59.520
his hat placed,
but I don't have enough time to go

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.930
into that. So,
you can see. While we're talking

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:06.350
about Dali, here's the
hallucinogenic toreador.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:09.760
And, I want to show you this
because it hearkens back to crystal

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.170
structures. He went out one day in
Manhattan to buy some Venus pencils.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:16.580
They're pencils, but the Venus was
the manufacturer.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:36.293
See, I have the Venus de Milo on
the pencil box.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:23.520
So, you see a bunch of Venuses
facing forward,

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.050
and some facing back.
Can you see the breast here is the

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:30.580
nose of the toreador?
Here's it's mouth; does that help?

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.110
OK, those are the gadflies of St.
Narciso, which is I think the patron

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.640
saint of Catalonia.
You see, here's his cape,

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.170
and there's the bull. And,
you can see symmetry planes here.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.700
OK, there's the head of the thing,
OK. There's the bull, yeah, yeah.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.230
OK, now look, here's the symmetry.
See, these Venuses are forward.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:52.120
These Venuses are facing backward.
What else do we have?

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.370
I don't know why it's doing this.
OK, now, there's the bull. What's

00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:00.620
the crystal structure?
See, this is the life force leaving

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:04.870
the bull. What's the crystal
structure? If you ignore color it's

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:09.120
simple cubic. You can even see
symmetry here.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.370
You see the shadow of the fly?
You see these two atoms here, these

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:17.620
two atoms here?
There's even something.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:21.870
You see the shadow of the Venus
actually looks a little bit like,

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:26.380
come on, come on, come on.
It looks a little bit like this.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:31.150
He really hated this. OK, we're
going to show you one more and go

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:35.920
through this. Ah,
this is his tribute to Watson and

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.690
Crick. Over here,
you have the DNA double helix,

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:45.450
and what he's portraying here is
that now that we have the capacity

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:50.220
to understand how life is encoded,
replication, and so on, ironically,

00:50:50.220 --> 00:51:09.040
humanity hasn't figured out how to
stop killing itself.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:59.540
And so, he has this group of people
all arranged in cubic arrays with

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.080
muskets pointing at one another.
Again, crystallography, you could

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.630
say actually this is simple cubic,
but if you put somebody inside, it

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:13.180
would be body centered cubic.
[LAUGHTER] On the last thing,

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:17.720
lithium, why is 7-Up called 7-Up?
When it first came out it was

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.250
called lithiated lemon-lime soda.
It contained lithium citrate in

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:26.750
large quantities.
It was supposed to make you happy.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:31.250
It was an anti-depressant. And, it
turns out that some people have a

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:35.750
sodium deficiency.
Lithium's a smaller ion.

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:40.250
If you're already sodium deficient,
lithium gets in there, displaces a

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:44.750
sodium; you die.
[LAUGHTER] So, after some tens of

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:49.250
people died, they took the lithium
out around 1950.

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:53.850
So, you don't have lithium in your
7-Up today. I'll see you on Friday.
