00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
We've already spent a lot of time

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.800
thinking about how awesome

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.800
carbon is for life, that really life as we know is carbon based.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.300
And this all comes out of carbon's ability

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.000
to bond with other carbons and form all sorts of neat structures, bonds with oxygen, hydrogens,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.490
and other things. In fact, we have a whole
class of molecules

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.580
called organic molecules that just are
molecules that involve carbon

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.939
and carbons bonding capabilities really
come out of its electron structure.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.099
We talked about this in the previous video

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.500
but if we think about carbon, it has six
protons and a neutral carbon will have

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.660
six electrons.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.649
Two of them are sitting at its innermost
shell and then the other four are on its

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.500
outermost shell, and those  four are the ones
that tend to react and we call them

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.789
the valence electrons. And so these
valence electrons tend to form four

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.780
covalent bonds, for example if

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.300
you wanted a bond with four hydrogens,
well each hydrogen would contribute

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
each hydrogen would contribute an
electron to one of these pairs, which are essentially

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.180
going to be a covalent bond

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.399
and then the hydrogens,

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.930
can feel that their outer shell is
complete because hydrogen is just trying to get to

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.100
two to fill its outer shell to try to be a
little bit more like helium

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.000
and carbon is trying to get to eight in its
outer shell to be a little bit more like

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.460
neon. Neon has two in its inner shell and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.400
eight in its outer shell. You might remember
the octet rule that,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.610
that atoms try to get to eight or pretend like they have

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.760
eight electrons in the outer shell to
feel stable.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.500
And here carbon is sharing eight
electrons. It contributed four and the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.150
four hydgrogens contributed four

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.579
and it forms, it forms methane. Now those of you who are quite astute

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.100
might have said: okay you know what, I know of
other elements that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.049
tend to form four covalent bonds, that
have four valence electrons.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.119
And in particular there's one that's
awfully close to carbon

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.619
on the periodic table and that's right
over here. This is,

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.090
this is silicon. Silicon has 14
protons and a neutral

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.649
silicon would have 14 electrons. So
let me draw that. So, if we have silicon

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.800
right over here. I'm just gonna focus on the electrons.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.020
You would have two
electron sitting in its innermost,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.380
in its innermost shell, so they are
jumping here

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.100
They're not these neat, well-defined orbits.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.600
They are just jumping around

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.960
in that, in that lowest energy in that, in
that,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.260
in the innermost shell. Then you have
another eight

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.170
in its second shell. So, one... I'll just draw them

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.810
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, all jumping around

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.880
all jumping around in the second shell. And it has a total of fourteen, so we already used up

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.350
ten so it is going to have four in its
outermost shell.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.540
So, one, two, three, four

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.040
and these four in its outermost
shell, these are the ones that tend to do

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.960
the reacting. We call them valence
electrons.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.550
So if we want to just draw the valence
electrons, we could do silicon

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.380
has four valence electrons, four

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.930
has four. One, two, three, four

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.500
valence electrons, just like carbon. It has a
different number of electrons.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.800
These four valence electrons

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.810
are actually one shell further
out but it has four that tend to react.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.120
And it does tend to form four covalent bonds.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.630
So, you might be saying, well, can't we have
life that is dependent,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.970
that a silicon-based as opposed to
carbon-based

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.090
and if you thought that, you would not be
the first person to think about that.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.210
Science fiction or

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.750
authors have have have theorized that, 
and this right actually

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.940
This is a, this is a screenshot from

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.940
"The Devil In The Dark " episode 1967, from
the original Star Trek, where they said

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.370
maybe they encounter, Kirk encounters
that, the enterprise encounters

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.060
these creatures that are silicon-based. They are called Hortas and they have all

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.710
sorts of

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.590
interesting properties. So, there's
you know, there's some folks who like to

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.560
think maybe

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.760
maybe silicon. But when you actually look at
the chemistry,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.660
things start to break down a little bit.
For example, one of the neat things about

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.520
carbon is it readily forms bonds with
other carbons and that these bonds can

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.050
actually be quite long. You can form all
sorts of these hydrocarbons and all sorts

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.650
of other

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.940
carbon-carbon structures, long chains
of carbon. So you can do that with carbon

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.900
but it turns out that silicon-silicon
bonds are not that strong and silicon is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.070
not going to form,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.580
is not going to form really long chains.
So silicon is not going to do that.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.200
Even if you look at a simple, a
simple molecule

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.740
like methane there is, there is a
molecule called

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.660
silane but this does

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.710
not readily form, it doesn't have the
same characteristics.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.150
So this is also not going to be as good
as methane

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.940
and even if you think about something
like carbon dioxide which is carbon

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.560
which is carbon bonded, having two double
bonds

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.830
so this is carbon having two double
bonds to oxygens

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.350
so two, so one double bond to one oxygen, another
double bond to another oxygen

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.440
And we're used to thinking about carbon
dioxide in our everyday life as a gas.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.920
Plants are using these to

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.170
fix into their structure, to
actually grow, they are taking the carbon

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.040
out of it in their carbon fixation.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.850
We are, we exhale this carbon dioxide, it's
essential to life

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.200
and you might think well what about, what
about silicon oxide.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.030
And silicon dioxide, is actually a fairly
common

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.960
molecule, fairly common compound but it
does not exist at a gaseous state

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.280
at the temperatures that we are normally, that
we normally associate

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.690
with life. Most of silicon oxide is
in the form of quartz

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.070
in the ground. So that is quartz over there.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.770
So when you look at the
actual ways that

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.870
silicon forms bonds

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.330
it actually does not seem actually close
to as good as carbon.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.960
Something like silicon

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.419
when silicon bonds with oxygen it's a much -- 
not only is it in the solid form at

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.419
normal temperatures

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.800
where we normally associate life but
these are very, very, very strong bonds,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.730
much stronger than the bonds that carbon
is forming with oxygen.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.750
They're so strong,  they make it hard for
them to be manipulated with the types of

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.890
chemical reactions

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.880
that we're used to seeing inside of
organisms.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.090
So, you know, it's fun to theorize
about this and I'd be the last person

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.110
to rule anything out. I think the
universe will continue

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.600
to surprise us with things that
right now we cannot even imagine.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.040
But based on the chemistry we know and
based on life as we know it

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.660
even though silicon can form these four
covalent bonds and does have four

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.850
valence electrons,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.360
it's still

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.430
nowhere near as good as carbon

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.050
in doing the types of processes
that we think are necessary for life.
