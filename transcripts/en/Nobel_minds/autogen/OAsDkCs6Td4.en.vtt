what problem have been solved for a long
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.709
what problem have been solved for a long

at all and it was debated for a long
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490
at all and it was debated for a long
time whether it was a response to

time whether it was a response to
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100

and they before they started their work

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
and they before they started their work
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.069
and they before they started their work
it was understood that it was endogenous

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
it was understood that it was endogenous
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380
it was understood that it was endogenous
and it was even understood that single

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
and it was even understood that single
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240
and it was even understood that single
genes could influence the circadian

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
genes could influence the circadian
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639
genes could influence the circadian
rhythm but nothing was known about the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
rhythm but nothing was known about the
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.290
rhythm but nothing was known about the
mechanism and there were different

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
mechanism and there were different
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810
mechanism and there were different
hypotheses but they found out the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
hypotheses but they found out the
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.959
hypotheses but they found out the
mechanism that controls the machinery of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
mechanism that controls the machinery of
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.649
mechanism that controls the machinery of
the clock so he turned to the discovery

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
the clock so he turned to the discovery
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.320
the clock so he turned to the discovery
what were the key findings and who did

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
what were the key findings and who did
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.620
what were the key findings and who did
what so first of all they studied they

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
what so first of all they studied they
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530
what so first of all they studied they
used the fruit fly as a model system and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
used the fruit fly as a model system and
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.570
used the fruit fly as a model system and
before their work there has been a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
before their work there has been a
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.560
before their work there has been a
classic experiment by Benson and Konopka

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
classic experiment by Benson and Konopka
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.770
classic experiment by Benson and Konopka
they had used a fruit fly to ask him can

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
they had used a fruit fly to ask him can
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.399
they had used a fruit fly to ask him can
you identify mutants that arise due to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
you identify mutants that arise due to
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.440
you identify mutants that arise due to
mutations in single genes so that was

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
mutations in single genes so that was
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.140
mutations in single genes so that was
sort of a basis before our laureate

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
sort of a basis before our laureate
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.429
sort of a basis before our laureate
started their work and they took

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
started their work and they took
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800
started their work and they took
advantage of that because the the gene

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
advantage of that because the the gene
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560
advantage of that because the the gene
wasn't known there were mutant strains

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
wasn't known there were mutant strains
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.039
wasn't known there were mutant strains
known who had long or short or no rhythm

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
known who had long or short or no rhythm
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960
known who had long or short or no rhythm
at all that were known to map to the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
at all that were known to map to the
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.719
at all that were known to map to the
same locus so the laureates use these

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
same locus so the laureates use these
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.530
same locus so the laureates use these
tries and went on to isolate the gene

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
tries and went on to isolate the gene
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.230
tries and went on to isolate the gene
and to determine what gene it was but

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
and to determine what gene it was but
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.730
and to determine what gene it was but
that didn't prove the mechanism either

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
that didn't prove the mechanism either
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.340
that didn't prove the mechanism either
so what they then did was experiments to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
so what they then did was experiments to
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.190
so what they then did was experiments to
understand the function of the system by

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
understand the function of the system by
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080
understand the function of the system by
this gene and then several others that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
this gene and then several others that
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.070
this gene and then several others that
they did in sequential experiments

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080
they did in sequential experiments
 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.729
they did in sequential experiments
why is circadian rhythm important so we

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739
why is circadian rhythm important so we
 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.220
why is circadian rhythm important so we
need the circadian clock to anticipate

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
need the circadian clock to anticipate
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.070
need the circadian clock to anticipate
the daily changes not only adapt but

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080
the daily changes not only adapt but
 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.740
the daily changes not only adapt but
anticipate so it's so there are

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750
anticipate so it's so there are
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.570
anticipate so it's so there are
dramatically different conditions during

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
dramatically different conditions during
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.130
dramatically different conditions during
day and night and we need to be very

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140
day and night and we need to be very
 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.470
day and night and we need to be very
active in the day and other processes

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
active in the day and other processes
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.500
active in the day and other processes
need to take place during night and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
need to take place during night and
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.580
need to take place during night and
evolutionary it's been a very great

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590
evolutionary it's been a very great
 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.759
evolutionary it's been a very great
advantage to take to use the only

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769
advantage to take to use the only
 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.360
advantage to take to use the only
critical lights hours where minutes of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370
critical lights hours where minutes of
 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.430
critical lights hours where minutes of
the day for instance if you're if you're

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440
the day for instance if you're if you're
 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.289
the day for instance if you're if you're
hunting you need to be active or if

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299
hunting you need to be active or if
 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.030
hunting you need to be active or if
you're hunted you need to run and hide

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
you're hunted you need to run and hide
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.910
you're hunted you need to run and hide
so you need to be prepared and take

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920
so you need to be prepared and take
 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.820
so you need to be prepared and take
advantage of be that one step before the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830
advantage of be that one step before the
 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.550
advantage of be that one step before the
the environment that's why we need it

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
the environment that's why we need it
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.910
the environment that's why we need it
it's this kind of clock is it this is it

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920
it's this kind of clock is it this is it
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.270
it's this kind of clock is it this is it
all ourselves so we know that most of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280
all ourselves so we know that most of
 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.420
all ourselves so we know that most of
ourselves have this clock and we also we

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430
ourselves have this clock and we also we
 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.940
ourselves have this clock and we also we
knew before these discoveries that there

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950
knew before these discoveries that there
 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.559
knew before these discoveries that there
is a central clock in the brain that

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569
is a central clock in the brain that
 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.949
is a central clock in the brain that
controls the rhythm and then later it

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959
controls the rhythm and then later it
 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.930
controls the rhythm and then later it
was found that it we also have them in

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940
was found that it we also have them in
 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.550
was found that it we also have them in
other parts of our body but it's the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560
other parts of our body but it's the
 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.620
other parts of our body but it's the
it's actually the mechanism that the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630
it's actually the mechanism that the
 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.210
it's actually the mechanism that the
Rorie's have elusively

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
Rorie's have elusively
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.890
Rorie's have elusively
it's an auto regulatory self sustained

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
it's an auto regulatory self sustained
 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:32.520
it's an auto regulatory self sustained
inhibitory feedback this what they found

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
inhibitory feedback this what they found
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.940
inhibitory feedback this what they found
that order for in an accessible way

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950
that order for in an accessible way
 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.890
that order for in an accessible way
would it be it's a metaphor one could

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
would it be it's a metaphor one could
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.789
would it be it's a metaphor one could
use the clock is a metaphor easy but for

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799
use the clock is a metaphor easy but for
 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.009
use the clock is a metaphor easy but for
the mechanism it's it's a little bit

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019
the mechanism it's it's a little bit
 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.830
the mechanism it's it's a little bit
difficult but it's an oscillator so you

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840
difficult but it's an oscillator so you
 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.900
difficult but it's an oscillator so you
build up a substance and then when the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910
build up a substance and then when the
 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.759
build up a substance and then when the
substance is there it turns off it

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769
substance is there it turns off it
 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.590
substance is there it turns off it
sounds production and then it can start

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600
sounds production and then it can start
 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.170
sounds production and then it can start
over again so it becomes an oscillation

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180
over again so it becomes an oscillation
 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.720
over again so it becomes an oscillation
so a negative feedback of its own

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730
so a negative feedback of its own
 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.190
so a negative feedback of its own
synthesis that's the best I can do like

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200
synthesis that's the best I can do like
 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.559
synthesis that's the best I can do like
an hourglass when the lower part is full

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569
an hourglass when the lower part is full
 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.949
an hourglass when the lower part is full
of sand and it's time to turn around

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959
of sand and it's time to turn around
 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.110
of sand and it's time to turn around
doesn't really shut up its own synthesis

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120
doesn't really shut up its own synthesis
 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.089
doesn't really shut up its own synthesis
so it's hard to find something similar

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099
so it's hard to find something similar
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.270
so it's hard to find something similar
actually so an oscillator and the

clock genes and then you have a shorter

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979
clock genes and then you have a shorter
 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.189
clock genes and then you have a shorter
or a longer face and that causes

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199
or a longer face and that causes
 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.400

of course in animal models where you can
disrupt the clock and then see effects

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740
