00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.760
I'm going to show you two ways to do this.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.260
We know that for each student, we want to write

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.189
that student's total into an array and return it. We

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.280
also know exactly how big we want the array to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.180
be because we want one for each student. So I

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.060
want numStudents items in my array. Now, for all of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.070
the student from the 0 student to the last student

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.640
Going up one at a time. I want to fill that student's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.510
spot in the array of totals with that

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.530
student's total. I already have a method that calculates

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.500
this. So, I can use totalForStudent. And then,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.030
when I've done that for all of the students,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.470
I can return the totals. Looks like I forgot to

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.490
call it totals. Let's check that it works. I'll run

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.130
the tester, and it looks like it's got what I

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.630
expecting. Now, we could use nested for loops. I'll still

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.150
want all of my totals, and I'll still want to

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.980
return them, but let's think about solving this problem for

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.500
just one student, for each topic, starting with the first

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.680
one. And we going up to the number of topics,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.010
one at a time. I'll add the score

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.360
for that topic to that student's total, let's say

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.120
for now I'm thinking about student 1. To

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.670
calculate total for student 1, I'll start at 0

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.600
and for each topic And want to add

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.350
that student's grade, in that topic. Then, once I

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.800
have the student total in my larger array

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.160
totals, I'll set the total for that student to

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.830
be the student total that I just calculated.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.540
So this is what I do for one student.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.300
And now, I want to do that for every single

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.230
student. So that all of the spaces in total

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.790
gets filled, so I will indent that a little

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.250
bit and now for each student starting with the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.410
zeroth one so we don't need this line anymore

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.960
I will go up to the number of students

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.430
one at a time. I will do all of these steps. So

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.440
now the inter-loop is calculating the student totals and the outer loop is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.699
storing the student totals in totals. So now we're fix up syntax errors. And

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.130
this way should work just like the last one. I'll

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.310
run it to make sure and it looks like it's

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.010
still good. Hopefully the number of values you see here.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.480
Makes it obvious why it would be be nice as

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.000
a teacher, have a computer do this for you.
