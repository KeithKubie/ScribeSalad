00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.160
So you all know self driving cars are the coolest thing ever built.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.550
They're going to change society, make driving safer, and retransform our cities.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.230
This course, you can now learn all the basics,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.310
what it takes to program a self driving car.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.370
In fact, you program it yourself.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.236
So right now in Google's self driving car, the car that our team have been

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:24.833
building up over the last couple of years, I'm going to hit the button [SOUND].

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.040
&gt;&gt; Auto driving.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.930
&gt;&gt; And the car is driving itself.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.650
The steering wheel moves by itself, the gas, the brake.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.490
It's sheer magic.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.090
In seven weeks in this class, you will learn how to do this.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.900
You will reprogram the basic algorithms and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.190
data structures necessary to build self-driving cars.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.380
But this isn't just a self-driving car course.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.780
It's really a basic artificial intelligence class.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.460
You learn about perception,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.190
control, planning, all the ingredients that make robots really smart these days.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.660
Prerequisites?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.113
Well I hope you are able to program in Python.

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:03.458
And some good knowledge of linear algebra and

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.623
probability will be extremely helpful.

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:06.909
I see you in class.
