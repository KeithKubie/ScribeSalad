00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.912
In today's video,

00:00:00.912 --> 00:00:02.200
we have gone all the way

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.320
to Canada to see the world's
most uncomfortable bed,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.800
and see if it's even
possible to sleep in it.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.380
[Music]

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.300
Hey guys, we're in Canada.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.200
That's right.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.100
Now, a while ago,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.700
you may have seen
I built a big bed,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.800
and that was trying to make
something really comfortable.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.500
Today, we are trying something
that's a little bit different.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.200
In fact, it's kind
of the opposite.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.400
This is the location
of the world's most

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.500
uncomfortable bed,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.700
which was built around real-life
experiences of those living

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.950
with severe eczema to help
give people a sense

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.000
of what it's like to live
with this disease.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850
The bed is in one
of the rooms back here.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.200
We need to go check it out,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.900
see what makes
it so uncomfortable,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.400
and then one of us is going
to have to put it to the test.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.400
Like a real test.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.200
We've heard a lot
about this bed.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.800
I'm very curious to know
what makes it so uncomfortable,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.200
and how it was
even put together.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.300
Let's find out.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.200
Ready for this?

00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:04.900
We'll find out.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Because I'm not.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.820
Oh, no.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.300
I have to go.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.620
It's not exactly thousand
thread count Egyptian cotton.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.860
Got a lovely carpet here,

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:16.200
and by carpet,
I mean like doormat

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.258
for scrubbing your shoes off.

00:01:18.258 --> 00:01:18.920
Oh my God.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.534
The table is sandpaper.

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:22.500
That's like 36 grit sandpa--

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.600
Ow, an actual cactus.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.900
I don't know
what I'm sitting on right now,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.000
but I don't enjoy it.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.803
These are brillo pads.

00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:32.500
I sat down to try
and delay the fact

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.600
that I have to get
near that bed.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.100
But this was also
a terrible choice.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.212
How is this--
I want to try it too.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.760
Oh, no.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.300
No, you don't actually.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.800
You don't.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.300
Okay, I'm going to try
out the terrible chair.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.400
I'm with jeans and a shirt on.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.300
It's not terrible.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.017
We wear different jeans, Nate.

00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:48.900
With my jeans,
it's not terrible.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.900
It looks durable.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.250
From what I've seen so far,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.000
the most comforting part about
this room is the Wi-Fi password.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.530
So...

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.825
Like seriously, this,

00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:00.600
I think is also a rug
for scraping your shoes.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.700
That a good pillow sound.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.362
I don't know,

00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:07.300
but when I just want
to push myself up,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.647
there's something disturbingly
lumpy in this blanket.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.000
This is not a pillow.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.500
Wait.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.700
This is bundles
of crumpled up paper.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.700
Pillow fight.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.500
The worst pillow fight ever.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.700
The scratchy part is
not the part I don't like.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.540
It's like slimy.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.080
It's like kind of sticky.

00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:27.000
Do you feel that?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.300
Yeah.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.280
Why is it--

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.660
I think that's just
like whatever they add

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.500
in it to get the fibers
to bind together.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.194
Because this material I think is

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.523
like you use it for putting
like under plants

00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:36.900
and stuff to absorb water.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.700
This is just a solid,
solid wood bed frame--

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.320
Okay.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.300
Is this--

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.500
I think that's it.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.120
That's it.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.400
That's the bottom sheet.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.900
And there's just...

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.960
Oh, and it's just 2x4's.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.160
Well, that's--

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.060
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, but...
&gt;&gt; That's supportive.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.200
You know at the end
of a long day,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.400
&gt;&gt; all you want is just to flop on your bed.
&gt;&gt; Fall on your bed.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.700
Don't hurt yourself.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.380
Imagine the itchiest,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.700
scratchiest thing
you've ever touched.

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:04.600
Now, imagine trying
to sleep in it.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.700
Never gone camping,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.900
and your sleeping bag
on the 10th floor was on a rock?

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.620
There's something
like 20 of those.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.200
Oh, I want to try walking
on our little carpet here.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.452
Boy, waking up in the morning
and walk on that would really

00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:18.900
make you want to go back to bed
if your bed didn't suck so much.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.900
Here's the thing.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.900
I think the bed needs
a proper test.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.060
It does.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.300
Who gets to test it out?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.800
There's only one fair
way to decide this.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.600
It's true.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.100
Okay.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.440
That's one.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.980
One.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.520
It's one.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.340
Best 2 out of 3.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.500
I only need one more.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.520
Okay.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.360
Okay.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.760
Okay.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.300
Okay.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.660
Shoot!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.920
No.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.400
It's--

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.000
It looks-- I'm sure
it's really comfortable.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.700
This is the worst bedspread.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.660
It's so heavy.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.200
But that just drives
the itchiness down

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.600
into you more.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.080
[Music]

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.300
That's awful.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.600
Oh boy.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.340
Ow!

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.700
Turning is the worst,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.600
because then you're
actually like rubbing

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.714
your skin against it.

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:22.200
Like if you just don't move.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.530
I mean, it's
still not comfortable,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.600
but it's like not the worst.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.620
But then you try
and turn over,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.540
and it's just like--

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.900
That's the worst thing?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.000
Not sleeping in it for a night.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.974
That's the worst part,
turning in it.

00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:32.300
Okay.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.200
That was terrible.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.800
I'm gonna go like get
a massage or something.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
You have fun though.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.700
Why are you going to suffer
through sleeping in this bed?

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.400
What's the reasoning
behind this?

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.623
Okay guys, the real answer
is this bed was made by

00:04:45.623 --> 00:04:47.400
Atopic Dermatitis Revealed.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.399
Their entire goal is
basically to bring awareness

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.900
about atopic dermatitis,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900
which is better known as eczema,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.900
and that affects so many people
you wouldn't even believe.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.100
In fact, I had it
when I was little.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.040
It's incredibly uncomfortable.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.400
It makes sleeping
nearly impossible

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.500
when it's bad.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.646
It's itchy.

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:06.771
It can be sore.

00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:09.700
It causes rashes,
and it's-- It's awful.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.160
And so they made the world's
most uncomfortable bed

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.300
to basically simulate what
a night is like trying to sleep

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.000
when you have atopic dermatitis.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.058
So we've got the itchiness,
we've got the discomfort,

00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:21.800
we've got--

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.700
I swear I felt heating
at some point.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.100
There was--

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.865
There was absolutely--

00:05:25.865 --> 00:05:26.860
I think there might be--

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.435
It feels like it's cooling down.

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:29.900
But we are on top rather--.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.100
Yes, we are.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.900
But yeah, no.

00:05:31.908 --> 00:05:33.766
It's doormat that
we're sleeping on.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.200
Because your skin gets hot.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.133
When it-- I mean,

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:39.100
when you get a rash, of course,
it's the skin irritant.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.300
So your skin warms up.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.036
I was going to say
I can't explain

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:43.275
how uncomfortable it is,

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:45.017
but I'm sure lots
of you do know.

00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:45.899
Not to mention,

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:49.150
that uncomfortable it can last
throughout the entire day too.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.520
Guys, if you suffer

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.600
from extreme eczema
or atopic dermatitis,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.700
talk to your doctor.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.500
There are treatment
options available.

00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:59.384
Okay, best 2 out of 3,
out of the best 2 out of 3.

00:05:59.517 --> 00:05:59.902
Nope.

00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:00.440
Nope.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.200
You lost.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.900
Good night, Nate.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.700
Okay. Have fun.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.519
The bed's hot again.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.600
I hate this.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.700
And then, it's so lumpy.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.800
Okay.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.320
I can just--

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.860
Just gonna...

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.200
[Music]

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.500
Well, good night, Mark.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.200
Good night.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:44.140
[Music]

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.800
Okay, guys, I am trying here.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.468
I have been in this bed
for an hour now,

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:49.748
and I can't sleep.

00:06:49.748 --> 00:06:51.100
This is ridiculous.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.700
I am itchy.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.200
I am scratchy.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.400
I don't know if this is
like a rash forming

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.400
from me scratching
or the bed itself.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.500
But this is a nightmare.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.000
I don't know
who designed this,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.950
but you're right.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.211
This is the world's
most uncomfortable bed.

00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:05.800
We're gonna try the carpet.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.500
Let me see
if this is any better.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.500
Nope.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.620
Here I am again.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.020
Just me in my [inaudible].

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.300
Also, with the size
of the lumps under me,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.111
like no matter
where you turn or try this,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.500
it just gets worse and worse.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.000
It's--

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.500
I don't--

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.300
It's digging into my spine
and my everything.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.800
There's no sleeping in this bed.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.000
I had headphones in.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.400
And then this voice started.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.900
I really hope you can hear that,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.900
because that's the
creepiest thing ever.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.500
No, I'm done.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.300
[Music]

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.200
Hello.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.300
How's--

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.800
Hello.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.400
I'm sorry.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.100
I'm just taking a nap

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.100
on this super
comfortable couch out here.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.740
How's--

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.100
Did you fall asleep?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.593
What's the worst part so far?

00:08:09.593 --> 00:08:10.700
Oh, the worst part.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.100
You'd like to know what
the worst part is so far?

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.330
Like the absolute worst part?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.100
Imagine that you
almost fall asleep, right?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.800
And then you don't.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.671
And then imagine a voice
suddenly talking to you

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:25.056
from the darkness.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.640
Oh, there's voices?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.120
Sounds really fun.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.800
Well, have a good night.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.500
Okay, so I know we've joked
around a bit about this now,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.100
but this bed is actually
super itchy and uncomfortable.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.530
I can't even begin
to imagine what it would be

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.800
like to experience this
every single night.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.900
So, let's see how things
are going in there.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.000
What's up?

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.120
You--

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.100
You give up yet?

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.900
Yes.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.407
You don't look like you've
been asleep very much.

00:08:56.407 --> 00:08:58.100
I'm not talking to you anymore.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.600
Okay.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.393
Silent treatment.

00:08:59.393 --> 00:08:59.828
That's--

00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:00.200
Yeah.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.280
I'm done.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.620
Tap.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.000
I'm going to be a mess
for a long time.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.380
I'm itchy and I'm tired.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.517
So hearing voices, huh?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.100
That thing talks to you.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.000
There's a speaker setup.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.400
Oh, so we're looking
at the list of things done.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.600
There's a list?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.000
They gave us a list of--

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.060
You didn't share it with me.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.100
I learned this recently.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.900
And in addition,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.930
we will have a hidden speaker
with subconscious audio playing

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.986
throughout the night.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:32.854
So there you go.

00:09:32.854 --> 00:09:34.700
That was because
they had a patient

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.375
that mentioned she heard inner
voices as sort of a side effect

00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:39.400
of her condition.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.248
So yeah, here you go.

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.480
Delightful, huh?

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760
Your turn.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.160
It's time to go.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.800
Thanks again to

and letting us try
this thing out.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.983
It's a very
interesting experience,

00:09:57.983 --> 00:10:00.100

are suffering from who are going

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.200
through atopic dermatitis
or severe eczema.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.800
Talk to your doctor
or dermatologist.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.080
Guys, that's all for today.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.640
