00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:16.610
“I reckon ‘Yesterday’ is 
probably my best song.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.140
I like it not only because it was a big success,
but because it was one of the most instinctive

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.500
songs I’ve ever written.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.850
I was so proud of it.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.070
I felt it was an original tune- the most complete
thing I’ve ever written.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.360
It’s very catchy without being sickly”-
Paul McCartney.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.890
“Yesterday”, written entirely (or almost
entirely– read on) by Paul McCartney, is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.780
either the most, or second most, recorded
song of all-time.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.079
(Guinness World Records claimed it was the
most, but this has been contested with others

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.940
claiming George Gershwin’s 1935 “Summertime”
is the true owner of that mantle.)

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.069
Whatever the case, to date, at least 4,000
different versions of the classic “Beatles”

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.449
tune have been recorded by artists as diverse
as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Liberace,

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.660
Tammy Wynette, Daffy Duck (!), The Mamas and
the Papas, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles and Placido

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.660
Domingo.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.749
In the mid-sixties, long before “Yesterday”
was known to the general public, singer Billy

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.810
J. Kramer said he was looking for a new song
to record and Paul played him “Yesterday.”

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.030
Poor Billy turned it down because he said
it wasn’t right for him.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
Chris Farlowe also turned down the number,
telling Paul, “It’s not for me.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.409
It’s too soft.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.659
I need a good rocker, a shuffle or something.”

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.090
So how did Paul come up with it?

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.670
“It was the only song I ever dreamed,”
said McCartney.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.240
Yep, the tune for “Yesterday” came to
Paul McCartney in a dream.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.909
Paul woke up one morning, late in 1963 in
the attic bedroom of Jane Asher’s house

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.369
(Jane was his then-girlfriend) with a complete
melody in his head and set some nonsense lyrics

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.369
to it.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.729
The original title was actually “Scrambled
Eggs.” Paul’s original lyrics were, “Scrambled

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.890
eggs, Oh you’ve got such lovely legs, Scrambled
eggs.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.579
Oh, my baby, how I love your legs.”

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.189
As for the tune, Paul was initially unsure
whether he had actually thought it up himself

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.539
or if he had unintentionally stolen it from
another composer.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.420
He played the tune to the other Beatles and
recalled, “It was like handing in something

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.489
you’d found at the police station and waiting
to see if anyone claimed it.”

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.950
Still unsure, Paul played the melody to several
other musicians and composers, but each one

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.400
assured him they didn’t recognize it and
he hadn’t unintentionally stolen it from

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.680
another source.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.810
After its ultimate release and widespread
popularity with no one claiming the tune,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.900
in every McCartney interview since 1980, Paul
has claimed complete 100% authorship and ownership

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.939
of the song.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:38.480
But, as with so many “facts” in the history
of the Beatles, this now-gospel is disputed.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.819
According to John C. Winn, author of the excellent
Beatles book “That Magic Feeling: The Beatles

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.110
Recorded Legacy,” when Paul first played
the song to his fellow Beatles, it was John

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.760
who suggested the three-syllable title “Yesterday.”

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.340
In a pre-1980 interview, John also stated:
“The song was around for months and months

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.860
before we completed it.”

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.739
(Note the “we”.)

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.250
Lennon continued, in the same interview: “Paul
wrote nearly all of it.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.640
We just couldn’t find the right title.”

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.590
In an interview in March of 1967, Paul also
stated John came up with the title when asked

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.480
by Brian Matthew about the backstory of “Yesterday.”

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.379
John stated, “Ah well, this is John saying
I don’t know anything about that one.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.610
I’ll hand you over to Paul.”

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.700
Paul then stated, “This is Paul, taking
up the story in a holiday villa in Corsica.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.969
Strumming away on a medieval guitar, I thought
[sings] ‘Scrambled Egg.’

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.519
But I never could finish it, and eventually
I took it back in.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.569
With the ancient wisdom of the east, John
came out with [sings] ‘Yesterday’.”

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.599
This is in direct contradiction to a May of
1965 interview in which Paul stated, “I

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.799
remember mulling over the tune ‘Yesterday’,
and suddenly getting these little one-word

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.010
openings to the verse.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.355
I started to develop the idea … da-da da,
yes-ter-day, sud-den-ly, fun-il-ly, mer-il-ly

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:46.355
and Yes-ter-day, that’s good.

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:47.355
All my troubles seemed so far away.

00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:48.355
It’s easy to rhyme those a’s: say, nay,
today, away, play, stay, there’s a lot of

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:49.355
rhymes and those fall in quite easily, so
I gradually pieced it together from that journey.

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:50.355
Sud-den-ly, and ‘b’ again, another easy
rhyme: e, me, tree, flea, we, and I had the

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.355
basis of it.”

00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:52.355
By 1980, John had also changed his tune, saying
in his Playboy interview that “Yesterday”

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:55.769
was entirely Paul’s and that he had nothing
whatsoever to do with it.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.920
“I never wished I’d written it and I don’t
believe in Yesterday.”

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.640
Whether or not “Yesterday” is indeed 100%
Paul’s song or whether John helped in any

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.599
way with it joins the scores of other “Mysteries
of the Beatles” that will undoubtedly remain

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.090
a bit baffling and will be “unsolved completely”
for the ages.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.800
But if we’re not nitpicking, it seems clear
it was a “Paul work,” with a possible

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.580
extremely minor contribution from John.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.390
In the end, it took almost two full years
for “Yesterday” to be recorded after the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.450
original “Scrambled Eggs” version.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.140
According to Beatles producer George Martin,
Paul first played the song for him in Paris

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.990
in January of 1964 and told him he thought
the title “Yesterday” might be “too

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.670
corny,” but Martin assured him it was not.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.230
It was finally recorded officially in June
of 1965.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.520
At first, they tried different ideas, including
with John playing the organ, but eventually

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.330
everyone decided it should be a Paul solo.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.300
Thus, “Yesterday” became the first-ever
“Beatle” song recorded with only one Beatle

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.170
and one Beatle alone.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.070
The other “evolutionary” factor in the
recording was the bringing in of a string

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.830
quartet to back up Paul on the song.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.310
This was quite a huge breakthrough at the
time for a mere “pop record.”

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.190
These two factors were not without minor repercussions-
jealousy from the other Beatles.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.700
(“Yesterday” was to be an early indicator
of the chinks in the armor of early Beatle

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.700
unity.)

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.140
“Yesterday” was released on the Beatles
“Help!” album in 1965.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.510
The song wasn’t released as a single in
Britain until after the band had officially

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.190
split up (the “Yesterday as a single”
idea was vetoed by John, George and Ringo.)

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.560
George Martin knew it was a “Paul song”
and thought it should be released as such.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.160
But Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein quickly
put the kibosh on this idea: “No.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.740
It is the Beatles.”

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.970
According to Martin: “He did not want to
divide his holy quartet.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.090
Though it wasn’t the Beatles at all, it
had to remain so, as part of their recordings.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.260
I don’t think it irritated Paul at the time
because he considered himself a Beatle above

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.340
all other things.”

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.340
True, John did reap one-half of the composing
royalties from “Yesterday” although it

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.690
was “Paul’s baby,” but very shortly
thereafter, Paul would reap the same one-half

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.000
from songs completely written by John (“Strawberry
Fields Forever,” “Come Together,” “I

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.160
Am The Walrus,” “Revolution,” and many
others.)

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.620
When the Beatles began touring in June of
1965, Paul initially didn’t play “Yesterday”

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.760
because he thought it might upset John.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.340
This changed when the Beatles appeared on
“Blackpool Night Out” in August of 1965.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.000
Apparently Paul was right and John didn’t
like this “solo spot” idea and made sarcastic

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.210
remarks all through Paul’s rehearsals of
the song.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.620
(As an interesting sidebar, at the “Blackpool
Night Out” performance, Paul reportedly

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.620
dedicated the song to his ex-girlfriend, Iris
Caldwell.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.620
Other sources claim Iris had once called Paul
“unemotional” and he called Iris up and

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.620
played “Yesterday” to her over the phone
to prove otherwise.)

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.770
On August 14, 1965, Paul performed the song
on “The Ed Sullivan Show”- when he finished

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.060
the number, John Cuttingly said, “Thank
you Paul, that was just like him.”

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.140
George was later to complain, “Blimey!

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.210
He’s always talking about that song.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.220
You’d think he was Beethoven or somebody.”

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.950
Despite the other Beatles’s derision, Paul
was to perform the song solo at many of their

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.750
live concerts during their 1965-66 tours.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.860
Of course, the Beatles all sang a drunk-like,
sarcastic version of the song on their 1965

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.940
Christmas record.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.010
Even the great Bob Dylan joined the anti-
“Yesterday” chorus, saying, “If you

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.830
go to the library of congress you can find
a lot better songs than that… there are

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.650
millions of songs like ‘Michelle’ and
‘Yesterday’ written in tin pan alley.”

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.790
(Ironically, Dylan was to record his own version
of the song four years later.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.190
It was never released.)

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.710
Despite the puerile jealousies of his friends
and colleagues, “Yesterday” remains a

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.750
classic, easily the best-known and most beloved
of Paul McCartney’s legions of compositions-

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.150
his “signature song,” which has been heaped
with numerous accolades.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.480
For instance, in 1997, “Yesterday” was
inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.050
It was also voted the best song of the 20th
century in a BBC 2 poll of music experts and

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.050
listeners.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.400
MTV and Rolling Stone Magazine also named
it the #1 pop song of all-time.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.160
Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) asserts
that “Yesterday” was performed over 7

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.370
million times in the 20th century alone.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:54.770
Not bad for a song whose tune came to the
composer in a dream and that started out with

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:04.330
the lyrics, “Scrambled eggs, Oh you’ve
got such lovely legs, Scrambled eggs.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:31.030
Oh, my baby, how I love your legs.”
