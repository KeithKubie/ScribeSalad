00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.280
Let's get started.
The weekend is over.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.570
Time to get back to work,
back to learning. A few

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.850
announcements.
Tomorrow Quiz 2 based on Homework 2.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
Thursday will be the Periodic Table
quiz. Remember,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.420
all you have to do is fill in the
one or two-letter abbreviation for

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.710
the chemical symbol.
And Friday is the last day of the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:01:04.086
contest, 5:00 PM. Send
it to me by email.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:54.830
You can enter more than once,
if you want. You can have multiple

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.660
entries. You can do the lanthanides
or the actinides or both.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.490
Test 1 will be a week from
Wednesday, and I will say something

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.330
about that later in the week.
And I will be available 3:30 to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.160
4:30 today for office hours if
someone wishes to drop in.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:33.120
Last day we talked about the
validation of the Bohr model.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:23.920
We saw that the Bohr model was able
to correlate the observations of

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.840
Angstrom, which had been formulated
by Balmer. And,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.760
furthermore, the concept of energy
level quantization was observed in

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.690
mercury during the course of the
Franck-Hertz experiment giving

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.610
credence to the notion that
quantization of energy levels is not

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.530
the property of one-electron atoms
alone but is something that is more

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.330
broadly applicable.
So Bohr was validated in very,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.990
very strong measure, but there were
also some contrary data.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.660
And we saw those. First there was
the observation by Michelson who

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.330
back in the late 1880s had done very
precise interferal metric

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.990
measurements of the hydrogen lines
and had observed that the 656

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.660
nanometer line associated with the
transition of n equals 3 to n equals

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.060
2 was, in fact, a doublet.
If you look really carefully,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.180
you could find it was not a single
line but two lines,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.310
and Bohr is silent on such matters.
And then we had Zeeman who

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.430
conducted the experiment of hydrogen
emission spectrum in a magnetic

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.550
field. And he found line splitting
in the magnetic field.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.680
And, furthermore, that the
intensity of the splitting was

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.810
proportional to the intensity of the
applied magnetic field.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.930
Again, the Bohr model silent about
these splitting into

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.070
multiple levels.
And subsequently Starck did the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.230
analogous experiment but with an
electric field.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.380
Again, in an electric field line
splitting observed,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.530
the intensity of the line splitting
varying with the intensity of the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.690
applied electric field.
So there are some problems here.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.840
Sommerfeld came to the rescue in
1916. He preserved the broad

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:34.346
concept of energy levels but put in
some fine structure.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:24.230
And the fine structure involved
taking those levels that Bohr

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.460
quantified with the number n and
assigning to those n levels a little

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.690
bit of energy width so that there is
a plurality of orbits,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.920
some circular, as in the Bohr case,
some a little bit off circular. And

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.150
that bandwidth he called the shell.
This is the shell model. And in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.380
order to label the various orbitals,
as he called them, he introduced two

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.360
more quantum numbers, l and m.
And we saw l and m last day.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.080
And then, at the very end of the
lecture, we saw the last quantum

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.810
number introduced,
sort of a back to the future where

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.540
we brought in the experiment by
Stern and Gerlach where they sent

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.270
the beam of silver atoms through an
asymmetrical magnetic field and

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:33.073
observed deflection,
but deflection in two directions.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:22.870
Deflection up and deflection down
indicating that there was something

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.740
strange that had yet to be accounted
for. And several years later these

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.620
two graduate students at Leiden by
the name of Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.490
proposed that the electron in fact
spins. It doesn't simply orbit the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.370
nucleus, but as it orbits it spins.
And since we don't know the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.240
absolute up and down in the universe,
it is possible that some of the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.120
electrons may be spinning up.
And, according to the right-hand

00:04:46.120 --> 00:05:06.373
rule, they would be spinning,
by our convention, anticlockwise.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And some of them might be spinning
clockwise, in which case,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
according to the right-hand rule we
would consider them spin-down.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And, in any arbitrary crucible full
of molten silver,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
half of them are going to be spin-up
and half of them are going to be

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
spin-down. And,
sure enough, we see the splitting.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And so that is where we left it on
Friday. I thought,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
well, maybe we can now go to the
Periodic Table and figure out what

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:22.230
is going on there.
If we look at the kinds of electron

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.690
configurations we would expect,
when we are at n equals one, which

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.150
is k shell, we know that the
selection rules allow for only one

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.610
value of l, and that must be l
equals zero, which the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.070
spectroscopists would call lowercase
s. And, under these circumstances,

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.530
m must be uniquely zero. And s can
take on values of plus or minus

00:05:44.530 --> 00:06:03.126
one-half. So there are really
two choices here.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:53.830
So there are two electron
configurations in the n equals one

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.660
shell, if we follow according to the
selection rules that we spelled out

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.490
last day. And,
if we go to n equals two,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.330
this would be the l shell.
And when n equals two, well,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.160
l could take on value of zero or one.
And when it takes on value of zero

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:32.586
then m must be zero uniquely.
S can equal plus or minus one-half.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:23.140
We have two electron configurations
when l equals zero.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.280
When l equals one, m can vary over
one, zero and minus one.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.420
S will always be allowed to take
plus or minus one-half.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.560
So I have three times two is six.
All in all, in the l shell, I have

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.710
the possibility of eight different
configurations.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.850
And we will just do one more.
And so when we get to n equals

00:06:48.850 --> 00:07:07.700
three that would be m shell by the
spectroscopists' notation.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
By the way, l equals one would be
the p-orbitals.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And so, in this case,
l could equal zero, l could equal

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
one or l could equal two.
When l equals zero, again,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
m is zero and s is plus or minus
one-half, so I can pick up two

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
electrons here.
In other words,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I have occupancy states for two
electrons.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.500
The orbitals you consider as bins in
which you can throw electrons,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.000
one per bin. Here I have m is one,
zero, minus one. S again is plus or

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.500
minus one-half.
There are six here.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.000
And when l equals two,
m can vary from two down to minus

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.500
two. S, again,
is plus or minus one-half.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.000
So five times two is ten. This
gives me, in total, 18.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:55.460
So this seems to be making sense.
And we talked about periodicity and

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.920
properties, so let's go and take a
look at what we have and see if we

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.380
can reconcile this.
If we look at n equals one,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.840
here is n equals one, hydrogen and
helium. And, indeed,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.300
we have two electron configurations.
And then we are over to lithium.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.760
Well, lithium is n equals two.
Here is 2s1, 2s2 and here are the

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.410
six associated with the 2p.
And then here is 3s,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.240
3s2. And then something is going
wrong. What I have here is there is

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.080
the 3p, there are six of them,
and now it is telling me I should be

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.910
able to put in ten more.
But before I can put in those ten

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.740
more, I am already over to 4s.
Potassium is 4s, and I've only

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.580
finished with 3p.
Clearly, there is something else at

00:08:46.580 --> 00:09:02.726
work here.
In other words,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:58.300
these energy states are not filling
just in ascending n number.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:16.633
We need to add something else in
order to explain what is going on in

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:50.700
the Periodic Table.
And that something else is

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.900
essentially the filling sequence.
What is the filling sequence of

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:22.410
electrons in orbitals?
Just by n, l, m,

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.240
s is inadequate. There is something
else at work here.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.080
It is close but not complete.
And the answer to this question is

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.910
given by the Aufbau Principle.
The Aufbau Principle comes from a

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.740
German word which means it is
essentially construction or building,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.580
build-up principle.
And there are three components to

00:09:46.580 --> 00:10:04.760
the Aufbau Principle.
The first one is the Pauli Exclusion

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.600
Principle which was enunciated by
Wolfgang Pauli.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.000
Pauli was an Austrian who did his
PhD under Sommerfeld in Munich and

00:09:45.000 --> 00:10:11.400
then post-doced with Max Born in
Gottingen and also with Niels Bohr

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:28.266
in Copenhagen.
So you can see these people went to

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:24.540
comparable schools.
They worked with the same people in

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:31.630
this group and kept the vigorous
discussion going.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:38.720
He eventually got a position at the
University of Hamburg where he was a

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.810
Professor of Physics.
And what he said first of all is

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:52.900
that in any system of electrons that
the set of quantum numbers n,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:11:08.933
l, m and s, unique to each electron
in a system.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
That is to say in a given atom.
So each electron has a distinct set

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
of quantum numbers,
the first important idea.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You can think of each electron as
having its own social security

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
number or IP address or something
like this. That is important.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Once we have chosen a certain mix
of n, l, m and s,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
it is used once for that particular
atom.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.500
So that is the first point.
The second point of the Aufbau

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.000
Principle is just energetics.
Electrons will occupy orbitals in

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.500
order of ascending energy,
occupying the lowest energy first

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.000
and up. Clearly,
this n, l, m, s sequence is

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.500
different from the energy sequence
once we get beyond 3p.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.000
So there is something else going on.
Let's talk about electrons.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:12:00.660
Electrons fill orbitals from lowest
energy to highest energy.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:10.330
But there is a wrinkle here.
And that is that the energy levels

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:23.393
themselves change with
electron occupancy.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:24.710
And as you go to higher and higher
levels, those energy levels,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.420
as you saw in the case of hydrogen,
are more closely spaced. The

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.140
differences between those energy
levels are becoming smaller and

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.850
smaller as the n number rises.
And what the second point of Aufbau

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.570
says is that as electrons begin to
fill those levels the differences in

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.280
energy may shift so that in an
unoccupied state certain levels may

00:12:48.280 --> 00:13:07.760
be in the inverse order from how
they are in the occupied state.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.500
We have to recognize this.
Lowest energy to highest energy and

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.000
it is a function of occupancy.
And we will see a few examples of

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.500
that. That is the second part of
the Aufbau Principle.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.000
And the third one talks about the
question of degeneracy,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.500
and it is called the Hund's Rule.
The Hund's Rule talks about

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.000
degeneracy. What do I
mean by degeneracy?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:28.570
Degeneracy is where you have
orbitals of equivalent energy.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:37.140
How do we put electrons into such a
system? Orbitals of equivalent

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:45.710
energy, we strive for unpaired
electrons. And what do I mean by

00:13:45.710 --> 00:14:02.020
that? Let's give a simple example.
A simple example is,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
say, let's look at carbon.
If we look at carbon, if you look

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
on your Periodic Table you will see
this notation next to carbon,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
1s2, 2s2, 2p2. What are we learning
here? This first number here gives

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
the value of n.
So this tells me that this is n

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:22.330
equals one.
And s is this lowercase notation

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.990
that the spectroscopists use in
place of the l number.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:31.660
This is s. S, according to
spectroscopy, means that l equals

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.330
zero. N equals one.
L equals zero. And the superscript

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.990
two is an indication of electron
occupancy. In plain English,

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.660
this says that there are two
electrons in the 1s orbital.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.330
And then we can continue. This is
two electrons in the 2s orbital,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:15:08.660
and there are two electrons in the
2p orbital.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:15:00.750
Another way of displaying this is in
a box notation.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:18.533
Here is 1s, if you like,
k shell. Here is 2s, l shell.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:15:12.250
And then there is 2p. And we know
from over here that 2p has the

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:29.166
possibility of three
different m numbers.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:22.260
And I showed you last day that this
is one case where trying to go in a

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.530
Cartesian space makes sense,
m equals one, zero and minus one

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.790
indicates the three principle
coordinate directions.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.060
And, indeed, people refer to these
as the 2px orbital,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.330
the 2py orbital and the 2pz orbital.
So now let's fill the orbitals.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.590
Let's occupy the orbitals.
And we are going to use the Pauli

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.860
Exclusion Principle and we are going
to use the fact that we fill from

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.300
lower energy to higher energy.
So one goes spin-up and the other

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.920
goes spin-down.
Why spin-up and spin-down?

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.530
Because the fourth quantum number
is s. And Pauli says no two

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:06.150
electrons in a given system can have
the entire set of quantum numbers

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.760
identical. So this one is spin-up
plus a half, this is spin-down minus

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.380
a half. So it is compact notation.
Likewise with 2s, spin-up,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:34.760
spin-down. I have two electrons now
to occupy the p-orbitals.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.500
But these three p orbitals are
degenerate. That is to say they are

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.000
of equivalent energy.
So the Hund's Rule tells me how to

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.500
put them in. And the Hund Rule says
try to go for unpaired electrons.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.000
I will put one up here. And I
cannot have an unpaired electron in

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.500
the same orbital.
That would violate Pauli.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.000
So the only way I can get an
unpaired is to put it alone in

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.500
another orbital.
And I don't care if you want to put

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.000
it over here. I am not going to
fight you over it.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
So the Hund's Rule is telling us to
put the two electrons in separate

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
orbitals unpaired as opposed to we
should not put them in like this,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
like some librarian might want to
fill nicely from left to right,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
up and down. No. No librarian rule.
Bad. Very bad.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Somebody might be sort of a
disorganized librarian and might

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
want to put this one upside down but
over here. Very bad.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
You violate the Hund Rule.
If you violate the Hund Rule,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
you will have to talk about the
appropriate physics punishment.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:25.070
This is the Hund Rule and it
explains electron occupancy.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.150
Now what we can do is look at an
energy level diagram.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:35.220
And this is the energy level
diagram for multi-electron atoms.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.300
And this is posted at the website.
Just to get you oriented, this is

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.380
energy decreasing from zero to
progressively negative numbers.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.460
Stability is at the bottom. N
equals one, l equals s, can

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.140
only be an s-orbital.
L can only equal zero.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.420
So we have two electrons here.
Here is two plus six is eight. And

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.710
now here is two plus six.
And what we see is that 4s lies

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.990
below 3d, according to this set of
rules. And you don't have to know

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.280
this by memory.
I would never ask you to tell me

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.570
what the various energies are from
heart. Instead,

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.850
I would ask you given that this is
the electron occupancy what is the

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.880
explanation for it?
So then you could explain in terms

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.660
of these levels.
You can see 4s, then 3d,

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:37.440
then 4p and then 5s. Let's see if
that happens. Sure enough there is

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.220
the 3s and then 3p.
And now 4s jumps in before the 3d.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:19:01.506
Now these are the 3d elements. And
now 4p. And now this is 5s.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:53.570
5s lies below 4d.
And, likewise, we get over to here

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.140
and finally, look,
here is 5d and 5f almost at the same

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.710
level. And this is an example where
unoccupied 5d lies below 4f.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.280
As soon as lanthanum takes that
electron, this level rises ever so

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.850
slightly, and then we jump down here
and fill in the lanthanide.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.420
But you notice up here how close
these levels are,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:35.106
so we are looking at very,
very fine distinctions.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And here d, of course,
can take the values from plus three

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
down to minus three.
That is seven different m values.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Seven times two is 14. Hence, you
have the 14 lanthanide,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
14 actinide elements. In other
words, everything makes sense here.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And now we can rationalize what is
going on in the Periodic Table.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Not on the basis of simple filling
in ascending order,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
but a modified rate of filling as
according to the Aufbau Principle.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:20:01.190
Things are looking pretty good.
Now what I want to do is take you

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:06.390
exactly to this place where we are
right now, where we see energy

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:11.590
levels and electron filling,
but I want to start all over again

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.790
and I want to use a totally
different approach.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:35.180
I want to get to this same place
now by wave mechanics.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:27.590
I want to get there by wave
mechanics to arrive at the same

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:33.190
place. And what is the same place?
The same place is that energy is a

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.790
function of these four quantum
numbers. And for that I need to

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:44.390
invoke the names of three giants.
And we are going to look at each of

00:20:44.390 --> 00:21:01.180
them and their contributions
in turn.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:56.160
De Broglie, Heisenberg and
Schrodinger. Let's go one by one.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.330
We are going to start with de
Broglie. De Broglie was the child

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:08.490
of French aristocracy.
He was thinking about doing a PhD

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:14.660
in political science and pursuing a
diplomatic career,

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:20.830
but he was also drawn to science.
And finally he decided to pursue a

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:38.193
PhD in physics.
This was in Paris in the early ‘20s.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:32.110
And he was very literary.
The thing about his thesis was it a

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:37.220
very short thesis.
And what makes it great is that he

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.330
began with an interesting question.
You know the old adage. If you ask

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:47.440
a dumb question there is only a dumb
answer. And the thesis is your

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.450
statement. It is what you profess.
Well, the thesis is also,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.360
another way to think of it,
an answer to a question. So de

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.270
Broglie's genius was in asking a
really, really good question.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:07.170
And then he answered it elegantly
in a very small number of pages.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:12.080
I want to read sort of my
encapsulation of his question.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:31.026
If a photon, which has no mass,
can behave as a particle --

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:21.400
And we know this.
Sometimes we model light as beams

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.790
of light, as rays of light.
And sometimes we model light as a

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:30.190
wave. And that doesn't bother us at
all. Light can behave as a particle.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.590
In some cases it helps us to think
of it that way.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.990
Other times it behaves as a wave,
and that is the way it helps us to

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.390
think and rationalize what we
observe. If a photon which has no

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.790
mass can behave as a particle,
does it follow then an electron

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:52.420
which has mass can behave as a wave?
1920. Bohr started talking about

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.280
quantization. Now de Broglie is
saying I am going to go further.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.140
I am not only going to say that we
have quantization in the motion.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.990
We are going to say that the
electron behaves as a wave.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.850
One more time. It is beautiful.
This is tautology. Ask not what

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.710
you can do for your country,
etc. If a proton which has no mass

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.570
can behave as a particle,
does it follow that an electron

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:26.590
which has mass can behave as a wave?
And, if so, he says this is what

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.790
that electron wavelength would be.
Let's first of all associate him

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.990
with this. De Broglie,
1924, in his PhD thesis says if an

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:42.190
electron has wavelike properties
this would be its wavelength.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:47.390
There is no hc over lambda. The
electron is not moving

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:52.230
at the speed of light.
He has to have some other expression

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:56.690
for it. It is the ratio of the
Planck constant to its momentum

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:01.150
**lambda = h/p**.
And this is just a Newtonian

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:05.610
expression of momentum,
the product of the mass of the

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:10.070
electron times its instant velocity.
That is what he said. What are the

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.530
consequences of that?
How can we go somewhere with that?

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:33.060
Now, you recall in Bohr the quantum
condition.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.500
Bohr expressed the quantum condition
by the angular momentum,

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:10.000
quantum condition in the following
manner. Bohr said that the angular

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.500
momentum, mvr is quantized where n
is this integer counter h over 2 pi.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.000
This is the proportionality that is
multiplied by the quantum.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.500
If de Broglie is correct, we could
then model the electron in its orbit

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:32.000
not moving as a particle,
but let's model it as a wave.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:56.900
So what kind of a wave is it?
There are only two kinds of waves.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.810
There are traveling waves and there
are standing waves.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.720
Well, this is in a stationary orbit
so we need to have a standing wave.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.630
Not to scale. Let's imagine this
is the electron in its orbit.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:16.540
It is in a standing wave
configuration. There is

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.750
a geometric constraint.
In order to have an electron in a

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:27.250
stationary orbit this implies
standing wave.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:32.750
And a standing wave means there is
a geometric constraint which is what?

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:38.250
I have to have a whole number of
wavelengths to get around the

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:43.750
circumference.
So the circumference is 2 pi r.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:49.250
And if it is going to be a standing
wave then this must be an integral

00:25:49.250 --> 00:26:07.300
number of wavelengths.
But de Broglie has told us that the

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
wavelength is related to the instant
velocity through this formula.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So let's substitute in. That will
give us 2 pi r goes as nh over mv.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And I can cross-multiply here.
That will give me mvr equals nh over

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
2 pi **mvr = nh/(2*pi)**.
The quantum condition of Bohr falls

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
out of the three line derivation if
you accept de Broglie's hypothesis

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
that the electron in this set of
circumstances can be

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:36.360
modeled as a wave.
So he got his PhD thesis,

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.080
and in 1929 he gets the Nobel prize.
He is off to a flying start.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.810
Einstein read the thesis and loved
it. He loved it.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:50.540
But what do we care what Einstein
says? Einstein is only a

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.270
theoretician and de Broglie is a
theoretician, so one theoretician

00:26:55.270 --> 00:27:15.140
propping up another theoretician,
this is a mutual admiration society.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.500
We need what? We need evidence.
We need experimental evidence.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.000
Let's go back to high school for a
moment, just by way of background.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.500
Remember these water tanks where
you could put a vibrator in a water

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.000
tank. And this is top view of a
water tank. And if you had a motor

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.500
here that was causing a paddle to
move up and down you could cause

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.000
waves to form at one end of the tank
and move from left to right.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:31.720
And, furthermore,
you can do little experiments.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.450
For example, you could put a dam in
the middle of the tank.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:41.180
And if the distance between the
wall and the dam was large in

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.900
comparison to the wavelength then
what happens? If this distance is

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.630
large in comparison to the
wavelength, this dam simply

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:56.870
casts a shadow.
It is like light casting a shadow.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:04.620
So this is simple. When d is large
in comparison to lambda the

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:12.370
obstacles cast shadows.
And this is equivalent to modeling

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:20.120
the wave fronts as particles.
This is ray optics. This is the

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:27.090
equivalent to ray optics, isn't it?
You don't have to know anything

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:33.290
about wave-like behavior.
You have a front coming here.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:39.490
You have an obstacle. Where it can
get by it moves through.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:45.690
But in the other case where the gap,
this d spacing,

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:51.890
when the d spacing was small in
comparison to the wavelength the

00:28:51.890 --> 00:29:10.313
obstacles did not cast a shadow.
The obstacles did not cast a shadow.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
You did not see a tiny, tiny little
stream coming out of each of these

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
orifices. Instead you saw this.
Recall. You weren't sick that day,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
right? You were there. You
remember this.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Now, this is diffraction.
And there is no way to explain this

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
phenomenon if you model the water as
having particle-like properties.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:35.330
You have to invoke wave-like
properties. Only by using wave-like

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:42.660
properties as an explanation can you
describe diffraction.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:57.853
Invoke wave-like properties to
explain.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:54.830
De Broglie has said electrons,
under certain circumstances, can be

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:59.660
modeled as behaving as though they
are waves. What is going to be the

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:04.490
experiment? We need to come up with
an experiment in which the electron

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:09.330
is going to be forced to behave as a
wave. We are going to go to the

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.160
United States,
1927, Bell Labs.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:31.920
This is fast. Look,
de Broglie was 1924.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:23.420
The thesis is written in French over
in Paris. Somebody is reading the

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.850
literature. They are top of this.
And they do a beautiful experiment.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.280
What do they do as their experiment?
People have been working with

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.710
x-rays for about 30 years by this
time. And there is a technique

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:41.140
known as x-ray diffraction.
And x-ray diffraction allows us to

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.560
characterize solid matter.
It is so important, in fact,

00:30:45.560 --> 00:31:04.720
we are going to study it in 3.
91 in detail next month.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.500
But for now let's simply say that we
have a diffraction which we know

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:41.000
occurs only by wave-like behavior
and it involves the use of x-rays.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.500
Why x-rays? Well, the wavelength
of x-rays is on the order of about

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.000
an angstrom. If there is
diffraction and the wavelength is

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.500
about an angstrom,
clearly the feature that the x-rays

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:03.000
are diffracting from must
be, likewise, dimension.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000
It has got to be small.
What is really small that would fit

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:19.000
this? Atomic spacing.
Interatomic spacing is also on the

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000
order of about an angstrom.
What Davisson and Germer did was

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:53.750
constructed an elegant experiment.
They took a crystal,

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:59.250
this is a single crystal of nickel
that has regular planes of atoms,

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:04.750
and those planes are spaced on the
order of an angstrom or less apart,

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:10.250
and they irradiated this with x-rays.
This is h nu.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:15.750
X-rays coming in.
And they looked at the result.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:21.250
And the result is a diffraction
pattern that produces

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:26.570
a series of rings.
You have a single beam coming in,

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:31.710
and you end up with rings. And
these rings are indicative of the

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:36.850
crystal structure of nickel and can
be explained only by invoking

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:41.990
wavelike properties of light.
Here is the critical experiment.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:47.130
If de Broglie is correct, let's
irradiate the nickel crystal with a

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:52.280
beam of electrons where the
wavelength of the beam of electrons

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.420
is identical to the wavelength of
the x-rays that were used

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:15.873
and see what we get.
So we use the de Broglie formula.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.500
And now we repeat the experiment,
only this time we come with an

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.500
electron beam.
And the wavelength of the e beam is

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:57.500
equal to the wavelength of the
x-rays that were used previously.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:22.790
The moment of truth.
Photographic plate.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:28.390
What do they see? Circles.
Electron diffraction was born.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:33.990
Electron. This is the e beam.
There is no way that you could

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:39.590
irradiate a crystal of nickel with a
single beam of x-rays and get that

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:45.190
circular ring pattern if the
electron beam were behaving as a

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:50.760
particle beam only.
So this validates de Broglie and it

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:56.300
also validates the whole concept of
wave-particle duality.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.840
Wave particle duality had been
applied to photons.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.380
People are very comfortable talking
about individual photons,

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.920
but now we can talk about waves of
matter. And so if you say de

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:18.460
Broglie's name to many physicists,
the tagline they associate with de

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:36.520
Broglie is "matter waves" as
distinct from light waves.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:27.840
We have waves of light.
We have waves of mater.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.690
That is important. That is number
one. I have to get you over to

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:35.530
where we were earlier this morning.
Number 2, we are going to Werner

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.380
Heisenberg. What did he do?
Well, he studied with Pauli.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.230
He and Pauli were buddies in
graduate school.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.070
They worked for Sommerfeld.
You know, Sommerfeld never won a

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:51.350
Nobel prize.
But we should count how many Nobel

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:56.070
prize winners he educated in his
group. There was something very,

00:34:56.070 --> 00:35:00.780
very important going on in the
mentoring process there.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.490
Heisenberg gets his PhD with
Sommerfeld in Munich and then goes

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:10.210
to Copenhagen to work with Bohr.
And he was getting burnt out so he

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:14.920
decided to take a vacation.
He went up North from Denmark to a

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.640
deserted island of the coast of
Norway and stayed there

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:26.620
for about three weeks.
He came back, and with him he

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:35.870
brought the Uncertainty Principle.
And what he said was that when you

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:45.120
get down to atomic length scales
there are limits,

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:54.370
there are constraints on our ability
to observe. At atomic length scale,

00:35:54.370 --> 00:36:01.090
limits on our ability to observe.
And this is important because it

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:05.270
means that since we cannot observe,
we cannot talk about individual

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:09.450
electrons. We are going to have to
stop doing that because we cannot

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:13.630
find an individual electron.
Every observation we make involves

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:17.810
the exchange of energy.
When I am looking at that wall,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:37.220
its photons are hitting the wall and
coming back to me.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:26.300
And so the photons hitting the wall
actually put pressure on the wall,

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.610
but the pressure is so low. Who
cares? But you might say why does

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.920
that make any difference?
Well, suppose I want to look at

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.230
something like an electron in orbit
here. We know that this dimension

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:43.530
is roughly one angstrom unit,
right? The Bohr radius, for

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.840
hydrogen is 0.
29 angstroms. Round numbers,

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.460
this is one angstrom.
Well, if I want to look at this,

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.390
I want to have very accurate
capabilities in terms of the energy

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:02.330
that I use, the light that I use.
So I would choose something that

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:07.260
has a wavelength of roughly an
angstrom. You wouldn't measure the

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:12.190
dimension of a human hair with a
yardstick, so I need something on

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:17.130
this order. If I take lambda equals
one angstrom, go through hc over

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:22.060
lambda, you will discover that the
energy of a photon with one angstrom

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:40.986
as its wavelength is on the order of
12,400 electron volts.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:30.830
Well, I am looking for this electron.
What is the binding energy of the

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.660
ground state electron in hydrogen?
It is 13.6 electron volts. So I am

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.490
going to go and I am going to look
for something that has an energy of

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.330
13.6 electron volts holding it in
place, and I am going to use a

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:46.160
flashlight with 12,
00 electron volts. I think I am

00:37:46.160 --> 00:38:05.920
liable to disturb the very thing I
am going to measure.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:54.460
You say, well,
why are you doing something so

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.920
foolish? Why don't you use
something that has much lower energy?

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.380
OK, let's choose something that has,
say, a hundred times less than that.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.840
This will be 13.6 over 100 electron
volts. Well, if I go through that,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.300
the wavelength of such a photon is
going to be so big that I am back to

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.760
measuring the dimension of the human
hair with the yardstick.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.930
So now you see the dilemma.
If I want to get down to very,

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.810
very fine dimensions, I have to
bring huge energy and disturb the

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.680
very thing I am going to measure.
So this is the Uncertainty

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.550
Principle. It leads to uncertainty
in the measure.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.430
Suppose I asked you to time a 100
meter spring in the Olympics,

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.300
but I give you a stopwatch that is
measured in units of 15 seconds?

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.180
Well, these people are blasting
through it, nine seconds and change.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.060
You have a whole bunch of runners
and five of them have all run it in

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.140
under 15 seconds.
I guess the whole batch is running

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.420
under 15 seconds.
And all you have is either zero or

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.710
15 because that is your resolution.
What does that tell you? It tells

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.990
you that you cannot resolve what is
going on at that level.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.280
In fact, there is something else
you cannot resolve.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.570
You cannot resolve causality.
When the uncertainty gets that big,

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.850
you don't know which came first.
Cause and effect below a certain

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:32.766
level of definition is blurred.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:29.150
Cause and effect,
that becomes uncertain,

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:33.300
too. This is philosophical,
as a lot of this physics should be.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.460
What does it mean? It means that
we better get away from these

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.610
deterministic models where we have a
little electron here with its

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:45.760
potential energy and its kinetic
energy. And it is moving around and

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.920
we are sitting on that electron
watching it go about

00:39:49.920 --> 00:40:07.806
its daily affairs.
Those models are not going to work

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:42.500
anymore. What we see as a result of
Heisenberg is the shift from

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:49.500
deterministic models.
In other words, we cannot talk

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:56.500
about individual particles.
Deterministic models are now giving

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:22.810
way to probabilistic models.
Now, instead of talking about

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:28.450
individual particles,
we talk about ensembles of particles.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:34.090
I don't know where any one of them
is, but I can tell you on average

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:39.720
where any one of them is likely to
be. But I don't know where any one

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:45.360
of them is. This means there is no
more chicken and egg.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:41:04.053
It is chickenality and eggness,
understand? Everything is blurred.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:55.660
And to just give you a sense of what
this is, the analytical expression

00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.330
that Heisenberg gave in one of its
forms is that the uncertainty in the

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:04.990
momentum of a particle times the
uncertainty in its position,

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:09.660
this is the uncertainty. Not the
value of the position.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.330
It is the value plus or minus
something. This is the plus or

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:33.460
minus, so the product of the
uncertainty and the momentum.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:23.280
And since we are not expecting the
mass of the particle to change,

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.570
what we really are saying is the
uncertainty in its velocity times

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.850
the uncertainty in its position is
greater than the ratio of the Planck

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:36.140
constant divided by 2 pi.
He put a quantitative limit on that.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.420
And so I went through the math on
this and said suppose I wanted to be

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:44.710
really sloppy and I wanted to say if
the delta X, the uncertainty in

00:41:44.710 --> 00:42:03.086
position is on the order
of one angstrom.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:53.760
In other words,
I just want to know where the

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.530
electron is somewhere within the
shell radius of the ground state of

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:03.300
atomic hydrogen anywhere.
I don't even care if you try to put

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:08.070
it at the heart of the nucleus.
Anywhere from plus 0.5 to minus 0.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:12.840
angstroms. All around. If you
plug in the numbers,

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:17.610
you will end up with an uncertainty
in the momentum as being

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.140
on the order of 15%.
A 100% uncertainty in the position

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.420
gives rise to a 15% uncertainty in
velocity. Well,

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.710
what does that tell you?
It tells you that any attempt to

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:34.990
try to specify,
to localize the position of an

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:39.280
electron in such a system is futile.
You are not going to be able to do

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.570
it. And that is even without
relativity. It gets even worse.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.850
It is impossible to specify
accurately the position

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:52.300
of the electron.
And the second thing is that the

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.920
observer is part of the observation
through that interaction.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.530
The way he described is when you
try to get down a quantum dimensions

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:06.150
and you are standing there with your
camera, just remember the sun is at

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:10.760
your back and your shadow is always
in the picture.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:15.380
You disturb the thing that you try
to measure. That is number two.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:33.893
Now number three. Let's go to
Erwin Schrodinger.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:25.450
Erwin Schrodinger also an Austrian.
He was the University of Zürich and

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.900
was getting burned out,
too. It was Christmastime 1925.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:36.360
He said I had it, so he headed off
to a villa in the mountains,

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:41.810
Christmastime 1925. Came back and
just after New Year's 1926 and gave

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:47.270
us wave mechanics.
That is what he did over his

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:53.330
Christmas vacation, wave mechanics.
So Christmas 1925 to New Year's 1926,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:59.990
what did you do for your Christmas
vacation? Oh,

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:06.660
I got wave mechanics.
That is what I did. Wave mechanics.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:13.330
What he did was took de Broglie
motion of the electron as a wave and

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:29.793
developed a wave equation
for such matter waves.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:24.610
And the thing about what Schrodinger
did was all he imposed on a system

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:29.220
was the electron behaves as a wave
and is bound. That is to say it is

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.840
confined to the atom.
He did not invoke the quantum

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:38.460
condition, but he gets to the
quantum condition.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:43.070
That is the brilliance of
Schršdinger. I want to give you an

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:47.690
analogy. I am going to show the
equation, but I don't expect

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:52.070
you to solve it.
You will have to have a little more

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:56.210
math, a little more physics to do
that, but I am going to talk about

00:44:56.210 --> 00:45:00.350
something that you are familiar with.
And that is a violin string.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.490
Let's take the situation where we
take a violin string and we pluck it.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:08.640
I am going to graph this.
This is the y coordinate and this

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.780
is the x coordinate.
The violin string extends from x

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.920
equals zero to x equals L,
and we pluck the violin string.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.060
What do we have here?
This is a bound system.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:25.190
It is bound. And so there are only
two kinds of waves that can exist on

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:29.330
this violin string,
standing or traveling.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:33.460
Well, if this thing is going to
vibrate for any length of time it

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.590
better be a standing wave.
And what do we have here? Well,

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:41.730
we know one solution to this is the
following. I am going to solve it

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.860
graphically and I am going to solve
it analytically.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:46:05.253
You know, there is another solution.
It could do this.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:54.390
The ends are fixed.
That is all I am doing.

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.790
But there is another solution.
I could do this. I could call this

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:03.190
n equals one, the fundamental
frequency. And I could call these

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:07.590
others n equals two,
n equals three. These are harmonics.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.990
You know them as harmonics or
overtones. And the mathematics of

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:16.390
that equation involved a double
derivative in time of x plus some

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:20.790
constant times x equals zero with
some constraints on it.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:25.410
**x'' + k^2 x = 0**
And the solution to this equation is

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:30.240
y equals A cosine kx plus B sine kx
**y = A cos kx + B sin kx**.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.080
All I have done is said I have a
fixed system here.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.910
What comes out of the math is that
the value of k,

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:44.740
there are multiple values,
there are multiple solutions.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.580
I just showed you that you can have
a single wave, a double,

00:46:49.580 --> 00:47:06.993
a triple and so on.
It turns out it is n pi over l.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:42.500
**k = n*pi / l** The modes of
vibration in that string are

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:49.500
quantized. There is a plurality of
solutions that conform to the

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:56.500
boundary conditions,
which is that the system must be

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:22.140
bound.
What did Schrodinger do?

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.420
Schršdinger said I am going to take
that same idea,

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.710
and I am going to apply it to a
larger scale system.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:34.990
And what he does is writes this
equation here.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:39.280
This is the Schršdinger equation.
It is a wave equation. It is in

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.570
complex notation and so on.
And the solution to this equation

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.850
looks like this where it is written
in terms of a quantity

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:53.330
called a wavefunction.
C is the wavefunction.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:59.990
And the wavefunction is clearly
nonphysical, but what we do know is

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:06.660
that we can take the product of the
wavefunction times its complex

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:13.330
conjugate. And this is proportional
to the probability of finding an

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:29.393
electron. And this is
a function of space.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:25.630
Finding an electron in a region of
space. This actually gives rise to

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:31.270
a set of orbitals.
The second thing is,

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:36.900
just as in the case of the violin
string, the wave equation,

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:42.540
as posed by Schršdinger, has a
plurality of solutions.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:48.180
And the plurality of solutions have
discrete values associated

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:53.400
with them.
But when you solve the Schršdinger

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.200
equation, you don't get just a set
of solutions that are dependent upon

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:17.666
one number. You get a set of
solutions that are dependent upon --

00:48:43.000 --> 00:49:10.590
These quantum states fall out of the

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:15.790
solution to this equation.
No condition imposed from the

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:33.580
beginning that there must
be quantized states.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:26.270
Instead, we have a certain energy,
we have certain geometric

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:31.540
constraints, we have a certain
energy constraint and these fall out.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.810
We have multiple solutions.
These are termed the eigenvalues.

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:42.080
In math, when you see multiple
value solutions,

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:47.360
these are eigenvalues.
And these wavefunctions are the

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:52.250
eigenfunctions.
Now we are back to where we started.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:56.750
We are back over to E as a function
of n, l, m and s,

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:01.250
only we got there through this other
torturous route.

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:05.750
And here are the samples of the
wavefunctions.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:10.250
And you can see,
we will take this up next day and we

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:14.750
will have a look at what the orbital
shapes look like as a result of

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.950
plotting this. See you Wednesday.
