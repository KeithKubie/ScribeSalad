00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.451
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.560
And today we have a
treat, Carol Barnes,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.220
who's recognized for
groundbreaking research

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.640
in the neurophysiological
basis for changes in learning

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.870
and memory as humans age.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.690
She directs the Evelyn
McKnight Brain Institute

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.080
as a regents professor in
psychology and neurology

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.540
and a fellow of the
American Association

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.720
for the Advancement of Science.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.700
Carol earned her bachelor
of arts in psychology

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.610
from UC, Riverside,
her MA and PhD

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.220
from Carleton
University in Ottawa.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.410
She has been conducting
brain-related research

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.210
for more than three decades.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.400
Her work provides the
basis for understanding

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.640
the basic mechanisms of
normal aging in the brain

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.200
and sets a background
against which

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.390
it's possible to
assess the effects

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.900
of pathological changes,
such as Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.460
It's really important
to recognize

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.020
she was one of the
first people that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.700
tried to put a baseline on what
it is to have normal aging.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.340
You can't really
figure out if you're

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.040
sick if you don't know what the
normal baseline is all about.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.580
So please welcome our
distinguished speaker today,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.370
Carol Barnes.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.716
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.970
Thanks for this
wonderful turnout.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.510
It's wonderful to see
you all here tonight.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.240
Now, if I can make the slides
work, we'll have a go here.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.560
Yes.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.485
One of the greatest
scientific puzzles, at least,

00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.360
it's kept my attention
for many years,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.970
is how the brain
captures and preserves

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.360
the unique experiences
of each individual.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.300
This organ gives us
our own identity.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.910
It gives us the
ability to understand

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.640
other great mysteries
that exist around us.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.300
Now, the importance of memory
was appreciated, actually,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.140
very early on.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.410
For example, in
Egypt, the god Thoth,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.600
shown here in
several depictions,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.660
was the god of learning,
memory, and wisdom.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.650
And in Egyptian mythology,
Thoth had the responsibility

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.520
of governing affairs
involving memory.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.500
In Greece, it was Mnemosyne
who was the goddess of memory.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.860
Mnemosyne was one of Zeus' wives
and the mother of the Muses,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.920
the goddesses that were the
spiritual source of emotion

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.480
and the arts.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.610
Amongst the earliest
written accounts

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.840
that describe the idea that
memory changes with age

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.430
come from Aristotle's treatise
On Memory and Reminiscence

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.570
of about 350 BCE.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.630
He describes there why the
very young and the very old

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.940
are defective in memory.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.130
"They are in a state
of flux, the former

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.520
because of their growth, and the
latter owing to their decay."

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.790
He went on to explain
that like running water,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.000
no impression would
remain in younger persons.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.670
And in older persons,
the impressions

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.330
would be inscribed less well
because his receding surface

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.490
would be frayed or deteriorated.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.920
Now Montaigne, someone
somewhat closer

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.770
to the present, who
is described often

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.500
as the father of
modern skepticism aptly

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.620
commented on issues
of aging and memory,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.704
particularly with respect
to his own aging memory.

00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.120
As you see here
and, he says, "I'm

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.800
obliged to call the
men who serve me

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.590
by the names of their
offices or their provinces,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.000
for I find it very hard
to remember a name."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.890
This very clearly
describes something

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.580
that has come to be called
tip of the tongue phenomenon.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.770
And it's a very active
research area currently.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.840
It's a state when
you just can't quite

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.810
recall the name of a
person that you know

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.319
or a word that describes
the essence of what

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.360
you're trying to express.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.690
It just doesn't come to you.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.900
So this happens increasingly
frequently as we age.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.240
Now, before we fast-forward
to the current views

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.540
about the brain and
mental competence

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.850
during aging, what I need to do
is give you a few definitions

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.670
so we're all on the same page.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.030
So we'll start with we'll
start with senescent.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.060
It's a word that refers
to an organism of old age.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.140
It carries no necessary
implication of infirmity.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.130
Senile, on the other
hand, is a word

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.040
that implies dementia
or mental incompetence.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.420
And dementia, of course,
describes a range

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.450
of symptoms that can be
caused by specific diseases

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.000
and results in a
decline in memory

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.920
and other skills severe enough
to affect your daily life.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.000
Now, the most common
forms of dementia

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.250
are Alzheimer's disease, which
has a specific pattern of brain

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.710
pathology that's characteristic
in the individuals that

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.740
have it, and it tends
to have a gradual onset.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.520
The other main form of
dementia is vascular dementia,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.800
which is caused by
one or more strokes

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.570
and is typically
more abrupt in onset.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.740
Now, even 50 years ago, the
prevailing view of old age

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.300
was that if you
live long enough,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.090
you would become senile.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.340
And today we know that
becoming senescent

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.100
does not imply senility.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.690
Alzheimer's disease and vascular
dementia are not inevitable.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.650
Now, when I talk this
evening about aging,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.920
my focus is on
aging of the brain

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.700
and what this means for
successful mental lifespan.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.300
This is a complementary topic
to the longevity and lifespan

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.790
extension that you
heard about last week,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.410
the lecture from [? Yanko ?]
[? Nicolet ?] [? Zugic. ?] Now

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.450
my focus is on the brain,
so let's go to the brain.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.190
The brain is composed primarily
of two types of cells, neurons

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.510
and glia.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.070
Example cells are shown here.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.650
The magenta-colored
cell is one nueron

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.690
in the olfactory part of
the moth brain that responds

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.010
to many, many different odors.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.390
And the green-colored cell
is one complex glia cell

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.610
in the same part
of the moth brain.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.550
Now, these images were provided
to me by good colleagues

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.000
here at UA, who do
fantastic neuroscience.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.760
But as you can see, are truly
at the interface of where

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.690
science and art meet, I think.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.290
Now a mature human brain weighs
about 1,500 grams, 3 or 3

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.780
and 1/2 pounds.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.090
And recent improvements in
whole-brain cell counting

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.610
methods have given us
an updated estimate

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.050
of the numbers of cells in
each of these categories.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.750
For humans, as of
2009, we think there

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:23.700
are about 86 billion
neurons and 85 billion glia,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.560
about a one-to-one
glia-neuron ratio overall.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.450
I guess-- I'll just
make a comment.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.520
It's nice to talk about
something in the billions

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.355
or more that's other
than our national debt.

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:36.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.840
So while the glia
neuron interactions

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.660
play a critical role in brain
function and in brain aging,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.090
tonight I'm going
to focus on neurons.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.000
And this is because these are
the elements in the brain that

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.570
hold our memory.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.380
I need to give you
two more definitions

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.700
before we go further.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.450
When I refer to the
cortex of the brain,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.800
this is what I'm referring to.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.680
This is the outermost most
part of the brain shown here

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.090
in a human brain.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.980
And in many animals,
this part of the brain

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.890
has many foldings,
highly folded, which

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.460
gives it an uneven appearance.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.070
F here stands for the frontal
lobes or frontal cortex.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.700
T, for example, stands
for temporal lobe

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.090
or temporal cortex.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.990
And what you can't see from
the outside of this picture

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.210
are the areas and
underneath the cortex.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.740
And these are referred
to as subcortical areas.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.330
These are examples of--

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.919
now you've gotten
all the definitions.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.700
These are human cortical
cells, their neurons

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.600
from the temporal cortex taken
from people of different ages.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.840
And this is history.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.090
This is a summary
of what was thought

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.460
to happen to neurons during
the aging process when

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.450
I became interested in aging
in memory in the early 1970s.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.490
Now before I describe
this in more detail,

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.230
I need to give you
one more definition.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.320
You may know that
neurons are what's

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.970
called postmitotic cells.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.740
They do not re-enter
the cell cycle

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.170
like, for example,
skin cells do.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.450
And because neurons do
not undergo cell division

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.599
after they're formed, they do
not show telomeric shortening

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:24.140
like other [INAUDIBLE]
tissues, which

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.260
you heard about from
both previous speakers

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.760
in this lecture series.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.480
So your neurons are born
largely before your birth,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.050
and they die with you
at the end of your life.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:43.180
So if this classic view of
brain aging was correct,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.510
then neurons of a
20-year-old maybe up to 60

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.580
would look pretty good.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.060
But this example cell
from a person who was 90

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.660
would be very shriveled, and
presumably, dysfunctional.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.030
Now, by the way, this picture is
still in many textbooks today.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.070
But we know now that this
depiction of brain aging

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.240
is wrong.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.830
This is because-- yes.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.960
This is because the
data that supported

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.894
these conclusions were flawed
for at least three reasons,

00:10:16.894 --> 00:10:17.810
and I'll tell you why.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.580
First, the early
experiments included

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.057
people who had a dementing
illness of some sort, probably

00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:26.890
Alzheimer's disease.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.740
So they use
contaminated samples.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.320
Second, the cell
counting procedures

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.500
that they used in these
early studies were faulty.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.010
We now have new, mathematical
assessment approaches

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.850
for counting cells free
from artifacts that

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.540
were a problem in the past.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.840
And finally, and probably
the most disturbing,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.740
is the fact that there may
have been experimental bias

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.760
in these studies.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.800
Now, no scientist sets out
to have experimental bias.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.060
But unless you actively put into
place methods that prevent you

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.580
from influencing your
own measurements,

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.750
it's possible to confirm your
own experimental expectations

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.310
Inadvertently.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.710
Now, an example of
this inadvertent bias

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.130
might be if say your
expectation is that there is

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.570
cell death in the aging brain.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.530
Then you might notice more
shriveled cells in a brain

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.040
that you knew was old than
in the brain that you knew--

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.480
that you thought was,
or knew, was young.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.230
One can do this
quite unconsciously.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.390
Interesting to this audience,
perhaps, is the fact

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.390
that this scientist,
Paul Coleman,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.000
who uncovered the problems
with these older studies

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.260
is currently here in Arizona
at Banner Sun Health Research

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.790
Institute.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.970
I met Paul at a
conference in Luxembourg

00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.730
in 1979 where these ideas about
neuron degeneration and aging

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.040
were just being
presented and debated.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.250
In this old photograph--
there's Paul and there's me.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:11.950
And in his lecture,
Paul presented

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.300
data that did not support
the picture of deteriorating

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.310
neurons in older
individuals that I just

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.100
showed you previously.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.970
Rather, in his lecture,
he attributed his findings

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.130
to the fact that first he used
individuals who were aging

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.770
normally, were not demented.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.220
Second, he uses these new,
unbiased cell-counting

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.120
methodologies, and he used
an experimental design that

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.950
required him to be blind to the
identity of the group in which

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.790
he was counting cells, so he
was blind doing his cell count.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.030
In fact, in the end,
Paul saw just as many

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.860
of those shriveled neurons in
younger individuals, younger

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.380
brains, as he did
in older brains.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.070
Now I must say, at
this meeting, his data

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.950
were met with a
lot of skepticism

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.090
by those who held onto the
dogma that aging essentially

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.340
is equivalent to disease.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.400
Now, I think that if you
were here last week and heard

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.640
[? Yanko ?] [? Nicolet ?]
[? Zugic's ?] lecture,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.120
he provided compelling
evidence last week that aging

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.760
of the body is not
equivalent to disease.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.130
And I'm about to
describe why this is not

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.670
an appropriate analogy
for the brain either.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.430
But first, you need to know
what an old person who is, so--

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.769
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.640
Later, I'll tell you what
old is in other mammals.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.140
But for people in
the United States,

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.540
the age at which you're
considered to be old

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.400
was statistically determined
by actuaries in 1935.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.720
And at this time, the prevailing
norm of retirement age

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.130
was 65 years.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.110
So when the social
security system

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.840
was launched in that
year, the US committee

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.640
on economic security selected 65
as the official retirement age

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.180
from surveys of existing
pension systems.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:17.600
Now the life expectancy at
birth in 1935 was 62 years.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.420
But today, 65 has remained the
conceptual transition point

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.050
into old age.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.670
And 65 is actually used in
most studies of the aging

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.380
brain in cognition today to
define at least a young-old age

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.690
group.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.140
But the actual age
at which people

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.000
choose to retire now,
as everybody knows,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.570
has been creeping up,
along with life expectancy.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.890
Now as you've already heard
about from both other lectures

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.920
in this series, life expectancy
at birth in the United States

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.480
is currently around 78 years.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.040
Japan is the oldest
large country,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.810
with an average life expectancy
of birth of 82 years.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.350
And the United
States is about 50th

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.500
in line, in terms of
longevity as a country,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.210
while micro states like Monaco
have a life expectancy at birth

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.769
close to 90 years of age.

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:17.560
Now, you'll be hearing
much more about this

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.970
from [INAUDIBLE] in a subsequent
lecture in the series.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.730
Now as an aside, when you're
looking at life expectancy

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.690
figures, these figures
can be very confusing.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.630
So I just want to draw your
attention to two things

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.130
quickly.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.810
First, you need to pay
attention to whether this

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.240
is an average of male and
females longevity figures.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.200
So this is the average.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.370
But females, on
average, live 81 years.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.230
Male, 76 years in
the United States.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.940
And you also need
to pay attention

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.330
to whether it's calculated
from birth, as it is here,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.660
or whether it's calculated
from a different age.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.220
So say from 65, of course,
the life expectancy goes up.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.040
If you live to 65, you're going
to make it, probably, to 84.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.340
If you live to 75,
to 87 and so forth.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.340
So just for your
own information.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.320
OK, defining prevalence.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.820
What we're interested
in with respect

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.390
to this particular lecture
is normal brain aging

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.670
distinct from diseases
of the brain that

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.760
can affect mental activity.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.080
And for dementia, the aging
demographics and memory studies

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.930
is the first study
in the United States

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.050
that used a nationally
representative sample

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:33.460
across all of the United States.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.930
They included individuals from
all regions of the country

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.930
and used very rigorous and
time-intensive assessment

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.780
tools.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.270
So here are the best
figures that we have.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:51.190
In the United States, 14%
of people 71 years and older

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.500
have dementia of some sort.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.780
Considering all dementias,
if you take this 14%,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.890
all dementias Alzheimer's
disease is the most prevalent

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:05.300
at 70%, and vascular
dementia is next at 17%.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.230
Now, the prevalence of
dementia, of course,

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.859
depends on the age
bracket you consider.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:18.020
If you look at the age 71
to 79 years, only 2.3% of us

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.810
will have Alzheimer's disease.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.740
Whereas if you look at the
age range over 90 years,

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.589
it will go up to 30%.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.460
Now, the actual numbers
of people over 71

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:35.570
who have dementia, those
14%, is staggering.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.220
But one must keep in perspective
that a rather small proportion

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.890
of us will be demented
at the average life

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.590
expectancy of 78 years.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.770
That is about 5% in
the United States.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:53.620
So for this talk, I'm going
to leave discussion aside

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.250
concerning these 14%.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.530
And what I'll focus on
for the rest of the talk

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.620
is what happens to the
brain and cognition

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.520
in the rest of the 86% of
us who are aging normally

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.570
and who may live to 100.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.440
Now, you might ask, well,
what do you mean by cognition?

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.400
Well, I'll just
briefly describe it.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.370
Cognition involves taking in
information and remembering it.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.500
It involves applying knowledge
gained through experience.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:31.032
It involves making decisions
and changing preferences.

00:18:31.032 --> 00:18:31.740
All these things.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.230
So the focus of this
talk is I'm going

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:40.900
to really focus on the memory
component here for today.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.670
All right, what
I want to do next

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.190
is to review some
fundamental observations

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.540
about brain aging that
hold true across mammals

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.740
and are critical for
human aging and memory.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.000
And--

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.660
Whoops.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.750
And this slide--
where's Joaquin?

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.980
This slide-- I've shown
you first a human brain.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:14.510
Next, a baboon, an elephant,
a zebra, a sheep, and a rat.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.860
And many of you are probably
going to be really disappointed

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.730
with me.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.260
I looked high and low.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.790
But as Shane Bridges introduced
you to the naked mole rat

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.620
in his lecture, but I couldn't
find a whole photograph

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.630
of in any of the
brain collections

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.250
that I had access to.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.400
So we don't have
the-- whoops, sorry.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.250
We don't have the
naked mole rat.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.480
So even though today
no one believes

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.800
that somewhere around 65
years of age senility sets in,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.060
and which is a commonly held
view only several decades ago,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.880
most now believe that even
if one is disease-free,

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.640
there are lifespan
changes in memory

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.010
that we should expect to happen.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.080
And these, of course, are
at least slightly annoying.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.040
Right.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.580
Different cortical regions,
different regions of the cortex

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.250
are involved in different
cognitive functions.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.440
And these cortical
regions develop

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.810
and they age differently
at different rates.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.730
So, for example, if you
take the frontal lobes

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.900
that I pointed out
to you earlier here

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.980
in the human brain,
this region of cortex

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.030
is the last portion of
the brain to develop.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.210
And it's only mature in
your early 20s or so.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.450
And interestingly, this area
of the brain is among the first

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.600
to show a decline during aging.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.740
It's, in fact, this
frontal cortical region

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.160
that's involved when you,
say, walk with determination

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.220
to the kitchen, you have to do
something, and then by the time

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.790
you get there you
forget what it was

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.960
that you were determined to do.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.640
And what you'd planned
to do, of course,

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.598
was to take out the lunch
from the refrigerator

00:21:03.598 --> 00:21:08.790
so you wouldn't forget it
on your way out to work.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.545
And this kind of memory
is called working memory,

00:21:11.545 --> 00:21:13.420
where you're trying to
keep something in mind

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.780
for a short period of time.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.000
And this depends on structures
within this frontal lobe

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.200
region.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.840
So while I want to make
you aware that there

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.870
are important changes with
aging in the frontal cortex,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.270
and actually, in a number
of other important brain

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.180
structures, the
focus of this lecture

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.060
will be on a structure
in the temporal lobes

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.375
down here, specifically,
the hippocampus.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.410
OK, so the reason for the
focus on the hippocampus

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:48.700
include the fact that the
biological mechanisms of memory

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.830
were discovered
in the structure.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.340
And the hippocampus is
thought to be the main gateway

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.300
to lasting memories
in the brain.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.990
Furthermore, changes
in the hippocampus

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.400
are known or a major factor in
age-related memory impairment.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.650
This is a picture-- it's a
beautiful picture, I think,

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.100
of the hippocampus in a
cross-section of what's

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.580
called a brainbow
transgenic mouse, where

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.860
different colored
fluorescent proteins can

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.540
be labeled in different subsets
of neurons in this structure.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.380
You might ask, how do I
know that the hippocampus is

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.060
critical to lasting memories?

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:29.560
Well.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.250
One answer to this question
is that the hippocampus is--

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.510
if the hippocampus is damaged
in humans or in other animals,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.300
memory is severely impaired.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.570
There have been a number
of famous amnesic patients

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.980
who were unfortunately to
have both hippocampi removed.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.320
And from then on,
effectively, they

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.555
could not lay down
any lasting memories.

00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:57.280
[INAUDIBLE] amnesics are left
with old memories and episodes

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.230
of experience that were stored
elsewhere in the cortex.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.390
But they can't incorporate
new experiences.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.740
One specific type of memory that
the hippocampus is involved in

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.330
is spatial memory.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.240
It's kind of memory that
allows us to find our way

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.780
through our environment.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.660
It's the kind of
memory that will

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.980
allow you to find your car when
you get out of Centennial Hall

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.590
or to point to the stadium--

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.220
I might be wrong--

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.210
the stadium from here.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.350
So an example of how we
know the hippocampus is

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.740
critical for navigation
and spatial memory

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.340
is a positron emission
tomography study, a pet study,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.410
that allows you to measure brain
activity bioglucose metabolism.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.900
Eleanor Maguire and her
colleagues in London

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.300
had taxi drivers recall
a route that they

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.990
could take if they were
told to pick someone up

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.890
at a specific location,
say, a Grosvenor Square,

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:03.160
and then to drop them off
somewhere else, say Elephant

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.670
and Castle.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.440
So they would just
recall these routes

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.030
while they were in the scanner.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.420
And when the taxi
drivers did so,

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:16.707
the right hippocampus was
powerfully activated, seen here

00:24:16.707 --> 00:24:18.040
in three different brain levels.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.410
This shows the
average activation

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.990
over 11 taxi drivers.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.520
So these are the kind
of data to support

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.670
the idea that the
hippocampus is fully engaged

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.190
in spatial navigation.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.160
Now, I just want to
segue here a bit.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.670
Spatial learning and memory,
and why emphasizing it,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:40.210
has been very, very important
for the study of the biology

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:45.850
of memory and how that kind of
how memory changes with age,

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.530
because it doesn't
require language.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.320
Because this type
of memory can be

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.230
tested under similar
conditions across species,

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.830
spatial memory can be
studied in some detail

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.440
in animal models of aging.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.210
Now rats are not good models
of tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.980
that Montagne complained of,
but they are great for learning

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.710
about the brain mechanisms
of spatial memory.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.640
Now, the subtitle
of my talk today

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.970
might be that aging
memory doesn't just

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.060
happen to those of
us who can study it.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:27.250
But it happens across
the animal kingdom.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.020
Because of this, we
can learn a great deal

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.510
about the fundamental
principles of aging brains

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:36.010
by studying animals who
also show brain and memory

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.560
changes as they
reach the maximum

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.300
of their respective lifespans.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.840
OK, unfortunately-- so I
have to tell you again,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.650
unfortunately, the spacial
cognition of the naked mole rat

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:48.775
has not been studied.

00:25:48.775 --> 00:25:49.341
[CHUCKLING]

00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:49.840
No.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.000
While they appear to
be cancer-resistant,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.150
they are resistant to a number
of forms of oxidative stress

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:00.070
and they live for a very
long time for their size.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:07.090
We do not know whether their
genetic makeup also prevents

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.790
brain and memory changes
with age, something actually

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.480
that should be studied and
may be worth a trip to Kenya

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.575
or Ethiopia where they live.

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:20.200
So a number of
tests have been used

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.900
to show that the acquisition
of new spatial maps

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.560
is defective in older
ages and across species,

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.560
and most of these studies
involve spatial navigation.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.770
So I'll give you examples
in the rat, in the monkey,

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.890
and in the human where
spatial memory has been shown

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.620
to be impaired during aging.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.240
OK, my choice of
memory tests to show

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.730
you is an example for rats.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.050
Can you imagine having a rat
apparatus named after you?

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.850
I mean, this is not something
to be proud of, probably.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:58.590
Anyway, we developed this
task in the mid-1970s,

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.360
specifically for old rats.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.360
The object is to
navigate to one place

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.360
where escape is possible
into this dark box.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.520
Rodents really don't like
brightly-lit. open spaces.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.060
And so they learn to find
this dark escape box.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.050
So the rat begins
by being let out

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.680
of the can in the
middle of the circle.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.530
And then he makes
a couple of errors,

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:30.010
and then he finds it and
descends into the escape box.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.030
So the consistent finding
here between age groups

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.300
is that old rats do not remember
this location of this tunnel

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.300
from day to day as well
as do younger animals,

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.730
suggesting a spatial
memory deficit.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.980
Now for rats-- I told you I
would tell you what an old

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.970
rat--

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.420
other animals-- defined aging
and other animals as well.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.610
And the definition
of old in the rat

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.990
is typically the 50% mortality
point, which is equivalent

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.510
to about 65, 70 human years.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.822
And for the rats that I study,
it's about two years of age--

00:28:00.822 --> 00:28:01.530
two years of age.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.490
So the very much more popular
spatial memory task, actually,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.650
for rats--

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.920
and partly because it's faster
to train, more expedient,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.244
is the Morris swim task,
which I'll show you now.

00:28:14.244 --> 00:28:15.660
And I don't know
whether you know,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.060
but rats are actually
rather good swimmers.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.280
And, in fact, in
the wild, they've

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.190
been observed to
catch fish in streams.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.100
And in this task, they can learn
to navigate to the one place

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.140
in the pool, which
is here, where

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.840
there's a hidden platform.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.310
Again, old rats show less
accurate spatial memory

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.900
compared with young
rats on this task.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.860
For example, if a young
rat was put in the pool,

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.990
they would take a
bee line directly

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.220
for the platform from
where they were released.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.370
So old rats have
visual memory deficits.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.640
Monkeys are also a good
model of normative brain

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.070
and cognitive aging in
humans for many reasons,

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.340
but for the purposes
of this talk,

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.100
it's important that,
of course, there's

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.550
a high degree of
similarity between brains

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.140
and these primate species.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:12.330
And they also show spatial
memory impairments in aging.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.210
Now, just in case
you are wondering

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.000
whether these performance
changes in aging

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.370
may be due to changes
in motivation,

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.860
maybe the older animals
just have some wisdom,

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.750
they just don't want to
play our silly games.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.690
I want to show you
a video clip of one

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:36.360
of our old and wonderfully
engaged monkeys.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.970
She's doing a complex visual
discrimination problem.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.780
These LEGOs are hard
for me to discriminate,

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.230
so you want to do the movie now?

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.615
So she-- whoops.

00:29:50.615 --> 00:29:53.001
Yeah, nope.

00:29:53.001 --> 00:29:53.501
Nope.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.330
Can you put it right on the--

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.650
yeah, there you go.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:05.790
So the door is up,
and she gets it right.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.369
She gets her gummy bear
strawberry she really,

00:30:08.369 --> 00:30:08.910
really likes.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.930
And sometimes she
doesn't get it right.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.510
Now, for bonnet macaques
or recess monkeys,

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:19.380
you multiply their age by 3 to
get the equivalent human age.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.970
So a 27-year-old
monkey is equivalent

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:25.460
to an 81-year-old human.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.770
So clearly, these old
animals really enjoy

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.800
coming out and playing
and are highly motivated.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.140
So most important
for this talk is

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.860
the fact that monkeys also
show spatial memory impairments

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.060
as they age.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:43.710
When old recess macaques have to
remember where they've already

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:49.456
acquired food in one of these
food boxes around the platform,

00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:51.330
they have to remember
where they've gotten it

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.640
and not to go back
to that place.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.380
Old monkeys make
many more errors

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.740
than young, the data being
consistent with the poor use

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.320
of spatial navigation
strategies in these animals.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.820
For humans, I will show you
a study conduct but conducted

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.510
by Mary Newman and Al Kaszniak.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.610
Al gave one of these lectures
in the Mind and Brain series.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.490
Older adults in this experiment
also showed memory problems

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.800
in a task analogous to
the circular platform

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.470
in the swim task
that I showed you.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.490
This human test involved
remembering where in the room

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.380
to place this marker pole.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.960
So they go in with the
experimenter into the room.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.460
The participant and
the experimenter

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.350
go in, look at all
the cues, see where

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.850
the pole is, they
take the pole out,

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.560
and then have to
replace that pole.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.860
And older adults were not
as accurate as younger

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:43.410
participants in finding a
consistent place, an accurate

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.340
place for the pole.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.860
So this is at least consistent
with spatial memory deficits

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.300
in older people.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.680
So the point to
take home here is

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.530
that in all species
that have been tested,

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.260
there are changes
in memory and tasks,

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.490
suggesting that
the hippocampus is

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:01.170
a structure vulnerable to
normative aging process.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.870
Now, why do I think
this is important?

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.290
I think is really important
because of all animals,

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.950
it's only humans
that spontaneously

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.510
develop Alzheimer's disease.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.750
And so other animals
who, by definition,

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.260
are Alzheimer's disease
free, do show memory changes

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.330
across the lifespan.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:23.550
So we can make the inference,
then, that changes in memory

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.860
are a normal part of
the aging process.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.350
So what happens in
the aging hippocampus

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.930
to cause these kinds of
spatial memory changes?

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:40.800
Well, this next slide shows
three hippocampal cell types.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.400
These are neurons
from the rat, and all

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.870
are filled with fluorescent
dye, granule cells,

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.600
and two different types
of pyramidal cells.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.140
And one thing we can
be confident does not

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.650
change or contribute to
hippocampul-dependent memory

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.492
impairment is cell loss.

00:32:59.492 --> 00:33:00.950
Because when
hippocampal cells have

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:05.330
been counted, such as these,
in rats, mice, dogs, monkeys,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:10.700
and humans, we keep the same
numbers of these neuron types

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.610
across our entire lifespan.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.670
There's more good news, at
least for those of us who

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.610
are hoping to age successfully.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.440
And that is the fact that many
cell functional properties

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.890
are very well-preserved
in the aging brain.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.360
In animals, it is possible to
examine activity of live tissue

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.340
in vitro or in a dish.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.100
You can take-- the
hippocampus can

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.180
be kept alive with artificial
cerebral spinal fluid

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.587
and oxygen for about a day.

00:33:43.587 --> 00:33:45.170
And with these
techniques, we've found

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.340
that most biophysical properties
or electrical properties

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.070
of these neurons
are quite intact.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.440
So the old cells are healthy.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.440
And if you didn't
know which dish

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:03.080
had the tissue from the
older rat or the younger rat,

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.370
you wouldn't be able to tell
the difference between these,

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.780
in large part.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:14.750
So the question is, then,
what is normal aging?

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.969
If, at least in the
hippocampus, there's

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:21.320
little cell loss and the
cells that remain are healthy,

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.630
why do we have memory change?

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.370
Well, to understand
this, we need

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.739
to ask a question
about how memories

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:30.080
are formed in the brain.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.480
Now, we've already
reviewed the fact

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.179
that the brain is composed of
171 billion cells, about 86

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.013
billion of which are neurons.

00:34:40.013 --> 00:34:44.600
Now neurons are made up of three
primary compartments-- the cell

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.860
body here, which contains
the nucleus and most

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.250
of the genetic
material of the cell,

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.409
the dendrites, which
receive most of the input

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:58.970
from the incoming information
from other neurons,

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.850
and the axons, which
transmit information

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.870
from one cell to another.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:07.220
Now, most communication
in the brain

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:12.260
occurs by one cell sending
electrical impulses

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.655
from this axon to the next cell.

00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:17.030
And you may have
heard about this

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.770
or learned about this
from Leslie Tolbert

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:22.640
when she gave her lecture on her
talk in Mind and Brain series.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:28.280
Now, at the end of
the axon, the signal

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.620
causes synapses to
release chemicals

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.550
across a small gap, which
cause electrical disturbance

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.300
in the next cell.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:43.010
Now this is one synapse at high
magnification you see here,

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.150
very high magnification.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.030
It's one micron across.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:55.400
And while you do not lose
hippocampal cells as you age,

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.950
older humans and other animals
where synapses been counted

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.010
have found to lose synapses.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.760
So in aging, you do lose
these synaptic contacts.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.360
So one reason the brain
network communication

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.120
is changed during aging
is because there's

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.110
a loss in the numbers of these
connections between neurons,

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.380
loss synapses.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:23.030
But how is memory stored
in these brain networks?

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.030
Well, the famous Canadian
psychologist, Donald Hebb,

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:34.040
predicted in 1949
that the alteration

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.980
in the strength of the
synaptic connections

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:41.720
is the change in the brain
that underlies memory.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.930
Now, another way to
remember this is--

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.470
one way to remember this
is a saying that Carla--

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.000
that can be attributed
to Carla Shatz, that is,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.450
cells that fire
together wire together,

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.280
implying that
synapses that converge

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.470
onto the same cell of a neuron
will become strengthened.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.170
And another way
to try to remember

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:07.190
this is also from Carla--
out of sync, lose your link.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.880
And this implies that the
timing of the synoptic activity

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.900
is critical for this synoptic
strengthening to occur.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.800
Now, Hebb was talking
about this in 1949,

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.640
but it was not until 1973 that
the Norwegian scientist, Terje

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.960
Lomo, discovered the
biological process that

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.250
seemed to fit his postulate
in the mammalian brain.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.990
And this biological process was
called long-term potentiation.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.120
Now, Lomo's discovery
was to find a way

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.760
to measure and
modify the strength

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.820
of these synaptic
connections in the brain.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.930
So LTP-- LTP is
the strengthening

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.380
of synaptic connections, and it
can be experimentally induced

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.530
by delivering patterned,
electrical stimulation

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.610
to the axons that mimic the
normal kind of firing patterns

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.200
that occur in the brain.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.280
This experimental stimulation,
then, results in cells

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.920
firing to together and
then wiring together,

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.100
the outcome being an increase
in synoptic strength.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.670
When a synopsis is stronger,
it produces a larger

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.790
electrical response in the
cell that it's connected to.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:26.110
And so it's believed then
that a mechanism like LTP

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.800
is used by the brain
to store experiences.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.860
Now, if memories are
stored as increases

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.220
in synaptic strength of the
connections between cells,

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.030
what happens in the aging brain?

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.550
Well, when I studied LTP
at hippocampal synapses

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.570
in older rats, not only
is there a synoptic loss,

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.540
but LTP is changed.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.060
There is altered plasticity
at the synapses that

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.100
remain in the older animals.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.100
Under some
conditions, LTP can be

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.080
induced powerfully
and effectively

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.500
and in both young and--

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.140
oh boy, sorry-- both
young and old rats.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.930
But the decay of
this modification

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.030
in synaptic strength
is about twice as fast

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.060
and the older as it is
and the younger animals.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.660
In this example, about
20 versus 40 days.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.570
And this change in
plasticity mechanism

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:23.620
was correlated with how good
the animal spatial memory was.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.530
So durable, long-term
potentiation

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.140
at your hippocampal
synapses was predictive

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.250
of good memory in this circular
platform spatial memory task

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.710
for both young and old rats.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.410
So clearly, the
plasticity mechanism

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.100
used for information storage
in the nervous system

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.660
is compromised in old rats.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.880
And this appears
to be correlated

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.510
with individual differences
in memory performance.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.480
Now, the changes with age
that I've talked about,

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.420
changes in numbers of
synaptic connections

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.410
and function or plasticity
of hippocampal connections

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:03.490
obviously could alter the
cellular dynamics of networks

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.990
in hippocampal neurons.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.410
Now, the data I'm
going to show you next

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.450
uses single unit
recording methods

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:14.710
that isolate the activity of
many single hippocampal cells

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.000
at once in a freely
behaving rat.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.230
Now you can use fine electrodes
the diameter, really,

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:27.580
of a hair that can be
surgically implanted into rats.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.960
And the brain does not
have pain receptors.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.540
So there's no sensation to
this insertion of these probes.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.850
In fact, electrodes used in
rats are very much smaller,

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:43.870
but that they're very similar to
those implanted, in principle,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.990
into those implanted in
people to deliver deep brain

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.610
stimulation, for
example, to relieve

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.430
drug-resistant symptoms
of Parkinson's disease

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.770
or in cases of
severe depression.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.380
So the idea is that
you can record activity

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.690
of groups of these
hippocampal cells

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.710
while the rat's
running through space.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:03.370
Now, I have to
admit, my old rats

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:08.320
aren't quite as champions
like this Norwegian rat is,

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.700
but they do run
around smaller tracks.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.310
And so looking at
how groups of cells

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.770
are active when animals
are free to behave

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.440
provides just a bit
different window

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.510
for viewing how
the brain becomes

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.770
modified through experience.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:29.590
So it's possible to amplify
the small electrical signals

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.140
generated by neurons
and to effectively

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.070
listen to the symphony of the
brain if you're wired up right.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.350
So next one I'm going
to do is let us all

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:43.560
listen in on the activity
of one hippocampal neuron

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.970
as a rat walks around
a circular platform.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.530
So you can see the rat walking
around the circular platform.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.040
He's connected to
the recording system

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.260
in the computer by cables.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.790
So let's see if the
movie will play,

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:58.510
and if you can hear the cells.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.534
So--

00:41:59.534 --> 00:42:00.450
[SOUND OF CELL FIRING]

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:04.330
--that is the discharge of
a single hippocampal neuron.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.490
And by watching
this video, you can

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.100
see that single cells
in the hippocampus

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.410
increase their firing
rates when an animal is

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.260
in a particular place
within an environment.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.400
And when John O'Keefe
first noticed this property

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.650
of hippocampal cells
in the late 1960s,

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:24.370
this is why he called these
hippocampal cells place cells.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.520
Now, the area over which
the cell fires here

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.800
is called that
cell's place flied.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.980
And you can see the place field
represented by yellow dots

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.090
here.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.070
Now presumably, the
firing pattern, then,

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.680
of many cells over
a given space form

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:44.410
to produce a cognitive
map of the environment

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:50.320
that O'Keefe and Nadel described
in their very well-known book,

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.210
The Hippocampus As
a Cognitive Map.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:56.290
You heard Lynn speak in an
earlier Mind and Brain lecture

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:57.220
series, I think.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.830
So when I refer to a hippocampal
map on the next slide,

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:02.380
I simply mean the
distribution of place fields

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.760
of different cells over
a particular space.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.780
Now, with new recording
methods partly developed here

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.480
in Arizona, many
hippocampal neurons

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.460
can be recorded
at once while rats

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.990
are running around a track.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.937
And this is a triangular track
that I'm showing you here.

00:43:21.937 --> 00:43:23.770
I'm just showing you a
few of the cells that

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.340
are simultaneously recorded.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.940
And this is from a younger
rat on two different sessions,

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.720
session one, session
two, on the same day.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.910
Now, you see that the
same hippocampal map

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:39.460
is retrieved in session two
as was there on section one.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.017
So the yellow cell
still fires here.

00:43:42.017 --> 00:43:44.350
So these are-- the different
cells are different colors,

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.630
and the dots are the spikes.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.460
So yellow cell is still
here, the blue cell here,

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.010
the red cell is
here, and so forth.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:55.030
So the young rats retrieve
the same map from session

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.680
to session.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.240
And actually, most of the time
older rats also show accurate

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.710
map retrieval.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:07.870
But about a third of the
time for any given old rat,

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.080
a completely different
place field distribution

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.010
appears when the old rat
goes back into the same room.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.850
It's as though the old rat
had retrieved the wrong map.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:23.050
And you can see that the blue
cell is now firing over here.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:26.530
The orange cell didn't
fire at all in section one.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:30.190
So the observation that
a completely different

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.650
neural activity
pattern can emerge

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:36.010
in the presence of the
same physical stimuli

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:38.290
at the very least
indicates that it's

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.500
going to be more difficult
to integrate episodes

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.150
into the context
in which they're

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.080
experienced in older animals.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.900
And this may be partly
responsible for why

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.160
older organisms more
frequently become lost.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.350
Certainly, if you're trying
to find your way around Tucson

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.820
and you're using
a map of Phoenix,

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.730
you're not going to be
navigating very well.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:03.340
So it appears that--

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:09.040
--that memory changes
can occur without changes

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.630
in neuron numbers and with
high functioning of most cell

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.560
properties.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.800
But there are very
specific neural correlates

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.890
of memory change that
do arise during aging.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.160
These include fewer cinematic
connections, reduced plasticity

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.980
of these connections, and how
the network works together

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.350
in the case of the hippocampus
to achieve accurate cognitive

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.670
map retrieval.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.610
So clearly, the behavioral
expression of memory

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.450
does change with age.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:42.010
And this appears to be a
normative biological change

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.320
in age of populations,
that is, as it

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.500
occurs across many mammals.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:52.540
But if you do live to 100,
become a centenarian, what can

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.500
you expect to happen to your
brain and your cognition.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.960
Well, in fact,
studies do indicate

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.140
that the longest-lived people
can have high cognitive

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.867
function in spite of these
functional changes in the brain

00:46:04.867 --> 00:46:05.950
that we've just discussed.

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:10.360
Now today, the oldest living
man is Jiroemon Kimura.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.810
He lives in a small town
in the Kyoto prefecture.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:16.700
He worked in a post
office for about 40 years.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.330
And he retired and went
into farming, which

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.340
he continued through his '90s.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.980
His wife died many years ago,
but he had seven children.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.710
And he reportedly
is particularly

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:29.260
fond of red bean curd and rice.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.440
Now, when asked about
his secrets of longevity,

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.930
he says it's his
own interpretation,

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.230
but maybe it's due to some
unknown forces of nature.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.610
I don't know.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.790
Now, the oldest person
who is currently alive

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.750
is Besse Cooper.

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.110
She's a remarkable woman who
received a teaching degree

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.180
from East Tennessee
State University

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.840
after she graduated
from high school.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:55.240
And she moved to Georgia
because the salaries were better

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.830
in that state.

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:58.930
She married and
outlived her husband

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.330
by nearly half a century.

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:04.100
And she has four children.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.520
She says that the secret
to her longevity-- and this

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.600
was on her 113th birthday-- was
that she minds her own business

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.033
and she doesn't eat junk food.

00:47:12.033 --> 00:47:13.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:18.160
So perhaps-- perhaps the
most remarkable example

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.450
of this extreme longevity
was Jeanne-Louise Calment,

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.120
the woman who was born and
lived in Southern France

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.610
to be over 122 years of age.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.660
She ate brie, French bread,
drank red wine her whole life.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.358
She stopped smoking at 90.

00:47:33.358 --> 00:47:34.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:39.760
She was 14 years old when
the Eiffel Tower was built,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.660
and van Gogh bought paints
from her family's paint shop.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.910
Now, to give you some
perspective on the changes

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.560
that she witnessed
in her life, she

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.190
was born when Ulysses
S Grant was president

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:57.580
and she died when Bill
Clinton was president.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.390
So Madam Calment
is the only person

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.870
with documented birth records
that has lived to 122 years.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.410
So she represents the
longest-lived person

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.800
in our species.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.010
So far, she has no peers.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:14.350
And another way
of saying this is

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.720
that any one of us
in this room has

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.120
a one in six billion chance
of living to that age.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:20.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.220
So each of these individuals
that I've just told you about

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.220
have exhibited very high
levels of cognitive functioning

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.990
at extremely old ages.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.270
And as you learned
about last week,

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.690
extending health span of the
body is a fundamental goal

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.300
of immunobiologists
like [? Yanko, ?]

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.270
and extending the
health span of the brain

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.030
and successful mental
lifespan is a fundamental goal

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:45.520
for neuroscientists like me.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:54.900
So I have told you
that 14% of US over 71

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.490
will not enjoy successful
mental lifespan.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:06.270
But for the 86% that will, how
does this add up when I've just

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:09.160
told you that changes
do occur during aging,

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.090
including changes in
memory, changes in the way

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:15.750
the brain stores information,
fewer synapses, and changes

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:19.080
in how networks of
cells work together?

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.100
What does this mean
for successful aging?

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.820
Well, I can offer at
least one potential answer

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.770
to this puzzle.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.350
There has been a
fundamental shift

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:32.820
in thinking about
the brain aging

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.440
over the past several decades.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.230
We now believe that
the brain does not just

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:41.880
sit back and
passively deteriorate.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.880
This passive deterioration view
of aging is probably wrong.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.570
We now believe that
in successful aging,

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.750
the brain is constantly
adapting in ways that

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.660
suggest outright compensation.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.570
And I'm going to give
you two examples.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:03.390
One animal experiment, one human
experiment to illustrate this.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:06.450
The animal experiment
is one that I

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.330
conducted that started with
the following observation

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:10.530
in question.

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.990
We know that some of these
hippocampal neurons from older

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:18.420
rats have lost up to a
third of their synapses.

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.630
And the neuron needs a
certain amount of input

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:24.780
to become active and
to discharge a spike.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:28.050
You know, like that the
spiking you heard in the movie.

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:30.390
Now in the face of
this reduced input,

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:35.100
how do these cells
manage to ever fire?

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.490
Well, we were able to show that
the way the hippocampus solves

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.130
this reduced input
problem is to make

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.210
the individual synapses that
remain in these older animals

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:48.660
stronger so fewer synapses
can discharge that neuron.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.110
So this is evidence for
biological compensation

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:55.700
during aging at the
single-synapse level.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.940
Now at the network
level, the observation

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.170
is that retrieval of
salient past experiences,

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:06.780
say, from last week, a
year ago, 10 years ago,

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.870
can be quite good
in older people.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:13.320
The hippocampus participates
in the encoding and retrieval

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.760
of this type of
information, and we

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.880
know that this part of the
brain changes with age.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.050
We've just spent the last 45
minutes talking about that.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.080
So I'm going to describe
an experiment that

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:29.940
suggests that older adults can
recruit additional circuits

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.360
to achieve accurate recall.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.840
So Maguire and Frith designed a
study to look at brain activity

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.210
during retrieval of old
memories while people

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:43.510
were scanned in the MRI.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.990
Now when participants
in this experiment

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:48.600
were asked to retrieve these
memories in the scanner,

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.530
you see that the left
hippocampus was activated,

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:54.730
becomes active in older people--

00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:00.870
activated in younger people,
while both the left and right

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:04.270
hippocampi become activated
in older individuals.

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:09.510
So the neural circuits recruited
for equivalent performance

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:12.840
in aged individuals
can be different.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:18.660
And this may potentially
reflect adaptive compensation

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.460
of the aged brain.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.880
Now I've given you these two
examples, one from animals one

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.960
from humans.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.690
But presumably,
adaptive changes will

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.780
be observed to occur at the
molecular, the cellular,

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.320
the network and behavioral
levels in future experiments,

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.530
and many people are
working on this today.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:43.650
So finally, since the brain can
clearly adapt during the aging

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:49.950
process, how can we facilitate
that adaptation and optimize

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:51.210
cognition?

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.790
Well, a number of
us working on this

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:57.910
at the University of Arizona
and around the state.

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:00.990
And this is the primary focus
of the research going on

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:04.590
at the Evelyn F
McKnight Brain Institute

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.960
here at the
University of Arizona.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.510
The primary purpose
of this institute

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.960
is to understand the biological
basis of memory decline

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.400
in normal aging and to find
ways to promote brain health

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.900
and cognition.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.260
So what I want to do now is
just to end with some recent--

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.720
so unpublished and
some published work

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.930
of colleagues here that are
affiliates of the Institute

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:33.450
and give examples of experiments
that involve exercise,

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:36.180
anti-inflammatory treatment,
identification of gene

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.090
pathways important for memory,
and cognitive training.

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:43.200
And so I'm going to start
with Gene Alexander.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.870
Gene is a professor in the
Department of Psychology

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:49.110
and part of the Scientific
Advisory Board for the McKnight

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.120
Institute.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.290
Gene and his colleagues
have analyzed

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.230
whether there's a
relationship between the level

00:53:55.230 --> 00:54:01.740
of physical fitness and markers
of a healthy brain across age.

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:08.340
So they studied 123 individuals
between the ages of 50 and 89,

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.290
and he used magnetic
resonance imaging

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:14.610
to compute brain network
patterns that best accounted

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:19.140
for the volume change in the
brain of older individuals

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.380
in that study,
which you see here.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.150
After they did
the MRI, they also

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.040
determined aerobic
fitness scores

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.070
for each of these individuals
from treadmill tests.

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.920
And they found that the
better your fitness level,

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.520
the less of this aging
brain pattern that you have.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.560
So better fitness, less
of the aging pattern.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.700
Of course, this suggests a
relationship between exercise

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.980
and healthy, aging brains.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:52.050
So if you need a good reason
to go take a daily walk,

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:52.830
this is it.

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.480
[CHUCKLING]

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.710
It's really quite exciting.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:00.210
OK, so Lee Ryan.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:02.580
She's a professor in the
Department of Psychology

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:05.070
and part of the Scientific
Advisory Board for the McKnight

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.250
Institute as well.

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:08.220
She also has a really
intriguing new study

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:12.860
suggesting that the control
the brain information

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.450
maybe optimal for brain aging.

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:19.630
So Lee and her colleagues
looked at two groups of age

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.360
and education-matched females.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.490
They're all living
independently,

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.450
age ranges from 52 to 92 years.

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:29.460
And selection of the
participants into groups

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.430
was based on whether
or not the participants

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:36.810
used non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs.

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:40.560
The controls did not
use these NSAIDS,

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.320
and the NSAID group
obviously did.

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.010
The mean drug use was 10 years
for this particular group,

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:51.150
and the minimum was four years.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:54.540
So let's just look at
the control group here.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.550
There was a significant
decrease with age

00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:00.210
in brain volume in frontal,
parietal, and temporal regions,

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:03.090
indicated by these
red shaded regions

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:08.100
here in the very brain
areas that we know play

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.650
an important role in memory.

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:15.090
Now, over a similar age range,
if you look at the NSAID users,

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:19.260
this group showed dramatically
less brain volume change,

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.480
as measured by fMRI.

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.070
So this suggests that there
may be a protective effect

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.520
of anti-inflammatory drugs on
age-related decreases in brain

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.460
volume.

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.360
And these decreases in brain
volume are in gray matter.

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.990
That's where the dendrites
and cell bodies are.

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:39.960
But Lee is now using a
different method, diffusion MRI

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.010
technologies, that allow a
closer look at the regions that

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:46.660
are connected by the axons.

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:49.890
And she's looking at whether
these connections are

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:53.740
preserved to a greater extent
in the older NSAID users.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.750
And these experiments are
ongoing and quite exciting.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:01.140
The next study that
I'm going to mention

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.570
was a group effort between
the University of Arizona

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:07.620
Translational Genomics, or
TGen, Anderson Health Research

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.720
Institute, and Arizona State.

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.490
Matt Huentelman--

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:13.396
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:14.510
Oh, boy.

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:18.770
Matt Huentelman, Eric Reiman,
and Heather Bimonte-Nelson all

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:20.990
affiliates of the
McKnight Institute.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:25.100
Now, my colleagues had been
involved in an extremely

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:30.645
interesting genome-wide
association study in humans--

00:57:30.645 --> 00:57:37.640
sorry-- that identified
a gene called KIBRA.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.460
And KIBRA accounts
for a significant part

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.480
of the normal variation
in memory ability.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:52.330
Now, this better memory is
associated with this T allele

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.630
in the gene.

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:58.620
This gave a potential
clue to understanding

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:02.520
how to go about trying to
improve or optimize memory

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.400
by looking at where this
gene is in the brain

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.170
and what biochemical
pathways are

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.870
affected by this gene variant.

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:12.900
Important for the
story, KIBRA is heavily

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.420
expressed in the
hip hippocampus.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:18.090
Variants of the KIBRA
gene influence biochemical

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:21.690
pathways that localize
in the synapse.

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:23.490
And so the rationale
for the experiment

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:28.290
was will a compound that affects
these biochemical pathways

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:31.750
affect spatial
memory in old rats?

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.960
Now, there were several
existing compounds

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.110
that were designed for
other applications that

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.200
should have the predicted
effect on memory

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.630
if our hypothesis was correct.

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:45.930
One was hydroxyfasudil.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:48.810
Now this is not used for memory.

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:52.050
It's used for angina treatment.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.700
And, in fact, when
we gave this drug

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.780
to old, memory-impaired
rats, this treatment

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:02.280
improved the spatial
memory in these old rats.

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.620
Now, there are many steps
to follow this forward,

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:08.910
but it's exciting to know that
we're beginning to understand

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.850
enough about memory
to predict how to have

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:14.750
a positive impact on it.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:18.420
OK, so finally I'm going
to mention an experiment

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.660
that Veronique Bohbot has
been given a pilot project

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.530
funding for through
the McKnight Institute.

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:28.050
She developed a virtual
reality environment

00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:31.980
with computers that consists
of an eight arm radial maze.

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:37.560
You see three different
views of it here.

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.600
It's surrounded by landscapes,
distal landmarks, trees,

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.750
the sunset, and mountains.

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.970
And this navigation
training program

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:47.190
is working well in
young participants,

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:50.880
and it can be administered
in the MRI scanner

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.610
so that the brain
activity can be monitored

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:55.920
across learning and training.

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.930
Now, with different
versions of training,

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:01.110
she can give subjects
practice solving the task

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:04.260
with a strategy
that specifically

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.300
exercises the hippocampus.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:10.920
Or she can use a strategy that
engages a subcortical structure

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.730
of the caudate nucleus.

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:16.080
Veronique wants to train a
number of parts of the brain

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.240
to see if this results
in positive benefits

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.050
and across a number of
domains for older adults.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.210
Because the problem
with many training

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.460
procedures is that
they don't generalize.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.780
That is, even though you may
be doing your crossword puzzles

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.330
faithfully every
single day, it's

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:37.500
not going to help you find
where you left your glasses

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.670
a couple of hours ago.

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.730
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.540
So Veronique's approach
shows some great promise.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.370
And actually, Paul
Cohen is going

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:47.040
to talk to you about
some ideas that he

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.350
has for a
computer-aided training,

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:53.520
I think, in his lecture
later on in the series.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.690
Now, because education
and lifelong learning

01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:01.620
is one of the top predictive
factors for cognitive health--

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:05.520
right next to choosing your
parents wisely, actually--

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.970
in fact, all of you
who are here tonight

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:12.990
are doing your part in keeping
those synaptic connections

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:15.060
of yours exercised.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:23.160
And so for those 86%,
the best advice that I

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.810
can give you is
to attend lectures

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:32.140
such as this one and others in
the series, or if not so much,

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:35.460
well, keep engaged in
other stimulating activity.

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:41.170
But the main message is just
to keep those synapses active.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:45.690
Now David Armstrong will
have an exciting lecture

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:48.960
for you next Tuesday
on the current ability

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.030
to replace various body parts.

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:54.770
I don't think he's really quite
up to brain transplants yet,

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:59.856
but-- but you'll have to
come next week to find out.

01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:00.606
Thank you so much.

01:02:00.606 --> 01:02:04.008
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.280
I'm sure Carol would like that
answer some of your questions.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.771
Maybe a few questions
from the audience?

01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:35.340
Hello.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.690
My question involves medications
that improve brain function.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.270
You mentioned one.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.670
My own doctors
prescribe Aricept,

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:46.950
even though I do not
have Alzheimer's.

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.252
Can you address that?

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.600
Is it-- so don't seem
to be [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.320
It's interesting
that you say Aricept,

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.920
because in normal
aging, actually,

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.420
the cholinergic system,
which Aricept addresses--

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.630
it modifies it.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:11.660
In normal aging, you have
a reduction in this system.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:16.930
So just because-- if you
see any improvements,

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:18.890
that's probably just a
part of normal aging.

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:23.200
So I think that there
are many agents out there

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.470
that can improve memory,
even in normal people.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.590
But you have to take into
consideration, of course, side

01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:31.090
effects and things like this.

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:32.560
And so have to be careful.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.060
But it's probably
not a bad thing.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.970
Cara?

01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.830
Sorry.

01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:40.590
Yeah, hi.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.450
I was just wondering-- when you
were showing pictures of all

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:44.395
the different brains--

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.180
it's a two-part question.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.210
One, is what is the purpose
of the worm-like brain

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.670
folds that you see
in all the brains

01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:56.140
except for the rat brain?

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.520
Yeah, it's very smooth.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.247
And the fact that you do
all the testing on rats,

01:04:00.247 --> 01:04:02.830
or a lot of the testing on rats,
and they don't have the brain

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:04.190
folds.

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:07.720
What's the comparison there?

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.200
Well, we had a wonderful
evolutionary biologist

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.260
try to explain the
brain folding question.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:19.830
And there are some
animals that do not show--

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:22.610
and I'm blocking on the name
of the animal-- darn-- that

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:27.640
don't show really high
levels of behavior

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.320
but have lots of brain folding
because their skull is quite /

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.680
so we think that the brain
folding is because of the skull

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.900
size, so it pushes the
brain in on each other.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.150
But, of course, particularly
the frontal lobes of rats

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:44.770
are not well-developed.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:46.930
But non-human
primates-- monkeys--

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:50.080
are quite well developed,
and they show similar memory

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.850
deficits as do humans.

01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:54.640
But spatial memory is quite
nice because, the hippocampus,

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.000
in fact, doesn't have
all that folding.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.350
It's in the bottom of
the brain, and it's

01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:01.030
very well-conserved
across species.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.510
It's a very old structure.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:08.431
So that's why it's particularly
good to study that across age.

01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:09.950
I have a question up here.

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:11.280
OK.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.380
What about people who never
had good spatial memory--

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.991
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:16.991 --> 01:05:20.870
And is there some
kind of genetic defect

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:22.930
has nothing to do with aging?

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:23.750
I know.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.110
So actually, this is
opening of a can of worms.

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:30.940
But actually, it's very
characteristic, even in rats.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.900
I'll put it that way.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.000
Rats-- you can make them seem
brilliant spatial learners.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.330
If you have a lot of proximal
cues-- sort of landmarks

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:47.420
around the water pool, you can
make them look really good.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.660
And you can make them look
really bad with distal cues.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.560
And the male rats look really
good with these distal cues.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:06:01.140
So there are sex differences
in spatial memory

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.850
between males and females
rats, males and females humans.

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:06.380
You know, there's
always exceptions.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:10.220
But yeah, some people do have
better or worse spatial memory.

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.690
And it may be that you
didn't exercise it when

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:13.940
you were younger or something.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.430
I don't know.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.540
Carol?

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.030
So where are the mics?

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:22.410
Sorry.

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:22.962
Hi.

01:06:22.962 --> 01:06:24.170
Thanks a lot for the lecture.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:25.550
It was great.

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:27.790
I was wondering,
I had one question

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:30.470
I have a lecture and
one general, if it's OK.

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:32.180
The loss of volume--

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.390
you said there's the
same number of neurons

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:37.932
in the same and glial cells
and that sort of thing.

01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:40.390
But then you talked about the
volume of the brain is less--

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:42.680
Yep.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.550
First question is,
what causes that?

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:49.880
And then my second question
is about mycelium and the loss

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.250
over time, the sheathing around

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:53.962
Myelin.

01:06:53.962 --> 01:06:54.665
Yeah, myelin.

01:06:54.665 --> 01:06:55.290
Yes, thank you.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:55.510
Yes, yes.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.920
OK.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.170
That's what I'm trying to say.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:01.310
OK, so I didn't
express this clearly,

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:05.960
but the volume loss is
probably synaptic contact loss.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.270
OK, so you do lose synapses.

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:11.640
And if I lead you to
believe that there

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.450
was no neuron loss in the brain
at all, that would be wrong.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:16.170
So let me clear that up.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:19.160
So in some parts of the brain,
like the frontal cortex,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.070
there probably is actual
neuron loss with aging,

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:24.270
but not in the hippocampus.

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:26.900
So it's probably the
connections overall

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.420
plus a little bit of neuron
loss in other brain areas

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.980
that makes the volume smaller.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:39.080
But in terms of myelin,
actually demylinating diseases

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.320
do produce real,
cognitive deficits.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:48.470
But it's not been demonstrated
that this is a primary cause

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:50.060
of age-related changes.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.190
For example, you know
the action potential.

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:54.050
Is the cell spiking?

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:57.820
The volume of those
spikes and so forth

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.760
that the velocity and so
forth, it seems to be the same.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.990
So there isn't much
demyelination in aging.

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:08.480
Now, there are these
white-matter hyperintensities

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.980
that you see in
humans that we're

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.620
trying to figure
out what that means

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.010
and whether there is
frank degeneration.

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:21.649
But when you do lose synapses,
you do lose those axons.

01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:24.350
So it could be
partly demyelination

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.859
of the axons where you're
losing the synapses,

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:30.416
too, that you do see.

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.499
Carol, thank you so very
much for a great lecture.

01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:33.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.300
Thank you very much,
all, for coming.

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.650
