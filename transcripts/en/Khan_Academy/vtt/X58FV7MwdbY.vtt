00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.970
We're on problem 20.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.640
Of the 5 coordinates associated
with points A, B,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.350
C, D and E on the number line
above, which has the greatest

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.740
absolute value?

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.520
OK.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.420
Let me just draw the number
line that they drew.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.980
And they say from 0 to 1.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.350
0, 1, 2.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.550
And then they say minus
1, minus 2.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:43.090
And then they say these are
choices A, B, C, D, and E.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.440
Of the 5 coordinates associated
with the points A,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.060
B, C, D, and E on the number
line above, which has the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.070
greatest absolute value?

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.000
So you can view absolute value
as the distance from zero So

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.460
the greatest distance from
zero is going to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.250
happen in two places.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.930
It's going to happen
here at A.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.480
It's also going to
happen here at E.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.960
Can you have more than
one right answer?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.210
Because both of those
are choices.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.460
Let's see.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.000
Indicate the best of the
answer choices given.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.930
I'm looking up the thing.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.820
Is it possible to have more
than one right answer?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.160
Because this doesn't seem quite
right that I can have

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.320
two possible answers
for this one.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.440
The answer is A.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.190
The coordinate A is the
farthest from zero.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.340
This has the greatest
absolute value.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.830
I disagree with that.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.320
It could be choice E as well.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.120
The absolute value of the
number x is the distance

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.710
between x and 0 on
the number line.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.865
The coordinate of point A is the
farthest from 0, and thus

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:54.110
has the greatest
absolute value.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.000
That's false.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.270
I mean, that's true, but
E is just as far.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.930
I don't know, I think
they made a mistake.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.430
I think this could be choices
A or E, because the absolute

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.260
value of either of those is 2.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.590
I think they made a mistake.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.199
And they say the choice is A,
which I agree with, but it

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.319
could just as easily
be choice E.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.150
So I don't know.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.640
Write a letter to GMAT.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.040
I mean, this seems pretty
straightforward.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.910
Of the 5 coordinates associated
with choices A, B,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.820
C, D, and E on the number line,
which has the greatest

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.590
absolute value?

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.540
The absolute value of
this point is 2.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.120
The absolute value of
this point is 2.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.160
They're equal.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.790
Anyway.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.090
Next problem.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.190
I think it should be A or E.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.750
It's surprising that they would
let a question like that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.730
get through their screen.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.680
Or at least they should
get rid of choice E.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.030
If x and y are prime numbers,
which of the following cannot

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.976
be the sum of x and y?

00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:50.700
x plus y cannot equal what?

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.310
So statement 1: 5.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.100
Well, I can immediately say
2 plus 3 is equal to 5.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.350
So that doesn't work.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.995
Cannot equal, so B.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.510
9, I could do 2 plus
7 is equal to 9.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.956
This was A.

00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:12.600
This is B.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.680
Let's see what C is.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.050
So it's not B.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.270
C is 13.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.310
So let me think.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.350
What could it be?

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.250
11 plus 2 is equal to 13,
so it's not choice C.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.770
D.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.720
16.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.460
The sum.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.020
So let me see, 16.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.170
9 and 7.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.840
No.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.730
11 and 5.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.620
11 plus 5 is equal to 16.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.730
So without even looking at E,
it's probably going to be E.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.640
E , 23.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.370
Let me see if I can come up with
two prime numbers that

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.360
add up to 23.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.090
19 and 4.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.880
No.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.160
Let's see.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.250
2 and 21.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.810
No.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.100
First of all, we found examples
for all of these, so

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.630
if you don't want to waste time
on the GMAT, you should

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.350
already have chosen E and moved
on by this point, but we

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.030
could just look through a bunch
of prime numbers and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.380
think if they can add up to 23,
but I can't think of any

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.010
right at the moment.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.780
And I feel pretty good that E
is the answer, because I was

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.080
able to find prime numbers that
added up to all of the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.280
other four choices.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.930
Next question.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.060
22.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.820
I'll switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.200
If each of the following
fractions were written as a

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.530
repeating decimal, which would
have the longest sequence of

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.073
different digits?

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.900
Are they going to sit here and
make us-- so let me write all

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.270
the choices down.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.840
Maybe we can do some
cancellation from the get-go.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.670
2/11.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.000
B is 1/3.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.440
And we already know
that that's just

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.600
going to be 0.33 repeating.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.440
Longest sequence of
different digits.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.820
So it's not going to be choice
B because choice B doesn't

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.760
have different digits.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.330
It just keeps being a 3, so it's
not going to be choice B,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.650
so we don't have to
worry about that.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.910
Choice C.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.250
41/99.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.670
Choice D is 2/3.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.370
We know that that's 0.666.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.300
It just keeps going.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.250
So it's not going to be that.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.720
It's the same digit that
just keeps repeating.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.870
And choice E is 23
divided by 37.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.100
So 2 divided by 11 repeats.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.170
Let's just try it, though.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.660
11 goes into 2.000 one time.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.090
1 times 11 is 11.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.470
You get a 90.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.290
11 goes into 90 eight times.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.760
88.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.650
It's 20.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.650
I already see the pattern.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.160
11 goes into 20 two times.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.660
Sorry, it goes into
20 one time.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.120
1 times 11 is 11.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.800
Then you get a 90.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.640
It goes into it eight times,
so it's just 0.181818.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.190
It's just going to keep
repeating 0.18.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.540
So that's 2/11.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.190
41/99.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.800
Let me do it in a different
color just so I

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.630
don't get too messy.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.330
99 goes into 41.0000.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.840
So 99 goes into 410
four times.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.020
4 times 99 is what?

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.890
396.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.900
4 times 9 is 6.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.500
3.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.420
4 times 9 is 36.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.840
Yep, 396.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.440
This is equal to 140.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.300
99 goes into 140 one time.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.610
1 times 99 is 99.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.720
This becomes 41.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.470
Already started repeating,
right?

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.620
99 goes into 410.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.780
That's just like that.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.370
So it's going to be 0.41
repeating over and over again

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.060
because we got the same
number again.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.200
We're going 99 into
41 four times.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.320
We're going to get
396 and it's just

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.290
going to keep happening.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.670
Then we're going to get 396.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.120
And then we're going
to get 140 again.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.470
It's 41, 41.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.120
So it's 41 repeating.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.570
So if I had to guess, it's
already going to be choice E,

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.590
without having to do any work
because these just have the

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.310
same numbers repeating
from the get-go.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.430
Choices A and C have the
same two numbers

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.400
repeating from the get-go.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.600
So I'm guessing that this
one has a lot more.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.180
So if you just wanted to worry
about time, you could just

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.240
pick E and move on.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.180
But let's do it just to
prove to ourselves.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.070
So 37 goes into 23.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.170
I don't remember when I took
the GMAT having to do this

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.780
much decimal division or
decimal multiplication.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.270
So 37 goes into 230.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.620
I don't know.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.150
Does it go into it six times?

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.280
No, probably five times.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.460
5 times 7 is 35.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.110
5 times 3 is 15, so
it's 18, plus 3.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.590
OK.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.510
30.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.610
85.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.310
Actually, this would have
gone six times.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.560
Let me change that to 6.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.130
Let me to it in a
different color.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.530
I don't want to make
it too messy.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:53.580
6 times 7 is 42.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.620
6 times 3 is 18, plus 4 is 22.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.490
80.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.820
37 goes into 80 two times.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.410
2 times 37 is what?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.900
74, right?

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.060
60 plus 14.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.240
74.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.152
You get a 60.

00:08:12.152 --> 00:08:13.460
30 is going to go into 60.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.360
So already we haven't even
started repeating and we're

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.720
already three digits into it.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.090
So this is going to have
the longest sequence

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.000
of different digits.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.950
We don't have to keep going.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.940
We've answered our question.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.560
The choice is definitely E.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.710
Next question.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.550
They've drawn something there.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.780
In the figure above the
coordinates of point V are--

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.179
well, this is just kind
of a reading the

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.140
graph type of problem.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:44.750
I'm just going to draw this 4th
quadrant just so that I

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.180
can show you how I
think about it.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.340
OK, so let me just count: one,
two, three, four, five; one,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.850
two, three, four, five.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.350
They tell us that each of those
slashes are 1, because

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.060
they do it in a couple
of places.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.700
They go one, two, three, four,
five, and then they say this

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.940
is negative 5.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.870
So that's information that
you actually need.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.470
You have to know that each
of those slashes

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.740
are definitely 1.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.860
But then on this, they
go one, two, three,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.120
four, five, six, seven.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.210
So they go one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, so

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.540
this is point 7.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.160
And you have to just count
it on your paper.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.960
So this is one, two,
three, four, five.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.500
And this is point one, two,
three, four, five.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.910
This is minus 5.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.380
And this is where V is.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.960
So they're just testing
to see if you know

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.330
how to graph a point.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.310
So this is x is 7.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.880
And y is minus 5.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.370
So it's 7 minus 5.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.430
And actually, that's
interesting.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.290
You don't even have to count the
points, because you say,

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.120
you know what?

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.970
This is in the 4th quadrant.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.110
x is positive.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.190
y is negative.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.380
And if you look at all the
choices, there's only one

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.540
choice where x is positive
and y is negative, and

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.730
that's choice E.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.770
So you really didn't even have
to count it, although I think

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.610
this wouldn't have taken much
time to count it, so that's

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.070
not like a huge shortcut.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.510
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
