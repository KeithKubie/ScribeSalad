For the rest of this lesson, you'll
be analyzing Udacity student data.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.800
But, before you get started on that,
let's talk about some of the other kinds

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.300
of problems you might
solve as a data analyst.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.530
When many people hear
the term data analyst,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.670
they picture someone who works at a tech
company, and probably in Silicon Valley.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.530
Many data analysts do in
fact work at tech companies.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.150
For example, Netflix uses data
analysis to provide personalized movie

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.910
recommendations for its users.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.600
Facebook uses it in their
newsfeed ranking algorithm.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600
And OkCupid uses it to predict
which people are likely to be good

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.429
romantic matches.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.770
In addition to building these kinds of
systems, many companies also use data

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.240
analysis to publish papers or
write blog posts about their findings.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.070
For example,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.850
Facebook has studied the ideological
diversity of people's political posts.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.945
They found that when posts appear
on people's newsfeeds written from

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.235
a different perspective, users
are less likely click on those posts.

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.725
OkCupid wrote a blog post about,

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:53.605
what are the best questions to
ask someone on a first date?

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:56.165
Did you know that long term
couples are very likely to agree

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:57.585
about whether they like horror movies?

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:01.295
Data analysts don't just work
at tech companies, though.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.233
Walmart looks through their purchase
records and people's posts on

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:07.029
social media in order to figure
out what to stock in their stores.

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:10.004
Apparently, strawberry Pop-Tarts
are more likely to sell out right before

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:11.290
a hurricane.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.550
Bill James is famous for
applying data analysis to baseball.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.020
He used it to understand who
are the top performers, and

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.750
how can you best predict
future performance?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.310
And pharmaceutical companies have
started using machine learning to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.870
predict which chemical compounds
are most likely to make effective drugs.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.400
Using this, they can make better
decisions about which compounds

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.130
are likely to be a good use of
the resources involved in running

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.560
a clinical trial.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.720
If you'd like to learn more
about any of these applications,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.080

the instructor notes.
