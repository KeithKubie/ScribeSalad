um<00:01:49.780><c> so</c><00:01:50.080><c> speculation</c><00:01:50.770><c> is</c><00:01:50.950><c> that</c><00:01:50.979><c> they</c><00:01:51.280><c> might</c><00:01:51.490><c> be</c>

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so speculation is that they might be
 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.870 align:start position:0%
um so speculation is that they might be
doing<00:01:52.030><c> this</c><00:01:52.390><c> because</c><00:01:52.690><c> this</c><00:01:53.320><c> year</c><00:01:53.950><c> is</c><00:01:54.130><c> the</c><00:01:54.520><c> 30th</c>

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
doing this because this year is the 30th
 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
doing this because this year is the 30th
anniversary<00:01:55.000><c> of</c><00:01:55.420><c> the</c><00:01:55.510><c> franchise</c><00:01:56.100><c> so</c><00:01:57.100><c> maybe</c>

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
anniversary of the franchise so maybe
 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
anniversary of the franchise so maybe
they're<00:01:57.909><c> trying</c><00:01:58.060><c> to</c><00:01:58.150><c> pull</c><00:01:58.390><c> something</c>
