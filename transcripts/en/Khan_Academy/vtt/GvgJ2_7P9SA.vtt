00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.440
If there are 6 people
in your family,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.650
and each person drinks 4/5 of
a gallon of milk each month,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.390
between what two whole numbers
is the number of gallons

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.080
of milk your family
will drink each month?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.920
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.990
So I've got my milk gallon
here for inspiration.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.657
So there's 6 people
in my family,

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:23.990
or in your family, whoever's
family we're talking about.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.960
And each of them drink
4/5 of a gallon per month.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
So we're going to go 6
times 4/5, or 4/5 times 6.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.930
Now, what is this
going to be equal to?

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.420
Well, there are several ways
we could think about this.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.320
One, we can express
6 as a fraction.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.110
We could say that this is the
same thing as 6/1 times 4/5.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.510
And you multiply the numerators.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.320
You multiply the denominators.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.590
6 times 4 is 24.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.570
And 1 times 5 is 5.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.185
So 24/5 gallons are going
to be drunk every month.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.810
And this is the same
thing-- let's see,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.980
5 goes into 20 evenly
and has a remainder of 4.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.861
So we could write this
as 20/5 plus 4/5 5--

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:10.860
let me move over a little
bit so I don't run out

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.430
of space, which
is the same thing.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.300
This is 4.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.670
So this is 4 and 4/5.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.470
So that's one way
to think about it.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.280
The other way, you could
think of this as 4/5 times 6,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.730
which is the same thing
as 4/5 plus 4/5 plus 4/5--

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.720
I think you get the idea--
plus 4/5 plus 4/5 plus 4/5.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.599
We took literally six 4/5's
and added them together.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.140
And what's this
going to be equal to?

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.810
Well, this is going to
be 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.400
plus 4 plus 4 over 5.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.210
This is how many 1/5's we have.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.530
Well, this is 6
times 4, or you could

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.740
say 4 times 6, over 5,
which is equal to 24 over 5,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.610
which we've already
figured out is 4 and 4/5.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.450
So either way,
we're going to drink

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.900
4 and 4/5 gallons per month.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.139
Now let's try to answer
the actual question.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.539
Between what two whole numbers?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.650
Well, between 4 and
5 gallons a month.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.950
4 and 4/5 is right
in between 4 and 5.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.390
We got it right.
