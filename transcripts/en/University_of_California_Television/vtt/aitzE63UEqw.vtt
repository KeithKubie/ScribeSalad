00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
(whooshing and beeping)

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.167
(piano music)

00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:12.340
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.603
Bipedal.

00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:14.867
Naked.

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:15.867
Large brain.

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.592
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:25.009
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.047
Aware that death is inevitable
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:34.840
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.448
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:39.531
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:43.703
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.703 --> 00:00:44.703
of the past.

00:00:46.584 --> 00:00:50.151
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.318
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:57.959
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:01.042
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.986
(digital tones)

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:30.634
(digital music)

00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:44.890
- Well, thank you very
much and I'd like to thank

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.033
the organizers and say
how glad I am to be here

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:53.482
and participating in this
very interesting symposium.

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:55.429
And indeed to have the opportunity

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.096
of discussing together a problem

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.826
which we all sooner or later

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:04.779
will have to come to terms with.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.130
And that is, indeed, an interesting point.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.297
So I'd like to start with
just a couple of quotations.

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:16.031
This from Wittgenstein.

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:20.698
And it makes an important point, I think,

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:23.115
that we are talking of death.

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:27.719
But death is a concept.

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:30.723
Obviously there are individual deaths

00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:33.898
or there are dead bodies, dead people,

00:02:33.898 --> 00:02:37.634
that we may or may not
come into contact with.

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:40.066
But death is a concept.

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.978
And as humans, we may,
in the modern world,

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:48.034
not witness many deaths,
but from the earliest times,

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.676
hominins and humans have experienced

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:52.508
the deaths of relatives.

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:55.300
So the condition of being dead

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.556
will have been a familiar concept,

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:01.611
at least as soon as human language

00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:05.778
could find a word for it,
namely the adjective dead.

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.453
But I think it is
crucial to the discussion

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:13.203
to realize that without
the concept of death,

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:18.389
and indeed without a
language which could find

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:23.812
a word from it, then it's not possible

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:27.828
to communicate about death
and it's not possible

00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:31.133
to have a shared concept of death.

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:35.300
And so the awareness of
death as a general phenomenon

00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:41.260
is very much when that came to be,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.365
in evolutionary terms,
is very much associated

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:49.365
with the question of when
human language emerged

00:03:50.412 --> 00:03:52.957
in a sufficiently sophisticated form

00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:57.165
that one could have an
abstract noun, dead,

00:03:57.165 --> 00:03:58.421
or an abstract adje...

00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.557
Death, I mean.

00:03:59.557 --> 00:04:02.174
Or an abstract adjective, dead.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:06.189
Which could give a word to the concept.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.342
And so I suspect that
when we're discussing

00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:14.342
when did the awareness
of death become a reality

00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:20.212
for humankind, the answer is when language

00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:23.629
had been developed to find a word for it.

00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:26.930
It's worth mentioning also,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.097
it's interesting perhaps that Epicurus

00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:34.245
had a similar concept to Wittgenstein's

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.835
and a couple of thousand years earlier.

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:42.002
But as archeologists, we don't
encounter death very often

00:04:43.896 --> 00:04:48.063
and indeed we don't even
encounter dead bodies very often.

00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:53.620
As archeologists, we more
often encounter burials.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.594
That is to say dead persons

00:04:56.594 --> 00:04:59.242
that have been inhumed deliberately

00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:03.946
and it's unusual for archeologists
to discover dead people

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:08.418
and it's so worth looking,
reminding ourselves,

00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:12.147
of these extraordinary
images of moments of death

00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:15.243
found at Pompeii and Herculaneum

00:05:15.243 --> 00:05:18.579
and the archeologists who found cavities

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:22.496
in the volcanic ash and
poured plaster of Paris

00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:26.842
into these cavities, were able to get

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:31.140
these extraordinary images
of death, if you like,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.548
of the moment of death of a kind

00:05:33.548 --> 00:05:37.715
which is exceedingly unusual
in archeological terms.

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:44.243
The business of burial is
often very much associated,

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:49.211
or at any rate in later
times, with notions

00:05:50.172 --> 00:05:52.052
of what is to follow.

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:54.948
Whether or not there is an afterlife,

00:05:54.948 --> 00:05:57.868
and that is why I've given my talk

00:05:57.868 --> 00:06:02.035
the notion, the title of The
Archeology of Immortality.

00:06:03.076 --> 00:06:07.243
And this slide is from the
Capuchin Cemetery in Palermo

00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:12.572
and of course the Capuchin
monks were very much aware

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:15.556
that there would be a day of resurrection

00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:19.780
and so this is now the
Capuchin Cemetery in Rome

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.068
where we see these extraordinary,

00:06:23.068 --> 00:06:27.235
elaborate, and sometimes very
decorative configurations,

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:32.244
which I think to us today,
to most of us today,

00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:34.379
perhaps because we don't very often

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.924
see skeletons or dead
bodies in the modern world,

00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:40.568
that's in the mortuary
which we don't visit,

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:43.598
and it's in the cemetery but
you don't see the dead body

00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:47.765
in most Christian burials,
and indeed in many faiths,

00:06:48.934 --> 00:06:52.216
so that we are very much
insulated from death

00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:56.383
and these are perhaps rather
shocking images for us

00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:00.384
and we find the apparent frivolity

00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:05.176
which you encounter in
the Capuchin Chapel,

00:07:05.176 --> 00:07:07.771
perhaps a little unseemly.

00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:10.688
But it's worth remembering, and I think

00:07:10.688 --> 00:07:13.400
we should pause and recognize,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.577
that we live in the Americas or in Europe

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:18.369
or in Western Asia, in a society

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:21.824
today dominated by two or
perhaps three religions

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:24.296
which hold that the supreme deity,

00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:27.963
God or other, promises
that life after death

00:07:29.328 --> 00:07:32.816
will be the destiny for those who believe.

00:07:32.816 --> 00:07:35.584
And so I take you to the Sistine Chapel

00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:38.251
to Michelangelo's Last Judgment.

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:41.985
And there will be many people here today

00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:44.776
who follow some version
of the Christian faith,

00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:47.121
so well expressed by Michelangelo

00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.456
for the Church of Rome in his vision

00:07:49.456 --> 00:07:52.088
of the Last Judgment, where the blessed

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:54.632
and the damned are judged on the basis

00:07:54.632 --> 00:07:58.632
of their conduct during
life and sent accordingly

00:07:58.632 --> 00:08:01.218
to their ultimate destinations.

00:08:01.218 --> 00:08:04.656
There are two ultimate destinations.

00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:08.656
And it is conventional,
in the scientific world,

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.026
which is particularly
inappropriate for this occasion,

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.754
that we don't discuss faith very much.

00:08:15.754 --> 00:08:17.786
Maybe they're a symposia on faith,

00:08:17.786 --> 00:08:20.514
but they tend to, or they can degenerate,

00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:24.130
into alternative expressions
of personal faith.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.594
And so it's an irony, really,

00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:30.738
that we're here today discussing awareness

00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:32.071
of death but the

00:08:35.258 --> 00:08:38.107
belief systems which determine,

00:08:38.107 --> 00:08:41.290
to some extent, what a number of us

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.037
will feel about death
are not openly expressed,

00:08:46.037 --> 00:08:47.456
and I think that's worth saying

00:08:47.456 --> 00:08:49.790
because underlying all the discussions

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.502
is that some of us here are believers,

00:08:52.502 --> 00:08:55.526
perhaps of those two or three religions

00:08:55.526 --> 00:08:59.254
which predominate in the Western world,

00:08:59.254 --> 00:09:01.486
and others of us are not believers

00:09:01.486 --> 00:09:04.311
and are agnostics or atheists,

00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:06.371
and therefore inevitably
have a very different

00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:07.747
approach to death.

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:12.091
And many agnostics or
atheists will not believe

00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:15.955
in the existence of the
human being after death,

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.987
although of course some may,

00:09:17.987 --> 00:09:19.907
and obviously I don't have time to talk

00:09:19.907 --> 00:09:22.475
about the Buddhist faith on this occasion.

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:26.475
So I move right on to the
earliest accumulations

00:09:28.307 --> 00:09:31.595
of human bones, which may
or may not be burials.

00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:35.011
This is Sima de los Huesos in Spain,

00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:37.532
which is early hominins.

00:09:37.532 --> 00:09:41.924
Early neanderthals, probably,
around 400,000 years ago,

00:09:41.924 --> 00:09:45.180
which were tips into these pits,

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.847
these caves, and
presumably deliberately so.

00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:52.020
Though that is not certain.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.220
But they don't really constitute burials

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.862
in a deliberate sense.

00:09:56.862 --> 00:10:01.693
And the first human burials
are archaic hominins.

00:10:01.693 --> 00:10:04.110
This is from Skhul in Jordan,

00:10:05.756 --> 00:10:09.471
and that is something
like 100,000 years ago.

00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:12.471
These are archaic hominins of humans

00:10:13.492 --> 00:10:16.809
following the slide we saw
in the last presentation

00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:20.476
who have left Africa
and with these burials,

00:10:22.444 --> 00:10:25.527
we do find, sometimes, other objects.

00:10:26.724 --> 00:10:29.474
Sometimes a bone signifying meat.

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:34.096
Not a human bone but a bone of mutton,

00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:37.377
or something like that.

00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:41.657
And so that is certainly
a deliberate burial,

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:44.537
which is certainly signifying
awareness of death.

00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:47.802
You can't come about
having a deliberate burial

00:10:47.802 --> 00:10:49.834
without some awareness of death.

00:10:49.834 --> 00:10:53.339
But it doesn't necessarily
signify an afterlife.

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:57.506
And this is one of the first
sites in European Romania

00:10:58.923 --> 00:11:02.083
where we find deliberate burials.

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:04.596
You do, of course, have
neanderthal burials.

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.933
For instance, at the Shanidar Cave,

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:10.683
something like 40 or
more thousand years ago.

00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:15.560
But it's not until the
Upper Paleolithic Period,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.143
until the arrival of
homo sapiens in Europe

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.376
that we find deliberate
burials of this kind,

00:11:24.376 --> 00:11:25.876
this very striking

00:11:28.608 --> 00:11:31.108
body inhumed with a headdress,

00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:35.241
which comes from the site of Sungir.

00:11:36.624 --> 00:11:39.712
And this is another such burial.

00:11:39.712 --> 00:11:43.528
This is around 28,000 years ago in Russia.

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.464
But although it's impressive,

00:11:45.464 --> 00:11:47.232
it's important to understand

00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:49.012
that it's clearly recognizing death,

00:11:49.012 --> 00:11:53.192
it's a formal burial, but
not yet in a cemetery.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:54.480
It's a formal burial

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.147
and so that indicates something,

00:11:58.146 --> 00:12:00.168
but not necessarily a suggestion

00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:02.314
of awareness in the afterlife.

00:12:02.314 --> 00:12:04.394
This is a similar burial from the site

00:12:04.394 --> 00:12:07.348
of Arene Candide in Northern Italy.

00:12:07.348 --> 00:12:10.706
And here now is one of
the first cemeteries.

00:12:10.706 --> 00:12:12.820
A number of burials grouped together.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.883
And you find these at the
very dawn of sedentism,

00:12:16.883 --> 00:12:21.234
just before the
domestication of agriculture

00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:25.923
is fully achieved in the
Natufian Period in Palestine

00:12:25.923 --> 00:12:29.006
and in Western Asia around 12,000 BC.

00:12:30.602 --> 00:12:32.739
And here is another of these sites

00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:34.822
where we find a cemetery.

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:40.105
And clearly a cemetery is a
different response to death.

00:12:41.067 --> 00:12:44.428
It's a place specifically chosen

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:47.923
for the formal disposal of the dead.

00:12:47.923 --> 00:12:49.835
And here is another such example

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:53.585
from an early site in
Jordan about 15,000 BC.

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:58.699
And it's Jericho in the
Pre-Pottery Neolithic A Period

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:01.939
that you find these
remarkable plastered skulls.

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:05.453
And these are one of
the most striking finds

00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:09.286
that one has where death
is being responded to

00:13:12.595 --> 00:13:15.512
and it's possible that this relates

00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:18.219
to a belief in the afterlife,

00:13:18.219 --> 00:13:20.611
but it's also just as possible

00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:23.091
that it relates to a
belief in the significance

00:13:23.091 --> 00:13:26.291
of the ancestors, whether
or not the ancestors

00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:29.226
are presumed to be still
living in some sense,

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:33.059
it is the ancestors who
give often one's right

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:37.092
to inhabit the land, the territory,

00:13:37.092 --> 00:13:39.259
which one inhabits today.

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:41.484
And so this, moving on very rapidly,

00:13:41.484 --> 00:13:43.890
to Northern Europe, to the Orkney Islands,

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.947
this is a site I excavated myself

00:13:46.947 --> 00:13:50.824
of Quanterness in Orkney where you see

00:13:50.824 --> 00:13:54.601
a constructed tomb, a very
handsomely constructed tomb,

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:56.697
here is a reconstruction of it,

00:13:56.697 --> 00:13:59.089
and this is a place of collective burial.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.273
And collective burial
is another phenomenon

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:05.889
where the bodies of the
community are together buried

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:09.169
and that is an important point.

00:14:09.169 --> 00:14:12.985
It is when you come to ranked societies

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.281
that you find burials

00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:16.913
with very strikingly wealthy grave goods

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:20.753
and here is one of the jade
burials of the Songze culture

00:14:20.753 --> 00:14:22.753
around 3300 BC in China.

00:14:25.746 --> 00:14:28.161
And here is another of these jade burials

00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:31.266
of the same period, also in China.

00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:34.921
And there's something special
about the material of jade,

00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:38.504
just as is special
about the material gold,

00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:43.201
which one finds here in
the earliest occurrence

00:14:43.201 --> 00:14:47.368
of gold in the world at
Varna, something like 4500 BC.

00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:52.393
And the inclusion of these materials

00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:57.243
doesn't necessarily indicate
a belief in the afterlife,

00:14:57.243 --> 00:15:01.124
but there is with the
purity and survival of gold

00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:04.204
and the purity and survival of jade,

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:06.621
something which certain in later times

00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:08.868
is associated with immortality.

00:15:08.868 --> 00:15:11.132
And I think there's a possibility

00:15:11.132 --> 00:15:14.980
that this is the time
that immortality first

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.228
enters the archeological
record, as it were,

00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:19.850
in these rich burials.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.244
This is another burial from Varna

00:15:23.244 --> 00:15:25.494
in Bulgaria around 4500 BC.

00:15:27.508 --> 00:15:30.652
But it is with the arrival
of state societies,

00:15:30.652 --> 00:15:34.275
and with the arrival of
the belief in deities,

00:15:34.275 --> 00:15:38.636
in transcendent deities,
that you certainly find

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:41.719
a systematic belief in the afterlife.

00:15:42.556 --> 00:15:46.462
And deities, of course,
are by definition immortal.

00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:49.766
And you find deities in
the archeological record,

00:15:49.766 --> 00:15:53.660
it may be argued for the
first time in state societies

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.988
such as Ancient Egypt.

00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.597
So here you see the pyramids.

00:15:56.597 --> 00:16:00.316
Here you see the
wonderful gold sarcophagus

00:16:00.316 --> 00:16:02.396
from the tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:04.940
And we know a great deal
about Egyptian beliefs,

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.580
and here is from the Book of the Dead,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.747
is the weighing of the soul of
the deceased in the balance.

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:16.042
And if the soul of the deceased

00:16:16.957 --> 00:16:19.004
was sufficiently free from sin

00:16:19.004 --> 00:16:22.516
as to be sufficiently light in weight,

00:16:22.516 --> 00:16:24.675
then the deceased would be accepted

00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:27.748
into a favorable afterlife.

00:16:27.748 --> 00:16:31.915
And so it's in China again,
with the Shang dynasty

00:16:33.804 --> 00:16:37.268
that you find these
enormously rich burials.

00:16:37.268 --> 00:16:41.183
And with the first bronze is in China.

00:16:41.183 --> 00:16:43.231
And these are of great abundance.

00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:45.981
And it's also in Mesoamerica that

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.879
with the development of state society,

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:51.703
for instance with the Maya, that you find

00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:55.416
very elaborate burials which do clearly

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:58.279
involve the belief of an afterlife,

00:16:58.279 --> 00:16:59.623
at least for the ruler.

00:16:59.623 --> 00:17:02.895
And this is the tomb of the
inscriptions in Palenque.

00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:05.191
And here is the wonderful tomb slab

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.858
of the deceased person of Pakal.

00:17:11.047 --> 00:17:13.607
And here is Pakal himself being taken

00:17:13.607 --> 00:17:15.278
down into the underworld.

00:17:15.278 --> 00:17:18.695
This is around 603 before the common era.

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.705
And here is the contents of his tomb,

00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:26.287
including this wonderful jade mask.

00:17:26.287 --> 00:17:28.062
And there is the jade mask.

00:17:28.062 --> 00:17:31.983
And it's interesting to compare
that with the jade masks

00:17:31.983 --> 00:17:34.566
which in China used to surround

00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:38.626
the body of the deceased person.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:42.841
That was Liu Shang and this is

00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:45.758
the burial suit of Princess Dou Wan

00:17:47.072 --> 00:17:49.239
who was buried around 113,

00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:54.271
or died 113 before the common era.

00:17:55.622 --> 00:17:59.789
In Europe, it's the necropoleis,
the cities of the dead

00:18:01.815 --> 00:18:04.646
of the Etruscans, which give
the most wonderful example.

00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:06.118
Here is Cerveteri.

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:09.902
Here is the Sarcophagus of
the Spouses from Cerveteri.

00:18:09.902 --> 00:18:13.190
And it's there that we find
the wonderful painted tombs.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.943
Here is the Tomb of the Leopards.

00:18:14.943 --> 00:18:18.446
And this is a funeral banquet,
or certainly a banquet.

00:18:18.446 --> 00:18:22.613
The deceased person reclining
with relatives and friends

00:18:23.726 --> 00:18:27.774
and being served on as Roman
banquets were transacted.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.198
And here is a very beautiful wall painting

00:18:30.198 --> 00:18:34.062
from the Tomb of the Baron, around 500 BC.

00:18:34.062 --> 00:18:37.542
And this too is Tarquinia, around 500 BC

00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:39.742
from the Tomb of the Baron.

00:18:39.742 --> 00:18:42.907
And here is one of the most delightful

00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:46.312
depictions of music and
dance from the ancient world

00:18:46.312 --> 00:18:48.312
likewise of that period.

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:52.087
And so we obviously find

00:18:53.047 --> 00:18:56.639
in the ancient world
wonderful representations.

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:59.852
Here is the goddess Athena in mourning

00:18:59.852 --> 00:19:03.628
at the grave stele of a deceased youth.

00:19:03.628 --> 00:19:06.908
And here is one of the
most delightful series

00:19:06.908 --> 00:19:09.860
of paintings of deceased persons,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.027
which you find on the mummy
coverings in the Fayum.

00:19:15.884 --> 00:19:18.127
And they have a wonderful vivacity,

00:19:18.127 --> 00:19:21.815
but they're commemorating
a deceased person

00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:24.478
for whom a belief in the afterlife

00:19:24.478 --> 00:19:27.228
was probably a doctrinal reality.

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:30.598
And then you have the grandiose.

00:19:30.598 --> 00:19:33.431
This is from the Tomb of Mausolus,

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.816
from whom we have the term mausoleum,

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:43.903
meaning a grand, eloquent,
commemorative tomb usually.

00:19:43.903 --> 00:19:47.135
And this is the funeral
effigy of Mausolus,

00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:49.295
which is now in the British Museum.

00:19:49.295 --> 00:19:53.462
And here is a reconstruction
of the Tomb of Mausolus

00:19:54.743 --> 00:19:57.630
as it would have been in Western Anatolia,

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.839
Halicarnassus in Anatolia.

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:02.256
And here in Rome is the great

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.740
monumental Tomb of Hadrian,

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:12.295
which is today the Castel Sant'Angelo.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:16.055
And here is a reconstruction
of how it may have looked.

00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:20.830
And this is obviously the
notion of death of an emperor

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.747
as a significant event.

00:20:24.438 --> 00:20:28.199
And of course the emperors
of Rome were deified.

00:20:28.199 --> 00:20:31.959
And so on their death, it was presumed

00:20:31.959 --> 00:20:35.343
that they went on to live an eternal life.

00:20:35.343 --> 00:20:39.623
And indeed the later emperors
were already regarded

00:20:39.623 --> 00:20:42.007
as divine before their death.

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:44.119
So there was no trouble about that.

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.287
And here is Hadrian indeed.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.919
And so just to come to the conclusion.

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:53.669
Obviously, we continue
to use grave monuments

00:20:55.852 --> 00:20:59.602
as a suitable locus for
celebrating the dead.

00:21:02.014 --> 00:21:05.630
And this is the Tomb
of Guiliano de' Medici,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.063
from the Medici Chapel in Florence.

00:21:09.063 --> 00:21:11.111
This is again, Michelangelo.

00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:15.457
Michelangelo now as sculptor
rather than as painter.

00:21:15.457 --> 00:21:20.055
And here, as you'll
recognize, is the Kremlin.

00:21:20.055 --> 00:21:23.199
And here in a similar guise is Lenin,

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.526
still immortalized and embalmed.

00:21:26.526 --> 00:21:31.444
As you remember, Stalin was
put beside him for awhile,

00:21:31.444 --> 00:21:33.575
but then perhaps was simply interred

00:21:33.575 --> 00:21:35.519
very wisely subsequently.

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:39.455
But Lenin still continues to rule supreme.

00:21:39.455 --> 00:21:43.311
And my last image is from the Taj Mahal,

00:21:43.311 --> 00:21:45.228
this lovely memorial to

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:53.726
the bride of the Shah dating
from the 17th century AD.

00:21:58.503 --> 00:22:02.086
So some notions of
immortality do continue,

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:08.032
but of course immortality is usually part

00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:12.664
of a belief system which involves,

00:22:15.199 --> 00:22:18.366
in the modern world certainly, a faith

00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:22.356
of whether it's Christian or Muslim

00:22:24.303 --> 00:22:26.481
or indeed Buddhist faith, but I haven't

00:22:26.481 --> 00:22:29.815
had time to discuss the Buddhist notion

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:32.751
of transubstantiation, how the soul

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:37.618
can move from one individual
on death to another individual.

00:22:37.618 --> 00:22:42.345
And that of course is a
different concept of immortality.

00:22:42.345 --> 00:22:44.577
But as I said right at the beginning,

00:22:44.577 --> 00:22:48.753
I think the awareness
of death simply depends

00:22:48.753 --> 00:22:50.967
on having a word for death.

00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:55.193
And I would say that when
we developed as humans

00:22:55.193 --> 00:22:58.110
in awareness of death as a concept,

00:22:59.185 --> 00:23:04.009
must be very much when we
developed the linguistic capacity.

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:06.546
And that linguistic capacity is usually

00:23:06.546 --> 00:23:10.313
associated with our own
species homo sapiens,

00:23:10.313 --> 00:23:14.186
as indeed was very well
documented by the last speaker

00:23:14.186 --> 00:23:18.353
with his map of the out of
Africa expansion of our species,

00:23:22.425 --> 00:23:25.393
something like 60,000 years ago.

00:23:25.393 --> 00:23:29.337
So that I think gives
a very brief synopsis

00:23:29.337 --> 00:23:32.657
of the concept of
immortality for humankind.

00:23:32.657 --> 00:23:34.153
Thank you very much.

00:23:34.153 --> 00:23:36.403
(applause)

00:23:38.274 --> 00:23:41.024
(peaceful tones)
