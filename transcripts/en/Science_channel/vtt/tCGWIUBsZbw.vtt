Narrator:
WITH THE HUNGER CLOCK TICKING,

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:09.200
JAMIE DECIDES THERE'S ONLY
ONE SOLUTION -- SPEAR FISHING.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.834
THERE WE GO.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.901
AND WHILE MOTHER NATURE DOES
PROVIDE THE MAIN COMPONENT...

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:17.334
GIVE IT UP, TREE.
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:20.033
...DUCT TAPE IS
AN INTEGRAL PART.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.634
MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT.

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:25.200
Jamie: THERE ARE THREE THINGS
THAT I CAN DO WITH THE DUCT TAPE

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.868
TO HELP MAKE A SPEAR.

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:30.267
FIRST, IT'LL ALLOW ME
TO ATTACH AND EASILY REPLACE

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.634
MULTIPLE POINTS ON THE TIP --
PERFECT.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.534
I DARESAY ANY
LITTLE FISH OR CRITTER

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.667
WOULDN'T REALLY WANT
TO GET STUCK BY THAT.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.300
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.033
AND I CAN ALSO USE IT TO MARK
THE BALANCE POINT OF THE SHAFT,

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.133
WHICH WILL HELP WITH ACCURACY.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.167
THERE WE GO.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.868
AND FINALLY, THE LINE ON THE END
WILL HELP ME RETRIEVE IT

00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:50.133
ONCE I'VE THROWN IT.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.234
I'M GONNA GO CATCH ME
SOME FISH.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.434
WELL, WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO
IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD --

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:59.534
SPOT A FISH AND SPEAR IT.

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:04.767
Narrator:
LIKE SNARING A CHICKEN,
IT SOUNDS EASY IN THEORY.

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.133
OKAY, FISH. HOLD STILL.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.734
OH!

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:11.601
BUT IN PRACTICE...
YEAH!

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:12.734
...IT'S A BEACH.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:13.801
OH!

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.534
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
WITHOUT DINNER.

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:17.400
Narrator:
ON THE PLUS SIDE, THOUGH,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.567
THE DUCT-TAPE SPEAR'S
HOLDING UP WELL.

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:23.000
Jamie: I LIKE MY LITTLE
STRING -- WORKED LIKE A TREAT.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.634
NOW, IF I CAN JUST GET THE FISH
TO HOLD STILL.

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:28.734
JUST LIKE FISHING
WITH A ROD AND REEL,

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.367
SPEAR FISHING
IS ALL ABOUT PATIENCE.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.234
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
GONNA SIT THERE LIKE DUCKS

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:36.601
AND WAIT FOR YOU TO SPEAR THEM.

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.767
YOU'VE GOT TO JUST HANG OUT,
WAIT FOR THE RIGHT TIME...

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:40.968
AND THEN THROW.

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:43.667
Narrator: AND THERE'S NO TIME
LIKE THE PRESENT.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:46.634
[ SHOUTS ]

00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:48.534
YEAH!

00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:49.734
ABOUT TIME!

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.467
Narrator:
AT LAST, HE'S NAILED IT.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.167
OH, YEAH, BABY!

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:55.334
SUSHI FOR DINNER!

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:57.200
Narrator: IT'S A GREAT RESULT.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.634
SORRY, LITTLE BUDDY.
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
