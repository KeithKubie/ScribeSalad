00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:08.873
Let's say you're on a game show.

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:12.375
You've already earned $1000 
in the first round

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:14.851
when you land on the bonus space.

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:16.657
Now, you have a choice.

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:20.131
You can either take 
a $500 bonus guaranteed

00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:22.537
or you can flip a coin.

00:00:22.537 --> 00:00:25.857
If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:29.246
If it's tails, you get no bonus at all.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:34.269
In the second round, you've earned $2000
when you land on the penalty space.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.384
Now you have another choice.

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:39.220
You can either take a $500 loss,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.171
or try your luck at the coin flip.

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:44.372
If it's heads, you lose nothing,

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:49.069
but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:50.493
If you're like most people,

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:54.284
you probably chose to take
the guaranteed bonus in the first round

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:57.254
and flip the coin in the second round.

00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:00.113
But if you think about it,
this makes no sense.

00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:04.205
The odds and outcomes in both rounds
are exactly the same.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:08.704
So why does the second round
seem much scarier?

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:13.214
The answer lies in a phenomenon
known as loss aversion.

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:15.106
Under rational economic theory,

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:18.846
our decisions should follow a simple
mathematical equation

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:23.055
that weighs the level of risk
against the amount at stake.

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:25.317
But studies have found 
that for many people,

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:29.120
the negative psychological impact
we feel from losing something

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.972
is about twice as strong as the positive
impact of gaining the same thing.

00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:39.765
Loss aversion is one cognitive bias
that arises from heuristics,

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.884
problem-solving approaches based on
previous experience and intuition

00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:46.529
rather than careful analysis.

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.165
And these mental shortcuts can lead
to irrational decisions,

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.459
not like falling in love

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.414
or bungee jumping off a cliff,

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:57.834
but logical fallacies that can easily
be proven wrong.

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:03.591
Situations involving probability are
notoriously bad for applying heuristics.

00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:09.053
For instance, say you were to roll a die
with four green faces and two red faces

00:02:09.053 --> 00:02:10.736
twenty times.

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:13.694
You can choose one of 
the following sequences of rolls,

00:02:13.694 --> 00:02:17.018
and if it shows up, 
you'll win $25.

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:18.909
Which would you pick?

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.838
In one study, 65% of the participants
who were all college students

00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:26.290
chose sequence B

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.885
even though A is shorter
and contained within B,

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:31.884
in other words, more likely.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:35.132
This is what's called 
a conjunction fallacy.

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:37.425
Here, we expect to see more green rolls,

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:41.607
so our brains can trick us into picking
the less likely option.

00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:45.822
Heuristics are also terrible 
at dealing with numbers in general.

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:49.393
In one example, students were split
into two groups.

00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:54.742
The first group was asked whether
Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9,

00:02:54.742 --> 00:03:00.279
while the second was asked whether
he died before or after age 140.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.719
Both numbers were obviously way off,

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.257
but when the students were then asked
to guess the actual age at which he died,

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:09.996
the first group's answers averaged to 50

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:13.536
while the second group's averaged to 67.

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.817
Even though the clearly wrong information
in the initial questions

00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:18.848
should have been irrelevant,

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:21.746
it still affected the students' estimates.

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:24.615
This is an example 
of the anchoring effect,

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.539
and it's often used in marketing
and negotiations

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.111
to raise the prices 
that people are willing to pay.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.559
So, if heuristics lead to 
all these wrong decisions,

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.998
why do we even have them?

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:39.772
Well, because they can be quite effective.

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:41.444
For most of human history,

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:45.724
survival depended on making quick
decisions with limited information.

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:49.751
When there's no time to logically
analyze all the possibilities,

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.775
heuristics can sometimes save our lives.

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:56.605
But today's environment requires
far more complex decision-making,

00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:01.180
and these decisions are more biased
by unconscious factors than we think,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.558
affecting everything from health 
and education

00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:06.172
to finance and criminal justice.

00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:08.482
We can't just shut off 
our brain's heuristics,

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:11.187
but we can learn to be aware of them.

00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:13.629
When you come to 
a situation involving numbers,

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.859
probability,

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.723
or multiple details,

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.040
pause for a second

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.348
and consider that the intuitive answer
might not be the right one after all.
