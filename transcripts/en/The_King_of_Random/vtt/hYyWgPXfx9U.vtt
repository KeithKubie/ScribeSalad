00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.800
Scammers, hackers and spammers, are all trying
to gain access to your accounts.&nbsp; They have

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.760
thousands of ways to trick you, so your initial
line of defense is a fortified password they

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.769
won't be able to crack.&nbsp; In this project,
we're exploring 6, "digital" life-hacks, for

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.709
building strong &amp; secure pass-codes.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.410
Let's start this project by grabbing a pen,
and a piece of paper.&nbsp; This will give us

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.980
a "digital disconnect", from any online intruders.&nbsp;
We need a password that's easy to remember,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.460
and super secure.&nbsp; That means, it needs a
good mix, of random letters, numbers, and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.370
funky symbols.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.100
Now a lot websites, will
let you use the spacebar, as a special character.&nbsp;

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.320
So that means, you can use full sentences!&nbsp;
Why use a passWORD when you can use a passPHRASE?&nbsp;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.970
Come up with a statement, like "I want to
be 23!"&nbsp; Something like this is super easy

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.540
to remember, and check out what you've done.&nbsp;
You now have a 16 character password with

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.310
a capital letter, 8 lowercase letters, 2 numbers,
and 5 special characters.&nbsp; By making a passPHRASE,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.220
you exponentially boost your protection, even
if it's one, as simple as this. &nbsp;

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.659
To make an original,
and completely randomized password, make three

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.370
columns, and write down the categories; Who,
What, and When.&nbsp; Now fill in the blanks,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.350
and remember that the crazier the idea, the
better.&nbsp; Be specific with dates, and times,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.950
and develop it into a sentence, will full
punctuation.&nbsp; "I'm training with Iron Man

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.200
at 8am on Friday!"&nbsp; Now simply take the first
character of each word, and you end up with

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.350
an incredibly strong password (ItwIMa8oF!),
that's easy to remember, and virtually uncrackable.&nbsp;

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.670
Another example could be something like "Next
year I'm going to Hawaii on March 5th." (NyIgtHoM5.)&nbsp;

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.159
These memorable passwords are 10 characters
long, completely randomized, and have a great

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.530
mix of numbers, special characters, and letters,
in both upper, and lower case.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.979
Think of your favorite
movies, songs or TV shows, and use the quotes,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.040
and lyrics as inspiration.&nbsp; If you got "I'll
be there for you!" from a TV theme song, try

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.950
switching, "for you" into the number 4, and
a capital "U".&nbsp; Your password is "I'll be

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.630
there 4U!"&nbsp; It' s a 17 character pass-code
that's easy to type, easy to remember, and

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.780
has all the essential elements to keep you
protected.&nbsp; Now some accounts won't let you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.440
have spaces in the password.&nbsp; That's no problem,
just take out the spaces and it'll work just

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.240
fine.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.300
Trying to memorize
dozens of passwords is too hard.&nbsp; To keep

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.819
things simple, many people use the same password
for most of their accounts.&nbsp; When a hacker

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.819
discovers one of your passwords, and it's
the same password for your bank account, your

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.559
personal information, and your email, you
can imagine how that's gonna affect your day.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.540
There are at least 3 different categories,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.040
where you need to have different passwords.&nbsp;Banking,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.000
Entertainment, and Email.&nbsp; Try remembering
them like this;&nbsp; It's 1. For the money.&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.209
2. For the friends.&nbsp; 3. For the email things
you send.&nbsp; Each password should be around

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.160
10-12 characters, and be completely different.
&nbsp;

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.560
You could use the same password
for similar sites, but to make it even better,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.590
try taking some of the letters from the website
itself and adding them in.&nbsp; From Facebook

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.700
you might take "F" &amp; "b" and add them to your
already secure password.&nbsp; From Twitter you

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.170
could get "T" &amp; "r", and YouTube might be
"Y" &amp; "T".&nbsp; Choose letters that you can remember,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.459
and if you're ever forced to update your password,
just add one more letter to the end. It's

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.560
as easy as that.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.060
The most secure protection
comes with having a long, and randomized password

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.500
for every different account.&nbsp; This will take
more work to create, and chances are, you

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.110
won't be able to remember them.&nbsp; You can
win that challenge by writing them down on

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.310
one piece of paper, and storing that paper,
in a place you're gonna protect.&nbsp; Like

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.769
your wallet, for quick and easy access, or
a super secret safe, like the one we made,

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.489
in a previous project.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.550
Now If you like the idea of different passwords
for each account, but don't wanna get your

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.019
paper out every time you log in, there are
password managing systems that can do it for

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.060
you. Password vaults like these, will store
all your passwords securely, maintaining full

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.300
protection, and allowing you, the speed and
luxury, of a "one click login" to any of your

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.010
sites.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.639
Well now you know how to make a strong and
secure password, that will thwart a hacker,

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.810
and help protect your digital life.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.690
By the way, if you've already been hacked,
or feel like you might be vulnerable, check
