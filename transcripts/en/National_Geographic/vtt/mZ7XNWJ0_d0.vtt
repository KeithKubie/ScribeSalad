00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.520
Who are you? Everyone thinks they know
who they are - Scots Irish, African

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.959
Or maybe Native American.

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.689
The genealogy can only get you back so
Far.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.510
you can research records, maybe learn
more about who your family is

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.429
And where they all came from,

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:21.149
but if you're lucky the paper trail goes
back maybe a couple of hundred years.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.460
Then, the trail goes cold.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.319
But the human lineages back around two
hundred thousand years to one person on

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.329
your mother's side and also the one
person on your father's side that we're all

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.550
related to. How can you get there? The
answer is -- you can't

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.260
unless you look at your DNA. 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.070
your DNA contains a roadmap all the
way back through time to those common

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.570
ancestors.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.310
It's as if they were dropping bread crumbs
on your DNA to let you find your way

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.870
back home.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.760
Your own DNA tells an incredible
story of how your ancestors embarked on an epic

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.370
journey that populated the earth,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.150
so how can you see your DNA and discover
your own family saga. 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.310
It sounds complicated but it's actually
pretty straightforward. About seven years

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.950
ago, National Geographic started
something called The Genographic Project.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.530
Our mission is to look at the DNA of as 
many people as possible from around the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.600
world to solve the riddle

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.270
of who we are and how we are all related to each
other. So far more than half a million

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.430
people have participated,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.310
and you can too. Your Genographic kit explains
it all and it also comes with a little

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.450
brush called a swab. All you need to do
is brush the inside your mouth.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.210
This collects some cells from inside your
Cheek, and those cells contain DNA. Send

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.299
the swab back to us, and a few weeks later
you'll get the answers on our website

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.649
Like what genetic linage you belong to,
where your ancestors originated, and where

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.789
they went. The amazing story of your ancient
family line it will even tell you what

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.450
fraction of your DNA is from what
part of the world -

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.680
European, African, Asian, Australian
Native American and so on.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.240
We'll even be able to tell you what
percent Neanderthal you are

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.640
the answers might really surprise you and
I'll bet they make you think a little

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.660
differently about who you are, where you
came from, and how you're related to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.979
everyone else in the world.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.620
Welcome to the journey of a lifetime, of
billions of lifetimes,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.300
the human journey.
