Speaker 1:          00:00          In them. What does, I mean it's some sort of chemical now, no other antigens, right? They're, they're, they're fluid back macromolecules. What's the liquids? Typically it would be saline or saltwater. And right now, um, what is missing from today's vaccine protocol, if anything in terms of diseases we should be vaccinating for. But yeah, there's certainly are, um, you know, one of them is a big, big problem among young infants, especially premature infants called RSV, respiratory syncytial virus infection. What does that come from? It, it's um, you know, it's a respiratory virus that peaks around the same time that flu does. So it's a very severe respiratory illness. So this is again, one of those vaccines that's not a big moneymaker. So the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is trying to, uh, provide grants for supporting that one, that that's a good one. And then there are all the diseases that affect poor people, both in developing countries that even among the point in the United States, that was the subject of this book.

Speaker 1:          01:05          That's, that's the next one called the marble health. The next one. So this is not released yet. This is out. This actually, this actually preceded the, Oh look at this one now. This book is all about poor people and infectious diseases and that the rise of these infectious diseases even in the United States. That's right. So you know, when we think about, so I, you know, let, let this big campaign to raise awareness of somebody call neglected tropical diseases or NTDs. These are the most common afflictions of people living in poverty. Um, I called them the most important disease. You've never heard of their diseases like schistosomiasis and chagas disease and leishmaniasis and had been devoting my life to seeing if we could develop vaccines for those diseases in the nonprofit sector. You know, because the big pharmaceutical companies just don't see, just aren't going to take these on.

Speaker 1:          02:00          So we're trying to do in the nonprofit sector. But this book, the Blue Marble health book came out of some number crunching that I did using data from the World Health Organization or something called the Institute for health metrics and evaluation, which is based in Seattle, Washington. That found something very surprising. And that is most of the world's poverty related diseases are not necessarily in the poorest, most devastated countries of Africa, meaning like Democratic Republic of Congo or Central African Republic. They're there, but on a numbers basis, most of these poverty related diseases are actually in the g 20 economies, the 20 wealthiest economies, um, together with Nigeria, which is not a g 20 country, but it has an economy bigger than the bottom three or four. So that was pretty amazing. Amazing for me to find that out. Because you know, at first I didn't believe the numbers because I said, well, how could it be if their poverty diseases, why are they in the 20 wealthiest economies?

Speaker 1:          03:02          And then I realized that it's among the poor living in wealthy countries. So the poorest of the rich today now account for most of the world's poverty related diseases. And what, what's the cause of this? So why, why the link with poverty? So that's a great question. One of the things I do in the book is I asked that, well, what is it about poverty that's making susceptible? I don't think we really know. I mean, clearly in some cases, if you live in poor, dilapidated housing without window screens, things like mosquitoes and kissing bugs and sandflies can get inside the house. Or if you look, um, in, in poor neighborhoods, like in and around Houston, you see a lot of environmental degradation or around the neighborhood you see discarded tires that breed, it is chipped. I mosquito or standing water. But I don't, I don't think what, what, what did the tires do?

Speaker 1:          03:54          Discard. So yeah. So one of the best habitats for the mosquito that transmits Danky and Zika and Chikungunya and yellow fever are discarded tires. That's what they love. So this, you know, if you go into poor neighborhoods, you'll see a lot of tire dumping for instance. And that's, those are habitats for that eighties Aegypti mosquito, including in southern California. Was that when the water gets in the tightest around a little bit of water? That's exactly it. Yeah. You know, I moved into a house once in a Encino down the street from here in fact. And um, no one had lived in the house for about a year. And a half, two years and the pool had not been taken care of and I went out into the pool and it was green and there were schools of mosquito Skeeto heaven. Mosquito head is so strange. So yeah, absolutely. You go into poor neighborhoods, abandoned swimming pools, things like that.

Speaker 1:          04:49          That's, that's where we're getting a number of these diseases. We don't have very many mosquitoes in southern California. I mean it's really kind of amazing in that regard. Like, well it depends. So you know, some counties where they do aggressive spraying and things like that, you won't. But many counties you probably, probably some of the poorer counties, poor districts you still do. But I mean in terms of the way it is on the east coast, like I grew up in Boston and then the summertime you just have fucking mosquitoes everywhere. They just can't get away from him. And then I've been to Alaska, which is the craziest place I've ever been to in my life in terms of mosquitoes. Right. Have you been? I haven't been to Alaska, but you get out of your car and they attack you like a hoard of birds because they only get one month of the senior.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Exactly. Yeah, they have. So they're super aggressive and they are, they're also very large. The big problems along the Gulf coast of the U s we have that aid is jipped by mosquito and that's why I got so worried about Zika virus. The Gulf coast of the u s yeah. Um, mosquitoes and other countries obviously contain malaria. I mean, we've been very fortunate that that's never made it over to here. Well, no, we, we used to have malaria used to be widespread in the United States. Um, both the one that was a real killer disease called Falciparum Malaria on the Gulf coast and even up into Illinois and the Ohio River valley. We had a lot of malaria. When was that? By five x in the 18 hundreds. In fact, there's a whole, there's a book written by Dickens when he visited the United States called Martin chuzzlewit. No. When he describes all of these sickly people in Illinois and Cairo, Illinois on the confluence of the Mississippi in the higher river.

Speaker 1:          06:24          He's clearly describing malaria. Wow. I did not know. Yeah. So what stopped it? So that's a great question. Um, we, so there's actually a very nice book written by a medical historian that Duke University named Margaret Humphreys called malaria race and poverty. And she has a hypothesis but I think she's onto something that um, it, the decreased the malaria dropped in associated with aggressive economic development so that the FDRs new deal included something called the Agricultural Adjustment Act that got people off of, off of with agrarian pursuits and put them into factories. Quality housing went up and that's probably what caused a lot of the reduction in these tropical diseases. Remember they're really diseases of poverty. In fact I spent a lot of time working in China and I'm seeing that play out right now in China. You know China is cuts is very, very aggressive program of economic development, mostly in the eastern part of the country, but in the southwest part of the country go into you non Sichuan provinces.

Speaker 1:          07:29          You go back in time 75 years and you still see those diseases. So spread. Do you think that the best cure or the best way to stop malaria would be just to increase the economy of these areas in Africa where they're experiencing it at? Clearly economic development is a very potent driver. Now what it is about economic development, we still don't have our arms around that yet, but economic development is very important. Just like for the neglected tropical diseases we study. But you know, unfortunately for many countries economic development is still decades away. So that's why, that's the rationale for developing these vaccines. Is it because of economic development moves people into more urban environments where there's less tropical diseases? I think that's part of it. Although now we're seeing some tropical diseases thrive and urbanized environments like you know, yellow fever and Zika and dengue.

Speaker 1:          08:16          He as well. So it's not only urbanization, you have has to be urbanization with good planning that's not done unchecked, that outstrips the infrastructure in terms of water and sanitation. So this brings me to the thing that I wanted to talk to you about in the first place. Cause this is what you brought up to me. Um, when we were doing this, a sci fi show, and, uh, you said something to me that has been haunting me ever since, that the vast majority of people that live in tropical climates have parasites. [inaudible] vast at jar. Yep, that's right. That's right. There's things like Toxoplasma Gondii. And so let's look at the, let's look at the hit parade, right? The top one is one called ascariasis intestinal roundworm. Uh, the estimates are on 800 million people have asked Russ Ron worms in their bellies. Whoa. So hunter, so more than one in 10 people on the planet, and mostly people who live in extreme poverty, um, 400 million have hookworm infection.

Speaker 1:          09:15          400 million have whipped warrants. A lot of these are wormy diseases. 200 million people with scabies, which is an ecto parasite on, on the skin that causes terrible itching and, and secondary bacterial infections. Just to surmise, this is another one. The point is every, almost every single person who is an extreme poverty has one of these, what I call neglected tropical diseases. And one of the interesting features about them is they're very debilitating. They not, so that not only occur in the setting of poverty, but I think they reinforce poverty because they make people too sick to go to work. They make a, they actually shape, we can show they shave Iq points off of kids when they have them. Well, this is the hookworm connection to the idea of the slack jawed dumb southerner, right, right, right. States of America. And now one of the things that we have found, so ray Dalio Mahia on my faculty, uh, working with environmental activist named Catherine Coleman flowers in Alabama found that hook where Ms. Little present and Alabama.

Speaker 1:          10:15          So among the poor people, so they understand what we're talking about. Because for the longest time, there was this stereotype about people that lived in the south, that they were dull minded, right. And that this could be directly connected to hook worm infection, which had run rampant. Right. There was even the term given called, they call it the germ of laziness, then hookworm infection because it causes severe anemia. So if you're walking around with terrible anemia, of course you're agreeing to, you're to, you're not feeling up to working a full day and all that sort of stuff. So hookworm was wildly president, president in the southeastern United States at the turn of the 20th century. And then as malaria went down with economic development, so, so did hookworm infection as well. But we still have pockets in this country. And this was an understood at the time, right?

Speaker 1:          11:03          They didn't know that these people were infected with hookworm for, for, for forever. No, up until very recently. So the cause of hookworm wasn't discovered until 1900 what is that? Cause it's called indicator Americaness the American killer as that. And that's the name of the worm. And this is from walking barefoot or that goes in through the hands or enters all parts of the body. So it's very common to get it from walking barefoot. Right. Which was more common in the south. Right, right. So that's one of the diseases. We've made a vaccine for this now in clinical trials. Yeah. When I found that one out, I was like, oh my God. Well that's it. That totally makes sense. Because for the longest time was there, there was that stereotype. And then when you find out that it's directly connected to a massive infection of this disease, this worm, so these are the diseases that are holding back, people who live in poverty. And originally I thought only in places like the poorest countries in sub Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia, but now I realize it's these pockets of poverty across the entire planet, that people are affected by these diseases and these diseases can be vaccinated. That's where we're trying to prove that we can make a vaccine against. And there is a hooker and vaccine right now in clinical trials. Yeah. Just in clinical trials.
