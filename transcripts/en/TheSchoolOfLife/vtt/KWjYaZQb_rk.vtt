It’s a lovely place.
They said it’s regional italian,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.420
whatever that means.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.060
It got some amazing reviews online.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.380
Mostly I get into work about 9, though, if the traffic is heavy, sometimes it can

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.180
be as late as 9.30. It’s alright though, I
usually have a book with me.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.520
I grew up in the countryside, so I’m
used to big distances. I’ve been riding

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.860
bikes since I was a kid. Grazed knees and
all that. I’m not scared of the traffic.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.560
You just have to make sure they know you’re
there.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.649
It’s a part of data services where
basically we hire servers to take some of

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.409
the pressure off at peak time and then charge
them depending on how much capacity they use.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.640
I think it’s basically trying to
make like a point about womens position

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
in society and how capitalism basically disenfranchises and alienates

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.580
people who don’t conform to the heteredoxy, you know?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.000
I think. But like, maybe it lends itself to film noir too.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.240
So I’m working for the youngest partner.
Usually it takes two years to reach associate

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.450
status, but I’m recon I could do it in one,
if I hit all my targets.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.100
I hardly ever eat artichokes, they’re
such weird things really. Imagine the courage

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.140
of the first person who ate one. Must
have been truly desperate.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah, nothing next to the courage of the guy who first ate an oyster...

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.980
I’ll certainly give it a few more
years, then who knows. There might be an opportunity

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.680
for me in America.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.520
The company is based in Atlanta,
which is in effect everywhere really...

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.460
And then my Nan lost her leg.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.170
No I’ll get it, I insist. It was my idea.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.580
Thank you, you’re so kind. I didn’t expect it, I mean, it’s so generous of you.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.580
This was great, thanks
Yeah, so I guess I’ll see you around.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.720
Sure.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.220
Great
