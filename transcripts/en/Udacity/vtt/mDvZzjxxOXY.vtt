00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.268
So personality is a mixture of both nature and nurture. But the nurture part

00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:10.606
ironically comes mostly from outside of the family. With twin studies, we see

00:00:10.606 --> 00:00:17.620
that heredity, or your genetics account for around 50 to 60% of most traits.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.860
However, slightly less for agreeableness and openness. What's surprising is

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.820
that shared environment, meaning your home and your family, has a really small

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.300
influence on these traits, as compared to a non sharing environment. So for

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.461
example you get 39% of your openness from your genetics, 14% from the

00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:40.616
environment you share with your family. And 47% from your non-shared

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:46.629
environment. And as for conscientiousness, 44% of this trait comes from

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.885
non-shared environment with 56% of it coming from genetics. And we can see this

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:58.924
line up with extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism as well.
