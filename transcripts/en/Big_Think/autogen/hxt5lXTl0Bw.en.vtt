00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:04.269
\f0\fs24 \cf0 Here is what we have to do.\'a0
The fiscal cliff everybody complains about

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:08.699
- and there will be some pain associated with
it, is a 1.3% recessionary economy for two

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.629
quarters. What you can't do is fix the deficit
by cutting taxes for millionaires and then

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.700
taking money away from people on social security
and Medicare.\'a0 That's what the Republicans

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.580
want to do.\
The reason I like the idea of going over the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.290
fiscal cliff is this is an incredibly partisan
congress, which has accomplished essentially

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.260
nothing in the last two years since the republicans
have taken over.\'a0 And they're not going

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.460
to come up with a better solution and here
is what is good about the fiscal cliff.\'a0

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.090
First of all, we go back to the tax rate when
Clinton was president.\'a0 We had a much better

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.390
economy.\'a0 We had a\'97the last balanced
budget we had was under Clinton.\'a0 Republicans

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.130
do not balance budgets.\'a0 I have no idea.\'a0
I think Eisenhower was the last budget that

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.059
was balanced under a Republican.\'a0 You can't
trust them with your money.\

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.570
So what you need to do is increase the taxes
to where they were when Bill Clinton was president

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.070
of the United States and you need to cut defense.\'a0
It has never been cut because every defense

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.230
although the defense establishment has plants
in 420 out of the 435 congressional districts.\'a0

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.079
That won't be done unless we drive over the
fiscal cliff.\'a0 I as a Democrat am willing

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.579
to sacrifice the cuts that we're going to
have to make in the programs we care about

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.619
in order to get those two things done, otherwise,
they will not be done. And it is so craven

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.159
of the congress to be scrambling around trying
to figure out how to get out the agreement

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.859
that they made because they're feathering
in their own nest. \'a0 I'm tired of having

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.450
politicians that won't do the tough stuff.\'a0
Yes, it's going to be unpleasant.\'a0 We spent

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.560
a lot of money that we didn't have.\'a0 Now
we're going to have to pay the bill.\'a0 If

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.060
we don't pay it now we really are going to
end up like Greece.\'a0 I don't want that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.840
to happen and I do not trust the Republicans
because they're terribly fiscally irresponsible

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.549
and frankly, I don't trust the Democrats a
lot either, even though they have a much better

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.740
record on fiscal matters because it was Clinton
and Gore that balanced the last budget.\

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.079
So I think we ought to go over the cliff.\'a0
We ought to bite the bullet.\'a0 It will take

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.000
7 \'bd trillion dollars out of our deficit.\'a0
That's a big number and there will be sacrifices,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.249
but any politician who tells the American
people there aren't going to be any sacrifices

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:03.079
for everybody is a liar and I do not want
the sacrifices to be on the backs of the middle

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.279
class.\'a0 I think it's time the people who
made all that money screwing up the banking

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.469
system paid their fair share.\'a0\
