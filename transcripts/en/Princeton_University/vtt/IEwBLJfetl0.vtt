00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:01.680
RODNEY PRIESTLEY:
The students are

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.090
learning theory behind material
science characterization

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
techniques as well as gaining
hands-on practical experience

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.860
on how to utilize
these techniques.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.440
This year we've decided
to break the course out

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.580
into three modules.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.370
The second module is
based on hard materials,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.620
characterization, and
giving students experience

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.470
on utilizing the techniques
that exist in the new Andlinger

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.320
Center for Energy
and Environment

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.024
and the Imaging and
Analysis Center.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:28.440
And so there, the students are
getting hands-on experience

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.380
with techniques and equipment
such as transmission electron

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.600
microscopy or scanning
electron microscopy.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.390
GRACE KRESGE: In lab,
we did an experiment

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.800
where we took a scanning
electron microscopy images

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.660
of a butterfly wing.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.250
I'd like to go to
graduate school

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.580
for chemical engineering
focused on materials science,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.500
and this course is really
going to prepare me.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.800
It already is preparing me for
graduate-level characterization

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.460
work.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.710
This is things that I've
seen my graduate students

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.760
in the past do.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.620
I know that this is
getting me on track

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.420
to be a competitive candidate
to go to graduate school.
