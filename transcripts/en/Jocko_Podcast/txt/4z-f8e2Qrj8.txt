Speaker 1:          00:00          You discuss leading and maneuvering up and down the chain of command. But what about laterally within your own peer group where the competition for advancement is fiercest and your ability to to set team objectives and implement some of the tools you discuss is limited. Okay, so you absolutely do have to lead laterally amongst your peers. And since you don't have rank or position, you have to do it another way.

Speaker 1:          00:29          But wait a second, since you shouldn't use rank or position to lead people below you in the chain of command and since you don't want to be led by someone that's throwing their rank and position around, then guess what? You need to do the same type of leadership that you would use up and down the chain of command to lead your peers. So what does that mean? That means you help them when you can or you support what they're doing. You try and build a relationship with them. That's what you try and do. Now this, this part of this that where we're talking about the competitiveness. Like if they want to maneuver and try and make you look bad and jump in the spotlight and try and get all the credit, guess what? That's fine. That's fine. Let them do it. And everyone is gonna see what they're doing. And they might not see it immediately, but they will eventually be found out. So do your best to support them. Do your best to help them do your best to build the relationship. Make the mission the most important thing, not the little politics that you're about to dive into and get involved. And don't make that the primary thing. Make the primary thing accomplishing the mission.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Thinking about this, if you start fighting with them, you're expending energy on fighting your own team. That's what you're doing. Instead of fighting the enemy, it's, this is a blue on blue situation. This is a friendly fire. It's fratricide don't do that. Disengaged from the friendly fire and focus on how to make the team win.

Speaker 2:          02:00          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Take the high ground, take the high ground or the high ground. We'll take you.

Speaker 2:          02:10          Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Another one of those points that we always say, I know I do and I always think this where people are watching, man, they see that and they see that you see all that stuff, but let's play this game too. You know the game where I play with it. Like who would you hire? Who would you rather have working for you? Who would you rather have working for you? If the guy, the guy, oh you got four guys. One guy is helping the other guys out trying to help them with their mission. One Guy, the other end of the spectrum is undermining people and trying to make himself look good. Which guy are you going to promote? Yeah. All Day long. You know who you're going to promote. Yeah. You're going to promote the guy that's trying to help the team win and not just look out for himself.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Yup. Yeah. Fully. And then sit and consider that with not just your boss but like your peers as well. You know, even if there's competition, let's say everyone's competing for, yeah, and you're the guy who's jumping in the spotlight always, whatever. Versus the other guy who's always helping everyone. Right. Even even if they're competing with you, for sure. I'm in the spotlight, he's going to get ostracized if anything is, you know, so man. Yeah, they see that stuff, man, that goes socially. You know what? No, no, no. Answer me this. When someone sees the world this way, that means there have a tendency to think that way. That means they, I might have a tendency to act this way, so they are going to be especially cautious if you're looking at everyone like, well, I'm trying to compete with that guy. I might be getting screwed over if I don't, if I let him, you don't get the spotlight right now.

Speaker 1:          03:38          If that's the way you're thinking, that's the way you're acting and if you're acting that way, everybody can see it. Yeah. Don't act that way. Don't act that way. Be a good team member. Yeah. The enemy is outside the wire. Yeah. That's a good one too. Where the good news about that is like let's say you are active in that way, as long as you can admit it to yourself, even if you do have those feelings inside, but you're like, hey, I don't want to act like that. And you start, even if you know it's kind of against her feelings, and then you start acting that way slowly and slowly. Your feelings can accommodate where you don't feel that way anymore. You'll start to feel that way. Let's start to realize how you should act as a human being, as a team member, as a leader, as a follower, you'll grow up, your mature, you'll be a good person. Feel the benefits as opposed to just looking out for yourself at school and over the other team. The ones against me, check, kill or be killed.
