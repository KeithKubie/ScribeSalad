00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's look at the two cases.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first case is where n is prime.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When n is prime, Ï†(n) is equal to n - 1, so we're done.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We have exactly what we need for that from Fermat's Little Theorem.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Case two is where n is not prime, but we know that a and n are relatively prime.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In this case, we know since n is not prime,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there are some numbers that are not relatively prime to n.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's put those in a set. We'll call it R.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We're going to multiply that set by a mod n to get a new set we'll call S.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now I have a quiz about R and S.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here are the choices.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all of the statements that are true.
