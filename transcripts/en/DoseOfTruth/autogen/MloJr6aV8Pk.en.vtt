00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270
exactly right you know it's it's it's
eerie that that's the mode of

eerie that that's the mode of
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.700
eerie that that's the mode of
representation that emerged for them but

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
representation that emerged for them but
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.650
representation that emerged for them but
it's certainly accurate so you know the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
it's certainly accurate so you know the
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.330
it's certainly accurate so you know the
whole tyrannical end of the great

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
whole tyrannical end of the great
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220
whole tyrannical end of the great
fathers this is the sort of thing that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
fathers this is the sort of thing that
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.680
fathers this is the sort of thing that
results from it you know it's like the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
results from it you know it's like the
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.090
results from it you know it's like the
the elevation of the person at the top

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
the elevation of the person at the top
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.320
the elevation of the person at the top
of the door minutes are key to the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
of the door minutes are key to the
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450
of the door minutes are key to the
status of some kind of quasi deity

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
status of some kind of quasi deity
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429
status of some kind of quasi deity
certainly happened in Hitler's case and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
certainly happened in Hitler's case and
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500
certainly happened in Hitler's case and
then the brutal murderous nough that can

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
then the brutal murderous nough that can
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.910
then the brutal murderous nough that can
emerge from that those are pictures from

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
emerge from that those are pictures from
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190
emerge from that those are pictures from
the concentration camps at the end of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
the concentration camps at the end of
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.219
the concentration camps at the end of
World War two so you know so I told you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
World War two so you know so I told you
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.320
World War two so you know so I told you
that the feet the feminine can be rep

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
that the feet the feminine can be rep
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.899
that the feet the feminine can be rep
that terrible unknown things can be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
that terrible unknown things can be
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.550
that terrible unknown things can be
represented by the feminine sort of a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
represented by the feminine sort of a
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.800
represented by the feminine sort of a
monstrous figure you know but it's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
monstrous figure you know but it's
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.870
monstrous figure you know but it's
certainly the case that the monstrosity

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
certainly the case that the monstrosity
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.350
certainly the case that the monstrosity
of culture is roughly equivalent to the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
of culture is roughly equivalent to the
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.200
of culture is roughly equivalent to the
monstrosity of nature you know and one

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
monstrosity of nature you know and one
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.520
monstrosity of nature you know and one
of the things you might think about is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
of the things you might think about is
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.039
of the things you might think about is
that common ideologies tend to utilize

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
that common ideologies tend to utilize
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.780
that common ideologies tend to utilize
these symbolic categories it's almost as

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
these symbolic categories it's almost as
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.429
these symbolic categories it's almost as
if they appropriate them so the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
if they appropriate them so the
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.770
if they appropriate them so the
environmental movement for example

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780
environmental movement for example
 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.870
environmental movement for example
basically says benevolent nature right

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
basically says benevolent nature right
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030
basically says benevolent nature right
so that's the positive feminine negative

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
so that's the positive feminine negative
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.530
so that's the positive feminine negative
culture because that's cultures out

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
culture because that's cultures out
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929
culture because that's cultures out
there rapaciously destroying the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
there rapaciously destroying the
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.270
there rapaciously destroying the
pristine wilderness of Mother Nature and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
pristine wilderness of Mother Nature and
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609
pristine wilderness of Mother Nature and
the negative individual too because you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
the negative individual too because you
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.170
the negative individual too because you
know human beings are part of that as

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
know human beings are part of that as
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660
know human beings are part of that as
individuals and we're kind of a cancer

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
individuals and we're kind of a cancer
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.580
individuals and we're kind of a cancer
on the face of the planet if you you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
on the face of the planet if you you
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.380
on the face of the planet if you you
know I mean that's a pretty dark way of

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
know I mean that's a pretty dark way of
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.969
know I mean that's a pretty dark way of
looking at it obviously but it's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
looking at it obviously but it's
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.800
looking at it obviously but it's
one-sided because you can easily say

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
one-sided because you can easily say
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449
one-sided because you can easily say
yeah well you know we're in a war with

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
yeah well you know we're in a war with
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.100
yeah well you know we're in a war with
nature because obviously she's trying to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
nature because obviously she's trying to
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670
nature because obviously she's trying to
kill us

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
kill us
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800
kill us
fast as possible and we better have some

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
fast as possible and we better have some
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.880
fast as possible and we better have some
culture because otherwise we'd be

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890
culture because otherwise we'd be
 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.920
culture because otherwise we'd be
sitting outside in the freezing snow and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
sitting outside in the freezing snow and
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.020
sitting outside in the freezing snow and
you know you might be a rapacious

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
you know you might be a rapacious
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.789
you know you might be a rapacious
consumer but on the other hand you're

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799
consumer but on the other hand you're
 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.949
consumer but on the other hand you're
just trying to survive and it's not that

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
just trying to survive and it's not that
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780
just trying to survive and it's not that
easy and so you know you need to have

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
easy and so you know you need to have
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.179
easy and so you know you need to have
both of those stories together before

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189
both of those stories together before
 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.069
both of those stories together before
you have a reasonable representation of

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079
you have a reasonable representation of
 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.379
you have a reasonable representation of
the world it's not easy to cope with

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389
the world it's not easy to cope with
 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.379
the world it's not easy to cope with
something like well like that it's not

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389
something like well like that it's not
 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.640
something like well like that it's not
easy to cope with something like that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
easy to cope with something like that
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.360
easy to cope with something like that
and every institution has this potential

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370
and every institution has this potential
 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.789
and every institution has this potential
and this element because institutions

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799
and this element because institutions
 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.789
and this element because institutions
tend towards bureaucratization and

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799
tend towards bureaucratization and
 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.679
tend towards bureaucratization and
tyranny as they develop they close up

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689
tyranny as they develop they close up
 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.629
tyranny as they develop they close up
and become rigid and so you know that's

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639
and become rigid and so you know that's
 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.399
and become rigid and so you know that's
a rough thing to deal with and then of

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409
a rough thing to deal with and then of
 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.839
a rough thing to deal with and then of
course this is a rough thing to deal

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849
course this is a rough thing to deal
 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.670
course this is a rough thing to deal
with too so you might think well you

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
with too so you might think well you
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.800
with too so you might think well you
could have a little bit of sympathy for

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
could have a little bit of sympathy for
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.509
could have a little bit of sympathy for
human beings not just throw them in the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
human beings not just throw them in the
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.759
human beings not just throw them in the
horrible rapacious creature category

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769
horrible rapacious creature category
 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.789
horrible rapacious creature category
which i think is an extraordinarily

which i think is an extraordinarily
 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.259
which i think is an extraordinarily
pathological and also a pre genocide

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269
pathological and also a pre genocide

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
now and then say the planet would be

better off without people on it it's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
better off without people on it it's
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.610
better off without people on it it's
like well you know that's kind of what

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
like well you know that's kind of what
