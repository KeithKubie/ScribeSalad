JENNY MURPHY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.520
Welcome to this week's session
of the Google+

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.850
Platform Office Hours.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.410
This week, we are taking a
little bit more of an informal

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.690
approach and doing a Q&amp;A
session, mostly focusing on

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.900
questions that you
guys ask us.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.650
We're doing this because we've
done a lot of neat stuff in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.780
the last couple weeks that we
think you might have some

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.070
questions about.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.215
For example, the Hangout
apps are now in OpenID.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:26.700
Here's me on here.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.110
I'll start with introductions.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.060
I'm Jenny Murphy.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.470
I'm a developer programs
engineer here at Google.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.550
And I focus on Google+ Platform,
so all the APIs that

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.220
are part of the Google+
ecosystem.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.850
And helping me from the
production booth is Chirag,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.345
who's going to come
over and say hi.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:47.650
CHIRAG SHAH: Hello.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.980
I'm also a developer programs
engineer working on the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.700
Google+ API.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.940
JENNY MURPHY: So he's primarily
making sure that you

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.950
guys can keep hearing me.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.520
We're trying something
a little different.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.700
So bear with us as we play
with our new gear.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.709
And joining us from cyberspace
is someone who is indicated as

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.050
App Dev from his camera.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.924
Would you like to say hi?

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:09.316
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Hi there.

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:10.310
I'm Alan Firstenberg.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.820
I'm the developer not affiliated
with Google.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.420
API [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.042
caption [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.680
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.890
Since you were nice enough to
come and join us on air, you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.190
mentioned you had
a few questions

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.290
you'd like to ask us.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.222
Would you like to dive in
and give us a grilling?

00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:41.146
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Sure.

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:43.456
The first question I had was,
while developing this Hangout

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:44.842
app, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.834
we would be getting warnings
about insecure content.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:53.084
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.930
JENNY MURPHY: This is
a great question.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.410
All the Hangouts are
run through SSL

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.230
for the obvious reasons.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.870
We want to keep your
conversations secure.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.570
And this has some implications
on the application

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.590
development.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.240
We're iframing your
application.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.370
So most browsers get a little
bit cranky when there's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.910
insecure content, such as an
image or a JavaScript file

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.530
that you're including that is
included over a normal HTTP

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.760
connection.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.080
So yes, this means if you want
things to work fast, serve

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.820
your content for your Hangout
app, including all of the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.430
JavaScript you include, any of
the Ajax calls you make, all

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.160
that kind of stuff.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.590
Do it all over SSL if you can
at all possible because this

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.980
protects the user's content.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.360
Because the user sees HTTPS in
the address bar-- and in

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.360
general, they're going to expect
secure communications.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.410
So that is in line with
that expectation.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.680
And as a result, it'll also
get rid of a lot of those

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.910
browser warning messages.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.920
I haven't done a lot of
cross-browser testing.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.790
But from my experience tinkering
around, things keep

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.910
working even if you're
not using SSL.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.250
But just to make the console
usable, I switched to SSL as

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.450
soon as I could.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.400
So SSL certificates can be
a real pain to set up.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.090
So there's some work arounds
for this during the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.950
development cycle.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.090
While you're developing, you
can start by using a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.900
sub-domain of an existing
provider that offers a wild

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.410
card SSL certificate.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.130
And we actually have one
available that we like, App

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.340
Engine, AppSpot.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.250
If you have domain, your
app.appspot.com, you can just

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.230
start using SSL without having
to do anything special at all.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.520
If you would like to serve
off of your own domain--

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.230
which is what I do for a lot
of my development because I

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.050
like to play with LAMP or Ruby
or whatever sometimes--

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.940
in those cases, if you don't
have the time to set up your

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.470
own SSL certificate or you don't
want to invest the money

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.769
during your development cycle,
you can use a self signed

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.810
certificate.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.800
And how you get that set up in
your browser depends a lot on

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.930
your operating system and which
browser you're using.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.570
But in general, you can google
search and find out how to do

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.020
a self signed certificate on
your domain and then how to

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.320
accept it on your computer.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.740
And then that will actually make
the warnings all settle

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.720
down during your development
cycle.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.930
Then later when it's time for
release and your app is ready

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.680
and everything's all cool, then
you're probably going to

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.220
want to set up your own SSL
certificate just so all users

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.350
will be happy.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.730
Cool.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.980
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.130
JENNY MURPHY: It would be really
cool if that supported

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.370
all the latest Badge features.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.340
I haven't actually talked to
the Blogger team about this

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.450
yet, but I'll be looping
back with them later.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.020
The general answer to these
kinds of situations is all the

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.530
teams are often developing stuff
and focusing on getting

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.480
features out as quickly
as possible.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.780
This means sometimes we get
a little bit out of sync.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.440
The Blogger team probably wanted
the badge to be pretty

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.040
stable before they started
developing their integration.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.940
And the resizing of the
badges, a newer

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.190
feature of the badge.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.600
And combined with this, in
general, we want to get

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.670
features out to you quickly
and as high quality as

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.310
possible, and then iterate
on them as fast as

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.120
we can after that.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.890
So I haven't talked to them
yet, so this is just my

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.920
conjecture.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.350
But I assume they reached a
point where it's like, we've

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.610
reached some challenge.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.200
And it's going to be
a lot of work.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.490
It's going to delay the release
to get badge resizing

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.490
and some of the other
features included.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.790
So we'll start by just releasing
the badge for now

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.940
and then we'll loop back and
we'll include the other

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.670
features like the resizing.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.890
So that's just my conjecture.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.740
I'm not actually sure.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.040
I'm going to have to loop back
with them and bust their chops

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.100
about this a little
bit, and [? CCC ?]

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.592
what's going on there.

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:34.180
But hopefully it's
coming soon.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.980
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
Okay, thanks.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.990
JENNY MURPHY: You're welcome.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.620
So do you have anything else
you wanted to chat about?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.650
Otherwise, I'm going to go to
some of the questions people

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.812
asked over the last
couple days.

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:45.030
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Let's go
to some of the questions.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.820
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.920
Let's go to some of these.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.110
So reading from the stream.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.080
So Chris Lang, who is actually
helping a lot of other people

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.160
on this [UNINTELLIGIBLE] with
blogging on the comments

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.370
thread-- thanks a
lot for that--

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.730
asked a question at the
top of the thread.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.980
Do you have any idea why my
Google+ button still throws

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.430
errors in Chrome?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.980
So I believe you're asking
about the +1 button.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.700
And occasionally, it will log
an error to the console that

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.260
says that there was
insecure content

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.280
included across domain.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.520
This is a known issue
with the +1 button.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.550
And the +1 button automatically
adapts to

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.640
recover from this problem.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.850
And it catches that error.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.220
But it still works its way
out to the console log.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.750
So it's a little bit ugly.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.920
But it should keep
working fine.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.560
And we're working through
solutions to this

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.890
problem right now.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.000
So hang tight.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.740
We're working to figure
this one out.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.590
But for now, it should
keep working fine.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.420
If it starts misbehaving,
let us know.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.580
We'll take another look.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.830
Thanks.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.790
So the next question down the
list was from Perkin, who

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.560
mentioned that there is a
discrepancy between the +1

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.520
count of the button on his pages
and Google Analytics and

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.770
Google Webmaster Tools.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.410
Actually, I saw that Chris,
actually, the asker of the

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.850
previous question, was working
with Perkin a lot to try and

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.600
resolve this problem.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.590
Thanks.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.760
We had some really good feedback
there for him.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.500
But let's talk a little bit
about the +1 button count.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.460
So in general in software,
whenever we have data,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.640
especially across a big
distributed system, and we

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.500
want to be able to read it
really quickly, we have to

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.679
make a compromise.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:47.000
We have to compromise between
the freshness of that data and

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.390
the speed with which
we can read it.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.200
And at one end of the spectrum
is stuff like ATMs, which need

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.340
to be transactionally
consistent.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.610
So the data that you see in the
ATM has to be completely

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.070
accurate at all times.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.140
As a result, they're slow to
respond sometimes, as you may

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.035
have noticed while you're
sitting there waiting for it

00:09:06.035 --> 00:09:08.050
to get your balance.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.960
We couldn't have long delays
when rendering the +1 button

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.140
on your pages or you guys
would never let

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.930
us live with that.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.300
We know you want
fast rendering.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.660
So the +1's that occur are
what's called eventually

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.320
consistent.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.080
It means if you have hit the +1
button and then you reload

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.270
the page, you may not see your
+1 immediately, especially if

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.320
you're reloading the page from
another account or from a

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.120
logged out account.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.610
This is because it takes a
little bit of time for those

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.770
+1 entries to propagate
across our system.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.700
And they propagate to
a lot of places.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.600
They propagate to the rendering
of the +1 button.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.460
You may notice it's a little
bit different when users

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.600
aren't logged into Google.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.120
So it's got to propagate to
those logins as well.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.880
And it also has to propagate
to places like Google

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.600
Analytics, for the social
actions tracking, and Google

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.130
Webmaster Tools.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.870
Sometimes these are going to be
a little bit out of sync.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.110
But we guarantee that they
will eventually reach

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.050
consistency.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.050
In other words, we're not
losing your +1's.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:05.870
They are in there.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.380
And they are coming.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.700
And they're there.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.240
They may just not
be showing up.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.580
Every once in a while, things
get a little bit clogged up in

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.440
those chains, and it can even
be a little bit slower.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.580
And you mentioned that you had
spent months waiting for

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.070
things to reach consistency.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.810
This is a sign that something
might be up.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.140
So in your specific case, thanks
a lot for reporting it.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.340
And you filed an issue
under Issue

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.670
Tracker, which was great.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.980
Thank you for doing that.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.360
Filing in our Issue Tracker or
on our forum is a great way to

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.490
let us know when you encounter
these kinds of issues.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.500
So I've investigated and it
looked like everything was set

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.740
up properly.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.260
Good work.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.020
And it escalated this to some
people on our side to try and

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.810
investigate and see what's
happening with the

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.720
rendering of those.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.340
But don't worry.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.740
Your +1's are there.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.520
But we'll get it worked out.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.150
But hang tight.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.681
Sometimes it takes a while to
work out some of these issues.

00:10:59.681 --> 00:11:01.065
So thanks for that
good question.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.320
So further down the thread,
Ross Jutsen

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.720
asked a great question.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.850
I'll summarize his comment
because it was

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.270
a little bit colorful.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.730
If a Google ID is used to log
into a partner site, such as a

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.780
newspaper site or somewhere
where there are comments, is

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.550
there an API that can return the
ID or return if the ID is

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.980
anonymous or has a real name
associated with it?

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.210
Are there or might there be
any levels of verification

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.750
with this identity?

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.140
So this is a great question.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.290
To paraphrase what it sounds
like you're interested in

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.260
doing, is using Google+
identities

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.540
within an external website.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.780
And this is really cool because
identity management is

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.040
a really hard problem.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.320
Authenticating your users and
all that stuff when you build

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.650
a site is actually really
challenging to get right.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.860
Wouldn't it be great if you
could just lean on Google?

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.320
Because we've put a lot of work
into making sure that

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.920
real people are using Google+
and creating really cool

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.420
content there, wouldn't it be
cool if you could lean on us

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.580
for all of your authorization
or-- not authorization, but

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.320
for your authentication needs?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.570
And you can do that.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.690
We have REST APIs that provide
access to the public fields of

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.190
people's profiles, which
includes their photo, their

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.900
name and any of the
other fields that

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.210
they've made public.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:37.670
So the way this would work on
your site is you would have

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.550
people-- you'd have a login
with Google+ button.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.600
And what it would do is it would
trigger an OAuth flow.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.540
And what that OAuth flow does
is it would take your users,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.210
forward them to Google and ask
them if Google can share their

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.990
identity on Google+
with your site.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.290
Once they've authorized that,
they would be redirected back

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.280
to your site.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.580
And then either depending on how
you implement it, either

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.640
via JavaScript in the front
end or back end stuff in

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.600
whatever language your website
is written in, you could then

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.270
pull the public profile
information for that user.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.800
So the user knows
what's going on.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.000
They know that they've
authorized you to see their

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.500
public fields on Google+.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.210
And then you know who they are
on Google+, so you can verify

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.710
that they are a real
person with a real

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.410
account and real name.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.110
And then you can allow them to
interact with your site and

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.480
create content.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.840
And as a cool bonus, you'd then
know their name, their

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.090
profile photo and a numeric ID
that you can use to identify

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.240
that user in your system.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.230
So it's pretty cool.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.150
And this might be something
that might be worth

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.610
[? liveputting. ?]

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.740
I'll probably be trying to write
this up for a future

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.400
session of our Office Hours and
show you how to do this.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.080
And let us know.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.105
We could either do this using
JavaScript or we could do it

00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:53.250
in the back end with Ruby
or something like that.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.740
So if anyone wants to see that
coded and you have opinions on

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.130
how you'd like to see
it, let us know.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.900
And I'll see what I
can put together.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.270
So that was a great question.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.380
That's a really cool feature of
the platform that has a lot

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.630
of potential.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.550
So I saw a few questions in the
feed, asking about when

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.380
certain features are going
to be available.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.570
And I picked one at random.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.130
Bill asked, is there any update
on when the API for

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.880
retrieving a user's +1's
will be available?

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.780
And there are some other
questions you really asked

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.260
about when stuff will
be available.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.570
So I'm going to refer back
to Vick on this one.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:40.980
Vick, you're an active person
on the Google+ Platform and

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.900
Google+ as a whole, had a
fireside chat at South by

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.130
Southwest where he mentioned
that we're very deliberately

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.070
taking a cautious approach
to releasing APIs

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.580
for the Google+ Platform.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.310
And we're doing this because we
don't want to pull the rug

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.920
out from under you if we decide
that some APIs we've

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.890
released are not compatible
with our Google+ strategy.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.150
So we're taking a very
cautious approach.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.390
We're discussing a
lot internally.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.210
We're working really hard to
figure out how we're going to

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.780
do this the right way so that
everyone can write really cool

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.150
applications and so that all of
the content and activity on

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.460
Google+ stays really
high quality.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.540
And the API, the specific API,
Read Access to +1's, is part

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.550
of that conversation.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.760
It's definitely something we've
heard feedback about.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.950
And it's something we're talking
about, as well as

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.540
pretty much everything
else you guys have

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.930
asked for on the thread.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.340
So that being said, now that
I've covered our strategy

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.870
there, we don't really talk
about the future releases

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.300
because we're really focused
on making sure we get the

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.030
right product out for you so you
can do cool stuff and not

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.240
rushing something out that we're
going to have to change

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.440
in some breaking way.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.900
So in other words, I really
can't tell you when any of

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.380
this stuff is going
to be available

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.730
because I don't know.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.140
But hang tight.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.040
cool stuff's coming.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.750
For now, go play with
some Hangout apps.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.000
They're really fun
to work with.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.990
Cool.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.750
So another question I saw that
got asked just before we

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.220
started broadcasting, Matthew
Gale asked, is there any way

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.540
to make my company's Google+
page a subdomain

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.050
of my primary domain?

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.470
For example, blog.mycompany.com.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.850
This is a great way to help
people find your Google+ page.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.530
So this is really cool.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.460
And actually, a lot of us have
been doing this with our

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.780
personal Google+ pages for
a while using redirects.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.920
And this is what I would
recommend you use.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.850
Specifically, what we've been
setting up is HTTP 301, moved

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.100
permanently, redirects.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.420
And the specific way this gets
implemented depends a whole

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:52.265
lot on how your domain is set
up, which web server you're

00:16:52.265 --> 00:16:54.790
using and how it's configured,
what languages or platforms

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.780
you [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.100
So I'm not going to be able to
give you a very specific

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.880
answer now.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.970
But what I can do is I actually
blogged about how to

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.440
do this for
[? mydomain.com/plussign ?]

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.069
for our personal profile pages
a few months back.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.099
And I explained how to do it on
several major platforms. So

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.960
I will post that again.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.810
Or I will post that
in the show notes.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.530
And then I'll update it and
explain a little bit about how

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.630
to do it for subdomains.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.180
So check the show notes.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.280
I'll post a write-up.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.540
But this will be really cool.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.050
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Actually,
he clarified his question a

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.220
little bit after the show
started and indicated that

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.500
what they really wanted was to
be able to take things that

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.420
were posted to their page and
repost them on their website

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.870
or somehow have their
own stream

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.890
showing up on the website.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.000
I know this is something you've
blogged about before.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.350
So maybe you can comment a
little bit on that as well.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.130
JENNY MURPHY: That's a
little bit different.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.230
And that's also really cool.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.740
So you can do this
with a caveat.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.860
Only public posts can be pulled
out via the APIs for

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.570
obvious reasons.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.490
Because if you have a private
post, you wouldn't want to be

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.880
posting that on your
public website.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.950
It would defeat the purpose of
it being a limited audience.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.840
So all of your public posts
on your Google+ page are

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.400
accessible via our RESTful
web services.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.960
Those are JSON feeds that come
out, and we have a whole bunch

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.980
of client libraries.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.450
The easiest way to do this
is probably to do it in

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.390
JavaScript.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.840
So we don't have any widget or
anything you can drop in.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.172
But if you wanted a little bit
of JavaScript development, you

00:18:35.172 --> 00:18:36.700
can write something that will.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.540
On Page Load of your external
website, blog.mydomain.com

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.420
will go to your Plus Page and
grab a few of the most recent

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.740
entries you've posted, maybe
some comments on each one, and

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.260
then manipulate them and make
them all pretty and make them

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.730
match the style of your site,
and then render them there.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.930
And that's something that
can be done with

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.590
the public data APIs.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.360
And this just might be a good
blog post for me to write up.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.870
So I will.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.370
Yeah, that's a general
explanation.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.700
There's no code behind
it right now.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.490
But there might be code
behind it soon.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.980
Great question.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.680
Thanks for catching
me up, Allen.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:26.085
So let me switch on over to take
a look at the activity

00:19:26.085 --> 00:19:28.570
because that's the list of
questions that I had from

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.630
before the show started.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.350
Let's take a look at what you
guys have been asking since

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.980
we've started.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.230
Scrolling on down.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.090
So Chris asked a question I
see down here, Chris Lang,

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.240
very active today.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.290
Thanks for all your
interaction.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.490
And you ask, I was tracking my
Google+ and other social

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.930
buttons and used the
badge on my site.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.150
Is there a way to track badge
adds to circles through Google

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.910
Analytics' tracking script
from the [? Dove ?] area?

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.500
Theoretically, this should
be possible.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.020
I haven't tried to
implement it yet.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.010
I think all the callbacks are
there from the badge so that

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.920
when people interact with the
badge, you can trigger a

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.370
social action callback
that will

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.250
register in Google Analytics.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.180
But I've never tried to
implement this, so I

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.430
can't say for sure.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.660
If you want to try and
play with it more--

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.200
I'll link to them in
the show notes--

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.560
go to the Badge Docs and look at
the various callbacks that

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.140
are available.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.890
Pick the one that's most
appropriate to the kind of

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.530
behavior you'd like to track.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.430
And then use that to trigger one
of those Google Analytics

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.090
actions, either a social
activity or there's some other

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.230
hooks in Google Analytics if I
remember right that you could

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.870
trigger from there.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.500
And then you can track
those actions also.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.550
So it should work.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.150
But I haven't tried, so
I can't say for sure.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.280
But if you try it out, let me.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.690
I'd like to see it.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.020
Cool.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.440
OK.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.830
So I don't see any other
questions in the thread unless

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.180
I missed something.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.370
Reload.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.590
And it looks like we're pretty
much wrapped up for today.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.270
So it was a short session today,
but thanks for all your

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.520
great questions.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.540
Thanks a lot for joining
us, Allen.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.370
And thanks Chirag, from
the booth back there.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.650
Thanks for trying to get
our audio cleaned up.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.230
And thanks--

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.040
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.640
JENNY MURPHY: Yep.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.962
So I'll see you all next week
in the next session of our +

00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:26.550
Platform Office Hours
Bye, everyone.
