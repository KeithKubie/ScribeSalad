00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:08.440
DAVID: Thank you all
for coming today.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.520
We're here with
Morra Aarons-Mele,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.130
the author of "Hiding
in the Bathroom:

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.500
An Introvert's Roadmap
to Getting Out There

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.820
When You'd Rather Stay Home."

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.340
If I may give a little
bit of a synopsis,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.130
it's largely about
being an introvert when

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.650
you face things that are
difficult for an introvert.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.360
It's been easier for many of us
to stay in a corner on our own,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.120
but Morra's work has
forced her to go out.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.710
And so she writes
about how to deal

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.310
with this tension, as opposed
to give up and stay away

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.570
from it altogether.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.290
Please, round of
applause for Morra.

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:50.824
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
Thanks, David.

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:51.490
Nice to see you.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.350
DAVID: How would
you describe being

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.340
an introvert and the challenge
you face as a result of it?

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.710
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I call
myself an ambitious introvert.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.340
I don't know if that phrase
resonates with any of you.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.670
I also have a lot of anxieties.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.560
I have social anxiety.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.050
I have flying anxiety.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.760
You know, sometimes for me,
sort of leaving the house

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.120
and going out in the world
can be challenging, especially

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.370
in these times.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.817
And yet, I run a
business and I chose

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:25.150
to write this book, which has
taken me out of my comfort

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.910
zone in every way possible.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.390
Because it's the
manual that I wished

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.650
I had had when I was
trying to build my career.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.250
I didn't know that
I was an introvert.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.070
I didn't know that
I had anxiety.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.200
I just knew that I cried
a lot in the bathroom

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.490
and quit lots of jobs.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.370
I felt like walking
into the office

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.000
some days was an
assault on my senses.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.600
And you know, as I got
promoted in my career,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.500
I worked in political consulting
and digital marketing.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.610
And so as the sort
of demands increased

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.360
to run teams, run meetings,
collaborate, negotiate, sell,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.060
network, all the stuff
that you really have to do,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.864
I literally just--

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:16.280
I felt like it was an assault.
I didn't know how to do it,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.770
and I didn't have a manual.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.690
And so instead, I hid
a lot in the bathroom.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.430
I still hide in
the bathroom a lot.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.610
I don't know if you do, too.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.390
I haven't been to
the bathroom here.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.151
So I wanted to really
provide a really practical--

00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:31.900
if you see the book,
it's super practical.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.220
There's worksheets,
there's tear sheets.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.850
And we take on business
development, networking,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.010
how to survive a professional
networking event.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.260
That's a huge one.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.060
Social media, right?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.295
How do you get out there?

00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:45.920
Everyone says you
should get out there.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.516
You should have a
personal brand, certainly,

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.140
as you grow in your
career, if you take

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.990
on a more public facing role.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.715
And this is tough
for some of us.

00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:58.560
DAVID: Most of the crowd
that I see here is engineers.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.610
But as engineers, every time we
look for a job that's an issue.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.660
But also, people who are
not software engineers

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.500
don't appreciate how
much collaboration

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.190
is part of the work we do.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.250
We may be able to get by
with relatively little

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.370
if we only go to the things
that we are called to,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.130
but if we have an idea we want
to promote, as you're familiar,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.920
you need to get
someone's attention.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.640
You need to push an idea
that maybe somebody doesn't

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.990
want to put his attention on.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.290
And so some of these
things are certainly

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.920
more relevant to us in ways
other than your personal

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.630
experience, directly.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.360
One of the things you've
described yourself as

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.635
is an ambitious overachiever.

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:46.990
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Yes.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.100
No one here is an ambitious
overachiever, I'm sure.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.670
DAVID: Well, it's easy to
be an overachiever in ways

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.100
that are solitary
with our field,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.794
until you get into industry.

00:03:56.794 --> 00:03:58.460
When you're in industry,
you aren't just

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.420
writing a program anymore and
then letting the world see it.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.730
You have to interact
with everybody

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.540
else who your software
is affecting in any way.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.320
And how do you reconcile
having that urge to achieve

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.850
and facing the fearsome
dog ahead of you

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.697
that you don't want
to interact with?

00:04:21.697 --> 00:04:23.030
MORRA AARONS-MELE: That's right.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.550
And I think for something
like, I would imagine

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.820
if you've written something--

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.900
I have felt this way
about my passion projects,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.525
and this is where
introverts can really

00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:33.890
shine if we are
creative people, which

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.170
I believe software engineering
is very creative as well.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.030
We have the ability
to have faith

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.790
in our project and our work and
to carry it to a certain place.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.880
So how do you
translate that, not

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.030
only in being able to stand
up in front of a group

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.570
and sell in that vision,
which is an essential skill,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.480
but be able to negotiate
with other people

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.550
to make your thing come to life?

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.560
And this can be
hard for introverts.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.220
Sometimes, because we've
gotten feedback in our career,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.810
even in school, that
we aren't heard, right?

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.060
Because we maybe
talked over a lot.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.710
I don't know how many
of you have felt that.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.950
And then of course there
are gender and race and age

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.177
implications and all of that.

00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:19.010
Depending on where
you're at in your career,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.510
you might get talked
over more or less.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.360
And so I think one
of the skills that I

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.970
had to learn the hard way, and
that I encourage companies now

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.560
to teach, is how to help
that ambitious introvert

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.360
with an idea.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.380
Negotiate it.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.520
Sell it.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.380
You're not born
learning how to code.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.000
You're not born
learning how to know

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.310
Excel or PowerPoint or Keynote
or any of these things.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.117
You're taught.

00:05:44.117 --> 00:05:46.700
And so one of the things that I
think we have to seek and give

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.330
in companies is how
to birth your idea

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.160
socially in the office culture.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.870
DAVID: At Google, many
of us, perhaps not

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.710
a predominant fraction,
but many of us

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.290
have not had a very social
experience before coming here.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.564
And so many of us are shorter
on those social skills

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:05.730
and would benefit from them.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.150
But it sounds like this
is general useful advice

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.335
for companies to help
their employees thrive.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:12.710
MORRA AARONS-MELE: And you
have a rich peer culture here,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.400
which I think can
be really valuable.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.210
You know, I always say that it's
great to adopt an extrovert.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.050
If there is someone who
you see has that skill

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.020
set, whether it's being able to
have someone see their vision,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.810
being able to
negotiate and listen.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.420
I mean, one of the things that
introverts are really good

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.670
at-- and if you can think
of selling in your software

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.070
project as a sort
of negotiation--

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.520
is it may be tempting
for us to sort of learn

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.290
to go in and tell everyone
about our project.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.770
But one of, I think, the
natural skills of introverts

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.500
is that we do absorb
and we tune in.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.832
And so before you sell--

00:06:46.832 --> 00:06:49.040
and I have this in the book
in the chapter on selling

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.390
and negotiate--

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.380
read the room.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.690
tune in to the other conditions.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.980
Do your research.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.910
We're very good at preparing.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.420
And the layer of sometimes
those of us with anxiety

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.170
makes us prepare even more.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.470
And so you can learn how to
use your introvert-like super

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.180
powers to actually take a step
back and sell in a project.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.120
DAVID: You describe yourself
as somewhat of a hermit,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.350
an introvert, socially anxious.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.990
I know these aren't synonyms.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.180
They aren't distinct.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.520
Could you talk about
where they overlap

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.290
and what the different--
introvert is one

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.442
that I didn't even understand
until a few years ago

00:07:26.442 --> 00:07:27.650
when I learned from a friend.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.400
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
There's a lot of myths

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.590
about what an introvert is.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.840
There's a lot of great books
and literature out there,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.790
and I think it's becoming much
more socialized and acceptable.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.570
We understand that we are
born probably more introverted

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.890
more extroverted.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.690
It's not something
that we learn,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.460
although most
introverts, we learn

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.350
how to fake it at
some point, certainly

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.710
if we're going to go out and
sell or be public in any way.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.510
I was on "Boston
Public Radio" last week

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.770
and Jim Braude said
to me, well, you

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.690
don't seem like you
suffer from introversion.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.398
I mean, you can make
eye contact with me.

00:07:55.398 --> 00:07:56.410
And you're laughing.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.035
I was like, what are
you talking about?

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:03.080
Introversion doesn't necessarily
mean that you're quiet.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.952
It doesn't mean even
that you're shy.

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:06.410
Actually, if you're
shy it may mean

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.310
that you have social anxiety,
or if you're just a little shy.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.680
An introvert is someone
who needs time and space

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.550
and does great work alone,
who gets that creative energy

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.390
alone.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.980
And when you go into
overwhelming situations,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.890
whether it's walking
into a hotel lobby

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.810
with lots of fluorescent
lights and noise,

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.520
or an open plan
office, frankly--

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.500
I mean, I'm obsessed
with open plan offices

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.083
and I have a whole
chapter in the book

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:34.539
about how to survive an open
plan office or pod situation.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.320
If you feel like I do,
like you're Superman

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.900
and the kryptonite is
draining your energy,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.150
you're probably an introvert.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.580
But it doesn't mean you're
quiet or that you don't talk.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.560
It just means that
you recharge and you

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.350
need more quiet environment
to do your best work.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.190
And you like to be
alone with yourself,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.800
which I think is amazing.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.620
Social anxiety is another layer
that I talk about in the book

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.210
and that I separate out.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.580
Because many of us, whether
we're awkward as kids,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.560
or no one will sit
with us at lunch,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.140
or we have whatever
kind of trauma,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.830
we have intense performance
anxiety and fear

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.750
of social situations,
even picking up

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.690
the phone to call a
colleague or a client.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.080
Walking into a meeting, we
assume people won't like us.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.330
And again this is
a real challenge

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.460
as you grow in your career
and you have to sell.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.261
Being a hermit is a--

00:09:26.261 --> 00:09:27.260
I use a tongue in cheek.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.593
I actually trademarked the term.

00:09:28.593 --> 00:09:30.760
I'm a hermit entrepreneur.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.780
And this is my choice.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.530
I left corporate America
about 10 years ago,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.710
and decided that I was
going to work for myself.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.500
I started a small business,
successful business,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.150
small business.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.420
I decided I didn't want to
become a corporate executive.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.480
I didn't want to have a big
career in the typical sense.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.390
I was willing to make less
money and have less power

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.670
systemically, because it
is that important to me

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.780
to work from home.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.210
I mean, that sounds
ridiculous, but it really is.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.500
I love to work from home.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.060
I like to be by myself.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.890
My favorite day--
and this may not

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.111
apply to you-- is a
day without meetings.

00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:06.610
I mean, we were
talking about email.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.340
Email is also a big sensory
overload for a lot of us.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.100
But a day without meetings,
and time to think.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.110
And so I created a
business that allows

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.530
me to build in days
alone, time to think,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.230
and then I hit the road.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.660
DAVID: How do you reconcile
being a mother of three

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.944
with having time alone at home?

00:10:25.944 --> 00:10:28.240
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
It's hard, you know.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.340
But I actually-- I
mean, oh god, this

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.450
feels horrible to admit--
but I build in my alone time

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.670
during my work day.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.050
Because your kids
don't care, right?

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.060
Your kids don't care
if you need a break.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.060
So what I try to do
is I try to protect

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.920
my time during the workweek,
actually, to get a lot of time

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.970
to think.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.714
And I justify it
by actually saying

00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:52.880
it helps me run my business.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.213
It's where I have my best ideas.

00:10:54.213 --> 00:10:55.690
It's where I come
up with solutions

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.010
and figure out how to pay for
things and hire new people.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.426
But, yes.

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.972
DAVID: One of the complications
of working at home-- parent.

00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:03.930
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Yes.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.130
Not everyone is made
to work from home.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.250
It's a discipline.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.640
I don't know if you have a
work from home policy here.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.080
I think that some
people really seek it,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.621
and some people it
drives them crazy.

00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:14.320
DAVID: We were
talking earlier about

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.830
how social anxiety
and introversion can

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.890
be different for women than
men, broadly, of course.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.840
It's not going to be
the same in every case.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.090
Could you talk some
about how it differs

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.374
for women in ways that might
not be obvious to us or not?

00:11:29.374 --> 00:11:30.790
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
I mean, I think

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.165
one of the things that has
been really remarkable to me--

00:11:33.165 --> 00:11:36.010
and I love seeing so many men
here today-- is, you know,

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.292
I wrote the book sort
of geared towards women

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:39.250
because that's my bias.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.200
I run a business
called women online

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.270
and I create political
and social marketing

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.130
campaigns that mobilize women.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.050
But I think what's
interesting is

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:53.380
that men feel work-life
conflict, the tug between home,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.340
work, the pressure.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.730
Certainly-- I mean, this is
one thing I talk a lot about

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.430
in the book when you think
of sales and negotiating,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.070
and again it's a bit different
maybe in an environment like

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.200
this, but you will come
up against it I think--

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.634
to be that sort of
alpha male salesman.

00:12:07.634 --> 00:12:09.550
That's something that
women don't really face.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.470
We face a lot of other biases.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.270
But I've heard from
many introverted men

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.317
at work who feel
really frustrated.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:16.150
One guy said to me--

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.650
I gave a talk last
week in Cambridge

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.860
and he said, how did the
extroverts when everything?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:26.000
He felt in his work experience
that because he was more quiet,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.130
he was not your typical sort get
out there kind of glad handler,

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.650
that he felt he didn't fit
in at his office, which

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.420
I felt was really sad for him.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.040
So I think for men there
are barriers to feeling--

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.980
certainly if you do like
me, you're a hermit.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.280
You love to work from home.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.870
You like alone time.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.120
You don't maybe want to go
out and take clients out

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.800
for drinks or dinner or
sell in all those ways.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.780
That's a barrier.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.620
For women, if we are
more introverted,

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.460
data show we are less
likely to get promoted.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.110
We earn less money,
and of course women

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.970
earn less money anyway, and
we fight to get heard anyway.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.260
So there's really a
double barreled assault

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.980
on women, I think,
who, again, may not

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.950
present in a typical
leadership fashion.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.980
You know, you only have to look
at our politics to see right

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.740
now-- and I promised I wouldn't
get political but I can't help

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.460
it--

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:27.200
that too often, the salesperson
in chief wins in our culture.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.620
Certainly, when it comes to
what we see as leadership.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.590
I could not help feeling
all during the election

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.690
that Hillary Clinton
is really an introvert,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.720
and if she could just sell
her policies in small groups

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.990
and connect in an
authentic way, things

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.310
would be so much different.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.040
And yet we got the sort of man
in front of the room talking

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.912
and selling.

00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:48.620
And I think that that's
powerful and that

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.206
extends to every
corporate environment

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:52.580
and every leadership
environment.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.190
We need to think about
that, and gender is a piece.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:02.900
DAVID: You wrote that you
would be more successful if you

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.297
went to cocktail parties more.

00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:05.880
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
37% more successful

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.129
if I went to cocktail parties.

00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:08.420
DAVID: Could you explain that?

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.670
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Absolutely.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.940
I mean, I think
it's amazing, now,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.700
that we have so many
online tools to network.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.790
And I talk about that
a lot in the book.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.890
In many, many
business environments,

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.040
we are obsessed with networking.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.500
I call it an "enlightened bro."

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.920
There are guys like Gary
Vaynerchuk and Tim Ferriss

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.430
out there, and they're full
of tips to solve your life.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.400
But if you watch any
leadership video on YouTube,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.790
chances are there is going to
be something about getting out

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.940
there, about networking, still
the old chestnuts of never

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.260
eating lunch alone--

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.270
again, prevalent in our culture.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.390
And if you're like me and
you're sort of allergic to this,

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:56.402
and you go to a professional
conference and think,

00:14:56.402 --> 00:14:58.610
oh gosh, how am I going to
survive the cocktail hour?

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.710
I just want to go back to
my hotel room and hide,

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.530
or whatever meet up
group, or whatever

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.540
you're part of to sort
of advance your career,

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.400
and you know it's important.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.920
Again, you can always
feel like you're at odds.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.662
So I probably would
be more successful

00:15:10.662 --> 00:15:12.370
if I liked networking
more, but I've also

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.360
made my peace with it.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.750
And that's why for me,
blogging and participating

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.630
in online community has
been a savior, because I

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.491
can find connections online.

00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:23.740
I can blog and connect with
people who care about what

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.200
I do, and it doesn't
matter if we're

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.320
going for drinks at the local
Hilton on a Tuesday night.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.910
DAVID: You communicate
on your terms.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.220
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I communicate
on my terms from bed.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.740
DAVID: Instead of party terms.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.510
You hinted at having
advice for people,

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.100
for the most important
thing that they

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.860
could do when at parties.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.220
Could you explain that?

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.440
I was curious what it was.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.050
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Yes.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.549
Well, the last
chapter of the book--

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:52.240
and actually if you go on
hidinginthebathroom.com,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.270
I have a 16 point guide
to getting out there

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.740
when you have to.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:02.020
And one of the things
that I talk about is--

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.580
and again, this is
simple advice but it's

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.790
really, really powerful--

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.270
is that feeling of
anticipatory anxiety

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.580
when you have to walk
into a networking event,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.850
or you have to go to a
presentation or meet a new team

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.770
or whatever you feel.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.990
I think it's really important
to sort of physically

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.010
get a sense of yourself.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.500
You know, actors do this
before they get on stage.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.361
They check in with themselves.

00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:26.860
They check in with
their motivation.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.610
Why am I here?

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.675
I feel that all the time.

00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:30.550
I want to be at home.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.142
Why am I here?

00:16:31.142 --> 00:16:32.850
I don't want to go on
this business trip.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.874
I'm scared.

00:16:33.874 --> 00:16:35.290
I don't want to
walk in this room.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.040
Why am I here?

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.230
Sometimes it's as simple
as I have to pay the bills.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.160
That's legit.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.970
Sometimes it's I
care about my work.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.760
I want to share
what I've written.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.690
I want to bring this.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.080
So checking into the meaning
and checking into your body.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.330
For me, also-- and I don't
know, this is different

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.420
for everyone--

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.262
I have clothes that I wear.

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.720
Literally, I'll
put my lipstick on.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.139
I will put on my armor
and become the person

00:16:56.139 --> 00:16:57.430
who would play me in the movie.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.210
Because I can then get
that person out there.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.300
And then I follow what my
friend Dr. Ellen Hendrickson

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.859
calls the 10 second rule.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.111
She's a social psychologist.

00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:08.569
You can do anything
for 10 seconds.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.079
You can even put your feet
over fire for 10 seconds.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.210
So just give yourself that push.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.260
Walk into the room or walk
up to someone and say, hi.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.900
And then muscle
memory takes over.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.200
The other tip that I have--

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.990
and this is one that I actually
talked to a lot of people

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.489
about.

00:17:23.489 --> 00:17:24.819
You'll hear this a lot.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.619
I call it channeling
your inner Oprah,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.207
but some people play journalist.

00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:30.040
You know, especially
if you're an introvert,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.840
you don't like the spotlight.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.800
Ask people questions.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.770
Again, tune in to other people.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.980
You don't have to be the
best conversationalist

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.657
to be remembered as a
great conversationalist.

00:17:41.657 --> 00:17:43.240
Because if you're
present with someone

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.550
and you can ask them questions,
they'll think that you are.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.360
Anyway, I have lots
of other good tips,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.880
but one thing I
also wanted to say

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.850
is to give yourself a reward.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.620
This is something
that you can think of,

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.460
if you're at a
professional conference--

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.130
did you know that
there, I think it's

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.610
137 professional
conferences in the US a day?

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.850
It is the most booming industry.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.970
And so again, the way that
we're taught now, to network

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.530
more than ever,
we're also expected

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.696
to go to conferences more
than ever, which is weird.

00:18:13.696 --> 00:18:16.180
I mean, certainly in tech,
conferences are out of control,

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:16.960
right?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.810
So for me, I'll do my research
about who I want to meet.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.560
I'll say I got to
meet three people.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.087
And then I let myself leave.

00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:26.670
Sometimes I'll go
hide in the bathroom

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.045
or I'll go hide
in my hotel room.

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:28.630
And it's OK.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.539
DAVID: Set a quota.

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:30.830
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Set a quota.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.442
Set a goal.

00:18:32.442 --> 00:18:35.500
DAVID: There's a
term that you used--

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.332
I didn't get to the
part of the book

00:18:37.332 --> 00:18:39.790
where you explain this term,
but I'm curious what it means.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.050
You mention achievement porn.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.800
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
Achievement porn, yeah.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.545
DAVID: Could you explain that?

00:18:43.545 --> 00:18:45.160
MORRA AARONS-MELE: A while
back, I wrote an article

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.118
in "The Harvard Business
Review" about the rise

00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:48.175
of entrepreneurship porn.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.520
I'm glad you think it's funny.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.470
I have been a sort of player
on the edges of the Boston tech

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.500
and VC scene, and
those sort of women

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.460
in tech scene for many
years now, and then in LA.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.580
And it's very sexy to
be an entrepreneur.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.980
It's very sexy to
work at a startup.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.320
It's probably still
sexy to work at Google.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.390
You know, so you guys have that.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.665
But as you know,
from your friends,

00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:18.040
whenever you work at a startup
or if you found a startup,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.830
it's very sexy.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:19.954
People want to talk to you.

00:19:19.954 --> 00:19:21.570
You're an entrepreneur, right?

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.030
And so the media, and
networking culture,

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.820
and leadership talks, and
this whole conference industry

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.330
has really glamorized
entrepreneurship, especially

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.400
tech entrepreneurship, right?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.760
It's made it seem like that's
what we should aspire to,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.350
and scaling, and never sleeping,
and tirelessly fighting

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.990
until we get funded or we grow.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.320
And I call it porn, because
you know it when you see it.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.770
You read all these profiles of
these young entrepreneurs who

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.110
would stop at nothing and
made a gazillion dollars.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.404
Very few of us can do that,
even if we're smart enough.

00:19:55.404 --> 00:19:56.820
For me, personally,
and the people

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.611
that I interview in my
book and my podcast,

00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:00.540
they didn't want to do that.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.420
Some of us wanted to have really
great lifestyle businesses.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.490
We needed to step back from
the entrepreneurship porn,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.740
and the achievement porn, too.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.540
You know, it's this
sense that if you

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.080
don't give 110%
every single day,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.160
you're letting the side down.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.452
DAVID: So it's the false image.

00:20:16.452 --> 00:20:18.118
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
It's the false image.

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:19.080
It's the glossy image.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.750
Even failure is
sort of glamorized,

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.930
because we read a lot of
stories about these sort of epic

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.910
failures, certainly in
Silicon Valley and New York.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.180
But they never really
feel like failures to me.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.846
I don't know about
you, but they sort of

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:34.480
feel like just a blip in the
road till the next big one.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.180
And life isn't like that.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.140
DAVID: You mentioned the
tech industry's passion

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.270
for an entrepreneur who drives
an idea and starts a company.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.480
But I feel like we're changing
more broadly than that.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:54.010
More and more people are
expected to make their job,

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.760
as you've done, even
without building a company,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.830
just as a sole contributor who
is also the CEO of the company,

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.240
you might say.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.130
And that requires a lot of
social networking of sorts

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.490
as well, a lot of
often cold calling

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.250
to start a business that doesn't
exist because no one else

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.100
has done it for you.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.510
Given that many of us,
well maybe not in this room

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.650
this year, but many
of the people watching

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.360
this may find
themselves in that state

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.830
while looking for
their next job,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.200
finding that they need
to make it themselves.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.790
If they prepare themselves
to walk into that room,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.710
then they're talking
to the people

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.080
and their nerve fails them.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.840
Do you have any advice
for how to pull yourself

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.632
back together when you feel
you're not up to the task?

00:21:45.632 --> 00:21:47.590
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I
mean, I think, it's again,

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.290
it's about tapping into the
meaning and the motivation.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.480
I like to use the metaphor
of being a crafts person.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.179
You know, if you
had built a house

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:56.470
that this really lovely family
were going to move into,

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.170
and you had lovingly taken
care of every element,

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.820
you would be proud
to talk about it.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.012
I'm a big fan of
freelancing and consulting,

00:22:04.012 --> 00:22:06.220
although there are many
things that are bad about it,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.050
and you probably
will make less money.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.180
You will have maybe less
of a systemic impact.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.310
You've got to think
about health care.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.060
But for many of those people,
or you, in five years from now,

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.310
if you leave this place
and go walk into a room

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.700
to make it on your own, even
if it is as a consultant,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.190
don't feel like you
need to start afresh.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.090
Often your best clients will
be your old company, the people

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.770
that used to work for.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.180
An introverts gift is
actually managing a network

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.155
in a way that is good for us.

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:38.530
And so I find that
we're actually

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.480
good at sustaining those
long relationships.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.370
I have a rule called the 10
touches, which is in the book.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.520
I learned it from my husband,
my favorite adopted extrovert.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.800
But for me, I can handle 10
business development touches

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.520
a week.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.100
It might be just dropping you
an email, which I know now

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.980
you won't see, but that's OK.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.330
It could be calling someone.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.420
It could be recommending
someone on LinkedIn,

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.400
making some sort
of outward gesture.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.040
I can do all of this
from my home office.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.740
But if I have the discipline
of reaching out to 10 people

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.690
a week, and you can
do this actually

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.840
while you're working for someone
else to help build that network

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.290
and help build that future
network of potential employers,

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.520
funders, colleagues,
staff, whatever--

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.380
you know, I'm a big believer
in breaking things down

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.220
into bit-sized chunks,
bearable chunks.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.940
So I do the 10
touches every week.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.820
I keep my network
going, and so then I'm

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.680
never so scared to
walk into a room,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.780
because I know why I'm there.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.650
I try to have a sense that
I am not alone in this work,

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.600
if that makes sense.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.110
DAVID: Thank you very much.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.060
Is this a good time
for questions from the

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.060
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Sure.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.620
Sure thing.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.790
If anyone has questions.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.880
AUDIENCE: So I don't know
whether the leadership

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.580
of Google would consider
themselves introverts,

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.880
like Larry Page and Sundar.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.700
But they don't strike me
as the like, you know,

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.770
usual sort of CEO, right?

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.870
When you see them
speaking publicly

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:05.246
they're not as, you know,
comfortable or polished.

00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:07.120
I don't know that have
a particular question,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.460
but any thoughts
about that and kind

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.790
of tech leadership
in general, I guess,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.865
and kind of where people fall
on the introvert/extrovert sort

00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:17.365
of scale?

00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:19.100
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I think
that's really interesting,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.970
and I was thinking about that,
actually, as I was coming in.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.070
Again, coming back to
the fact that these

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.670
are skills that you learn,
I think that if you are you

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.580
are gifted and you create
an amazing tech company--

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.430
and I think of Bill Gates and
I think of all the leaders

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.240
of these big tech companies--

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.570
they are not necessarily
the most comfortable

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.390
public speakers, but
they give public speeches

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.970
every day when they reach a
certain point in leadership.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.910
And I do think they
are changing the model.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.870
I think that's really cool.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.110
But what's interesting to
me is at the same time,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.840
we have these leaders who
are changing the model

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.580
and do seem like
they're more introverted

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.250
and probably would be much
more comfortable in a smaller

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.390
group or one on one, or
even behind the screen.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:06.400
We have sort of this
flourishing, how-to culture

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.440
of conferences and gurus
telling us to get out there.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.140
And so to me, it's actually
a little confusing.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.840
You know, should I
be a great networker

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.700
or should I just
pursue my own passion?

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.669
I think the answer is
pursue your own passion

00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:22.960
and you'll figure it out later.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.820
If you're good enough
at what you do,

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.430
no one's going to care if you
don't give a great speech.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.971
And you will notice
that when they're

00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:30.970
talking about things
they really care about

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.760
and they're really comfortable
with, they come alive.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.434
They don't feel awkward anymore.

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:36.850
DAVID: I saw that
with a professor

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:37.675
when I was in undergraduate.

00:25:37.675 --> 00:25:38.633
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Yes.

00:25:38.633 --> 00:25:42.010
DAVID: Sophomore classes,
he was like a robot.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.347
Junior year classes,
he was a fire.

00:25:44.347 --> 00:25:46.180
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I
bet someone taught him,

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.885
or he just liked
that class better.

00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:51.180
DAVID: It was the material
difference, not a change.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.180
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi, Morra.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.096
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Hi.

00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:56.064
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about creating

00:25:56.064 --> 00:25:58.230
sort of like, space and
alone time in the businesses

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.730
you create.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.970
Do you have recommendations
for how to do that

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.530
within a corporate environment?

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.567
Given that we are
in an open layout

00:26:04.567 --> 00:26:06.400
and there's always a
lot of noise around us,

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.350
people are always
walking around,

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.720
or you just hear
conversations from people who

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.720
are sitting right next to you.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.650
Yeah, do you have, I
guess, recommendations

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.530
for how to sort of carve out
that time for yourself, even

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.605
in that environment?

00:26:18.605 --> 00:26:21.760
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Yeah,
that's Chapter 10 in the book.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.790
And to be honest, you
know, I think that it's

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.260
a very individual thing.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.150
I hear you.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.930
I hear you on the open plan.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.650
I think that more companies--
and I don't know about Google,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.350
and I'd actually be
very curious to know--

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.220
are building in
more private space,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.230
especially with the rise
of pod based set ups

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.670
and sort of agile
everything where there is so

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.700
much collaborating happening.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.414
I think people also understand
that individual teams might

00:26:52.414 --> 00:26:53.830
want a quiet space
to collaborate,

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.820
but that people need a break.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.430
We're all over meetinged.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.080
I also think the rise of Slack,
and I guess here you use Gchat,

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.460
but you know, the constant
communicating not just

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.790
face-to-face, but online
while we're sitting publicly,

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.450
is very draining.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.850
I think if you can, and you
are able to do your best work,

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.600
talking to your
manager, and you know,

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.670
if working from
home is your thing,

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.240
if there's a quieter place,
I think many of us are

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.330
socialized-- and I
totally understand it--

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.090
to be afraid to ask for what we
need to get our best job done.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.090
But I have some amazing
statistics in the book.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.487
Your boss will accommodate
you, because she

00:27:33.487 --> 00:27:34.570
doesn't want you to leave.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.590
It's very expensive and it's
a major pain in the butt.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.230
And so being prepared, having
a plan, and saying, you know,

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.660
I have to get this project done.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.710
I need quiet.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.350
I will do my best
work in the quiet.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.930
I'm going to take
three hours on Friday.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.400
You have my cell phone.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.600
I'm going to be on
Gchat, and just trying

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.390
a little bit of a
pilot and easing in

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.590
might be really effective.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.630
But I think not being afraid
to say, we all feel that way.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.610
It is a very
draining environment,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.242
and so don't be ashamed.

00:28:08.242 --> 00:28:09.700
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming, again,

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.970
and I guess first thing
I'll say is that Google

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.520
has some very nice bathrooms.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.590
So feel free to take advantage.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.467
My question is, I
guess I find myself

00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:22.050
in a little bit of a flip of the
situation that you described,

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.940
in the sense that,
like, day to day

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.760
I'm interacting with a
lot of people around here.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.190
And outside of
that, I find I have

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.260
zero energy for
social networking,

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.570
like for online networking.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.630
I have zero energy to put stuff
even on Google+ internally,

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.530
much less, you know, Facebook
or LinkedIn or whatever.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.050
And it feels like there
are these very big channels

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.600
of being connected,
interacting with people,

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.330
having influence, blah
blah blah, that I'm not

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.250
participating in
because I just don't

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.770
feel I have this sort
of introvert energy

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.660
to participate in those.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.200
Do you have any
thoughts or suggestions?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.880
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I just
want to say I hear you.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.680
I feel the same.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.170
I feel sometimes that
participating online

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:10.650
is almost more of a
challenge and that you

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.270
do have to force yourself.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.330
But I would ask yourself why.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.150
I think a lot of us feel
this sense of FOMO right?

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:20.440
I know I should be doing this.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.700
I should be gaining influence.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.490
I should be building
my personal brand.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.780
My question is, why?

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.436
DAVID: FOMO-- Fear
Of Missing Out.

00:29:27.436 --> 00:29:29.060
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
Fear Of Missing Out.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.030
So that's my question to you.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.820
What's your motivation for
building the influence?

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.990
And then, OK, I want to write.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.590
Do you want to make a
creative contribution?

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.860
Do you want to grow your network
for potential future career

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.090
opportunities?

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.580
Do you just want to build
your online landscape,

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.100
your online footprint,
your online profile?

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.616
Maybe pick one simple way.

00:29:54.616 --> 00:29:55.990
For me, it's always
been writing.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.250
I'm comfortable writing.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.510
I like to write.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.900
So blogging was
so natural for me.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.450
And I didn't push myself for
the other parts of social media

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.730
that made me feel naked.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.010
I think that there
are ways to build

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.590
your online footprint that
are less social, but equally

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.240
legit--

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.750
photography, video,
recipes, writing.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.750
So maybe start there.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:20.920
But I think it's
also OK to say, why?

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.772
Who says I have to
do this right now?

00:30:23.772 --> 00:30:25.974
And like, baby steps.

00:30:25.974 --> 00:30:28.317
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for coming.

00:30:28.317 --> 00:30:29.900
So I have a question
sort of on behalf

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.870
of my partner, who
is currently trying

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.870
to get a leg into a career
doing, like, animation.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.932
And she's spending time
building a portfolio.

00:30:38.932 --> 00:30:41.380
She's going to start
applying to jobs soon.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.300
And I think she has a
challenge now where she's

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.030
an outsider looking to
break into an industry

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.540
where she doesn't have
a lot of connections.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.510
What would you say
that someone like that,

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:57.020
who's trying to get into a
place where they're networking

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.335
and meeting people and
finding opportunities when

00:31:00.335 --> 00:31:01.460
they're starting from zero.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.170
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
That's tough, right?

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.590
This is where conferences
actually can be very helpful.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.660
And because she does want to get
into a very specific industry,

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.170
I mean, I would encourage her
to even go a little bit deeper

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:12.920
than animation.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.970
You know, is there
a certain area?

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:14.990
Does she want to
do entertainment?

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.980
Does she want to do scientific?

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.230
Does she want to do technical?

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.780
I don't know.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.760
But what I would
do-- honestly, this

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.550
sounds so basic-- is I
would start on Twitter

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.040
and use some search
term, seeking.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.420
And find out who's writing--

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.961
this is what I would
tell my clients,

00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:29.240
too-- who's writing about it?

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.580
Are there animators tweeting?

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.160
Who are people on YouTube
who have big followings?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.690
I would start following them.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.960
And I would figure out what
are the publications they site

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.610
or contribute to--

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.340
message boards, websites--
and is there a conference they

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.330
go to.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.560
Honestly.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.830
And then she needs to
have a battle plan.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.480
I would challenge her.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.384
If there's a conference in LA,
for example, where she says,

00:31:53.384 --> 00:31:55.550
you know, potential employers
are going to be there.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:59.300
This person that I really
want to work for is speaking.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.640
That's the place where
she's got to have her plan,

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.969
and she's got to figure out her
online strategy ahead of time.

00:32:05.969 --> 00:32:07.010
She's got a good website.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.134
She's got a good portfolio.

00:32:08.134 --> 00:32:10.610
Is she following the
right people on Twitter?

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.460
Go to the conference,
have a strategy,

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.980
try to meet five people.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.260
Maybe she can bring
an extrovert with her.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.130
And do it.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.140
Because when you are
going to break in,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.930
you sometimes have
to get out there.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.740
And sometimes the face
time of a conference

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.420
is actually really great.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.362
It just is.

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:28.112
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:28.612
Thank you.

00:32:28.612 --> 00:32:29.828
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Thank you.

00:32:29.828 --> 00:32:32.490
DAVID: Typical sorts
of things to bring up

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.640
in a talk like this that don't
apply so much to Google are,

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.110
how are the workplaces
lacking in ways that

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.436
makes these challenges greater?

00:32:41.436 --> 00:32:42.810
And how can the
companies change?

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.310
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I would
say just in general--

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.380
and I don't know if this
is an issue in Google.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.338
I've never worked here.

00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:48.420
I've read a lot about it.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.900
My personal passion is
helping really successful,

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.200
ambitious people claim the
space and the quiet they

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.540
need to get their job done.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.400
For a lot of people
it's working from home.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.770
It's getting out
in the open plan.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.110
There was a great
reported story on a blog

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.530
that, you know, the Apple
$5 billion headquarters--

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.369
it's all pod.

00:33:08.369 --> 00:33:09.160
It's all open plan.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.785
So one of the senior
engineers actually

00:33:10.785 --> 00:33:12.930
had a bit of a palace
coup and insisted

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.460
he have his own building
with private spaces built.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.210
I don't know if that's true
or not, but I was like, yes.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:21.180
So if I had one dream
for workplaces to change,

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.550
it would be that managers stop
looking at the person who's

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:30.570
always in the office as
their most ambitious person,

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.020
and look at the person
who does the best work.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:42.330
I feel that, again, we equate
face time, seeming enthusiasm,

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:46.890
team spirit, all this stuff
with ambition and skill,

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:50.340
and that's actually
not the case at all.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.160
If I could have grown
through the corporate ladder

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.260
and worked from home
two mornings a week,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.790
I would have been really happy.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.570
So I would like people to
stop, to decouple ambition

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.035
from face time, and
certainly from extroversion.

00:34:04.035 --> 00:34:05.420
AUDIENCE: I was going to say--

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.753
I don't if this is a question
or a response to something

00:34:07.753 --> 00:34:12.610
that somebody else asked, but
are you familiar with "Rest"

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.642
by Alex Pang.

00:34:14.642 --> 00:34:16.600
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Yes,
I quote it in the book.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because he talks
a bit about many intellectuals

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.365
or quiet people or
whatever who, you know,

00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:26.739
would do an hour or
two of work, and then

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:29.537
go out on a walk for an
hour, hour and a half,

00:34:29.537 --> 00:34:30.370
something like that.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.190
And to me, I have
certainly done that here

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.380
at Google when I need
quiet time by myself

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.611
to think about something.

00:34:36.611 --> 00:34:38.860
The problem is, you can't
bring like a laptop with you

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.610
and type.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.100
But around here,
sometimes that's

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.767
the only time you can
get quiet for 30 minutes.

00:34:46.767 --> 00:34:48.850
MORRA AARONS-MELE: I just
want to acknowledge that

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.469
and to say, again,
it sounds so basic,

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:55.210
but the ability to
claim your time to think

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.066
is really powerful.

00:34:57.066 --> 00:34:58.940
And I know that Google's
always been a leader

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.023
and that you've had your--

00:35:00.023 --> 00:35:01.390
is it 20% rule, or whatever?

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:05.020
But you know, so few
places in our life

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.530
give us a moment to be with
our thoughts and get creative.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:14.505
And that's a discipline at
work that we need to honor.

00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:15.880
AUDIENCE: I had
another question.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.560
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Sure.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.601
AUDIENCE: Since you brought
up Hilary's campaign,

00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:19.719
I was curious--

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:21.260
yeah, I guess if
you were going to do

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.234
that, having those [INAUDIBLE]
conversations, how would you

00:35:24.234 --> 00:35:27.470
have gone about, I guess,
like changing the way that she

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.960
sort of went across America
and had these conversations?

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.535
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
Oh, so politics.

00:35:31.535 --> 00:35:33.170
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.420
Yeah, it's not really like a--

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.086
MORRA AARONS-MELE: No, you know,
I have been thinking about this

00:35:37.086 --> 00:35:39.500
because as a sort of digital
political consultant,

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.460
I've been thinking, and there's
actually a candidate running--

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.466
you should check
out, Laura Moser,

00:35:45.466 --> 00:35:47.840
in Texas-- who started something
called the daily action,

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.644
which is online action.

00:35:49.644 --> 00:35:50.810
She's a bit of an introvert.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.830
So I'm going see
how she's running.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:57.920
Again, I think that we don't
always get the best candidates,

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.700
because so much of
being a politician

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.250
is that glad
handling small talk.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.010
I mean, if we think walking into
a tech networking event is bad,

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.000
imagine walking into a firehouse
dinner in a different state,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.260
firehouse breakfast every--

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.470
I mean, oh my gosh, that's
hell for an introvert.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:20.540
So I would love to see
candidates win who could either

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.550
use online conversations.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.200
You know, wouldn't
it be amazing if you

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.080
could have Skype
conversations, if you could

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.180
use all these tools
to connect with people

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.480
in a meaningful way,
convene smaller groups.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.190
Usually small groups are just--

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.060
only high donors get small
groups now, high dollar donors.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.040
And yet, politicians
are expected

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.420
to be so extroverted
at the detriment

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.489
to the skill of policy.

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:45.780
I think this is something
we're all going to deal with.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.820
We're dealing with diversity
at work, work styles.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.060
We're dealing with failed
styles of leadership.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.300
I think we need to rethink all
of our different temperaments

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.290
and how leaders can be different
kinds of people to your point,

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.830
and that that will happen in
the next five or 10 years.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:06.010
DAVID: Well, here's to seeing
how the future accommodates

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.135
and how introverts adapt.

00:37:07.135 --> 00:37:08.260
MORRA AARONS-MELE: Ah, yes.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.970
DAVID: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:10.970
MORRA AARONS-MELE:
Thanks, David.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:11.470
Thank you.

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.970
Thank you.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.450
Thank you, everyone.
