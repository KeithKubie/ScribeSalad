00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now it's your turn. I set up a very similar problem to the last one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you need help solving this one, you should go back and see how we solved the last one.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But in this problem, we have, let's call him Archimedes, standing on the bluffs of Syracuse.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He's firing his bow straight out into horizontally into the ocean

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to see how far a ship could be before he could reach it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
His bow fires his arrow at 50 m/s, and the height of the bluff is 100 m.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can you fill out all of these fields here?

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you can get this right, I will be very, very impressed.
