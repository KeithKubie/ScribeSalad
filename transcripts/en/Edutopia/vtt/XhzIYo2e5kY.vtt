00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:14.226
&gt;&gt;Grace: Good morning, class, and
welcome to Online Learning 101.

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:17.106
In this short course, you'll
discover why more students

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:19.696
and school districts are taking
advantage of online learning

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:22.316
and what this could mean for you.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:25.676
Let's see, it looks like
somebody is typing there.

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:31.416
Yes, 45 out of 50 states now
have an online learning program.

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.946
Okay, so this is what it might look

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.776
like if you were a
student in an online class.

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:38.136
Here's Robert Foster.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.276
He's a senior at Centerpoint
Alternative High School

00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:42.356
in Caldwell, Idaho.

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:46.146
He fell behind his freshman year
and was at risk of dropping out.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:50.536
Now, he's taking classes from
teachers at Centerpoint face to face

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:53.336
and online classes to catch up.

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:55.986
Robert: I've taken quite a
few classes, ranging anywhere

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:59.826
from fitness to economics to
government, and my goal is

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:03.266
to graduate on time and to be
able to go play college football.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.946
&gt;&gt;Grace: In Las Vegas, Lauren Wu
took AP courses she couldn't get

00:01:07.946 --> 00:01:09.346
at her local high school.

00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:11.576
&gt;&gt;Lauren: Two classes
aren't offered at my school,

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:14.686
and the geopolitical economics is
only offered through distance ed,

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:16.816
so I have a chance to take
advantage of that course.

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:20.276
&gt;&gt;Grace: And in Central
Florida, the flexibility

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:23.666
of online learning allowed
Amanda Gashaw to work full-time

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.546
and take community college classes
while completing high school.

00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:31.696
Just like students,
schools are finding lots

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:33.476
of reasons to like online learning.

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.806
Reason number one, it's personalized.

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:40.926
Course content is available
on demand so students can work

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:44.606
at their own pace, and they develop
close one-on-one relationships

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:45.436
with their teachers.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:50.526
&gt;&gt;Jhone: Online curriculum allows
the student if they have a question

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:54.236
to go ahead and email the teacher
right then and not wait their turn,

00:01:54.486 --> 00:01:56.126
as you do in a regular classroom.

00:01:56.606 --> 00:02:00.896
So the teachers and the students both
feel that there's more communication

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:04.476
in an online classroom when they're
not physically sitting together

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:07.136
than they do in a face-to-face
classroom

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:09.326
with a teacher and 35 students.

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:13.566
&gt;&gt;Grace: Reason number two, online
learning levels the playing field.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.696
&gt;&gt;Benjamin: And without online
classes, the students in Notus,

00:02:16.816 --> 00:02:20.626
Idaho will not get the same
opportunity to be successful

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:21.966
as a kid in Boise, Idaho.

00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:26.286
There's a distinct
inequity in that fact,

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:29.656
that kids in small
schools have fewer teachers

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.666
who have fewer certifications.

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:35.326
We think that students at Notus
should have the exact opportunities,

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:38.606
the same credits, and the same
challenges that are going to get them

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:40.036
to excel in their future life.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.676
&gt;&gt;Grace: Reason number three, money.

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:47.776
Robert Foster's school, Centerpoint,
was so strapped for cash last year

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:50.216
that it cut its math
department entirely.

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:53.286
Now, Centerpoint offers
math classes online,

00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:57.866
costing the school just 75
dollars per student per course,

00:02:58.206 --> 00:03:02.736
and there's the impact on teacher
shortages, present and future.

00:03:02.736 --> 00:03:06.276
&gt;&gt;Susan: In the state of Georgia,
there are 400 high schools,

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:13.046
and there are 89 qualified
physics teachers in the state.

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.986
So right there, you know that not all

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:17.946
of your high schools
can even offer physics,

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:19.416
so how are you going to do that?

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:21.316
We can offer online classes.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.646
&gt;&gt;Grace: Online learning fosters
the kind of skills students needs

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:28.656
to succeed in the 21st century--
fluency with technology,

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:32.166
online communication, and
self-directed learning.

00:03:32.436 --> 00:03:34.106
&gt;&gt;William: The students
are going to be able

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:38.416
to use technology much more easily
and readily than ever before,

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:43.696
not only taking full online courses
but taking parts of courses online

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:46.766
so that you would have what they
call blended, having teachers

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:50.366
in the regular classrooms teaching
face to face with their students

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:54.666
for part of the time and using the
technologies, where appropriate,

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:57.116
to enhance and improve
the quality of courses.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:58.246
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So you can call me...

00:03:58.586 --> 00:03:58.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:03:58.816 --> 00:03:58.883
&gt;&gt;Teacher: ...

00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:00.346
whenever it's flexible for you.

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:02.366
&gt;&gt;Grace: Of course,
there's still plenty of room

00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:03.526
to improve online learning.

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:04.396
&gt;&gt;[Holly]: Okay, you can keep going.

00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:07.506
&gt;&gt;Grace: For one thing, many
teachers find it tough to have kids

00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:09.636
in far-flung places work together.

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:12.286
&gt;&gt;Holly: In terms of designing
lessons where they have

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:16.056
to work together, that's a little
more challenging because part

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:18.446
of the reason they came to online
school was to be able to work

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:21.606
when they wanted to work, but
I think that's the next stage,

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:24.376
maybe two point 0, of online
education is to figure out how

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:29.116
to really fit that in and make it
an inherent part of the curriculum.

00:04:29.256 --> 00:04:32.306
&gt;&gt;Grace: Still, online
learning is a powerful strategy.

00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:36.466
Early research has found that
students perform as well or better

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:40.156
in online versus face-to-face
environments,

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:43.286
so it's probably coming
to a classroom near you.

00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:45.846
&gt;&gt;Benjamin: Online or blended
learning models are going

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:49.026
to be a commonplace in the
future of education in Idaho

00:04:49.026 --> 00:04:50.376
and across the United States.

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:54.476
The funding formulas are going to
force administrators and educators

00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:55.846
to look outside of the box.

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:59.596
&gt;&gt;Grace: Okay, so that wraps up our
introduction to online learning.

00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:03.606
In the materials here on
Edutopia.org, you'll find resources

00:05:03.606 --> 00:05:07.176
and tips from teachers on how to
make the most of virtual education.

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:10.856
And if you have any questions, I'll
be available by e-mail after class.

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:12.526
Just kidding.

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:14.916
