00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.880
We were talking about the
energies of the various states

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.691
in a multi-electron atom.
And the question is,

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:29.754
how do we know what these
energies are,

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:34.528
experimentally?
And the technique that we use

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:39.324
to know those energies is
something called photoelectron

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:41.591
spectroscopy.
In principle,

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:46.125
it is the same kind of
spectroscopy as when we talked

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:51.095
about photoemission from a
solid, the photoelectron effect

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:54.408
explained by Einstein.
And, by the way,

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:59.814
I put on the website an article
that is really very clear about

00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:04.000
what Einstein's contributions
were.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.449
In particular,
in explaining the photoelectric

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:10.132
effect.
And it has some sociology in

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:12.815
it, too.
It is a really easy-to-read

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:15.728
article.
I encourage you to take a look

00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:18.717
at it as a study break sometime.
Anyway.

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:23.010
The idea here is the same,
the photoelectron spectroscopy

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.342
off of atoms and molecules.
It is the same thing as the

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:33.286
photoelectron emission from a
solid, in that you send in a

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:37.450
photon and that causes an
electron to be ejected.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.655
But, unlike the solid where we
essentially had just one state

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:46.819
at a particular energy,
in an atom or a molecule,

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.850
we have many different states
with many different energies.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.448
And what we typically do,
then, is we send in a photon

00:01:56.448 --> 00:02:02.000
that will be able to ionize all
of those electrons.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.104
That is, it is a photon with
enough energy to rip off even

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:09.970
the most strongly bound
electron.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.268
And so, that photon is
typically an X-ray photon.

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:18.029
For example,
we take this unsuspecting neon

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.955
atom, and we bring in an X-ray
photon and make neon plus.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:26.358
And one of the electrons that

00:02:26.358 --> 00:02:30.208
can come off is,
of course, the 2p electron,

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:34.865
here, so that the ion
configuration is 

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:39.602
1s 2 2s 2 2p 5.
And then, of course,

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:44.570
another possible electron to be
pulled off is that 2s electron.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.977
The electron configuration is
1s 2 2s 1 2p 6.

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:50.980
And then, finally,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.307
if the photon has enough
energy, we can pull off the 1s

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:58.913
electron, to make the 1s 1 2s 2
configuration,

00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:03.000
2s 2p6 configuration.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.360
And what we then do in this
technique is we measure the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.478
kinetic energies of all the
electrons that come off.

00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:16.565
We measure the kinetic energies
and disperse them so that we get

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:20.602
a plot of the number of
electrons with a particular

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:23.993
kinetic energy.
The plot is what I show you

00:03:23.993 --> 00:03:29.000
here, number of electrons versus
the kinetic energy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.229
And what you see is that we
have three kinetic energies that

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.421
show up.
We have electrons with three

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:42.562
different kinetic energies.
We have three different kinetic

00:03:42.562 --> 00:03:46.905
energies because in neon,
we had three states with

00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:50.008
different energies.
So, for example,

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.819
this energy,
384 eV, that corresponds to the

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.227
electrons that were pulled off,
electrons that were in that 1s

00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:03.028
state.
That is the most strongly bound

00:04:03.028 --> 00:04:04.205
state.
For example,

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:07.084
if this is the energy of our
incident photon,

00:04:07.084 --> 00:04:10.943
and then this is the ionization
energy, which is going to be

00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:14.476
largest for the 1s electron
because it is most strongly

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:17.551
bound, well, then,
the energy difference between

00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.476
the incident energy and that
ionization energy is the kinetic

00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:24.747
energy of the electron.
That is the leftover energy

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:29.000
that goes into the kinetic
energy of the electron.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.390
That is going to be smallest
because that 1s electron is most

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.317
strongly bound.
Then we have this kinetic

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:40.780
energy here, electrons with that
kinetic energy were electrons

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.731
sitting in the 2s state.
That has higher kinetic energy

00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:47.365
because they are less strongly
bound.

00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:50.365
This is the energy of the
incident photon.

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:53.951
This is the ionization energy
of that 2s electron.

00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.609
That leftover energy,
then, is that kinetic energy.

00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:00.682
And then, finally,
this is the feature that

00:05:00.682 --> 00:05:05.000
represents the electrons in the
2p state.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.692
They are least strongly bound.
If this is the incident energy,

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:13.307
this is that ionization energy
for the 2p state.

00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:17.769
All of this energy is leftover
to go into kinetic energy of

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:21.000
that 2p electron moving away
from the atom.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.769
And so, in general,
as the kinetic energy goes up,

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:30.000
the binding energy here is
getting less and less negative.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.185
It is getting weaker and
weaker.

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:35.638
Or, in other words,
as the kinetic energy goes up,

00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:39.938
the binding energy is getting
more negative in this direction.

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:42.969
Very quickly,
if you look at a photoelectron

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.198
spectrum and you see three lines
like this, you know you have

00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:50.017
three states at three different
energies.

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:54.246
And you always know that the
highest kinetic energy means the

00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:58.546
least strongly bound electron,
the lowest kinetic energy means

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:02.000
the most strongly bound
electron.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.869
And then, we can use these
results to actually calculate

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.738
the binding energies of the
electrons by conservation of

00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:12.271
energy.
And this you have to know for

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:14.522
the exam.
Incident energy is that

00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:18.532
ionization energy or the work
function, in the case of the

00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:22.613
solid, plus the kinetic energy.
Or, I can turn this around.

00:06:22.613 --> 00:06:25.216
I can solve for the ionization
energy.

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:30.000
That will be the incident
energy, which is right here.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.078
This is the energy of that
X-ray photon,

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:37.184
1,253 eV, minus the kinetic
energies that we actually

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:42.236
measure, which are going to give
us those ionization energies for

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:46.500
each one of the electrons in
their corresponding state.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.289
And then, once we have those
ionization energies,

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.631
it is easy to turn it into a
binding energy because that

00:06:54.631 --> 00:07:00.000
ionization energy is equal to
minus that binding energy.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.030
For example,
since the ionization energy,

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.564
the 1s electron,
is 870 eV, the binding energy

00:07:08.564 --> 00:07:12.090
of that 1s electron is minus 870
eV.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.732
And I also want you to notice
just how much more strongly

00:07:17.732 --> 00:07:23.073
bound that electron in the 1s
state is compared to the

00:07:23.073 --> 00:07:26.397
electrons in the n equals 2
shell.

00:07:26.397 --> 00:07:32.544
That is because that n equals 1
shell is much closer in to the

00:07:32.544 --> 00:07:40.000
nucleus, where that attractive
interaction is much stronger.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.789
And, therefore,
this electron is much more

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:46.328
strongly bound than those
electrons in the n equals 2

00:07:46.328 --> 00:07:48.437
state.
Of course, 2s is lower in

00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:50.955
energy than 2p,
and that is important.

00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:54.289
This is because in the 2s
state, you have a finite

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:57.556
probability of being really
close to the nucleus.

00:07:57.556 --> 00:08:01.571
That is what makes that 2s a
little bit lower in energy than

00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:07.164
the 2p.
Now, what we are going to do is

00:08:07.164 --> 00:08:14.820
I am going to start lecturing
about trends in the Periodic

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:22.880
Table, and this is where the
questions come for your section.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.850
Oh, okay.
Do you have any extra paper?

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.695
Not much.
Well, the way you were going to

00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:38.173
be able to answer a question for
your recitation was by making a

00:08:38.173 --> 00:08:43.391
paper airplane and launching it
to the blackboard after I say

00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:46.695
launch.
And the first paper airplane to

00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:50.347
hit the blackboard,
well, you will have the

00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:53.304
opportunity to answer the
question.

00:08:53.304 --> 00:08:58.086
Your recitation will have that
opportunity to answer the

00:08:58.086 --> 00:09:02.633
question.
And we will keep score.

00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:07.900
Now, we are kind of running out
of extra paper.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:14.770
You can take the one page that
asks for the seating plan that

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:20.954
you will not need again,
as a piece of paper to make an

00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:25.190
airplane.
Do you have any other paper?

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.000
Here are a couple of extra
pages.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.510
Also, if you need some,
there are some paper airplanes

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.000
up here.
You are welcome to take those.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.305
Okay.
Some of you are more

00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:51.378
strategically placed than
others, and so you may want to

00:09:51.378 --> 00:09:56.635
designate someone in your
recitation section as a launcher

00:09:56.635 --> 00:10:03.000
and send them down here so that
everybody gets an equal chance.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.149
That is fine with me.
And, as I said,

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:09.037
if anybody wants a paper
airplane.

00:10:09.037 --> 00:10:13.762
Oh, also the other thing,
write your recitation section

00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:19.274
number on the airplane so that I
can identify which airplane and

00:10:19.274 --> 00:10:24.262
what section it comes from.
And they have to be airplanes.

00:10:24.262 --> 00:10:28.024
They cannot be wads.
And here are some extra

00:10:28.024 --> 00:10:31.000
airplanes if you want.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.273
You can take some and pass them
back if you want.

00:10:43.273 --> 00:10:48.082
While you are doing that,
I am going to start lecturing

00:10:48.082 --> 00:10:52.000
here about trends in the
Periodic Table.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.596
And, of course,
it is these electron

00:11:05.596 --> 00:11:09.973
configurations that allow us to
understand the trends in the

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:13.385
Periodic Table.
But you should realize that the

00:11:13.385 --> 00:11:18.133
Periodic Table was initially put
together by Mendeleev and others

00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:21.323
in 1850-1870.
And it was put together on the

00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:25.922
basis of the similarity of the
chemical and physical properties

00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:28.964
of the elements.
For example,

00:11:28.964 --> 00:11:32.743
lithium, sodium,
potassium, they were put in the

00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:36.522
same column because those
elements are all soft,

00:11:36.522 --> 00:11:39.899
malleable elements that were
very reactive.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.035
Helium, neon,
argon were put in the same

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:47.698
column because they are all
atoms that are very unreactive.

00:11:47.698 --> 00:11:51.316
And, of course,
today, we understand why their

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:55.819
properties are what they are.
And we understand it on the

00:11:55.819 --> 00:12:00.000
basis of the electron
configurations.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.987
Lithium, sodium,
potassium, we have this extra

00:12:03.987 --> 00:12:09.215
valence electron in the s state
that makes it very reactive.

00:12:09.215 --> 00:12:12.582
Helium, neon,
argon are very unreactive

00:12:12.582 --> 00:12:17.012
because they have this closed
shell, this inner gas

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:20.822
configuration.
But really, by the late 1800s

00:12:20.822 --> 00:12:24.012
and early 1900s,
the similar chemical

00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:29.063
properties, as you go down a
column of the Periodic Table,

00:12:29.063 --> 00:12:35.000
was really very firmly believed
to an extreme extent.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.530
So strongly,
that it was known that,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.070
and, of course,
human beings ate salt and that

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:48.618
the body had sodium ions in it
and potassium ions in it,

00:12:48.618 --> 00:12:53.561
if that is the case,
if you can consume sodium and

00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:58.000
potassium, why not a little
lithium?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.200
In 1925 or so,
there was marketed a soft

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.712
drink, and this soft drink
wanted a lemon-lime flavor to

00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:08.338
it.
To get that lemon-lime flavor

00:13:08.338 --> 00:13:12.851
they needed a little bit of
citric acid, but that is not

00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:17.117
very soluble in water.
To make it soluble you make it

00:13:17.117 --> 00:13:19.743
a salt.
And, for whatever reason,

00:13:19.743 --> 00:13:22.533
they used lithium citrate.
Why not?

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:27.374
Let's use some lithium citrate.
And that soft drink was none

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:31.081
other than 7-Up.
Honestly.

00:13:31.081 --> 00:13:36.007
And, in fact,
the benefits of lithium were

00:13:36.007 --> 00:13:40.573
touted.
Lithium was claimed to give the

00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:46.701
beverage healthful benefits,
an abundance of energy,

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:51.868
enthusiasm, clear complexion,
lustrous hair,

00:13:51.868 --> 00:13:55.232
lustrous eyes,
shinning eyes,

00:13:55.232 --> 00:14:01.000
and you have got to drink this
stuff.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.606
It was the market for 25 years
until the early 1950s,

00:14:05.606 --> 00:14:09.857
when the antipsychotic
properties of lithium were

00:14:09.857 --> 00:14:14.286
beginning to be noticed,
along with the severe side

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:18.538
effects of lithium.
And it was then taken off the

00:14:18.538 --> 00:14:23.764
market, or at least taken off
the market with the citrate as

00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:28.459
the lithium salt in it.
And it was really only another

00:14:28.459 --> 00:14:32.179
20 years, 1970,
before lithium was actually

00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:36.785
approved as a drug for the
treatment of antipsychotic

00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:40.472
behavior.
I don't know how many

00:14:40.472 --> 00:14:44.750
individuals suffered the side
effects of lithium from drinking

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.696
too much 7-Up,
but there is a moral to this

00:14:47.696 --> 00:14:49.098
story.
And the moral,

00:14:49.098 --> 00:14:53.306
of course, is that even though
we are about to talk about the

00:14:53.306 --> 00:14:56.742
general trends along a column of
a Periodic Table,

00:14:56.742 --> 00:15:00.950
don't put any element in your
mouth just because it is in the

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:06.000
same column of the Period Table
as some element you do eat.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.225
This is a for real story.
One of the properties we are

00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:15.563
going to talk about is the
ionization energy.

00:15:15.563 --> 00:15:21.281
And we have already used the
word ionization energy quite a

00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:27.000
lot, but let me just formalize
the definitions here.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.014
For example,
we have a boron atom being

00:15:30.014 --> 00:15:32.949
ionized.
The energy difference between

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:37.788
the products and the reactions
here is that ionization energy.

00:15:37.788 --> 00:15:42.548
But this ionization energy is
minus the binding energy of the

00:15:42.548 --> 00:15:46.435
2p electron in boron.
That is what that ionization

00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:49.449
energy is.
We are ripping off the least

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:53.653
strongly bound electron.
And when we rip off the least

00:15:53.653 --> 00:15:57.302
strongly bound electron,
we call that the first

00:15:57.302 --> 00:16:02.217
ionization energy.
That is the energy to remove

00:16:02.217 --> 00:16:06.415
the electron from the highest
occupied atomic orbital.

00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:10.297
That is the same idea,
the highest occupied atomic

00:16:10.297 --> 00:16:14.811
orbital, that is the same idea
as the least strongly bound

00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:17.584
electron.
However, most of the time,

00:16:17.584 --> 00:16:22.178
when we talk about ionization
energy, we don't use the word

00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:25.108
first.
If you see a list of ionization

00:16:25.108 --> 00:16:29.148
energies, if you see a table of
ionization energies,

00:16:29.148 --> 00:16:33.671
they don't say first.
That first is implied.

00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:36.635
Now, of course,
there are other kinds of

00:16:36.635 --> 00:16:39.066
ionization energies.
For example,

00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:43.018
the second ionization energy.
We can keep going here.

00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:47.729
We can take boron plus,
rip off the next least strongly

00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:51.072
bound electron to make boron
plus 2.

00:16:51.072 --> 00:16:55.480
That energy change is what we
define as a second ionization

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.911
energy.
That second ionization energy

00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:02.800
is minus the binding energy of
the 2s electron in boron plus.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.777
And we can keep going.

00:17:04.777 --> 00:17:08.600
There is a third ionization
energy, taking another electron

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.962
from boron plus 2 to
boron plus 3.

00:17:11.962 --> 00:17:14.532
And there is a fourth
ionization energy,

00:17:14.532 --> 00:17:17.564
boron plus 3 to boron
plus 4.

00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:20.992
And a fifth ionization energy,
boron plus 4,

00:17:20.992 --> 00:17:23.563
boron plus 5,
all the way down.

00:17:23.563 --> 00:17:25.606
And now we are the bare
nucleus.

00:17:25.606 --> 00:17:28.440
That is our definition of
ionization energy,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.000
second, third,
fourth, and fifth.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.666
Now comes the first question,
and the question is going to be

00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:43.777
on the side boards here.
We have this reaction.

00:17:43.777 --> 00:17:50.111
This is boron plus
going to boron plus 2.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:55.444
What we are doing here is
removing a 2s electron.

00:17:55.444 --> 00:18:02.625
[LAUGHTER] Remember about the

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:08.000
fool aiming for their chemistry
professor?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.389
Look at the second reaction
here, boron to boron plus.

00:18:20.389 --> 00:18:23.597
Again, we are pulling off a 2s

00:18:23.597 --> 00:18:26.045
electron.
And the question is,

00:18:26.045 --> 00:18:30.750
are these two energies equal?
Now, the way we are going to

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.312
answer it is after I get out of
the way, I am going to say

00:18:34.312 --> 00:18:36.250
launch.
You are going to launch.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.375
And the first paper airplane to
hit the blackboard,

00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:42.937
we are going to look at that
recitation number and you are

00:18:42.937 --> 00:18:44.937
going to have a chance to
answer.

00:18:44.937 --> 00:18:47.000
Are you ready?
Launch.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Recitation four.
Are these two energies equal?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
That is you.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.888
Are these two energies equal?
No.

00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:13.866
Final answer?
Yes, they are right.

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:19.191
One point for recitation four.
These energies are not equal.

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:22.169
Why?
Well, because this ionization

00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:25.599
energy is the second ionization
energy. It is

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:31.194
minus the binding energy of
the 2s electron in boron plus.

00:19:31.194 --> 00:19:36.147
This energy is the ionization

00:19:36.147 --> 00:19:39.837
energy of the 2s electron in
boron.

00:19:39.837 --> 00:19:46.131
It is minus the binding energy
of the 2s electron in boron.

00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:49.713
They are not equal.
Next question.

00:19:49.713 --> 00:19:54.705
Which one of these binding
energies is greater?

00:19:54.705 --> 00:19:58.286
Wait.
I am getting out of the way.

00:19:58.286 --> 00:20:02.799
Are you ready?
In position.

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:04.000
Launch.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.945
Recitation eight.
Where are you,

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:16.000
eight?
You are over here.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.836
Eight does not want to identify
itself.

00:20:20.836 --> 00:20:24.781
All right.
Which one is greater,

00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:27.072
top or bottom?
Top.

00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:32.279
Final answer?
Boy, you are right.

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:36.599
Top one is greater.
Recitation eight.

00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:43.200
It is greater because the
effective charge in boron plus

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:50.279
is larger than it is in boron.
There are fewer electrons for

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:55.200
shielding.
The effective charge is larger.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.805
That binding energy is greater.
Or, that ionization energy

00:21:02.805 --> 00:21:06.690
here, the way I write it,
is greater.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.791
Fantastic.
Now, we are going to look at

00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:17.374
some trends in the ionization
energy along the Periodic Table.

00:21:17.374 --> 00:21:22.661
The first question is,
here is the Periodic Table,

00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:28.057
as we go across it,
what happens to that ionization

00:21:28.057 --> 00:21:31.125
energy?
Wait.

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:36.750
Are we in position?
Ready?

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.000
Launch.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.878
Recitation five.
What happens to the ionization

00:21:49.878 --> 00:21:54.333
energy as you go across the
Periodic Table?

00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:57.833
Is that five?
Is that your answer,

00:21:57.833 --> 00:21:59.000
five?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.466
What happens to the ionization
energy as you go across the

00:22:11.466 --> 00:22:15.096
Periodic Table from here to
here?

00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:18.159
It increases.
You are right,

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:22.016
recitation five.
Here is the trend.

00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:26.554
Here is row one,
from hydrogen to helium.

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:32.000
Here is row two,
from lithium to neon.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.548
It increases.
It increases because,

00:22:35.548 --> 00:22:41.080
as you go across the Periodic
Table here, Z increases.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.673
The nuclear charge increases.
But, of course,

00:22:45.673 --> 00:22:50.474
there is another parameter
here, and that is r.

00:22:50.474 --> 00:22:55.797
But, as you go across the
Periodic Table right here,

00:22:55.797 --> 00:23:00.494
you are putting electrons into
the same shell,

00:23:00.494 --> 00:23:05.735
essentially.
You are putting those electrons

00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:09.176
into shells that have,
roughly speaking,

00:23:09.176 --> 00:23:12.617
the same distance of r from the
nucleus.

00:23:12.617 --> 00:23:18.176
And so the factor that wins out
is Z, the effective charge here.

00:23:18.176 --> 00:23:23.205
And the ionization energy as
you go across then increases.

00:23:23.205 --> 00:23:27.176
But you also see that there are
some glitches.

00:23:27.176 --> 00:23:33.000
You see that boron is a little
bit lower energy than --

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.470
What did I want to say here?
I'm sorry.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.235
I am looking at it from the
side.

00:23:46.235 --> 00:23:51.764
Here is the electron
configuration of beryllium.

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:56.000
Here it is, boron,
Z equals 5.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.847
What you see,
here, is that in boron,

00:24:04.847 --> 00:24:09.039
you have to put that extra
electron into the 2p state,

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:11.491
which requires some more
energy.

00:24:11.491 --> 00:24:16.158
The bottom line is that the
nuclear charge does not increase

00:24:16.158 --> 00:24:20.587
fast enough to compensate
completely for the extra energy

00:24:20.587 --> 00:24:24.146
that you need to have to get to
this 2p state.

00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:28.101
Boron has a little bit lower
ionization energy than

00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:32.728
beryllium.
And to see another glitch,

00:24:32.728 --> 00:24:37.765
that other glitch is between
nitrogen and oxygen.

00:24:37.765 --> 00:24:43.117
Again, we can understand that
glitch by the electron

00:24:43.117 --> 00:24:46.370
configuration.
Here is nitrogen,

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.098
Z equals 7.
Here is oxygen,

00:24:49.098 --> 00:24:53.086
Z equals 8.
And the bottom line here is

00:24:53.086 --> 00:24:57.808
that in oxygen,
you have to put an electron in

00:24:57.808 --> 00:25:04.000
a state in which there already
is an electron.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.623
That is a repulsive
interaction.

00:25:06.623 --> 00:25:11.532
Again, the increase in the
nuclear charge just is not large

00:25:11.532 --> 00:25:16.357
enough to fully compensate for
that repulsive interaction.

00:25:16.357 --> 00:25:21.097
We can understand those little
glitches in terms of these

00:25:21.097 --> 00:25:24.482
electron configurations.
And, in general,

00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:29.476
here, that ionization increases
as we go across the Periodic

00:25:29.476 --> 00:25:32.808
Table.
Here is the third row.

00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:36.753
You also see there are glitches
in the third row.

00:25:36.753 --> 00:25:41.356
You see there is a glitch
between magnesium and aluminum.

00:25:41.356 --> 00:25:45.054
They are right underneath
beryllium and boron.

00:25:45.054 --> 00:25:48.260
A glitch between phosphorous
and sulfur.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.958
They are right underneath
nitrogen and oxygen.

00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:55.739
For the same reason,
there is a glitch at those

00:25:55.739 --> 00:26:01.000
elements in the second row.
Now, the next question.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.232
As we go down a column of the
Periodic Table,

00:26:09.232 --> 00:26:16.154
what happens to the ionization
energy?

00:26:16.154 --> 00:26:18.212
Wait.
Ready?

00:26:18.212 --> 00:26:20.270
Set?
Launch.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:26.819
Five.
What happens to the ionization

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:30.590
energy?
What?

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.425
Decreases.
You are right,

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:37.795
recitation five.
Why does it decrease?

00:26:37.795 --> 00:26:43.818
It decreases because?
Well, it decreases because you

00:26:43.818 --> 00:26:50.078
are putting electrons into
shells that are farther and

00:26:50.078 --> 00:26:57.283
farther away from the nucleus.
Yes, as you go down the column,

00:26:57.283 --> 00:27:02.870
Z increases.
But it does not increase fast

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:07.621
enough as r increases.
Remember there are the two

00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:11.382
factors, Z and r.
Although Z increases,

00:27:11.382 --> 00:27:17.023
you are putting the electrons
into shells that are farther

00:27:17.023 --> 00:27:21.279
from the nucleus.
Therefore, that attractive

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:26.723
interaction does go down,
and the ionization energy goes

00:27:26.723 --> 00:27:29.000
down.
Great.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.522
Now, we are going to talk about
another property.

00:27:33.522 --> 00:27:38.328
That other property is called
the electron affinity.

00:27:38.328 --> 00:27:42.191
For example,
if I take chlorine and add an

00:27:42.191 --> 00:27:46.714
electron to it to make chlorine
minus.

00:27:46.714 --> 00:27:51.425
There is an energy change here.
That energy change,

00:27:51.425 --> 00:27:56.136
delta E, is equal to minus 349
kilojoules per mole.

00:27:56.136 --> 00:28:02.868
That is, the fact that this

00:28:02.868 --> 00:28:08.073
energy change is negative,
this tells you that the

00:28:08.073 --> 00:28:13.278
chlorine ion is more stable than
the neutral atom.

00:28:13.278 --> 00:28:19.545
Now, in terms of an equation,
what is the definition here of

00:28:19.545 --> 00:28:24.644
the electron affinity?
That is the next question.

00:28:24.644 --> 00:28:29.000
Are you ready to launch?
Launch.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.368
Recitation eight.
Where are you?

00:28:36.368 --> 00:28:39.652
You are right here.
No, you are right there.

00:28:39.652 --> 00:28:43.166
Recitation eight,
what is the definition of the

00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:45.000
electron affinity?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.857
TAs cannot help.
Energy required to add an

00:28:55.857 --> 00:28:59.000
electron, that is --

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.604
Recitation eight,
you are right.

00:29:12.604 --> 00:29:16.093
It is minus delta E.
Fantastic.

00:29:16.093 --> 00:29:20.046
This is the delta E for the
reason.

00:29:20.046 --> 00:29:25.162
The electron affinity is minus
that quantity.

00:29:25.162 --> 00:29:30.511
The electron affinity,
then, of chlorine is 349

00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:36.770
kilojoules per mole.
Now, unlike the ionization

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:42.844
energy, the electron affinity
can be positive or negative.

00:29:42.844 --> 00:29:47.426
For example,
if you try to stick an electron

00:29:47.426 --> 00:29:52.114
on a nitrogen atom to make N
minus,

00:29:52.114 --> 00:29:56.057
delta E for that reaction is
positive.

00:29:56.057 --> 00:30:02.882
It is 7 kilojoules per mole.
And so that electron is not

00:30:02.882 --> 00:30:06.298
going to stick onto the
nitrogen.

00:30:06.298 --> 00:30:11.209
The electron affinity in that
case is negative.

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:14.733
It is minus 7 kilojoules per
mole.

00:30:14.733 --> 00:30:20.498
Again, you can understand that
in terms of the electron

00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:25.943
configuration for the nitrogen.
Here is the electron

00:30:25.943 --> 00:30:32.279
configuration for nitrogen.
If you go and you want to add

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:35.186
in another electron,
like right there,

00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:37.701
there is a repulsive
interaction.

00:30:37.701 --> 00:30:39.902
And Z equals 7.
In this case,

00:30:39.902 --> 00:30:44.303
that nuclear charge is not
large enough to compensate for

00:30:44.303 --> 00:30:48.390
this repulsive interaction,
so the electron affinity,

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.769
here, is negative.
Noble gases have negative

00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:55.620
electron affinities.
You cannot add an electron to

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.349
that.
It is not stable.

00:30:57.349 --> 00:31:02.623
Why?
Because you are destroying,

00:31:02.623 --> 00:31:10.004
in effect, the electronic
configuration of the rare gas.

00:31:10.004 --> 00:31:17.116
With that, now we want to ask
is how does the electron

00:31:17.116 --> 00:31:23.961
affinity change as you go across
the periodic table?

00:31:23.961 --> 00:31:28.121
That is our next question.
Wait.

00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:31.263
Okay.
Ready?

00:31:31.263 --> 00:31:34.000
Set?
Launch.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.184
Six, where are you?
What happens to the electron

00:31:47.184 --> 00:31:52.973
affinity as you go across the
Periodic Table,

00:31:52.973 --> 00:31:56.789
from left to right?
Decreases.

00:31:56.789 --> 00:32:01.418
Is that your final answer?
Yes?

00:32:01.418 --> 00:32:05.187
You are wrong.
The electron affinity,

00:32:05.187 --> 00:32:08.014
as you go across,
increases.

00:32:08.014 --> 00:32:12.306
The halogens,
fluorine, chlorine have very

00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:17.750
large electron affinities,
because adding an electron

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.729
gives you that noble gas
configuration.

00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:28.010
The electron affinity increases
as you go across the Periodic

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.826
Table.
Now what happens to the

00:32:31.826 --> 00:32:35.797
electron affinity as we go down
the Periodic Table?

00:32:35.797 --> 00:32:39.054
You guys, do you have any paper
airplanes?

00:32:39.054 --> 00:32:42.072
We have to give you some.
Are you okay?

00:32:42.072 --> 00:32:46.361
That is our next question.
What happens to the electron

00:32:46.361 --> 00:32:49.617
affinity as we go down the
Periodic Table?

00:32:49.617 --> 00:32:50.411
Ready?
Set?

00:32:50.411 --> 00:32:52.000
Launch.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.555
Recitation four.
What does it do?

00:33:03.555 --> 00:33:06.444
Does it go down?
Decreases.

00:33:06.444 --> 00:33:09.000
It absolutely does.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.874
The electron affinity,
as you go down,

00:33:17.874 --> 00:33:21.434
decreases.
It decreases because the

00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:25.099
nuclear charge,
here, is increasing,

00:33:25.099 --> 00:33:31.382
but you are putting electrons
in shells that are farther away

00:33:31.382 --> 00:33:37.065
from the nucleus.
The overall effect is that that

00:33:37.065 --> 00:33:42.208
r dependence dictates,
and the electron affinity goes

00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:43.000
down.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.178
Let me do one more here.
Or, maybe a couple more.

00:33:54.178 --> 00:34:01.000
Now, what I want to ask is
about the atomic radius.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.070
And what I want to know is what
happens to r as you go across

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:21.391
the Periodic Table.
I am getting out of the way.

00:34:21.391 --> 00:34:22.871
Wait.
Ready?

00:34:22.871 --> 00:34:26.906
Set?
I haven't said launch yet.

00:34:26.906 --> 00:34:28.251
Ready?
Set?

00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:32.195
Go.
Recitation one.

00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:36.292
What happens to r?
Decreases.

00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:40.097
It decreases.
It goes down.

00:34:40.097 --> 00:34:44.634
This is important.
It goes down,

00:34:44.634 --> 00:34:51.365
here, because Z is increasing.
Z is increasing,

00:34:51.365 --> 00:35:00.000
and you are putting electrons
into the same shell.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.163
And so the same shell means the
same distance from the nucleus.

00:35:07.163 --> 00:35:13.980
Larger Z, the radius actually
goes down, the size goes down.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:20.796
And then, one more question.
What happens as you go down the

00:35:20.796 --> 00:35:25.764
Periodic Table?
I am going to get out of the

00:35:25.764 --> 00:35:26.920
way.
Ready?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.000
Set?
Go.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:45.045
One.
It decreases?

00:35:45.045 --> 00:36:02.587
What did you say?
Increases.

00:36:02.587 --> 00:36:37.672
It does increase because you
are putting electrons into

00:36:37.672 --> 00:37:10.158
shells farther and farther away.
What is the score,

00:37:10.158 --> 00:37:11.491
Christine?
Fantastic.
