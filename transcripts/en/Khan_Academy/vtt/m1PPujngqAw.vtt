00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:01.654
- [Voiceover] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.654 --> 00:00:03.384
is give ourselves an introduction

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:07.389
or an intuition for the
term Flux in general.

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:09.189
And then think about how it applies

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.091
to the idea of magnetic

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:14.646
Magnetic Flux.

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:17.722
So, first of all, when people
are just talking about flux,

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.417
and this is the easiest way that I know

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:20.427
how to conceptualize it.

00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:22.889
They're talking about
how much of something

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.755
is flowing through a surface
in a given amount of time.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.659
So if you imagine that this is,

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.827
this is, I'm just defining a
volume of air right over here.

00:00:32.827 --> 00:00:36.054
And let's say the air is
denser near the bottom

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.192
of this volume of air,

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:40.722
so there's more air down here

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.161
than there is up here,

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:43.322
which is generally true.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:47.955
Air density goes down as
you increase altitude.

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:50.161
So there's very low density up here.

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:51.589
This is in between.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.191
I don't have to draw
all the air particles,

00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.523
but you get the sense.

00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:57.750
Lot of air, lot of air down here.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.457
And the air is moving.

00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:01.350
And so let's say that the air,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.391
let's say the air is...

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:06.887
Let me do the velocity
vectors in a different color.

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:10.951
So, these are some of the
velocity vectors of the air.

00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:14.852
Let's say the air on this side is moving

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:18.625
is moving at let's say, a medium velocity.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.994
So right over there.

00:01:20.994 --> 00:01:23.292
But as we move more in that direction,

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:25.707
the air is moving faster.

00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:30.707
So they have larger
velocity vectors like that.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.695
We see that in general,
all of the air is moving

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:36.388
in that general direction,
that's the way I'm drawing it.

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.919
And I can draw the
velocity vectors over here.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:40.858
The air is less dense.

00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:42.484
But the trend in the velocity vectors,

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:44.225
when I go from the left to the right is

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:45.827
roughly the same.

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:47.859
So that's the flow.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.425
Now I'm just sampling some of
the velocity vectors there.

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:51.551
So let's talk about flux.

00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:53.026
And the thing about flux,

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:53.850
really of any form,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.487
you have to think about a surface.

00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:58.958
So let's imagine you were
to put some type of a net.

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:02.348
Let's say you were to put a net right over

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:05.355
right over here, right over here.

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:06.992
And if we think about the flux,

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.757
we would say, well how much air

00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:12.054
is traveling through that net
in a certain amount of time?

00:02:12.054 --> 00:02:13.958
We could say how many molecules

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.989
are traveling in say, each second.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.694
And so this would have some
flux associated with it.

00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:20.889
Relative to the air.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.293
But what if we were to take that same net.

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:25.092
And we're assuming it's
some type of theoretical net

00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:27.658
that actually does not
impede the air flow.

00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:30.886
But it helps us visualize a surface.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:34.287
What if we were to move that
net a little bit to the right

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.308
where the density is the same,

00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:39.094
but the particles are just moving faster.

00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:41.346
Well now, our flux would increase.

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:44.284
So this is larger flux.

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:46.954
Larger, larger flux.

00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:48.719
Why is our flux increase?

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.750
Because, well, the density is the same,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.993
but in any given amount of time

00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:56.486
I'm gonna have more things
going through that surface.

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.680
Now what if I were to put that same net

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.828
and move it up to this high altitude,

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:02.558
right over here?

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:03.951
That high altitude.

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:07.387
Well, the velocity of the
molecules are the same,

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.421
and they're going in the same direction.

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:10.127
But there's just fewer of them.

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:12.751
So you're going to have
less fewer molecules

00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:15.886
traveling through the surface
in a given amount of time.

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:17.453
So this is going to have smaller flux.

00:03:17.453 --> 00:03:19.787
And this is all relative to my first one.

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:23.676
Smaller, smaller flux.

00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:26.555
Now, what if you were to take the same net

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:30.224
and instead of the direction of the air

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:32.360
being perpendicular to the surface,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.323
be normal to the surface,

00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:36.122
what if you were to take the net

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:38.525
and reorientate it so
that the air is going

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:40.151
in the same direction of the surface.

00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.950
So what if you were to take the same net

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.388
and you were to make it like this.

00:03:44.388 --> 00:03:45.758
So that it's the same net.

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:47.384
I know it doesn't look exactly the same.

00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:49.323
But it's the same net,

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:50.240
and you're to make it like this.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.026
Well now how much air is
traveling through that net

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:54.861
in a given amount of time?

00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:56.556
Well now very little to zero air

00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:57.960
is gonna be traveling through that net

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.889
in any given amount of time.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.422
The air is going along the surface,

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:02.256
not through the surface.

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:04.857
So this one, let's just say that

00:04:04.857 --> 00:04:06.157
all the air is going exactly

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:07.492
in the same direction as the surface,

00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:09.361
so nothing is going through the surface.

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:11.753
We would say that this one has zero,

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:13.390
zero flux.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.724
Now let's say that this theoretical net

00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:17.500
that actually does not
impede the air flow,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.184
let's say we can stretch
it or contract it.

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:20.995
So if we stretch that net,

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.421
in the same, let's say we were to do it,

00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:26.022
let's say we were to
stretch it up like this.

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:27.891
So it becomes a bigger net.

00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:29.783
So it becomes a bigger net like this.

00:04:29.783 --> 00:04:31.954
Well now this thing's
gonna have larger flux

00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:33.650
because there's just more area.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.449
There's more to flow through.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.725
So now, if you said for this surface,

00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:39.222
you're gonna have a larger flux

00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:40.627
because there's just gonna be more air

00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:42.024
is going to go through that

00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:44.017
in any given unit of time.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.120
So as you can see,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.850
when we think about how much of something

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.951
just flux in the traditional sense.

00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:50.856
How much of something
goes through a surface

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:52.493
in a given unit of time.

00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:56.057
It depends in this case, the
density of the substance.

00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:57.949
It depends on

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.528
it's velocity.

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:00.921
Both the magnitude of the velocity

00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:02.326
and the direction of the velocity.

00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:03.824
We see if we orient the surface

00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:05.786
or if we oriented the velocity.

00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:08.154
So it's not going normal to the surface,

00:05:08.154 --> 00:05:09.385
perpendicular to the surface.

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:11.986
Well then, we can have our flux go down.

00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:13.414
And you can have things in between.

00:05:13.414 --> 00:05:15.295
You can have a net.

00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:17.291
Let's say we took that same original net.

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.554
But the direction of the
air is neither normal

00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:22.760
nor exactly in the same
direction of the surface.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.418
Well this flux is going to be in between,

00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:27.590
is going to be in between
that original flux.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.250
And this one right over here.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.117
There's gonna be air flowing through.

00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:35.020
There is going to be air

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.226
flowing through

00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:39.060
the actual surface.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.951
But it's not going exactly
normal to the surface.

00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:44.052
And as we will explore later

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.655
when we get a little
bit more mathy into it.

00:05:45.655 --> 00:05:47.756
We actually care about the component

00:05:47.756 --> 00:05:50.426
of the vector of the air
that is exactly normal

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:53.027
when we eventually calculate flux.

00:05:53.027 --> 00:05:54.792
But this flux is gonna
be some place in between

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.986
this one and the zero flux

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:59.993
because the air isn't going
exactly perpendicular.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:03.221
Well that's just the more basic,

00:06:03.221 --> 00:06:05.914
or for me the more
intuitive notion of flux.

00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:08.747
But what do we mean by magnetic,

00:06:08.747 --> 00:06:10.988
by magnetic flux?

00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:13.461
Well, like regular flux,

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:17.652
we're still dealing with
how things are kind of,

00:06:17.652 --> 00:06:19.753
you could say going through a surface.

00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:22.516
But instead of thinking
about air particles or

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.920
water molecules or things like that,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.555
we're gonna be thinking
about a magnetic field.

00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:29.424
So let me draw a surface.

00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:31.955
So I have, I have a little bar magnet.

00:06:31.955 --> 00:06:34.718
This is the north side,
this is the south side.

00:06:34.718 --> 00:06:36.588
We see our field lines.

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:39.119
And then I've drawn a
couple of the magnetic

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.821
field vectors in white there.

00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:44.955
And let's say that we have a surface.

00:06:44.955 --> 00:06:46.906
We have a surface like this.

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:49.890
And so, for this surface

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.886
when we think about the flux

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:54.592
we wanna care about...

00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:57.993
things are actually moving when
we think about magnetic flux

00:06:57.993 --> 00:07:00.292
we aren't actually thinking about actual

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:02.928
physical things moving
through the surface.

00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:04.390
The way we did when we thought about,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.457
I guess you could say,
traditional or more,

00:07:06.457 --> 00:07:08.152
or flow-based flux.

00:07:08.152 --> 00:07:09.789
But it's a similar idea.

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:12.552
We care about the component

00:07:12.552 --> 00:07:14.027
of the magnetic field.

00:07:14.027 --> 00:07:16.047
And the density of the magnetic field

00:07:16.047 --> 00:07:19.007
that is normal to this surface.

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:21.562
So let's say that this has a given flux.

00:07:21.562 --> 00:07:24.394
So let's call that, and
the notation is phy.

00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:27.494
And, that's the flux
of the magnetic field.

00:07:27.494 --> 00:07:29.851
And once again, it's based on,

00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:33.624
it's based on the strength
of the magnetic field

00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:38.624
and specially the component
of the magnetic field vectors

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.078
that are perpendicular,

00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:44.317
that are perpendicular
to this actual surface.

00:07:44.317 --> 00:07:46.790
So this would have one magnetic flux.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.356
But if I were to take the same surface

00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:51.190
and make it parallel,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.393
make it parallel to the
magnetic field vecotrs

00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:57.761
instead of being normal or...

00:07:57.761 --> 00:07:59.584
Now the magnetic field
vectors are parallel to it

00:07:59.584 --> 00:08:00.687
instead of being normal.

00:08:00.687 --> 00:08:02.452
So now our flux is zero.

00:08:02.452 --> 00:08:05.494
So this would have zero,
or pretty close to zero.

00:08:05.494 --> 00:08:07.386
So approximately zero

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.279
magnetic flux.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:11.020
Magnetic flux.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.251
Flux.

00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.120
Now if I were to take this surface

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.560
and instead of orienting this way

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.986
I just moved it further away.

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:19.588
So instead of putting in here

00:08:19.588 --> 00:08:21.353
I would take it all the way out here

00:08:21.353 --> 00:08:25.393
where the magnetic field is weaker.

00:08:25.393 --> 00:08:26.856
Where the magnetic field is weaker.

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:29.225
So we have a weaker
magnetic field out here.

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:30.757
The flux would also decrease.

00:08:30.757 --> 00:08:32.660
So it has a lot of the same properties

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.217
as this more physical flux

00:08:34.217 --> 00:08:35.818
that we were talking about before.

00:08:35.818 --> 00:08:37.083
But instead of talking about, say,

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:39.058
the velocity of the air molecules,

00:08:39.058 --> 00:08:42.054
no, the velocity vectors
of the air molecules

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.888
and how those relate to the surface,

00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:48.393
here we're talking about
the magnetic field vectors.

00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:50.691
And how those relate to the surface.

00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:54.720
But the metaphor, the
analogy is still the same.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.054
If they are perpendicular,
you have larger flux.

00:08:57.054 --> 00:08:59.515
If they are going in the same direction,

00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:01.721
you might have zero or very little.

00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:03.590
You might have very little flux.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.154
If you have a weak
magnetic field out here,

00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:08.292
the flux is going to be lower

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:11.694
than if you have a strong magnetic field.

00:09:11.694 --> 00:09:12.855
That's analogous to,

00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:15.386
when you had high density
and high velocity,

00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:16.883
that was a lot of flux.

00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:18.683
Versus low density or low velocity

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.657
that is lower flux.

00:09:20.657 --> 00:09:23.884
And also, we can increase
the total surface.

00:09:23.884 --> 00:09:25.394
So if we stretch that surface

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:27.356
or we had a larger
surface right over here,

00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:29.956
the flux through this
surface is gonna be larger

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:31.814
than the flux through this surface.

00:09:31.814 --> 00:09:33.521
Let's say this surface is analogous

00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:36.121
to a surface like this right over here.

00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.792
Let's say that the magnetic
field is symmetric on both sides

00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:40.742
so the flux through this surface

00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:42.588
and this surface would be the same.

00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:44.260
So if you were to stretch it out

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.222
to be a larger surface,

00:09:46.222 --> 00:09:49.821
well now you just have
more of the magnetic field

00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:52.991
that is now normal to the surface.

00:09:52.991 --> 00:09:55.254
So hopefully this gives you
at least a beginning ideas

00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:57.751
of the notion of magnetic flux.

00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:59.086
And how it relates to,

00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:01.240
I guess you could think
of more physical flux.
