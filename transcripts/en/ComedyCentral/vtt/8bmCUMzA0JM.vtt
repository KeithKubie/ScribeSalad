00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:01.601
As you know,
I encourage viewers

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:02.969
to call in
and leave us voice mails,

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.338
but I never have time
to listen to them.

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.141
Our crew at<i> The Opposition</i> has
put some voice mails together

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.343
that I have honestly
never heard before,

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.578
but I promise
to answer any questions

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.547
and vomit my thoughts
straight at you.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.849
I have citizen journalist
Tim Baltz joining me

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.018
to add his expertise.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.587
I can't wait to tear these
people new assholes, Jordan.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.256
Right, Tim. Well...

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.625
I think those are mostly fans
of the show, so...

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.493
Oh, yeah.
I mean in a helpful way.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.129
Right. Well, I'm excited
to hear what you have to say.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:32.331
-Chuck, let's fire up
the first call. -(beep)

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.934
Hi, Jordan.
This is Diane from Chesterland.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.971
And I want to know why are all
the actors in Hollywood liberal?

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.407
I mean, I feel like
they're just Democratic pawns.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.876
I get the feeling
they're being told what to say,

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.012
-where to stand, how to look.
-Mm-hmm.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.447
-It's disgusting.
-Yeah.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.982
And, I mean, the whole place--
it's a liberal infestation.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.784
Hollywood? Why not Holly coal?

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:54.587
-Huh. Oh, God, that's good.
-(chuckling): Oh.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.890
-Wow. -They say conservatives
can't do comedy, right?

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:59.992
That was... She made a really,
really great point,

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.461
though, all right?

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:04.197
And it gets to something that we
have talked about on this show.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.932
-Yup.
-Is that Hollywood is scripted.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.000
It's almost like
they have people writing lines,

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.470
and then they read the lines,
and then they say the lines.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.771
Here's a funny thing.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:14.674
There's an area in New York
that you can go to.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.543
They call it SoHo. It stands
for "north of Houston."

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.479
-Okay.
-And...

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.482
And what I've seen it is,
these, uh... these libs

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.851
sell what they call
"screenplays,"

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.420
and they're actual scripts
of the words that are being said

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:29.088
in movies, in famous movies.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.157
<i> Almost Famous.</i>
 Uh,<i> The Godfather.</i>

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.658
<i> The Godfather: Part III.</i>

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:34.861
Uh, and if you flip through it,
it's the exact words

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.830
that these so-called actors,
these, uh... these human beings,

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:39.599
these liberal with their own
points of view...

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.501
It's the same words
that they say on screen.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:42.869
Hold on.
Flip through it?

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.470
Are you saying
that it's on paper

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.340
when they could put it
on an iPad and not waste paper?

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.008
Thank you. Um...

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:50.710
See, this is where
they're hypocritical, Jordan.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.545
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. -This is where
they're hypocritical.

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:53.980
Yeah, yeah, they want us

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.048
to cut up
our little six-packs of plastic

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.885
so that birds in the ocean
don't eat it and die

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.388
when birds live in the sky,
and fish live in the ocean.

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.190
(laughter)

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:05.958
It's-it's so easy
to pull this apart.

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:09.228
You pull one string, and the
whole ball of spaghetti

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.830
becomes unra...
unraveled, you know?

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.331
-It totally is.
-(applause)

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.600
Unbelievable.
Uh, let's hear our next call.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.235
-(beep)
-MAN: Hi, Jordan?

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.237
I got a bit of a problem.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.206
I hate Justin Trudeau

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.809
and all of his liberal,
long-haired ideas.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:27.914
But I also recognize
that he is a handsome man.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.483
-Yeah. -And I'm not sure
what to do about that

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:32.318
-Mm.
-because... ooh,

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:34.754
I hate him so much,
I want to kiss him!

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.124
-This is the category I call
"Oops, he's hot." -Mm-hmm.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.093
(laughter, applause)

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:43.162
You had, uh...

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.598
Obama fit in this category
for just a second, right?

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.333
-Which has stopped. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:50.136
When Obama was on the campaign
trail, I was, "Oops, he's hot."

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.738
-Mm-hmm. -And then, the second
he put his hand on the bible

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.074
and got sworn in, I was like,
"Something's not right.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:57.009
-We need to take him down."
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.011
Well, you see a man
shirtless kite-sailing,

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.214
and you're gonna have
an instinctive response.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.216
My response was,
"Oops, he's hot."

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.484
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
That's a human response.

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.553
People can have
an "Oops, he's hot" reaction.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.488
That doesn't mean
that you're gonna support them.

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.424
That doesn't mean
that you're gonna vote for them.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.226
That means
that you will eventually, uh,

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.094
probably go into a side room,

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:17.263
uh, turn off all of the lights,

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.632
uh, and try to repress
the feelings that you have,

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.901
build that into a ball of anger
and then

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.236
aim that anger at that person

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.304
that you cared about,
uh, just hours earlier.

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:27.139
It's normal.

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:30.209
Uh, but seriously,
shout-out to...

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.578
shout-out to you
because the first time

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.313
I met you, I thought,
"Oops, he's hot."

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:36.182
And to be honest,
there are times

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.450
when Jordan still does things,

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.119
and I think, "Oops, he's hot."

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:42.888
So it endures.

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:44.857
(laughter)

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.037
(laughter continues)

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.843
-Are you gonna...? -Oh,
let's get another call, Chuck.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:07.613
Jordan! This is Grace
from Northampton, Mass.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.949
-Love it. -I run
a mixed martial arts studio

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.853
for women and their dogs, and we
have this argument all the time.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:18.190
Which Founding Father would win
in a cage match melee fight?

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:20.960
I love your show.
Love you, man. Love Grace.

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.428
It's a great question.

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.897
I think obviously people are
gonna go with Abraham Lincoln.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.266
He's gangly, he's large,
he has a top hat, uh...

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:31.037
he knows to at least be
on the<i> receiving</i> end of a gun,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.973
-and so, uh...
-(laughter, groaning)

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:36.542
No, but your point is fair--
violence begets violence.

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:38.077
Exactly. Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.713
That's why, like, you know, if
you punish a kid with violence,

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.615
-they're gonna get tougher.
Uh-huh. -Yep.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.850
Uh, Andrew Jackson
is a clear one.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:47.987
Andrew Johnson, also,
a tough, uh, scrappy guy.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.356
-Yep. -Uh, Martin Van Buren,
I like him.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.259
A lot of... he... he is somebody
that doesn't get enough credit.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.995
I know... I know pneumonia
took that man down.

00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:57.730
-Uh...
-William Henry Harrison?

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:59.865
-Was that... What'd I say?
-You said Martin Van Buren.

00:04:59.898 --> 00:05:02.134
-Are you correcting me right
now? -I am correcting you.

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.870
But I have to do it
for the sanctity of this show.

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:07.473
Martin Van Buren was
the eighth president,

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:08.941
who came after Andrew Jackson,

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:11.344
-the seventh president. -Why
are you doing this right now?

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.112
Why are you doing this
right now, Tim?

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.480
'Cause I have to set
the record straight?

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:16.515
Why are you doing this?
-'Cause we have to stand atop

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:17.750
a foundation
of integrity and truth.

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:19.418
-We also create our own records.
-We have to do it.

00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:20.820
What we do is
we have our records.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.521
And the other two foundations
are anger toward the libs

00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:26.158
and knowing that the globalists
are trying to take us down.

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:28.361
So we have integrity, honesty,
anger toward the libs...

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.762
But history is written
by the winners.

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.163
...and the globalist agenda
that we hate.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:32.665
-History is... -Those are
our four founding pillars.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:34.066
-Right? -History is written
by the winners.

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.634
Just like the four presidents
that we have named:

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:37.203
Andrew Jackson,
the seventh president,

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:38.804
Martin Van Buren,
who counts as two

00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:40.940
because he's got a long name,
as the eighth president...

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.209
-Mm-hmm. -and then
William Henry Harrison,

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:46.011
who counts-- well, he probably
counts as more than two guys

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:49.248
because he's got an even longer
name than Martin Van Buren.

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.384
I'm gonna stop talking
'cause I'm leaking secrets

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.185
-about the show.
-(laughter)

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:54.920
-What the (bleep), man?
-What?

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:57.289
-What the (bleep), man?
-William Henry Harrison died

00:05:57.322 --> 00:05:58.591
after... because...

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:01.894
After 9/11, is that
what you were going to say?

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:03.562
There are some people
that say...

00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:05.331
I know there are.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:08.801
...that his pneumonia was a way
to get him out of office,

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:10.269
-Mm-hmm.
-by the Whig Party,

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:12.671
and then they put him on ice,
and then...

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:14.840
they were gonna resurrect him
at any point

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:17.109
to become the true successor
to the American crown...

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:18.677
-I mean, the presidency.
-(laughter)

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.914
Go to Tim's blog-- he has
a lot of this laid out for us.

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.183
-Yeah, that's true. -That's
all the time we have today.

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:26.852
<i> But</i> if you at home
have any questions,

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:28.821
give us a call at...

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.659
...and leave a voice mail with
your name and where you're from,

00:06:33.692 --> 00:06:35.227
and we might use it on the show.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.996
And if you'd rather e-mail,
too bad.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.665
-(laughter)
-I was... recently hacked,

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:41.901
and now I'm being cyber-bullied
by a neighborhood teen.

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:44.537
-(laughter)
-So... I had to go off the grid.
