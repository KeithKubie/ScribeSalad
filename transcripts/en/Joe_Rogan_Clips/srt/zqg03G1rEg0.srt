1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,890
The Joe Rogan experience I heard cause
a lot of vitamins in it and some iron.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,530
I can't produce anymore man.
None. They cut off my balls
do to do. I turned him in.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,150
Yeah. What did, what caused you to
turn them in? What was the final straw?

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,240
Was this movement downtown La
embarrassed at your own gender? Yeah.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,390
I went to the me too thing and I cut off
my balls and I left him there so I just,

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:25,170
I donated them if you like,
if people started calling for that,

7
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:28,590
if girls started calling for that,
guys would do it. Remove your nuts.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,320
There's guys out there
that there's a certain,

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,300
there's a certain kind of guy that
would do so many people there.

10
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:38,010
If you called for guys to step out into
the middle of the town square and cut

11
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:42,280
their own balls off, at least a couple
of guys would show up. I can name two,

12
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:43,350
two centers we live in.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,020
There's a couple of dudes I know
that would fucking do it exactly.

14
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,610
Just for like Twitter cred. Yeah,
just for some street. I just,

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,660
just for the retweets, some
love from feminists. What
this is how you are an ally.

16
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:59,460
Boys learn like my fed. Like we were
favorite like your favorite shirts.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,280
Yeah. Females kickass or what is it? A
women kick ass or whatever else. Yeah,

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,370
yeah, yeah. That whole,
the idea of like, uh, of,

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,300
of virtue signaling overt,
overt support for something.

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,600
It's so seethrough when you're like,
I'm here for you girls.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,970
It's so seethrough God,
it's such a crock of shit.

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,500
But you can feel that way without yelling
at all the time we pull you also like

23
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:26,940
broadcasting like that. Like what?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,880
What's the purpose? Yeah, that's what
I like. Why, why are you reaching out?

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,600
You're supporting, what do you
supporting? What is happening here?

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,040
It's another instance of the echo chamber
doing the whole supporting the thing

27
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:42,710
that I don't think people are really,
I talk about it on stage about the trend,

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,530
a trend,

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,060
the word trans phobic over
like I understand the meaning,

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,500
but I also think it's hyperbolized and
in essence of like there are these large

31
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,320
groups of people that are against Trans
people. I don't believe that whatsoever.

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,340
But there were definitely are.

33
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,830
I think there's small groups of
people that get a lot of attention.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,410
I don't think there's massive look. The
KKK is significantly larger of a group.

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,100
Then whatever group you want to formulate
a trans folk of transphobic nature.

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,100
I know a lot of people don't
even know what that is. Right.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,290
I haven't done any statistical research.

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,080
The company KKK members are in the United
States. There are tens of thousands.

39
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,060
Okay. How many people, what do people do?

40
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:22,500
I think a trans people religious that
don't believe in trends people or that

41
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:26,200
don't think that they should be able
to call themselves a woman. I think Mo,

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,180
I think most of those people don't care
enough to call themselves part of that

43
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,360
category. They just disagree. They go,
I don't really like it. I don't get it.

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,230
I think,

45
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,630
I think there's more of those than
there are people that are like adamantly

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,670
against trans rights.

47
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,120
I think we have to take any consideration
what we already said about God's

48
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,550
willing to cut their balls off that
there are guys like that. Sure.

49
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:48,480
There are some,
there are so many people in this country.

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,680
I guarantee you there's a lot of trans
phobic people, a lot. You listen man,

51
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:55,530
if you read the comments,
and I don't, and I didn't,

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,850
but someone told me that the
comments and the Eddie Izzard, uh,

53
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,970
Instagram posts that I made were horrific.

54
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,610
But don't you think that
is an internet fodder? See,

55
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,370
that's my thing is I think people like
to say shit on the Internet even if they

56
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,340
don't believe it, because they know
that gets attention. If they go, fuck,

57
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:12,190
this fucking dude looks like a chick
that I don't know what they said.

58
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,470
Maybe they were just making fun
of the way you look so you can,

59
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,710
you can assume what fucking people
right on the Internet about that issue.

60
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,830
They would just go, what's up with this?
Fuck. Oh, here. I'll give you an example.

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,300
I tweeted the other day about the
met gala, um, Harry styles. Uh,

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,850
I tweeted a, uh, he was wearing like a,

63
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,300
a lot of men were wearing like dresses
at the met gala. This was a whole thing.

64
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,280
And I tweeted,
um,

65
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,150
Tilda Swinton looked fire at the met gala
because he looked like Tilda Swinton.

66
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,300
Not because I'm saying like,
who's till the swimming?

67
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,150
She's a fucking actress who has short
hair, right? So, right. That was him.

68
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,160
And I said,
Tilda Swinton looked fire at the met gala.

69
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,360
Who is this gentleman pleaser?
He's a pop star. He's like part of,

70
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,900
what's it called? One direction.
He's part of one direction. What,

71
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,060
what is happening with that shirt?
That's what he wore to the back. Alice,

72
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,370
what'd you say, Jamie? It's a
blouse. Shirts versus blossoms.
Okay. Here's the thing.

73
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,040
If you go into one of those things and
you're going to stand in front of all

74
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,670
these jackasses with cameras
to take pictures of, why
not wear a fucking blouse?

75
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,080
That's what,
that's his point.

76
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,470
But I said Tilda Swinton looked fire
because when I saw the first image,

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,870
his face kind of looked like
Tilda Swinton. Okay? Of course,

78
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,570
I'm making the joke about the joke.
You're a comedian. Well, dude,

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,630
everyone was like, very funny
last night. Thank you. Thank you.

80
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,160
Everyone went after me. Everyone was like,
oh, of course you fucking, I mean, Hattie,

81
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:28,600
are you a Nazi? Well, they
say, here's my problem. They
go, um, he, I think he's gay,

82
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,630
right? Did He, is he gay,
Jamie? No, I think somebody
told me they were like alone.

83
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,100
They were like, you're, you're, you're may
you found in your sexuality. I was like,

84
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,270
I can't make fun of people
anymore for people. I said,

85
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:40,420
t he looked like Tilda fucking swim.
Why are you reading comments?

86
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,680
Because I'm not as famous as you stop
and think about the amount of people that

87
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:46,060
had their balls by,
no,

88
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,600
that would just walk into that town
square and cut their balls off to the ELA.

89
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,430
Now stop and think about those
people commenting. Yeah, I know.

90
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,100
And you're reading it and allowing
it to fuck with your head.

91
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,430
Sometimes I feed into it. A lot
of times I don't. When do you not?

92
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,900
When I'm confident in whatever I
posted. Hmm. That's interesting. Right?

93
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,080
When I like that joke,
I knew it was going to be misinterpreted.

94
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:11,980
Like I knew when I wrote that I go,
someone will misinterpret this. Who Care?

95
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,300
That's why I still posted it,
but I read some shit sometimes if I go,

96
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,610
I wonder if that was
dumb or if that was cool.
