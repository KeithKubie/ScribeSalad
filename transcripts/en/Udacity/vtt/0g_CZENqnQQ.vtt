00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.630
As we discussed, the fact that the queries

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.830
are sent over a connectionless channel and that there

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.970
is no way to authenticate the query responses, makes

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.550
the DNS vulnerable to various kinds of spoofing and

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.140
cache poisoning attacks. The fact that DNS names

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.680
are human readable does not make the DNS inherently

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.060
insecure. Nor does the fact that it's distributed. There

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.510
are certainly very well understood ways of securing distributed

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.620
systems and that does not inherently make DNS insecure.
