00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.200
 [Music playing] 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.760
 I have played video games all my life 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.080
 This is my favorite hobby 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.160
 I learned how to program computers 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.640
 And then in 2001 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.000
 We established our first video game company 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.400
 For mobile phones in Spain and we call it Microjocs 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080
 In 2013, my company purchased a large studio 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.480
 I decided with some friends 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.800
 To do something different 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.280
 Something new we set up Omnidrone 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.400
 "Titan Brawl" is a real-time strategy game 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.040
 They are MOBA 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280
 No game on a huge online battlefield 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.400
 But specifically designed for mobile devices 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.280
 The game has become as it is today 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.800
 Thanks to the demo program 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.440
 We made a lot of changes 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.160
 Through learning from the community of players 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.400
 Since we launched the game for experimental use 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.440
 The number of installations reached more than two million 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.320
 Install on Android devices 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.240
 We started the activity in the experimental use program 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.160
 When he was in his infancy 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.560
 The difference between the trial use program 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.040
 The traditional release is that users 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.880
 They give their comments to the team effectively 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.440
 So in addition to checking the standards that you have 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.120
 You are also providing possible solutions 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.240
 Ultimately the game is designed by the players 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.880
 Although there are no evaluations 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.520
 We got the players comments and it was very good 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.440
 Experimental use was a great opportunity 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.640
 For an independent and developer programmer 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.120
 It was very basic for us in Omnidrone 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040
 When we started the demo use program 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.920
 We applied it at different stages 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 So the idea was at first 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 Focus on game interaction 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.040
 And when we dealt with this aspect 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160
 We focused on the retention rate in the game 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.840
 Finally, we focused on monetization 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.560
 With the aim of providing a high value product in the market 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 Thanks to the experimental use we were able 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.880
 Increased retention rate of 41% 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.120
 Level of interaction by 50% 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.720
 Increase income by 20% 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.160
 Since the start of the program 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.320
 And even launch the game around the world 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 I am happy with my work 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.600
 In the video game industry 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 It has been my dream since I was a child 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.400
 It is really exciting that it is through Omnidrone 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.760
 We have a real chance 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.440
 To formulate and form a new era of video games. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.040
