00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.099
Now let's consider
the computational problem at hand.

00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:05.619
Given a system of three planes.

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:08.353
Can we determine their
unique intersection point?

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:11.218
As we can see doing just a few steps.

00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:14.712
The algebra is going to be a nightmare
if we try to symbolically solve for

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:15.890
the solution.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.290
Also, it's not clear how generalized any
formulas we end up with to systems and

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.080
higher dimensions, which we
eventually like to be able to solve.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.140
Instead, is there some sort of
algorithm we can follow that will

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.090
always find the solution
to a linear system?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.830
In fact, there is.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.410
The algorithm we will follow is based
on three operations that we'll apply to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.440
the equations in the system.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.950
However, before we start trying
to manipulate equations.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.430
Let's think about what sort of
manipulations would be valid.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.770
Primarily we don't want to do anything
that would change the geometry of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.910
the planes represented by the equations,
and therefore change the solutions.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.820
Also, we should be able to reverse
the operations we perform.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.050
In order to obtain the original
pair of equations.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.480
First of all,
it's certainly legal at any time to swap

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.100
the order of two
equations in the system.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.320
Since intersections of planes don't
depend on the order in which we

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.080
list them.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.810
This is perfectly fine.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.030
We don't change our solution set at all.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.650
Also, we can easily undo this operation

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.970
just by swapping the two equations
back to their original order.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.220
What's another type of
operation we could do.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.420
Well, if we have an equation and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.730
we multiply both sides of
the equation by the same number.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.770
Then the equation will stay true.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.385
However if we were to
multiply through by zero.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.740
Then the operation would
not be reversible.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.360
We would not be able to divide through
by zero to obtain the original equation.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.170
So we need to add a caveat.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.990
We can multiply an equation
by any non-zero number.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.660
Now, does this operation
preserve the solution?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.410
Yes.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.300
Multiplying through by a non-zero scalar
just multiplies the normal vector.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.360
Whose coordinates are these
coefficients, by a scalar.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.670
So we'll be pointing
in the same direction.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.040
Moreover, you can algebraically
verify that any point you select

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.880
on the original plane satisfies
the new equation and vice versa.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.660
So the two planes consist
of the same sets of points.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.720
I.e., they're the same.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.750
Also since we specify that alpha
must be a non-zero number.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.860
The operation is reversible simply by
multiplying through by one over alpha.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.280
Third, if we have two equations.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.980
We can add one equation to the other.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.800
Does this operation
preserve the solution set?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.911
Well, suppose we had a point x,

00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:37.129
y, z that was in
the intersection of two planes.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.436
In other words the point x, y,
z satisfies both of these equations.

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:46.570
Now suppose we added the first
equation to the second equation.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.400
This equation we know to be true,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.490
because it was assumed true
in the previous system.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.097
In the new second equation,
this quantity is equal to k one,

00:02:55.097 --> 00:02:57.026
because of the first equation.

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:59.192
And this quantity is equal to k two,

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:02.860
because of the second
equation from the old system.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.720
Therefore, this new
system is true as well.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.220
X, y,
z satisfies both of these equations.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.190
Therefore x, y, z is in the first
plane and in the new second plane.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.076
Which means that the point x,y,z is in
the new intersection of the two planes.

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:23.729
Since this is true for any point,
x, y, z in the old intersection.

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.601
It means that all of the points in
the old intersection are contained in

00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:29.520
the new intersection.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.390
Also, because we can easily
reverse this operation

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.420
by subtracting the first equation
from the second in the new system.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.360
This means that the new intersection
does not contain any points that weren't

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.050
in the old intersection.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.370
So the intersections are the same.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.450
So the solution is preserved.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.040
Now suppose I modified the operation.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.630
So that instead of adding just one
times the first equation to the second,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.790
I add an arbitrary amount.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.250
Alpha, times the first equation
to the second equation.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.490
Notice that the same logic I applied
earlier also holds in this case.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.400
So instead of just adding some
equation to another equation.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.270
I can add a multiple of
one equation to another.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.420
As I stated earlier, it's easy to
reverse this operation as well.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.320
We just need to add negative alpha
times the first equation to the second

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.070
equation, to get back
to the original system.
