00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 align:start position:0%
and so on 3d is the best 3d experience I
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
and so on 3d is the best 3d experience I
ever<00:00:46.079><c> had</c><00:00:46.320><c> so</c><00:00:47.250><c> and</c><00:00:47.640><c> we</c><00:00:47.789><c> saw</c><00:00:47.969><c> two</c><00:00:48.030><c> in</c><00:00:48.629><c> 3d</c><00:00:49.079><c> but</c><00:00:49.260><c> it</c>

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 align:start position:0%
ever had so and we saw two in 3d but it
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 align:start position:0%
ever had so and we saw two in 3d but it
but<00:00:49.500><c> it</c><00:00:49.620><c> wasn't</c><00:00:49.800><c> IMAX</c><00:00:50.250><c> and</c><00:00:50.370><c> that</c><00:00:50.520><c> really</c><00:00:50.910><c> does</c>

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't IMAX and that really does
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't IMAX and that really does
make<00:00:51.149><c> a</c><00:00:51.329><c> difference</c><00:00:51.449><c> so</c><00:00:51.870><c> if</c><00:00:52.320><c> they</c><00:00:52.559><c> released</c>

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 align:start position:0%
make a difference so if they released
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
make a difference so if they released
this<00:00:53.039><c> on</c><00:00:53.190><c> IMAX</c><00:00:53.489><c> which</c><00:00:54.480><c> they</c><00:00:54.600><c> might</c><00:00:54.809><c> not</c>

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 align:start position:0%
this on IMAX which they might not
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 align:start position:0%
this on IMAX which they might not
because<00:00:55.649><c> of</c><00:00:55.680><c> battle</c><00:00:56.070><c> angel</c><00:00:56.250><c> it's</c><00:00:56.489><c> like</c><00:00:56.640><c> damn</c>

because of battle angel it's like damn
it<00:00:57.140><c> but</c><00:00:58.140><c> but</c><00:00:58.289><c> if</c><00:00:58.440><c> you</c><00:00:58.829><c> can</c><00:00:58.949><c> see</c><00:00:59.100><c> it</c><00:00:59.190><c> in</c><00:00:59.280><c> 3d</c><00:00:59.489><c> I</c>

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 align:start position:0%
