00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.018
- [Mark] For any food lover,
Tsukiji Market in Tokyo

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:04.699
is an ultimate culinary paradise.

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:06.758
In this video, I'm going
to take you on an extreme

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:08.507
one-day Japanese street food tour

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:09.976
and show you some of the best things

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:13.318
to eat at Tsukiji Market,
including a huge oyster

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:16.743
and some off the beaten path
local hole in the walls.

00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:19.326
So keep watching this video
and get ready to devour

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:23.677
some of the most incredible
Japanese street food in Tokyo.

00:00:23.677 --> 00:00:27.487
(light electronic music)

00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:30.298
The first thing that I'm
gonna eat this morning,

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:33.552
it's not seafood at all, but
it's one of the most popular,

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:37.394
it's like the Tsukiji power breakfast.

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:38.599
It's one of the most legendary

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:40.265
things to eat at Tsukiji Market.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.765
(light electronic music)

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:49.341
Oh, wow, this looks amazing.

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:52.884
The first stop on the
Tsukiji food tour today

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:55.824
is a legendary stall and she serves

00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:59.991
a miso-based stew with all
types of innards and organ meat.

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:04.045
Unfortunately the Auntie
doesn't allow any photos.

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:07.518
You grab your bowl, you can
come out here and stand.

00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:08.980
They have a couple of standing

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.407
tables on the side of the road.

00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:12.990
She has one of those
classic, what looks like

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.282
eternal, bubbling pots of organ meat

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:18.707
and you can smell that miso aroma.

00:01:18.707 --> 00:01:22.259
I'm just gonna lift this bowl to my face.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.791
There's definitely some
giggly bits in here.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:27.193
There are some intestines.
There might be some tongue.

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:28.431
I don't even know what else is in here,

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:32.598
but it smells like pure
comfort, like grandma's comfort.

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:38.980
Mmmmm. Oh!

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.903
I got a definite mixture
of organ meat in that bite.

00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:49.110
It almost looks like it's gonna
be like a spicy style curry,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.393
but you can really taste
the miso flavor in that.

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:55.277
It's like reduced down miso stock,

00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:59.253
so it has a slight bean paste flavor to it

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:02.020
and they just wrap it up
with those incredibly soft,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.189
tender intestines and organ meat.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.062
If you like organ meat, wow!

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:09.729
This is a hearty breakfast here.

00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:15.977
Oh yeah, this is exactly what I

00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:18.577
needed to finish this bowl off.

00:02:18.577 --> 00:02:22.077
(light electronic music)

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:33.742
Oh, that's a little gelatinous.
It's really good though.

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:36.342
If you didn't know it was organs,

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:38.300
you would just think it's some

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.869
very tender gelatinous cuts of meat.

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.952
Goes great with hot rice.

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.689
Oh my cap. And tea.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.047
That's tasty. This place just
got really packed and busy.

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:01.825
Miso organ stew.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.199
Excuse me. Arigato.

00:03:07.114 --> 00:03:09.830
All right, that was a very
hearty way to start the morning.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.144
But that's the energy you need when

00:03:12.144 --> 00:03:13.705
you're working at Tsukiji Market

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:17.281
and you're moving fish
and giant things around.

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:21.448
You need that energy.
(light electronic music)

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:27.066
Right now we're walking around the outer,

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:29.647
this is called the outer Tsukiji Market.

00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:31.818
This is a place where they
have lots of restaurants,

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:34.100
you'll find lots of
Japanese street food here.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.768
I love how it's mixed in
with fresh produce vendors,

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:41.769
as well as lots of fish sashimi vendors.

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.537
Then if you go on the
inside of the market,

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:44.975
which is called inner Tsukiji Market,

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:46.941
that's where the actual, where you'll

00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:48.298
be able to buy the real seafood.

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:51.715
(light electronic music)

00:03:55.328 --> 00:03:56.454
Hello.
- Hello.

00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:58.062
- [Mark] What is the difference?

00:03:58.062 --> 00:03:59.110
(speaking Japanese)

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.943
- [Mark] It's all the same?

00:03:59.943 --> 00:04:01.205
- All same.
- Oh, okay.

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:04.256
Just one please. Thank you, arigato.

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:06.562
(speaking Japanese)

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:09.605
I saw the fresh sea urchin,
which in Japanese is called uni.

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:13.641
And ohh. I could not resist
passing this stall by.

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:15.630
It's within this alley, and they

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.456
just have some freshly cut spiny uni.

00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:22.820
Oh man and just that gold on the inside.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.460
You can just see, look at that texture!

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.157
You can see how creamy and how,

00:04:27.157 --> 00:04:28.615
yeah, it's just gonna be creamy.

00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:30.115
No doubt about it.

00:04:32.732 --> 00:04:36.899
Oh. Oh. All the freshness. You
don't even need to chew it.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.267
It just slides down. Oh and
it's so ice cream creamy.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.300
Mmm. It just goes down so easily.

00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:54.945
That pudding. That sea urchin pudding.

00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:01.726
(speaking Japanese)

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:08.865
Arigato.
- Oh oi.

00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:11.198
Sorry, sorry!
- That's okay.

00:05:15.077 --> 00:05:15.986
- [Mark] Thank you, sorry!

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:17.580
Another one of the
famous street food stalls

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.976
to eat at at Tsukiji
Market is the eel stall.

00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:25.313
Eel is a real delicacy in
Japan, it can be pretty pricey,

00:05:25.313 --> 00:05:28.412
so they have these little
sample skewers of grilled eel.

00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:32.053
I don't know if you saw, but
when he handed me two skewers,

00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:35.107
one of them actually, we
had a little accident.

00:05:35.107 --> 00:05:38.112
One of them literally
slipped off the skewer!

00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:41.028
That's how buttery soft it's gonna be.

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:43.472
That just increased my appetite,

00:05:43.472 --> 00:05:46.018
but it's gonna be soft and buttery.

00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:47.153
You can just how oily that is just

00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:50.070
glistening in the morning sunshine.

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:59.091
Oh yeah, oh. It's butter.
It's just so creamy.

00:06:01.516 --> 00:06:05.251
You've got like a little bit of a salty,

00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:07.623
slightly sweet sauce all over it.

00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:10.480
It's a glaze and then that just has

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.980
that roasted, slightly burnt flavor to it.

00:06:16.017 --> 00:06:19.184
That is absolutely melt-in-your-mouth.

00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:25.107
This is my kind of a Popsicle.

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:28.190
(speaking Japanese)

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:33.857
The butteryness of that eel
is just lingering in my mouth.

00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:35.779
But I am coming up on another stall here.

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.265
And I wanna get one, they
have some corn fritters

00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:42.432
and I think some type of fish
cake fritters as well here.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.213
Arigato.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:50.131
Next up, this is a stall that does

00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:52.461
all sorts of fish cake and fish paste.

00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:55.286
A lot of them, some of them look fried,

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:57.526
some of the look grilled, and they have

00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:59.946
a whole cabinet full of fish cakes.

00:06:59.946 --> 00:07:03.373
But one of their most well
known treats is this little,

00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:06.123
another popsicle looking delight,

00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:10.254
I think this is fish
cake, fish paste which is

00:07:10.254 --> 00:07:13.351
then covered in, it's just
completely caked in corn.

00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:18.029
Then, I'm actually not
sure if it's fried or what,

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:22.029
but it looks like a little
yellow ice cream bar.

00:07:28.045 --> 00:07:31.047
Oh wow. It's like, there's
just corn mixed within.

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.688
I thought the corn would
just be covering the outside,

00:07:33.688 --> 00:07:38.029
but it's really mixed within
and then the fish cake inside,

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:40.250
it's kind of spongy and it's
mot really fishy at all.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.417
It's really sweet from the sweet corn.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.788
So really the fish cake just acts

00:07:49.788 --> 00:07:52.103
to hold together all that corn.

00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:54.273
It's just packed in there with corn.

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:57.498
This could almost be
considered a sweet snack

00:07:57.498 --> 00:08:01.331
because that sweet corn
is unbelievably sweet.

00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:10.276
(light electronic music)

00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:17.640
Hi!
- Hi!

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.571
- [Mark] Hi.

00:08:18.571 --> 00:08:21.790
These little walkway alleys
around the outer Tsukiji Market

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.613
are really a food lover's
dream come true, a paradise.

00:08:24.613 --> 00:08:28.054
It really is a mixture of both
street food things to eat,

00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:31.137
ready made things to eat, and then lots of

00:08:31.137 --> 00:08:35.304
fresh ingredients as well
and you can buy just almost

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:39.565
all Japanese food
products you can imagine.

00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:41.898
It's quite a superb mix that

00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:44.780
will make any food lover excited.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.780
(speaking Japanese)

00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:00.314
Can I have one of the really big ones?

00:09:00.314 --> 00:09:02.314
- Big one?
- Yes. Please.

00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:08.392
- Thank you.
- Arigato.

00:09:10.121 --> 00:09:13.215
- This is, by far, the most giant oyster

00:09:13.215 --> 00:09:16.329
I've ever seen in my life,
and the most expensive oyster

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:19.446
I've ever bought in my
life, but it is huge!

00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:21.070
This is definitely not a one biter.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.487
This is like, they actually
give you two toothpicks

00:09:23.487 --> 00:09:26.598
because this is like a two person oyster!

00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:29.882
Just check out, this is
just insanely gigantic.

00:09:29.882 --> 00:09:32.157
I wouldn't even, if I saw
this from the outside,

00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:34.236
I wouldn't even recognize
that it's an oyster.

00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:36.612
It has like a, it's not just one of those

00:09:36.612 --> 00:09:39.072
flat shell fish looking oysters,

00:09:39.072 --> 00:09:42.034
but look at that depth on
the bottom of that shell.

00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:44.760
This is like a, probably
a circular oyster.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.927
This thing is huge and
meaty and just gigantic. Oh!

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:53.717
It's so meaty! Look at
the size of this. Wow.

00:09:54.668 --> 00:09:57.806
I'm honestly kind of
contemplating the one bite,

00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.578
but no I don't think, this
should not be attempted!

00:10:00.578 --> 00:10:04.578
This oyster should not
be attempted in one bite.

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:20.160
That's just like a mouthful of the sea.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.993
Oh. It's like a cross
between butter and jelly

00:10:25.874 --> 00:10:30.041
and just so seafoody, that
is a mouthful of the ocean.

00:10:31.963 --> 00:10:36.903
Wow, that is absurd. That
oyster is literally spreadable.

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:40.233
You could spread that
onto a piece of bread.

00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:42.636
It literally dissolves, similar to if

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:44.842
you were to take a bite of ice cream

00:10:44.842 --> 00:10:49.009
and how that just sort of melts
on the tip of your tongue.

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:55.399
That is seafood at its finest.

00:11:01.908 --> 00:11:04.241
Man! That's insane. Ooo. Oh!

00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:16.076
With that one oyster I feel
like I just ate the entire sea.

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:20.227
Wow, that was for sure the
best oyster experience,

00:11:20.227 --> 00:11:23.183
single oyster, that I've
ever experienced in my life.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.075
They have a selection of
different oysters there,

00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:28.272
all different sizes and
priced according to size,

00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:30.689
but that giant, giant oyster.

00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:33.873
That just deserved a moment of silence.

00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:36.749
Even though that's one oyster, she put on

00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:40.238
a little bit of sauce,
which I didn't even taste,

00:11:40.238 --> 00:11:42.842
but that really sums up Japanese food.

00:11:42.842 --> 00:11:46.201
The purest of the best
with little seasoning,

00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:48.082
but just focusing on the ingredients.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.584
That is Japanese food for me.

00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:54.001
(light electronic music)

00:11:55.078 --> 00:11:57.374
A lot of people come to
Tsukiji Market to eat

00:11:57.374 --> 00:12:00.548
with a priority on
their mind to eat one of

00:12:00.548 --> 00:12:04.328
the most popular, one of the
most famous Japanese foods

00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:08.398
and they have a lot of
places to choose from.

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:11.703
I'm walking over to a
place now that hopefully...

00:12:11.703 --> 00:12:15.870
yeah, let's check it out.
(light electronic music)

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.069
I've been scouting out this restaurant.

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:33.643
It's in the backstreets,
some real local backstreets

00:12:33.643 --> 00:12:37.810
of Tsukiji Market and I
found this tiny little alley.

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:44.761
Where'd that alley go? Oh here
it is! Here it is over here.

00:12:46.653 --> 00:12:50.820
And yeah, this is a tiny
little alley, but this is

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.388
the coolest route to get
to this sushi restaurant.

00:12:54.388 --> 00:12:58.302
Come on Ying! I'm sure
this is the way. Hey Micah!

00:12:58.302 --> 00:13:02.052
And you get back into
this neighborhood here,

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:07.116
and this is the house where
the sushi restaurant is in.

00:13:08.574 --> 00:13:13.444
Right here. They're open.
(speaking Japanese)

00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:15.392
- Hello.
- Thank you.

00:13:15.392 --> 00:13:16.617
- Thank you.

00:13:16.617 --> 00:13:19.342
- [Mark] Oh I am so thrilled
that we found this place.

00:13:19.342 --> 00:13:22.262
If you had a Japanese grandpa, this is

00:13:22.262 --> 00:13:23.908
the type of sushi you would get.

00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:25.892
This is just a little house place.

00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:29.514
This is definitely the
most classic heritage,

00:13:29.514 --> 00:13:33.681
just awesome, loving, you can
feel the love in this place.

00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:37.036
This is a classic little house

00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:39.191
in the back of the outer Tsukiji Market

00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:42.608
and they make just perfect looking sushi.

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:48.466
We got one large plate of sushi
and then one, the omakase,

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:51.724
so the chefs back there
just decided what to make

00:13:51.724 --> 00:13:55.544
and then one sushi
sashimi bowl Chirashi don.

00:13:55.544 --> 00:13:58.641
Wow, it looks so colorful and so,

00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:00.978
it's just oozing with freshness!

00:14:00.978 --> 00:14:03.478
I'm gonna pour some soy sauce.

00:14:06.476 --> 00:14:08.983
This is such a beautiful,
colorful plate of sushi

00:14:08.983 --> 00:14:11.014
that is absolutely stunningly gorgeous.

00:14:11.014 --> 00:14:13.327
This looks just like family style sushi.

00:14:13.327 --> 00:14:14.286
I'm gonna start with this one,

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:16.906
which I think is medium fatty tuna.

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:20.604
Just look at that, just
get a close up on that.

00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:23.322
That is pretty beyond belief.

00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:25.818
You can see how that fish
is so soft and tender

00:14:25.818 --> 00:14:29.659
that it's almost, you could
easily pull this apart.

00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:32.326
It's like little scales of fish.

00:14:40.444 --> 00:14:42.611
Oh. Oh that's insane. Mmm.

00:14:47.807 --> 00:14:51.890
Oh that fish just
disintegrates. That is so pure.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.388
Oh and it's room temperature, the rice

00:14:58.388 --> 00:15:00.472
just sort of blends with the fish.

00:15:00.472 --> 00:15:02.341
That is outrageously fresh.

00:15:02.341 --> 00:15:06.042
I'm sure they got that
fish right from the market,

00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:08.959
which is just a stone's throw away.

00:15:09.816 --> 00:15:11.343
You actually put quite
a lot of wasabi within

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:14.702
that piece of sushi underneath the fish.

00:15:14.702 --> 00:15:17.202
That is immaculate. All right.

00:15:24.243 --> 00:15:26.910
Mm hmm. That has a crunch to it.

00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:32.062
Kind of like, I think it's
some kid of a shell fish.

00:15:32.062 --> 00:15:34.312
Mmmm. Mm. That is stunning.

00:15:35.592 --> 00:15:38.681
This really just tastes like an uncle

00:15:38.681 --> 00:15:42.185
or a grandpa is serving you sushi.

00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:45.388
Wow, that is absolutely incredible.

00:15:45.388 --> 00:15:48.471
Next up I'll take a bite of the bowl.

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:54.746
Ohh. (chomping) It just melts your heart.

00:15:55.728 --> 00:15:58.895
It's the purest. The purest. The best.

00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:07.420
Ohh, it has a very light, kind
of fishy, miso broth flavor

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.724
to it with those green
onions or leeks in there.

00:16:12.724 --> 00:16:14.557
Light and really good.

00:16:18.513 --> 00:16:21.458
Mmm. That's delicious as well.

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.534
With just a thin layer
off fish on that one.

00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:27.534
Followed with ginger. Oh,
it's so complimentary.

00:16:30.187 --> 00:16:31.579
Whenever I eat sushi, I could down

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:34.579
a whole pile of that pickled ginger.

00:16:38.628 --> 00:16:42.504
Bite after bite of just extreme freshness.

00:16:42.504 --> 00:16:46.671
Ohh. That's another, a winner
of a melt-in-your-mouth bite.

00:16:47.563 --> 00:16:50.313
(baby shrieking)

00:16:53.153 --> 00:16:55.363
This is just absolutely amazing.

00:16:55.363 --> 00:16:58.030
I'm just in sushi awe right now.

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:08.456
My final bite, my final piece
of sushi came way too fast.

00:17:08.456 --> 00:17:11.855
Oh, that is some of the
freshest, some of the best,

00:17:11.855 --> 00:17:15.522
love in the sushi tasting
that I've ever had

00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:19.201
in my life and I'm down
to that final bite.

00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:20.613
I just have this little tradition where

00:17:20.613 --> 00:17:23.440
I often save the fatty
tuna belly for my last bite

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.979
just because that is
the flavor that you want

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:30.185
to linger in your mouth
for as long as possible.

00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:32.279
I don't even want to use
my chopsticks for this one.

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:35.698
I actually have this
urge to just touch it.

00:17:35.698 --> 00:17:39.820
I'm going so the fish
touches my tongue first.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.237
(light electronic music)

00:17:51.484 --> 00:17:55.986
Moment of silence. That
is Japan in one bite.

00:17:55.986 --> 00:18:00.540
That is absolutely stunning.
Okay, coming out of here now.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.123
Wow. This. Arigato!

00:18:05.498 --> 00:18:07.831
That has just given me a new

00:18:09.564 --> 00:18:12.896
ultimate perspective on family sushi.

00:18:12.896 --> 00:18:15.628
That is literally like if you were to have

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:19.500
a Japanese grandfather and
you went over to his house,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.765
he just bought fish from the fish market.

00:18:22.765 --> 00:18:24.876
He sliced it up, made sushi.

00:18:24.876 --> 00:18:27.163
That is the type of experience that

00:18:27.163 --> 00:18:30.090
that just was and that was mind blowing.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.554
I actually found that restaurant

00:18:31.554 --> 00:18:33.471
just by scanning through Google Maps.

00:18:33.471 --> 00:18:35.715
When I found that place,
I saw the photo of

00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:38.199
the dining room with
that one singular table,

00:18:38.199 --> 00:18:40.764
that old style looking table.

00:18:40.764 --> 00:18:43.250
Just from seeing the table,
I knew that's the sushi

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.092
restaurant we needed to
eat at when we came here.

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.377
It just, it was beyond my expectations.

00:18:49.377 --> 00:18:51.794
(car motors)

00:18:55.974 --> 00:18:57.171
From here we're gonna go walk around

00:18:57.171 --> 00:18:58.503
the inner market for a little bit.

00:18:58.503 --> 00:19:00.250
See some fish and some seafood.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.921
But we're here in the middle of

00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:04.099
the morning now, almost noon.

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:05.463
You gotta be careful though, so you don't

00:19:05.463 --> 00:19:09.213
get run over by one of
these little trolleys.

00:19:11.414 --> 00:19:14.562
We really did get here too
late for the fish market.

00:19:14.562 --> 00:19:16.624
There's just about nothing left.

00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:19.798
Almost everyone has packed
up, but that's okay.

00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:21.830
We got, I got a little carried away eating

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.484
in the outer market before
even making it here.

00:19:24.484 --> 00:19:27.253
That's okay, I visited the fish market

00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:28.975
the last time I came here.

00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:30.726
If you want to visit the fish market

00:19:30.726 --> 00:19:33.800
you gotta come in the
morning, even like 7 or 8am

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.043
is good to come, or
even earlier than that.

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:40.597
You'll see some gigantic
tuna and some seafood

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:43.184
like you've never seen before, ever!

00:19:43.184 --> 00:19:46.601
(light electronic music)

00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:01.150
There's this one section
of the outer market

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.674
where you come and you see everybody who's

00:20:03.674 --> 00:20:08.147
standing around has an
ice cream cone in hand.

00:20:08.147 --> 00:20:10.321
Let's have an ice cream cone!

00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:13.321
(speaking Japanese)

00:20:16.234 --> 00:20:17.510
They have a bunch of different flavors,

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.338
but one of the most common is the Matcha,

00:20:20.338 --> 00:20:22.635
the green tea powder.

00:20:22.635 --> 00:20:26.635
It looks really kind of
like a fluffy ice cream.

00:20:29.814 --> 00:20:32.925
Mmm. It's definitely green tea.

00:20:32.925 --> 00:20:35.147
And then, something
about Japanese ice cream

00:20:35.147 --> 00:20:38.826
is you can really, really
taste the milky flavor of it.

00:20:38.826 --> 00:20:42.993
It's really like, it's really
strong milky. In a good way.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.256
It's very rich, it's very creamy,

00:20:46.256 --> 00:20:49.589
and has a strong green tea flavor to it,

00:20:52.131 --> 00:20:54.327
that's good, it's actually very good.

00:20:54.327 --> 00:20:58.157
It's called Silk Ice? I
think it's called Silk Ice.

00:20:58.157 --> 00:21:01.524
(speaking Japanese)

00:21:01.524 --> 00:21:04.607
Mmm yeah. Ice cream is good for sure.

00:21:05.611 --> 00:21:07.305
- (family speaking Japanese)

00:21:07.305 --> 00:21:08.494
- [Mark] Oh okay, nice to meet you!

00:21:08.494 --> 00:21:10.049
- Nice to meet you,
we'll see you on YouTube.

00:21:10.049 --> 00:21:12.751
- Thank you! Next up,
right on this corner,

00:21:12.751 --> 00:21:15.636
right across from that ice
cream place is some of the,

00:21:15.636 --> 00:21:18.815
one of the, again it's not a seafood dish.

00:21:18.815 --> 00:21:20.756
It has nothing to do with seafood,

00:21:20.756 --> 00:21:24.512
but it is one of the most
common, popular street food,

00:21:24.512 --> 00:21:26.604
Japanese street foods next
to eat at Tsukiji Market,

00:21:26.604 --> 00:21:30.439
this outer market and it is an egg omelet.

00:21:30.439 --> 00:21:31.601
Oh yeah, he just looks like

00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:33.863
he knows how to handle an omelet.

00:21:33.863 --> 00:21:35.949
You can see how popular this snack is,

00:21:35.949 --> 00:21:39.571
they're just dishing them out enough.

00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:42.571
(speaking Japanese)

00:21:44.373 --> 00:21:45.956
Arigato.
- Arigato!

00:21:49.816 --> 00:21:51.318
- [Mark] There are probably
four or five places

00:21:51.318 --> 00:21:53.053
that serve Japanese omelets here

00:21:53.053 --> 00:21:56.144
and it's a very, very common
street food snack that

00:21:56.144 --> 00:21:58.333
you see almost everyone
walking around eating.

00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:02.955
Especially on this row
here, it's pretty cool.

00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:04.554
At this place you can see them making it.

00:22:04.554 --> 00:22:07.260
He has the square pans
and he folds up the egg.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.131
It's really an art to
make this Japanese omelet

00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:11.234
and if you look at it
closely, it almost looks like

00:22:11.234 --> 00:22:15.156
a block of a type of cheese
with those air bubbles in it,

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:16.864
but it's dense at the same time.

00:22:16.864 --> 00:22:20.062
This little custom plastic thing
is pretty cool to eat with.

00:22:20.062 --> 00:22:23.200
It's like a knife with a poker on it.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.701
You can cut off a piece, stab, and eat.

00:22:26.701 --> 00:22:29.451
Oh, look at the airiness of that.

00:22:35.442 --> 00:22:39.609
You know, I just can't fully
get into the Japanese omelet.

00:22:40.814 --> 00:22:44.231
I love Japanese food, I love the seafood.

00:22:45.402 --> 00:22:49.569
But it's kind of oddly sweet
for me, Japanese omelets.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.269
I knew this going into this
piece, I've had it before.

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:56.131
It's just not my personal favorite thing.

00:22:56.131 --> 00:22:58.794
That being said, it is kind of good.

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:02.544
This one's kind of
custardy, it's very juicy.

00:23:04.065 --> 00:23:07.898
It's almost like an egg
custard, but a omelet.

00:23:10.268 --> 00:23:13.510
Yeah, you know, I can
definitely appreciate it

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:18.428
and I like how they make it,
but this is just not my thing.

00:23:18.428 --> 00:23:21.568
He is selling some squid jerky.

00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:25.651
I'm just gonna taste a
quick piece, take a piece.

00:23:27.002 --> 00:23:29.335
Oh take it all! Squid jerky.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.333
Mmmmm. Oh yeah. That's good.

00:23:37.906 --> 00:23:41.491
That's leathery squid.
Kind of sweet and salty.

00:23:41.491 --> 00:23:45.074
(chattering in background)

00:23:47.933 --> 00:23:50.291
(speaking Japanese)

00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:51.564
Hello.
- Hello.

00:23:51.564 --> 00:23:53.314
- How much is?
- One.

00:23:54.188 --> 00:23:57.605
- [Mark] I'll have one please. Thank you.

00:24:01.624 --> 00:24:04.707
(blowtorch whirring)

00:24:21.846 --> 00:24:24.857
(speaking Japanese)
- Hot, hot, hot!

00:24:24.857 --> 00:24:29.490
- [Mark] Okay.
(speaking Japanese)

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.067
Another Japanese street
food, seafood snack

00:24:32.067 --> 00:24:36.222
that I could not resist is, it's a scallop

00:24:36.222 --> 00:24:38.594
which is diced up and
then put back in the shell

00:24:38.594 --> 00:24:40.552
and then he adds a variety of different

00:24:40.552 --> 00:24:42.399
seafood to it and then he blowtorchs it.

00:24:42.399 --> 00:24:45.800
That's the key to this and I ate here

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.386
a couple years ago when I was at

00:24:47.386 --> 00:24:49.261
Tsukiji Market and it was probably one of

00:24:49.261 --> 00:24:52.439
my favorite street food snacks that I had.

00:24:52.439 --> 00:24:54.547
Last time I had a little
surprise, it was during winter.

00:24:54.547 --> 00:24:56.019
Now it's summer in Japan.

00:24:56.019 --> 00:25:00.488
It was during winter and I had
this little creamy surprise.

00:25:00.488 --> 00:25:01.787
I didn't know what it
was when I was eating it,

00:25:01.787 --> 00:25:05.816
it turned out to be cod sperm,
which is a delicacy in Japan.

00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:07.376
I had no idea what I was eating then,

00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:10.212
but it was included on this shell.

00:25:10.212 --> 00:25:12.060
Since it's summer, I don't
think it's season now.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.425
He's included a few other things.

00:25:13.425 --> 00:25:15.936
He included some uni, which
I'm not gonna complain about

00:25:15.936 --> 00:25:17.860
and then he included a little crab claw.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.362
Oh that's just scorched
uni! Oh the sea urchin!

00:25:20.362 --> 00:25:22.113
Oh the creaminess!

00:25:22.113 --> 00:25:24.589
Okay this is a piece of the,

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:26.143
just look at the size of the shell.

00:25:26.143 --> 00:25:29.330
Look at that scallop below there.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.693
It is just so meaty and so... oh.

00:25:32.693 --> 00:25:35.745
It's gonna be amazing.
Oh ho wow. Look at that.

00:25:35.745 --> 00:25:38.078
That's like a cream topping.

00:25:42.518 --> 00:25:44.628
(chomping) Oh man.

00:25:44.628 --> 00:25:47.105
The combination of that
scallop, which is so sweet,

00:25:47.105 --> 00:25:50.335
and then that slightly
bitter seafoody sea urchin

00:25:50.335 --> 00:25:51.992
with that carmalized crust on top.

00:25:51.992 --> 00:25:55.089
I think he always serves a
scallop, but then it's kind of

00:25:55.089 --> 00:25:58.955
a seasonal mixture of seafood
that he adds on top of it.

00:25:58.955 --> 00:26:00.671
So you might get lucky
with some cod sperm,

00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:05.473
or with a little crab claw,
I got a crab claw this time.

00:26:05.473 --> 00:26:09.640
(sucking) Oh wow. Just look
at the size of this scallop.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.553
Look at that, oh! What is that?

00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:19.851
I think that's part of the scallop.

00:26:22.403 --> 00:26:25.986
Wow. That's like scallop
and, what is that?

00:26:28.868 --> 00:26:32.608
I feel like I'm starting to
turn into a seafood right now.

00:26:32.608 --> 00:26:36.775
Really exceptionally good,
extremely fresh, good quality.

00:26:38.157 --> 00:26:39.855
You know, everything is really good,

00:26:39.855 --> 00:26:43.807
but if you could just
choose one seafood treat

00:26:43.807 --> 00:26:46.069
Japanese street food snack,
that might be the one

00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:49.056
because it's a jumble,
it's a seafood jumble.

00:26:49.056 --> 00:26:51.684
The way it's sort of raw
but it's sort of cooked

00:26:51.684 --> 00:26:54.402
at the same time and the
way he blow torches it.

00:26:54.402 --> 00:26:56.712
That's a good one. That's a must eat.

00:26:56.712 --> 00:27:00.201
We're waking over to eat
at our final restaurant

00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:04.368
and this is gonna wrap up the
food tour of Tsukiji Market.

00:27:06.383 --> 00:27:09.371
Can I have one ten don?
- One ten don.

00:27:09.371 --> 00:27:12.038
- And one tempura--
- Pura A, B.

00:27:12.922 --> 00:27:15.249
Yeah?
- Yeah. Yes please.

00:27:15.249 --> 00:27:16.082
Arigato.

00:27:17.876 --> 00:27:21.787
For the final stop on this
Tsukiji Market food tour,

00:27:21.787 --> 00:27:25.113
this is a whole strip of kind of

00:27:25.113 --> 00:27:26.926
like little shop house restaurants.

00:27:26.926 --> 00:27:29.599
There's some of the most popular

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:32.548
and most well known sushi
restaurants in this area,

00:27:32.548 --> 00:27:36.472
but I've already had amazing
sushi and so I'm gonna

00:27:36.472 --> 00:27:39.473
end this food tour by
eating some fresh tempura.

00:27:39.473 --> 00:27:42.543
This is just a really small restaurant.

00:27:42.543 --> 00:27:43.857
It has a sliding door in the front

00:27:43.857 --> 00:27:46.807
and these little tiny stool chairs.

00:27:46.807 --> 00:27:49.070
Cool little place.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.221
As soon as you step in here
you can smell the aroma

00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:53.799
of the frying oil and you can
hear it cooking in the back.

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:57.049
That bubbling oil sound. Oh. Green tea.

00:28:00.975 --> 00:28:03.308
Oh that's soothing. Arigato.

00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:10.653
Wow. That is gorgeous.
It's still crackling.

00:28:12.478 --> 00:28:14.145
It's still sizzling.

00:28:15.228 --> 00:28:17.486
They do not make your
tempura until you order it,

00:28:17.486 --> 00:28:19.755
so it is hot and piping fresh.

00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:22.945
They take their time to make it perfectly

00:28:22.945 --> 00:28:27.415
and just fry it very very
fresh so it's just, oh yeah.

00:28:27.415 --> 00:28:30.052
You do wait for it and
it's gonna be worth it.

00:28:30.052 --> 00:28:33.474
Ying and I got two
different sets to share.

00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:36.998
One is the ten don, which is a rice bowl

00:28:36.998 --> 00:28:39.526
with an assortment of tempura on top.

00:28:39.526 --> 00:28:41.089
They also put the sauce
all over it already,

00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:42.200
so there's no dipping sauce.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.094
That is beautiful. Also we
got just a set of tempura.

00:28:47.094 --> 00:28:49.332
Just the mix, there's
shrimp. There's fish.

00:28:49.332 --> 00:28:52.879
There's some vegetables. It's
beautiful. It's beautiful.

00:28:52.879 --> 00:28:57.076
Look at that shrimp on
top there. Look at that!

00:28:57.076 --> 00:29:00.909
Okay, this has to be my
first bite right here.

00:29:06.038 --> 00:29:07.911
Oh, absolutely sensational.

00:29:07.911 --> 00:29:10.794
First of all, starting
with a very fresh shrimp

00:29:10.794 --> 00:29:14.095
and then it's like muscular in texture.

00:29:14.095 --> 00:29:17.584
That batter is crispy and, I don't know,

00:29:17.584 --> 00:29:21.102
it's drenched in that sauce,
which is a little bit salty,

00:29:21.102 --> 00:29:25.486
and a little bit sour,
and a little bit sweet.

00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:29.236
Oh, that's delicious.
Absolutely sensational.

00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:33.125
Oh the rice! Mmm.

00:29:35.452 --> 00:29:37.704
The rice is amazing because it's soaked

00:29:37.704 --> 00:29:40.710
up a little bit of that
oil and that sauce.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.293
Oh. What a fried treat this is.

00:29:45.523 --> 00:29:47.379
What a crunchy treat this is.

00:29:47.379 --> 00:29:51.546
Next up, could this be
eggplant? I think it's eggplant.

00:29:55.144 --> 00:29:59.023
Oh, it's hot! Oh yeah. Oh that's eggplant.

00:29:59.023 --> 00:30:02.411
It's just like melt-in-your-mouth creamy.

00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:04.593
We also got a plate of tempura and there's

00:30:04.593 --> 00:30:07.634
some shrimp on there, but I
really want to try the fish.

00:30:07.634 --> 00:30:09.664
Check that out, that's just a butterfly

00:30:09.664 --> 00:30:11.765
cut piece of fish, then deep fried.

00:30:11.765 --> 00:30:15.788
What I love is that nothing
is over deep fried, you know?

00:30:15.788 --> 00:30:19.155
The ingredients underneath that

00:30:19.155 --> 00:30:21.905
batter layer just remain perfect.

00:30:23.104 --> 00:30:27.271
(crunching)
(chomping)

00:30:31.172 --> 00:30:34.589
That's so light and fluffy. Oh delicious.

00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:39.741
It's a little bit of a
flaky fish on the inside.

00:30:41.417 --> 00:30:43.478
Let me taste some of those pickles.

00:30:43.478 --> 00:30:47.395
(crunching)
Mm. Nice and crisp.

00:30:48.267 --> 00:30:49.100
Thank you.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.841
Arigato.

00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:56.720
Okay I'm down to the final
bite. I saved a shrimp.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.158
This is going to be my final bite

00:30:59.158 --> 00:31:01.467
on this Tsukiji Japanese food tour.

00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:03.634
And what a tour it's been!

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:09.250
I'm gonna let it relax, I want to

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.485
let it relax in there for a little bit.

00:31:12.485 --> 00:31:16.139
All right. Here it goes. Final bite.

00:31:16.139 --> 00:31:19.556
(light electronic music)

00:31:29.936 --> 00:31:34.365
Mmm. And on that note, I
am tapping out. I am done.

00:31:34.365 --> 00:31:39.346
That was an amazing Tsukiji
Market Japanese food tour.

00:31:39.346 --> 00:31:43.513
We are the last ones in here,
they are closed for lunch.

00:31:44.974 --> 00:31:47.852
What a way to end this food tour!

00:31:47.852 --> 00:31:50.691
This place is legendary
for their tempura as well.

00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:52.037
That brings us to the end of this

00:31:52.037 --> 00:31:55.021
Tsukiji Market Japanese food tour extreme.

00:31:55.021 --> 00:31:57.570
There's been so much good food.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.575
I'll include everywhere that I ate,

00:32:00.575 --> 00:32:01.497
the whole list in the description

00:32:01.497 --> 00:32:03.856
box below and also you can check out

00:32:03.856 --> 00:32:06.969

00:32:09.004 --> 00:32:10.478
but really, you can
come to Tsukiji Market.

00:32:10.478 --> 00:32:12.596
There's so much to see, there's so

00:32:12.596 --> 00:32:15.253
many street food snacks to try.

00:32:15.253 --> 00:32:19.028
Especially if you love
to eat seafood of course.

00:32:19.028 --> 00:32:21.501
It's where your dreams will come alive.

00:32:21.501 --> 00:32:24.078
It's an amazing place to
visit when you're in Tokyo.

00:32:24.078 --> 00:32:26.566
One of the greatest fish
markets in the world

00:32:26.566 --> 00:32:30.367
and the restaurants surrounding
are also impressive.

00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:32.950
I am stuffed. That was amazing.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:35.854
