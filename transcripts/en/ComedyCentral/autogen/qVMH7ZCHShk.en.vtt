speed of light squared so what you're

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120
speed of light squared so what you're
 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.110

saying is e equals MC squared yeah

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120
saying is e equals MC squared yeah
 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.130

but what if we were wrong what if II did

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
but what if we were wrong what if II did

not equal MC squared well I guess that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180
not equal MC squared well I guess that

so if you could explain in the simplest

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350
so if you could explain in the simplest
 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.120
so if you could explain in the simplest

of course yeah I know it but when

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
of course yeah I know it but when
 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.290
of course yeah I know it but when
Einstein came up with that equation with

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300
Einstein came up with that equation with
 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
Einstein came up with that equation with
the basic statement he was making was

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310
the basic statement he was making was
 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.110
the basic statement he was making was
that you can get energy from mass and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
that you can get energy from mass and
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720
that you can get energy from mass and
from mass you can get energy and what

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730
from mass you can get energy and what
 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.720
from mass you can get energy and what
made those equal was see the speed of

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
made those equal was see the speed of
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.240
made those equal was see the speed of
light squared so E is equal to MC

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250
light squared so E is equal to MC
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.479
light squared so E is equal to MC

squared what if we turn this on its head
 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.170
squared what if we turn this on its head
and said what if II did not equal MC

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180
and said what if II did not equal MC
 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.960
