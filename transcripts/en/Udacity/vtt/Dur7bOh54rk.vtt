00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A great place to try out our skills with this new found tool of energy is on a roller coaster.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If you ever look at a physics book, I promised you on the chapter on conservation of energy

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you will see some problems of roller coasters.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The reason is because the energy transformations are very easy to see.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Up here, we have Isaac, Newton, and Galileo let's say and their cart isn't moving yet,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but they have a lot of potential energy because they're up high.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
As they go down that would be converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Start going up some of the kinetic energy is converted back to potential

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and so on as they go across the track.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Using what you know about the conservation of energy, could you tell me,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
assuming that there is no friction on this track, we'll get to friction later in this unit,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
"What's the fastest speed that this roller coaster will reach?", and we'll call thet Vmax.

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
