00:00:15.228 --> 00:00:18.271
There has never been a time

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:21.493
to make things as good as right now.

00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:24.438
Between what's available on the Internet,

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:26.342
like the stuff on YouTube,

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.109
the stuff on Instructables,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.492
MAKE Magazine,

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:31.614
between the quality of your teachers

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.449
who know so much

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.641
and the incredible availability of parts,

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:37.886
and tools,

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.232
and supplies,

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:42.424
there's almost nothing that you can't make,

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:44.159
almost nothing you can't make,

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.901
if you really try.

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:48.561
Now in my career, I've made a lot of stuff.

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.966
I've made telescopes,

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.201
I've made microscopes,

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:54.738
I know people who made electron microscopes.

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:56.741
I personally made flamethrowers.

00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.242
I made a four-story high trebuchet.

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:01.240
Um, I've made some really dangerous stuff.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.945
My favorite is I made a battlebot

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:04.836
when battlebots were kind of big.

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:05.855
You know, it was metal,

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:07.410
it had 20 horsepower motors,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.826
it had a carbon-tip fireman cut-off saw in the front.

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:11.375
That thing could, you know,

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.629
eat its way out of a steel room.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:17.130
I've made just so many things.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.538
But not everything you have to make

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:20.213
is dangerous to be cool.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:23.766
The point is, is that it's just fun to make stuff

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.749
and if you've got a really good idea,

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.349
you could probably do it.

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:32.966
Now, there are different styles of making things.

00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.428
There's Do It Yourself and that's like,

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.263
"Well, I'm going to fix the brakes on my car

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.730
or put siding on my house,"

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.431
and that's an interesting kind of DIY.

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.174
But there's hacking,

00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:43.303
where you take one item that's purposed for something else

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.475
and turn it into something, you know, cooler,

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:46.680
something different.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.607
There's bricolage,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.872
which means making things from found objects.

00:01:49.872 --> 00:01:51.741
There's kitting, which means you buy a kit,

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:54.314
something complicated, probably, and put it together.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.989
And there's inventing,

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.617
and inventing is the best!

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:01.221
The best kind of making things involves

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.390
not just following directions from people

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.027
who have done things before,

00:02:05.027 --> 00:02:06.459
but actually going out there,

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.430
figuring out how to make something,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.029
doing the design yourself,

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.925
and then actually building it.

00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:14.775
Now, I don't have a lot of time,

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:15.982
but I want to get you started

00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:18.836
on your own invention project, maybe.

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:21.195
So what I'm going to do live and real-time

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:23.176
and something that scares me, is,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.611
because it is live and real-time,

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.053
is I'm going to make an audio speaker

00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:29.208
out of stuff that I found in my kitchen

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:31.515
on the night before I came to New York.

00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:32.224
Okay.

00:02:32.224 --> 00:02:35.611
So what I've got here is a block of wood.

00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:40.468
I've got some sand paper.

00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:43.333
I've got some pieces of notebook paper

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:46.382
folded up into a rough "Z" shape.

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:48.837
I've got two magnets.

00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:51.554
And, I've got some wire.

00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:53.572
Now, this wire is the key part.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:57.027
The four things that I need to make my own speaker is

00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.621
a diaphragm,

00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.785
a coil,

00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:00.626
a support,

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:01.841
and a magnet.

00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.950
So first thing's first.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.966
Let's start doing it.

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:06.630
What I need to do is wind a coil.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.432
And what I'm going to do is take this wire

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:13.140
and wind an entire voice coil from it.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.666
Now, unfortunately that's going to take a really long time,

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:16.895
and I don't have much time,

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:18.904
so I'm just going to give you the flavor of it.

00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:21.299
I'm going to take 30 gauge magnet wire

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.802
and I'm just going to wrap it tightly together,

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.344
and I'm going to do about 150 turns

00:03:26.344 --> 00:03:28.973
on a 3/4 inch wooden dowel.

00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.074
Now why would I do that?

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:33.578
Because I want to get my coil to have about 4 ohms of resistance.

00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:34.522
If you don't have enough resistance,

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:36.611
you can do something bad to your amplifier.

00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:37.624
And then once that's done,

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:40.652
I'm going to glue it all together so it's nice and tight.

00:03:40.652 --> 00:03:44.319
Now I don't nearly have 150 coils there

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.574
so I made one in advance

00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:48.829
and I'm going to use that one.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:49.962
So where is it? Here it is.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.948
What I'm going to do is simply hot glue it

00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:55.016
to the back of this yogurt cup.

00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:57.936
And I had to eat a lot of yogurt while I was experimenting,

00:03:57.936 --> 00:04:01.441
so I feel like I've got all the calcium I need for a while.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.837
Now, the next thing I'm going to do

00:04:02.837 --> 00:04:06.264
is take these magnets and glue it in the center of this dot.

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:07.681
Hot glue, by the way,

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:11.410
a hot glue gun, it's the greatest maker toy you can possibly have.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.858
I don't care what the 3-D prototype guys say,

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:16.594
I love my hot glue gun!

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:17.731
What I'm going to do next

00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:20.594
is take these little "Z" stand-offs, see?

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:23.563
And I'm going to put some glue there.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.671
Look how fast that bonds!

00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:28.508
My god, this is great stuff!

00:04:28.508 --> 00:04:30.642
And I'm going to do that,

00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:32.844
and then I'm going to glue this.

00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:38.144
And I'm going to center that coil right over those magnets

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:39.609
so it's just above it.

00:04:39.609 --> 00:04:40.891
And now it's done.

00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:42.121
Now this needs to dry.

00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:44.391
So you know how Martha Stewart would take the cake

00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:46.426
out of the oven, it's pre-made?

00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:47.393
We're going to do that,

00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:49.223
we're going to go to the Martha Stewart one.

00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:51.531
So this is the one I made earlier today.

00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:53.434
And it's the yogurt cup,

00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:54.294
the stand-offs,

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.056
and everything else.

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:56.396
Well, I'm going to turn on my iPod.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.669
We'll see if we get some music.

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.084
I need a microphone.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.711
Hello? It's on, good deal.

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:11.292
So, let's play something.

00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:17.996
[Music plays.]

00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:20.141
Now this is really coming from a yogurt cup

00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:23.119
and it's kind of a neat deal.

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:24.941
Might not be your choice of music.

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:26.948
Now you can experiment with different things.

00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:28.143
In fact, I did.

00:05:28.143 --> 00:05:29.344
Last night I did this.

00:05:29.344 --> 00:05:30.445
Let me walk over here.

00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:32.579
I made all these different speakers

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:34.049
out of different things.

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:34.623
Here's one.

00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:35.450
Because I'm in New York,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.677
I made one out of a piece of matzo.

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:42.124
I made one out of a coffee cup lid.

00:05:42.124 --> 00:05:44.258
I made one out of a Tostito.

00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:46.528
The Tostito looks like a speaker, doesn't it?

00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:48.297
So, you can imagine how good that works.

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:50.364
And then last night during rehearsals

00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:51.732
they gave us some food,

00:05:51.732 --> 00:05:53.842
and they gave us these thick potato chips.

00:05:53.842 --> 00:05:55.345
You've got to hear this, you guys.

00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:59.043
This is just incredible how nice that sounds.

00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:14.856
[Music plays.]

00:06:14.856 --> 00:06:16.213
It's just incredible.

00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:18.746
So anyway, like I said,

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:20.246
today is the very best time,

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.345
this age is the very best time

00:06:22.345 --> 00:06:23.111
to be a maker.

00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:24.710
You can make so many things

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.403
if you put your mind to it.

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:27.350
Get out there,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.250
pick something up

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.951
because, I'll tell you,

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.186
the stuff you make,

00:06:31.186 --> 00:06:32.828
the stuff you make is way better

00:06:32.828 --> 00:06:33.986
than the stuff you buy.

00:06:33.986 --> 00:06:34.924
It's special,

00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:36.222
it's significant to you,

00:06:36.222 --> 00:06:37.912
and I really encourage you to do that.

00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:40.148
Thanks a lot for listening to me.
