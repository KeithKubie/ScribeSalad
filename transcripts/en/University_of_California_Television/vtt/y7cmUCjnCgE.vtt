00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:04.398
(electronic music)

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:36.190
- It is an extraordinary pleasure

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.240
to welcome professor Bart Ehrman today.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.090
Professor Ehrman burst
on the scene in 1993

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.150
with a book that was
devoured by his fans entitled

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.670
The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.400
the effect of early
Christological controversies

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.223
on the text of the New Testament.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.050
The scene was the small
scholarly community,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.623
and persons devouring this
book were persons such as me.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.523
Things by now have changed.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.080
The Colbert Report...

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.620
Fresh Air, CNN, you name it,
Bart Ehrman has spoken there.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630
He has written the books persons

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.380
like me dream about writing.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.100
When we read The DA Vinci Code and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.323
keep thinking what is going on here?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.160
I think it, he wrote it,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.680
and that is true for lots of other things.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.060
Professor Ehrman's output
has been extraordinary.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.910
He has written about Peter,
Paul, and Mary Magdalene,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.290
misquoting Jesus, truth and fiction,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.333
if there is such thing as
truth in The Da Vinci Code,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.460
and lost Christianities, which he says is,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.960
among the many children
that constitute his books,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.290
one of his favorite ones.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.330
He has also just published a book entitled

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.560
God's Problem, How the
Bible Fails to Answer

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.043
Our Most important
Question, Why We Suffer.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.570
So you know it takes a particular
passion, a really passion

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.300
to speak with such eloquence
as Professor Ehrman does

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.560
about such things as the New Testament,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760
how it came to be, and
what that really means

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.613
for those who read the text today.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.470
And today it is my great pleasure
and I'm sure you will see

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.393
what I mean with this passion,
and welcome professor Ehrman.

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.708
(applause)

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.580
- Well thank you very much for
that generous introduction.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.173
I'm really very pleased
to be with you today.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.820
As a professor of religious studies,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.110
I've always thought that
I had one of the best

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.723
conversation stoppers at a cocktail party.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.300
You are gathered around
with a group of people

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.100
whom you don't know and drinking wine,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.450
and somebody comes up and
asks oh, so what do you do?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.140
And you reply, I teach at the University.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.290
Oh, great, what do you teach?

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.653
I teach New Testament.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.703
Oh.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.880
That must be interesting.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.470
And you can see the mental file going,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.120
trying to think of a follow-up question.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.410
Well, more recently I've come
up with a better conversation

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.950
stopper, I'm at the cocktail
party and somebody comes up

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.700
to me and they say so,
what are you working on?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.930
I'm writing a book.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.100
What's it on?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.523
It's on suffering.

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:46.030
(laughter)

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.970
Oh.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.170
What are you doing next?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.192
So, suffering is one of those topics that

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.490
people as a rule don't want to talk about,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.400
but everybody has an opinion on.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.540
And I suppose it makes sense
that everybody has an opinion

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.660
about suffering, because
everybody has suffered.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.180
And everybody knows
people who have suffered,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.320
and everybody can read the
newspaper and can see what

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.973
kind of excruciating suffering
there is around the world.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.500
I published my book on God's
Problem, How the Bible Fails

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.270
to Answer our Most Important
Question, Why We Suffer,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.220
I published this book a couple
of months ago, and since then

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.750
I've gotten hundreds
of emails from people.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.120
Most of them are very well-meaning emails,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.280
and a number of them are intent

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.270
on telling me what the answer is.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.190
And so in an email of 12 lines
one can answer the problem

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.420
that has plagued the human
race since time immemorial.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.420
And I appreciate these
emails and I appreciate

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.980
the thought that goes behind
them, but one wonders,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.280
if you can really solve
the problem of suffering in

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.680
twelve lines, well, some
people think that you can.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.770
As I give talks about
suffering around the country,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.280
I am impressed by the number
of people who are sure

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.100
that they know what the
answer, the answer, is.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.560
My thinking on suffering actually

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.183
began about twenty years ago.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.210
I was teaching at the
time at Rutgers University

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.600
and they had a course on the books called

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.320
The Problem of Suffering
in the Biblical Traditions,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.540
Dealing with both Hebrew
Bible and New Testament,

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.400
and they wanted me to teach this course,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.600
and I thought it would be
a good course to teach.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.590
In part because virtually
everybody that I knew

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.890
who thought about this
issue had a set answer

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.970
to why there's suffering in the world.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.190
It's the freewill response
that sometimes I call

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.320
the robot answer, which goes like this.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.030
Human beings were given free will by God,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.330
and since human beings were
not, they weren't programmed

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.580
like robots just to obey,
they were given the ability

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.630
to obey or disobey, and since
people are free to love God

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.580
they can also, they're free to hate.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.390
And since they're free to do good,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.220
they're also free to do
evil, and so that's why

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.660
there's so much suffering
in the world, is because of

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.870
free will, or as I say,
the robot solution.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.320
And I think that in fact there's
a lot to be said for this,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.550
I mean obviously a lot of
evil in the world happens

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.000
because people have
the free will to do it.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.810
But of course it doesn't
answer everything.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.770
It doesn't answer why there
are tsunamis, and hurricanes,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.270
and earthquakes, and
other natural disasters.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.890
Free will leaves a lot of
things out of the equation,

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.180
and so I thought it'd be
interesting to teach a class

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.226
on what the Bible has
to say about suffering,

00:06:39.226 --> 00:06:41.730
and one of the things that
struck me in teaching the class

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.510
is that the Bible has a lot of
different things to say about

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.270
suffering, as it has a lot
of different things to say

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.590
about a lot of different topics.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.990
Some parts of the Bible
think that that the reason

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.370
people suffer is because they've sinned

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.400
against God, and God is punishing them.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.400
So suffering comes as a penalty
from God for wrongful acts.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.360
Other parts of the Bible
think that it's not God who's

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.190
punishing people, it is
evil forces in the world

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.140
that are opposed to God
that are punishing people.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.600
There are some parts of the
Bible that think suffering is

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.410
a test of faith, to see whether
you will remain faithful

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.790
to God even when things go bad.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.020
Some authors of the Bible
think that suffering is

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.230
a huge mystery, that we
can't ever understand why

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.340
there's suffering, and
even to ask why we suffer

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.481
is itself virtually blasphemous.

00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.580
Some authors of the Bible
simply think that chaos happens,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.710
and sometimes we get in the way.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.690
And so I thought it'd be
interesting to teach this class

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.330
at Rutgers on the problem of suffering.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.300
And to deal with, it turned
out the biggest problem I had

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.330
in my class was convincing my
19 and 20 year old New Jersey

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.621
middle upper-class white students
that there was a problem.

00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:57.964
(laughter)

00:07:57.964 --> 00:08:02.964
So this was actually in the mid 80s,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.270
it was during one of the
horrible Ethiopian famines,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.540
and I resorted to doing things
like bringing in pictures

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.640
from the New York Times
of women starving to death

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.556
with children on their
breasts starving to death,

00:08:15.556 --> 00:08:18.010
pointing my students to these pictures

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.560
and saying, this is a problem.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.510
And, well, by the end
of the semester I think

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.740
they at least got that point down.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.940
The way I set up this
class was by talking about

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.000
what is the classical
problem of suffering,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.390
which is the problem of, typically,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.750
it's a tradition called theodicy.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.570
The word theodicy comes from
two Greek words that mean

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.040
God's justice, and the
question of theodicy is

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.790
how can God be just given the
state of things in this world?

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.740
Given the pain and misery
all around us how can we

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.080
possibly think that God is just?

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.150
And often this problem
of theodicy is set up

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.300
as a kind of logical problem.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.320
The logical problem involves
three statements that are

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.950
typically made in the
Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.502
each of which seems to be
true on its own but when you

00:09:07.502 --> 00:09:10.910
put the three together, there
seems to be a contradiction.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.620
And so these are the three statements.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.073
First that God is all powerful.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.953
Second, God is all loving.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.103
Third, there is suffering.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.360
How do you reconcile
these three statements?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.280
If God is all-powerful he
can do anything he wants,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.210
including he can prevent suffering.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.790
If God's all loving he
certainly wants to prevent

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.040
suffering, he doesn't
want people to suffer.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.700
And yet they're suffering.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.850
So how does one explain all three

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.350
statements being true simultaneously?

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.486
Throughout the history
of Christian thought

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:47.530
there've been two basic approaches to

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.970
dealing with this problem of theodicy.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.650
One approach is to deny one
of the three statements.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.230
So one could deny, for example,
the God is all-powerful.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.150
This is the approach taken by
rabbi Harold Kushner in his

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.870
very popular book, When Bad
Things Happen to Good People.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.900
I used this book in my class
at Rutgers that year that

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.300
I taught this course, my
students started calling it,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.016
when bad books are written by good people.

00:10:13.016 --> 00:10:15.457
(laughter)

00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:19.160
The point of the book is that God in fact

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.120
really wants to help you when you suffer,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.113
he wishes he could prevent the suffering.

00:10:23.113 --> 00:10:25.530
He wishes there was something he could do,

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.470
but his hands are tied,
and so he can stand by you

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.220
and help you through your
suffering, and he can

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.260
comfort you in your suffering,
he can make you face

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.350
your suffering, and God is
more like, instead of the

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.820
kind of great grandfather in the sky

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.540
it's more like your mother,
your mother in the sky,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.170
who really puts her arm
around you and kind of

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.530
gets you through it, but
there's nothing he can do,

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.650
his hands are tied, he
can't prevent suffering,

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.200
so God is not all-powerful.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.680
For a lot of people that's
a satisfying solution,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.560
for other people it
doesn't really seem like

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.940
God is much of a God if
he can't do what he wants,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.120
and if he can't intervene
in the world then

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.880
in what sense is he really God?

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.340
There are other people
who want to deny the

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.620
second proposition that God is all loving.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.830
This comes very close to
the position that you find

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.780
in some of the writings of Elie Wiesel.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.810
Many people have become
reacquainted with his book, Night,

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.950
his classic, another book of
his is called God on Trial

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.180
where in effect Wiesel finds God guilty

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.860
for crimes against humanity.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.760
So that he's not loving
in any traditional sense.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.970
So one could deny the God's
all loving, or one could deny

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.897
that there's suffering, but there aren't

00:11:33.897 --> 00:11:35.820
too many people who want to go that route.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.980
Since one just needs to look
around the world a little bit.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.360
So one could deny, one way
of getting around the problem

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.050
is denying one of the three statements.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.340
Another way of getting around
it is to call on some kind of

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.520
extenuating circumstance
that can explain it all.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.940
That there's some something
that explains all three things

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.790
by bringing something
else in from the outside.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.510
For example, this idea that you're

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.360
suffering because God's punishing you.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.860
God might be all-powerful
and he might be loving,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.590
and he might be causing you to suffer

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.000
precisely in order to get
you to change your ways.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.470
And so that's an extenuating circumstance

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.490
that can make sense of suffering.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.930
Well in any event, these
were the issues that I was

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.400
dealing with in my class
at Rutgers 20 years ago.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.150
And at the time when I
finished teaching this class,

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.100
I thought, you know that
was kind of interesting,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.840
I think maybe I'd like to write about it.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.740
Then I thought, you know,
you're only 30 years old,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.680
you're not old enough to
write a book on suffering.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.500
So about three years ago I was
fishing around for the next

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.920
thing to write, I'd written
a lot of kind of things

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.470
that were on sort of a similar line.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.980
I thought you know, I
wouldn't mind going back

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.463
to that problem of suffering book.

00:12:39.463 --> 00:12:41.770
Then I thought no,
you're only 50 years old,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.690
you're too young to write the book.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.640
Then I thought you know
when I'm 80 years old,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.820
I'm gonna think, you're too
young to write the book.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.900
And so I just decided to
go and write the book,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.330
and so I did and so that's
what the book is about,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.370
is about the problem of suffering

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.120
as dealt with in the Bible, specifically.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.460
How do the authors of the
Bible deal with suffering.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.210
And the reason I think this is
an important topic is because

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.450
whatever one's view of
the Bible happens to be,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.340
whether one actually believes
in the Bible as somehow

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.370
inspired scripture or not,
for everyone the Bible is

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.970
the most important book in our history,

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.420
the history of our civilization,

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.060
without any, without parallel really.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.810
This is the most important
book, and it's worthwhile

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.660
seeing what the authors
of the Bible have to say

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.810
about this most important question.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.480
So what I'm going to do
in the rest of my lecture

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.640
is look at two of the
major answers to suffering

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.720
that one finds in the Bible.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.340
An answer that dominates the Hebrew Bible

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.730
and an answer that
dominates the New Testament.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.810
And I'm not saying that one
view, that the Hebrew Bible view

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.740
is not also found in the New
Testament, the New Testament

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.440
view not also found in the Hebrew Bible,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.920
they're actually found throughout the,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.290
but they're two views that
dominate both Testaments.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.490
And then after that I'll
talk about the view that

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.770
I find myself to be
personally most palatable.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:01.820
So first...

00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:07.790
A view that is very common
throughout the Hebrew bible

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.450
is a view that is in fact
embraced by the prophets.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.070
The prophets such as Isaiah
and Jeremiah, Ezekiel,

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.350
Hosea, Joel, Amos, all of the
prophets of the Hebrew Bible,

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.250
in fact I would argue
that all of them have

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.500
the same basic view about
why there's suffering.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.350
Specifically the prophets were concerned

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.210
why the people of God suffer.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.630
To understand what the prophets
have to say about this,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.434
I need to provide a
little bit of background.

00:14:35.434 --> 00:14:38.480
The prophets, many of
the prophets explicitly,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.720
were rooted in traditions
found in ancient Israel.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.500
That God at some point in
the past had saved Israel

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.730
from a disastrous situation
that it was experiencing,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.930
as it was enslaved to a foreign nation.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.700
This is found in the Exodus traditions

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.230
you find in the book of Exodus,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.990
the basic line is that the
children of Israel had gone into

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.600
Egypt to escape a famine, and
while there they had become

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.620
enslaved, and they served as
slaves to the Egyptians for

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.440
400 years, but God raised up
a savior for the Israelites,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.210
Moses, who performed ten
plagues against the Egyptian

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.590
pharaoh so that the pharaoh
then drove the people

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.660
out of his land and
then had second thoughts

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.110
and started chasing them,
ended up at the Red Sea,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.240
Moses parted the Red Sea, the
whole Charlton Heston thing,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.180
and the Egyptian army was
drowned, the people of Israel

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.510
were saved, and they ended
up getting the law of God on

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.170
Mount Sinai and then they
eventually got the promised land.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.350
These traditions were taken
quite seriously by many people

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:47.350
in ancient Israel, that God had
in fact intervened on behalf

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.050
of the people in order to
save them from their slavery.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.430
There were some theological implications

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.140
that were drawn by some
thinkers in ancient Israel.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.910
First that God is all-powerful,

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.490
more powerful than the
Egyptians for example.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.200
Second that God is on the side of Israel

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.380
and has chosen Israel to be his people,

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.950
and third, that God will intervene

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.130
on behalf of his people
when they get into trouble.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.020
Those were the theological implications

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.710
drawn from the Exodus tradition.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.810
As time went on, however,
there were historical problems

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.430
with these theological implications.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.830
Because if God is powerful
and on the side of Israel

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.270
and willing to intervene on
its behalf, why is it that

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.720
Israel continues to experience
one disaster after another?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.960
Drought and famine and pestilence,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.530
war, military defeat
eventually the northern part of

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.250
the Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.253
the Assyrians in the eighth century BCE.

00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:51.010
150 years later the
southern part of the kingdom

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.980
was destroyed by the Babylonians,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.520
then there were the Persians,
then there were the Greeks,

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.110
and it just went on and on.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.380
How does one explain the
fact that Israel continues

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.013
to suffer despite the fact
that God is on its side

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:05.910
and God has chosen it to be his,

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.413
to be his God and they to be his people?

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.490
The prophets of scripture had answers

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.330
to why the people of
God continued to suffer.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.350
As an example of this answer that is found

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.350
throughout the prophets,
I'll read a couple of

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.020
brief passages from the Book of Amos,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.060
one of the earliest
authors among the prophets.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.450
Amos chapter three verse
two, this is God speaking.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.450
God says to his people Israel,
'you only have I known'

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.790
'of all the families of the earth,'

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.297
'therefore I will punish
you for your iniquities.'

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.880
Why is it that Israel suffers,

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.980
because God is punishing them.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.980
That's the prophetic solution.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.590
The people have broken God's
law, God is angry with them,

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.480
and he's punishing them to get them to

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.540
turn around so that they'll repent.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.470
If they repent of their sin,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.690
then God will cause the suffering to

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.760
abate and good times will return.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.080
Amos goes on to explain that
God has created all sorts of

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.600
havoc among his people in
order to get them to repent.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.180
And so he says in chapter four,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.690
I, this is God speaking,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.690
'I gave you cleanness of teeth
in all your cities' he says.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.650
Not that he, this isn't he
invented toothpaste or something,

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.000
it means that they've had nothing to eat,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.250
cleanness of teeth, 'and lack
of bread in all your places.'

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.870
'Yet you did not return
to me says the Lord.'

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.440
In other words God created a famine.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.050
he starved people to get them to return.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.080
'I also withheld the rain from you'

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.700
'when there were three
months to the harvest.'

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.390
'I would send rain on one
city and send no rain on'

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.340
'another city, so two or three
towns wandered to another'

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.990
'town to drink water and
they were not satisfied'

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.090
'and yet you did not return
to me says the Lord'.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.650
So he created a drought,
that didn't work either.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.690
'I struck you with blight and mildew,'

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.560
'I laid waste your gardens
and your vineyards.'

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.160
'The locusts devoured your fig
trees and your olive trees'

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.487
'yet you did not return
to me says the Lord.'

00:19:14.329 --> 00:19:18.380
'I sent among you a pestilence
after the manner of Egypt.'

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.430
'I killed your young men with the sword'.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.710
This is God speaking.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.880
'I killed your young men with the sword,'

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.320
'I carried away your horses, I
made the stench of your camp'

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.660
'go up into your nostrils
yet you did not return to me'

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.590
says the Lord.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.490
'I overthrew some of you
as when God overthrew'

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.720
'Sodom and Gomorrah and yet
you did not return to me'

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.720
says the Lord, 'therefore thus
I will do to you O Israel.'

00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:48.050
'Because I will do this to you,'

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.700
'prepare to meet your God, O Israel.'

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.253
In this context meeting your
God is not a happy prospect.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.990
That is not something you want.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.090
God says, you've had it bad
so far, you've had famine

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.550
and drought and pestilence
and war, and people are dying

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.190
right and left, and now
you're really going to get it.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.070
More specifically, Amos thinks
that there's going to be

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.310
an invasion from an enemy
from the north, and the nation

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.113
is going to be wiped out
in a military defeat.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.770
Why is it that Israel is suffering?

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.010
Because God wants them
to turn back to him.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.523
They refuse, and so the
punishment continues.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.670
This is what I call the prophetic answer

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.201
to why the people of God suffer.

00:20:41.201 --> 00:20:44.610
It's a view found not
only in the prophets,

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.320
it's found throughout much of the

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.510
historical narratives of the Hebrew Bible.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.900
I mean the Bible begins of
course with Adam and Eve,

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.120
they're told not to eat the fruit,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.810
they eat the fruit, they get punished.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.790
The whole world becomes wicked,
and how does God respond?

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.570
He destroys the whole world with a flood,

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.450
killing everybody on it except
for Noah and his family.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.920
And so it goes through
the historical narrative

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.720
of the Hebrew Bible,
sin brings punishment.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.150
People suffer because they have violated

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.763
God's will, because they have sinned.

00:21:15.471 --> 00:21:19.610
One might ask whether
this is a very accept,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.730
whether this is acceptable at all as an

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.553
understanding of why people suffer.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.973
In our own context, for example,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.300
is it really true that suffering comes

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.510
because God is punishing people?

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.700
People continue to feel this way.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.870
Whenever something bad
happens and someone says,

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.170
what have I done to deserve this?

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.560
Right, well the whole
idea behind that is that

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.970
you've done something that
deserves, merits the punishment.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.270
Or when somebody says why me?

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.370
Well that implies that there's

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.140
some reason for what's happening.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.456
But is this really true?

00:21:55.456 --> 00:21:58.660
Is it true that every five
seconds a child dies of

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.563
starvation because God's
trying to punish somebody?

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.510
Or that every minute 25 people die

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.133
from drinking unclean drinking water?

00:22:09.522 --> 00:22:14.410
Every hour in our world
700 people die of malaria.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.673
Is this because God's punishing people?

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.760
Is this why tsunamis hit the Indian Ocean

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.143
and killed 300 thousand people overnight?

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.723
Or why a Holocaust happens
that kills six million Jews?

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.790
Or a purging in Cambodia
that kills two million

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.853
Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge?

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.690
We still have this answer with us today,

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.420
but I certainly don't
think that very many of us

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.430
are going to find it a
very satisfying answer,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.400
but it is surprising
how many people have it.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.960
I was on a radio show a couple months ago,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.960
I was in Lincoln, Nebraska
and I was on this radio show

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.300
with a pastor who told me that
a couple months before this,

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.930
he had a woman in his congregation whose

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:02.590
twelve-year-old daughter
had died of a brain tumor.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.410
And he was talking with this
woman and this woman told him

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.653
she knew why her daughter had died.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.810
It was because she, this
mother, had promised God that

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.953
she would quit smoking,
and she hadn't done it.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.633
And so God was punishing her.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:26.030
Well, yeah, so most of us don't
find this very satisfying,

00:23:26.352 --> 00:23:28.970
and luckily there are other answers

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.570
in the Bible besides this one.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.850
This answer which
dominates the Hebrew Bible

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.030
can be found to some extent
in the New Testament,

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.380
is one of the many answers that

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.413
biblical authors had for suffering.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.530
Another answer that I want
to look at is one that is

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.220
found in the latest book
of the Hebrew Bible,

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.760
and comes to be a very dominant
understanding among Jews

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.640
in early Judaism, and then among

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.840
Christians, the followers of Jesus.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.370
It's a response to suffering that

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.563
I'll call the apocalyptic response.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.110
The term apocalyptic first
needs to be explained.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.140
The word apocalyptic
comes from a Greek word,

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:10.140
apocalypsis, which means an
unveiling or a revealing.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.750
This view is called an
unveiling or revealing

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:17.140
because Jewish thinkers
began to think that God had

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.650
revealed to them the heavenly secrets

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.423
that can make sense of earthly realities.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.630
God had revealed the heavenly secrets

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.840
that could make sense
of earthly realities.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.700
Specifically these apocalyptic
thinkers came to understand

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.900
that suffering was not coming
as a punishment from God.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.480
Suffering was coming from other

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.950
sources in the world besides God.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:49.270
Before I explained what
the view itself is,

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.950
let me say how we have
information about this

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.513
particular view that became
prominent in early Judaism.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.850
The Book of Daniel is probably the latest

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.010
of the Hebrew Bible books to be written,

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.640
possibly 150 160 years
before the life of Jesus,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.080
and it embodies this
apocalyptic point of view,

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.110
as I'll explain in a second.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.860
Jewish Apocrypha which are
outside the traditional

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.860
Protestant canon of scripture,
the Apocrypha also contain

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.977
books that relate this view,
and the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:25:22.977 --> 00:25:26.480
which were discovered in the 1940s,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.730
also widely contain this
apocalyptic point of view.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.250
It became a view that
was dominant among Jews

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.470
in the time of the the
beginning of Christianity,

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.460
and it ended up being a view that

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.143
dominated the New Testament itself.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.173
The basic view of the
apocalyptic response is this.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:53.180
God is not causing suffering,
there are enemies of God

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.280
who are cosmic forces in the world

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.660
that are causing suffering,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.393
God has personal enemies.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:07.390
These enemies include the
Devil, and his demons.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.530
In the apocalyptic view, God has

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.790
a personal opponent, the Devil.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.890
Throughout most of the Hebrew Bible,

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.780
you don't find a devil figure at all,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.060
you don't find him in the
prophets, for example.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.550
But apocalyptic thinkers
started thinking that God had

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.270
a personal opponent who stood
over against him, the Devil,

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.680
and that just as God has angels under him,

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.358
the devil has demons under him.

00:26:31.358 --> 00:26:36.358
These forces had other had
other powers aligned with them.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.880
For example, God had the power of life

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.510
and the Devil had the power of death.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.560
God had the power of righteousness

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.790
and the devil had the power of sin.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.110
In the apocalyptic view, sin
is not simply something that

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.360
you do wrong, it's not simply
an act of disobedience.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.190
Sin for an apocalyptic Jew
is a cosmic force that's

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.060
in the world that is trying to enslave you

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.540
to force you to do things
contrary to what you want.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.310
To force you to violate God's will.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.520
The psychology of this is,
you know there are people

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.760
sometimes who just, they
do things that are against

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.120
their best interest and they
just can't stop themselves.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.340
And what is that, that you
know what the right thing to do

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.670
is and you can't do it, or you
know that something is wrong

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.170
and you just can't stop yourself.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.757
I've never had this experience myself,

00:27:25.757 --> 00:27:29.500
but I've heard that some people
have had this experience.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.800
And what is that, well
for an apocalyptic Jew

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.110
that is the power of sin
that is enslaving you

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.960
and making you do something that's wrong.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.810
So there are these cosmic
powers in the world

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.590
that are forcing you to do things wrong,

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.370
and these cosmic powers are what is

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.170
bringing suffering in the world.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.850
It's the Devil, and the demons,
and the other cosmic forces.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.720
But eventually God is going
to overthrow these forces

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.580
and bring in a good Kingdom on Earth,

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.440
in which there'll be no more suffering.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.630
There'll be no more pain or misery,

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.290
there'll be no more sin or death.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.640
That's the basic view of
the apocalyptic response,

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.880
but I want to unpack it by
explaining it in greater detail

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.880
by talking about four major
tenets of apocalyptic thinking.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.200
Four major tenants, first of all dualism.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.210
And the apocalypticists
are basically dualists,

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.870
they thought there are two
fundamental components of reality

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.600
as I pointed out these are cosmic forces.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.370
The forces of good and the forces of evil.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.630
But the thing to know
about these apocalypticists

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.530
is they thought that
everything and everybody

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.373
participates on one side or the other.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:43.100
Everybody sides either
with God or with the Devil,

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.750
either with good or with evil.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.300
So that there's no neutral territory.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.840
You have to choose which
side you're going to be on.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.840
If you side with God in this
world, you are likely going to

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.230
suffer, because the powers in control

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.380
of this world are the powers of evil.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.650
So that siding with God is not going to

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.520
make you rich and famous and prosperous.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.680
What's going to happen
if you sided with God

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.893
is the powers of evil
are going to get you.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.080
But, there's going to come a future life

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.210
in which you will be rewarded.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.290
So you have to decide which
side you're going to be on.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.080
The people who are rich and
powerful prosperous by the way,

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.090
famous people, they're
obviously on the side of evil.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.990
This is explaining why it is that

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.350
the wicked prosper and
the righteous suffer.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.730
The prophets had a hard
time explaining that.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.950
But the apocalypticists had

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.690
a very easy time explaining that.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.190
The reason the wicked prosper
is because they're on the

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:46.190
side of evil that has dominance
in this world for the time.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.880
This cosmic dualism was worked
out in a historical scenario.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.690
Apocalypticists believed
that there were two ages

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:57.650
of this world, there's this
age that we live in now,

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.065
and there's an age to come.

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:04.140
The age we're living in now
is controlled by the forces of

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.730
evil and it's just going
to get worse and worse.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.120
But God is going to
intervene, and there'll come a

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.720
cataclysmic break at the end of this age,

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.150
and God will bring in a new age.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.570
A new Kingdom.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.282
There'll be a utopian
like existence in which

00:30:20.282 --> 00:30:21.950
there will be no more pain or misery.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.990
And so you have this
age, and the age to come.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:29.500
The kingdoms of evil now and
the kingdom of God yet to come.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.080
So these these Jewish
apocalypticists were dualistic.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.780
They were pessimistic.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.170
They did not think that we could

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.150
improve our life in this world.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.700
We can't improve our lot,
we can't make things better.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.240
We can't decide which
nations to to attack in the

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.685
Middle East so as to stabilize
or destabilize the region,

00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:56.590
we can't decide to put more
cops on the beat or more

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.330
teachers in the classroom,
I mean we can do

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.470
all these things, but
it's not going to matter.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.110
Because the powers of evil
are going to increase in their

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.580
intensity and their power
until at the end of this age

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.730
literally all hell is going to break out.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.020
And there's nothing we can do to stop it,

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.893
things are going to get worse.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.740
But at the end of this age

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.270
there will be a divine vindication.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.520
God will vindicate his
name and his people,

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.570
he will redeem this world that he created,

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.120
he himself will once
again become sovereign.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.690
This vindication at the end of

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.820
this age will involve a judgment.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.120
The powers of evil will be
destroyed and taken away,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.120
and everybody who has sided
with them will face punishment.

00:31:46.462 --> 00:31:50.630
Those who are good, however,
who have sided with God,

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.020
will be given an eternal reward.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.950
An eternal reward.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:32:00.830
So there'll be a future judgment,
everybody will be judged.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.090
And when I say everybody will be judged,

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.430
I mean literally everybody.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.920
You shouldn't think that you
can side with the forces of

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.810
evil, become rich and
powerful and prosperous,

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.330
and then die and get away with it.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.860
You can't get away with it,
because at the end of this age

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.850
there's going to be a
resurrection of the dead.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:26.370
God is going to raise
everybody bodily from the dead.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.220
Everybody who's ever
lived will face judgment.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.840
You can't get away with siding with evil

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.450
and succeeding because of
it, because God's going to

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.410
raise you from the dead to face judgment,

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.840
and there's not a sweet
thing you can do to stop him.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.440
You will face either an eternal reward,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.503
or an eternal punishment,
and the choice is yours.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:52.370
Well, so I should point out
that within the history of

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:57.470
ancient Israelite thought, most
ancient Jews thought either

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.830
that when you died your soul
went to some kind of shadowy

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:04.370
place called Sheol where everybody
kind of went whether they

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.480
were good or wicked they
all sort of went there

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.920
and that's where they live forever.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.560
Other Jews thought you died and that was

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.410
the end of the story, that was it.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.670
It was only with apocalyptic
thinking that the idea

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.890
that you were going to
live forever came about.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:23.860
With apocalypticists, in a sense
immortality came into being

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.360
and immortality came into
being as a kind of theodicy.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.390
An explanation about how
things can be so rotten now.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:34.900
They're rotten now
because they're going to

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.310
be made right in the
future kingdom of God.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.790
But this was not a belief in
the immortality of the soul,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:46.430
per se, in the sense of the
soul apart from the body.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.550
Apocalypticists did not think
your soul was going to live on

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.950
after death, your body was
going to be reconstituted

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.810
and you're going to live forever bodily.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.500
This is the beginning, though,
of the idea of having some

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.070
kind of afterlife after this
death, with the resurrection of

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.560
the dead that was going to
transpire at the end of this age.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.050
Well when is the age going to end?

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.850
When will it all happen?

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.580
Jewish apocalypticists believed
it was going to be imminent.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.040
It was right around the corner.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.150
Things had gotten bad and
they were just about as bad as

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.580
they possibly could be, God
was soon going to intervene

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.530
and overthrow the forces of evil,

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.150
and set up his kingdom on earth.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.280
And when would this be?

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.970
Truly I tell you, some
of you standing here

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:35.740
will not taste death before they see

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.513
that the kingdom of God has come in power.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.633
The words of Jesus, Mark
chapter nine verse one.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.730
Or as he said later to his disciples,

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.190
this generation will not pass away

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.450
before all these things take place.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:54.190
Jesus anticipated that the end of the age

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.360
was coming within his own generation,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.470
that his disciples would live to see it,

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.253
that the kingdom of God
would arrive in power.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.540
It's not surprising that Jesus'
followers after his death

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.100
continued on with his vision,
the Apostle Paul for example

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.060
thinking that he himself would
be alive when Jesus returned.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.910
And down to the present day,
there continue to be Christians

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.970
who think that in fact the end is coming

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.953
sometime next Tuesday afternoon.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.160
This is an apocalyptic view that

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.956
the end of the age in fact is imminent.

00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:29.530
This apocalyptic view is dominant

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.230
throughout the New Testament.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.590
It predominates in the teachings of Jesus,

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.990
and in the writings of
Paul, and in most of

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.110
the writings of the New
Testament, including

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.510
of course the book of Revelation.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.970
I think that there are some
serious upsides to this

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:47.330
way of looking at suffering
and why there's suffering.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.290
This view takes evil seriously.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.690
It takes evil as a power that
is bigger than any of us.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.680
The Holocaust is bigger than the

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.340
individuals who made it happen.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:03.813
This takes evil as a very
serious phenomenon in our world.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.150
It asserts that God will eventually

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.730
make right all that is wrong.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:14.260
That is a hopeful thought,
that eventually God will

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.700
make right all that is wrong,
that evil does not have

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.340
the last word but God has the last word,

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.040
and that death is not
the end of the story.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.470
This is a view that can provide

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.433
hope in a world of hopelessness.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.310
At the same time, I think
that there are some downsides

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.810
to this point of view, one
obvious downside is that it

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.060
makes possible moral complacency

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.810
in the face of evil and suffering.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.590
If in fact things are
just going to get worse

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.200
and there's nothing we can do about it,

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.810
and they're going to get
worse and worse until God

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.943
intervenes, then what's the
point of working for justice?

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.793
Why worry about homelessness, and poverty?

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.980
Why worry about hunger?

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.620
Why worry about countries that are

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.430
falling apart and destabilizing?

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.130
Why worry about any of that,

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.295
if in fact it's only going to

00:37:09.295 --> 00:37:11.960
become better when God intervenes?

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.810
This apocalyptic view
can and has led to moral

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.140
complacency, and I think that's a problem.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.660
The other problem is, I think
sort of the obvious problem,

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.700
is that this is this view
is based on a belief,

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.450
a false belief, in the
imminent end of all things,

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.530
that everything is going
to end pretty soon.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.610
Now this may not be such
a big problem in Berkeley,

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:36.460
but let me tell you it's a
big problem in North Carolina.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.420
Where I teach, the
buckle of the Bible Belt.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.630
I moved to North Carolina in 1988.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.493
I moved there from New Jersey.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.383
Which was quite a shock.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.310
When I moved to North Carolina in 1988

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.110
I started getting phone calls
from the local newspapers.

00:37:56.248 --> 00:37:58.720
They wanted to know if it was true that

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.780
the Bible predicted that
the end of the world

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.623
was going to happen in September of 1988.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.322
I didn't know what they
were talking about,

00:38:07.322 --> 00:38:10.380
but they told me that a book
had been written that said,

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.890
indicated that the Rapture
was going to occur in 1988.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.470
Now for those of you who don't know,

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.200
the Rapture is when Jesus
comes back from heaven

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.540
and takes his believers out of this world

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.880
before the Great
Tribulation that takes place

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.020
on earth when the Antichrist arises.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.870
So the rapture is when Jesus comes back.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.950
Well, it turned out
somebody had written a book,

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.990
this guy's name was Edgar Whisenant,

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.940
and before he wrote this book he literally

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.820
was a rocket engineer for Nassau.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.050
So he was a smart guy and
he had written a book called

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:46.083
88 Reasons Why The Rapture
Will Occur in 1988.

00:38:47.147 --> 00:38:50.300
This book was taken very
seriously in North Carolina,

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:55.040
I had students whose parents
literally sold the farm

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.900
because they knew that
Jesus was coming back

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.950
and the Rapture would take place in 1988,

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.030
and this this book, this book was in,

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.100
there were 2 million copies
of this book in print,

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.560
in circulation, and was taken
very seriously in the South.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.570
He had 88 reasons why
this was going to happen

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.330
so I'll just give you one of the 88.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.640
So in Matthew's gospel,
Jesus disciples want to know

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.070
when is the end going to come?

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.180
And Jesus says learn a
lesson from the fig tree.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.550
'When the fig tree puts forth its leaves,'

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.440
'you know that summer is near.'

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.640
'So too when these things take place'

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.120
'you know that the end is near.'

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.123
'Truly I tell you this
generation will not pass away'

00:39:31.123 --> 00:39:33.860
'before all these things take place.'

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.010
So Whisenant interprets
this, this saying of Jesus,

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.640
what does it mean about the fig tree?

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.130
Well in the Bible the
fig tree is often used

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.463
as an image for the nation of Israel.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.440
When the fig tree puts forth its leaves,

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.250
well that's in the spring time,

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.610
when the fig tree has been
dead through the winter

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.930
it comes back to life in the spring.

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.250
So when does Israel come back to life?

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.870
Well Israel comes back to life in 1948,

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:02.020
when Israel again becomes
a sovereign state.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.130
This generation will not pass away

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.950
before all these things take place.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.160
How long is a generation in the Bible?

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.810
40 years.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:13.743
1948 plus 40, bingo, 1988.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.190
That was one of his 88 reasons.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.683
He had 87 others that I
won't bother you with.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.270
Jesus, the Rapture was
going to occur during the

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.840
Jewish festival of Rosh
Hashanah in September of 1988.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.800
Now some people pointed
out to Edgar Whisenant

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.060
that Jesus actually said, 'no one knows'

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.050
'the day or the hour
when the end will come'.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.310
And Whisenant was completely
un-phased by that,

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.310
he said, yes, it's true, I don't know

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.664
the day or the hour, I just know the week.

00:40:41.664 --> 00:40:44.220
(laughter)

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.090
And so it goes.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.130
Of course, what happens
of course, Rosh Hashanah

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.460
came and went and Jesus never appeared.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.290
And so Whisenant did
what people always do in

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.040
those situations, he wrote another book.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.350
And in the next book what he
said that he'd made a mistake

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.360
in his calculations because he
forgot that when they created

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.560
the modern calendar they
didn't include a year zero.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.653
So it goes from 1 BCE to 1
CE, or you know 1 BC to 1 AD,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.970
there's no year 0 and
so he was off by a year.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.960
So in fact it was going to happen in 1989.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.243
And so it goes.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.953
World without end, amen.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.840
Is there an alternative
perspective to either

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.960
the prophetic or the apocalyptic views?

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.890
Well there's a lot of different
perspectives in the Bible,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.220
I'm going to end in the
last couple minutes talking

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.240
about another view that I
personally relate to much better

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.660
than either of the preceding two.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.990
This is a view that's found
in the Hebrew Bible book

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:41.040
Ecclesiastes, one of the
books that I think is much

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.780
under read by readers of the Bible.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.722
Ecclesiastes claims to be written by

00:41:46.722 --> 00:41:50.670
King Solomon, the wisest man on earth.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.280
In fact it wasn't written by Solomon,

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.360
it was written hundreds
of years after Solomon,

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.040
but it continues I think
to be a very wise book.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.920
Ecclesiastes' view is more or less

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.200
summarized in its very opening lines.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.200
'Vanity of vanities, all is
vanity says the preacher.'

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:13.530
The word vanity in this
book, Ecclesiastes,

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.020
is a Hebrew word, hevel.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.180
Hevel is a word that is
used to refer to the mist

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.830
that's around for a little
while and then burns off.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:23.550
So it's here for a little while it's gone,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.493
it's a word that implies
transience, impermanence.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:33.431
Vanity in the sense that
there's no substance to it.

00:42:33.431 --> 00:42:36.550
The author of Ecclesiastes
looked around the world

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.360
and he saw that in fact that it was

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.330
all a very transient life that we live.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:46.510
He looked and he saw that there
was no justice in the world.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.683
The righteous suffer
and the wicked prosper.

00:42:50.683 --> 00:42:54.520
And the author of Ecclesiastes
did not think that

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.170
this problem was going to
be solved in the afterlife.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:02.870
He does not believe in the
immortality of the soul.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:07.670
He does not believe that after
you die you continue to live.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.120
For the author of Ecclesiastes,
this life is not a

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.470
dress rehearsal for something
that's going to happen later.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.700
This is not a dry run.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.010
This is it.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:24.010
This life is all we have, and
it is transient and fleeting.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.940
How then should we live this life?

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.790
We should live life as fully as we can.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.913
In the present.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.460
This life is not going to be here forever,

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.870
it's not going to be here for long,

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:42.160
and so we should enjoy what
we eat, we should enjoy

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.540
what we drink, we should enjoy
our work we should enjoy our

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.690
spouses, we should enjoy
our friends and families.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.150
We should grab life for all it can give us

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.273
because this life is all
that we're going to have.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.455
That's the view of Ecclesiastes,

00:43:57.455 --> 00:44:00.283
and it's a view that I
find most acceptable.

00:44:01.276 --> 00:44:04.120
The problem of course is that
there are a lot of people

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.320
who can't enjoy life to its fullest.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.000
People who are suffering because
of, all sorts of reasons.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.970
Because of natural disaster,
because of poverty,

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:16.443
because of homelessness.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.130
I take as an implication of
grabbing life for all that

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:25.500
we can, that we should work
in order to make life better

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:30.500
for others, so that they too
can grab life for all they can.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.253
My conclusion.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:36.990
I'm not sure at the end of
the day there's an answer to

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:40.280
suffering, or at least there
are lots of different answers,

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.160
sometimes contradictory answers.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.280
But even if we don't have
an answer to why there's

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.350
tsunamis, and hurricanes, and earthquakes,

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.150
and genocides, and
murder, and homelessness,

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.660
and poverty, even though
we don't have an answer,

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.520
I think we can have a response.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:01.600
Our response should be ourselves
personally to live life

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.950
to its fullest because
this is all we have.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:08.270
We should enjoy what we eat,
we should eat good food,

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:11.660
we should drink good wine, we
should drink microbrewed beer.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.940
We should enjoy our families.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.210
We should enjoy our friends.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.750
We should stay up late
drinking single malt scotch

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.610
and talking about the big issues.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.090
We should enjoy life as much as we can

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.950
for as long as we can.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.750
And we should also work to
make life happy and satisfying

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.440
for other people who are less
fortunate than ourselves.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.970
We all can do more, in fact.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:38.950
We can volunteer more,
we can give more money

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.050
to deal with issues of local
poverty and homelessness,

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.610
we can give more to
international relief efforts,

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.890
we can do more and we should do more,

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.350
because this life is all there is,

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.040
and we should grab for it all that we can.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.040
Thank you very much.

00:45:53.996 --> 00:45:56.246
(applause)

00:46:00.273 --> 00:46:04.430
- [Male] I have a
question which is how does

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.533
your answer solve the
problem of suffering?

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.380
In other words do you believe there is

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.403
an omnipotent, wholly benevolent deity?

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.114
- Personally I do not.

00:46:17.114 --> 00:46:19.110
- [Male] Oh I see, so nothing,

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.693
you are not presenting a theodicy, then.

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:23.363
- No.

00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:26.560
I am saying, my personal
view, what I do within my book

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.110
is to explain how in fact
this problem of suffering

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:32.400
led me away from belief in a personal,

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.400
omnipotent, powerful, loving God.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.040
So I don't personally believe
that such a being exists,

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.380
I don't believe that
there, I don't subscribe

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.130
to the Judeo-Christian
understanding of God.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.540
I think though, so that I don't have,

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.920
so I don't, my answer
to suffering is not that

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.670
God's involved with it
because I don't think

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.160
God is involved with it, I
think suffering comes because

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.000
we live in a random and chaotic world

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.942
and sometimes we get in the way of it.

00:46:56.942 --> 00:46:59.440
So that's why I say
there isn't necessarily

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.650
an answer, but there is a response.

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:04.190
- [Male] Right, so that
you've really given kind of

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.610
a historical description
of what the Bible says.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:08.443
- Yes, I'm not affirming --

00:47:08.443 --> 00:47:11.930
- [Male] But you haven't attempted
to to provide a theodicy.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.463
- No, the only, I'm not giving a theodicy

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:15.420
because I don't believe in God,

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.070
but I am saying that at
least one book of the Bible

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:20.510
seems to me to give a satisfying answer

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.660
to the relationship of
humans to suffering,

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.533
which is the book of Ecclesiastes.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.690
- [Male] And why is that satisfying,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.560
what are the criteria that make
that a satisfying response?

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.403
- It's the least problematic answer.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:35.630
- [Male] Okay, thanks.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:40.500
- [Female] I was wondering,
where do you get your morality,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.040
and how do you know
that, or just personally,

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.990
how do you know that it's
not good that people suffer,

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:49.420
so where do you get your morality

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.120
that tells you that suffering is bad?

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.560
- Yes, good, thank you,
it's a good question.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.570
You know, when I was a Christian I thought

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.560
that the only way a
person could have morality

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.210
is if there was some kind of
authority figure over them

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:05.270
telling them what was right and wrong.

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:09.803
Whether it was the church,
or your parents, or God,

00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:13.970
that God was sort of an
ultimate arbiter of morality.

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:16.060
And I was really afraid
when I was thinking,

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.170
I only became an agnostic
9 or 10 years ago.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.360
I'd been a Christian for my entire life,

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.890
and when I was reflecting
on whether I really wanted

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.940
to take that leap or not,
the one thing that held me,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.120
one of the things that held
me back is I thought that

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.080
it would lead to a life
of complete immorality.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.660
That in fact I'd become
this complete reprobate

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.840
and it would just be one
party after the other,

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.970
and I wouldn't be able
to you know (chuckles).

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.810
Then I thought well maybe
I wouldn't be so bad.

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:44.000
But no, seriously, I
thought that would happen,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.650
and it didn't happen, and I
think that I had a false belief

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:50.650
that you have to have a divine
figure giving you morality

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.130
before you know what's moral.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:55.290
My own view is that as an agnostic,

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.540
without the existence
of God, how do I decide

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.580
what's good and what's
bad, I have a fairly

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.240
traditional utilitarian view,

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.540
whatever is good for
the most people is good.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.470
Why is it that I don't
want people to suffer,

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:08.550
I don't know, I'm made that way,

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.090
I mean humans are made that way.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.320
You see somebody suffering and

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.650
you don't want them to suffer.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:14.793
So I don't have deep
philosophical reasons for it,

00:49:14.793 --> 00:49:16.690
it's just part of being human.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.490
- [Female] What do you mean
by human I'm made that way?

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.930
- Well humans are made that
way, or they evolved that way,

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.950
but they are that way.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:27.100
- Oh yeah, and one other thing
is, do you think that truth

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.290
is always based on what
makes sense to people,

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:33.879
or do you think that
truth is there despite

00:49:33.879 --> 00:49:35.680
what might not make sense or what

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.513
might not be comfortable to people?

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.960
- Well I don't believe
in a capital T truth,

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.460
I don't believe in some kind
of platonic form of truth

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.400
that's sitting up there
that we need to discover.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.960
So, I mean, I think that truth,

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.670
I don't look upon truth that way,

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.438
as some kind of objective thing
that's out there someplace.

00:49:54.438 --> 00:49:55.271
- [Female] Thank you.

00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:56.700
- You're welcome.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.990
- [Male] I'm not a
Christian anymore either,

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.030
and so the Christians that
I have sympathy for, or some

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:07.290
commonality, are the ones
that seem to read the Bible,

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:10.113
I think the Pope might even
be in this category where

00:50:10.113 --> 00:50:13.690
you just, you read it and you
don't understand all of it and

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.200
seems like there's contradictions
so you just end up saying

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.290
that it's a big mystery that
you don't quite understand.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:22.470
And I'm thinking, so I'm
curious, more specifically

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.700
I'm wondering what you
think of some of the

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.240
modern interpreters of the
Bible, modern Christians.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:32.710
I'm assuming that you
might feel that some people

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:34.820
have sort of the view that
I already said, and then

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:38.290
other people try to explain
away the contradictions.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.950
I'm wondering if CS Lewis
is maybe the type of person

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.820
who walks away from
the Bible saying, like,

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.800
oh it's very clear to me what
the response to suffering is,

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.460
where someone may be like
Gary Wills or Kierkegaard

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.040
is more of a, I'm trying
to make sense of this and

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.510
maybe this is an answer,
but it's still bigger

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:58.480
than I am and it's more of a mystery.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.049
- Right, well I mean there are a range of,

00:51:01.049 --> 00:51:02.710
there are a range of
thinkers who deal with

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.690
the problem of suffering, some of them

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.363
are more biblically oriented than others.

00:51:08.385 --> 00:51:11.520
I mean Kierkegaard wasn't
particularly biblically oriented

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.740
in the way that CS Lewis
was, and CS Lewis isn't as

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.970
particularly oriented toward
the Bible as as New Testament

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.520
interpreters are, and so
there's a whole range,

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:25.520
a whole range and I think,
you know, in my book on this

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:28.920
I'm not really dealing with issues of

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.533
philosophical approaches toward suffering.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:34.810
It's really more dealing with what

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.110
the Bible itself actually
has to say about it.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.940
- [Female] I am an atheist
as well as a revolutionary

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.730
and a communist, and I
wanted to say that I really

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:49.190
appreciated a lot of what
you said about suffering,

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:51.812
in particular that if
there were such a God,

00:51:51.812 --> 00:51:54.980
why is all this suffering happening?

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.733
I wanted to ask you a question.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:01.580
There's a new book called Away
With All Gods by Bob Avakian,

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.010
and one of the question it asks is,

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:07.110
is believing in Gods actually harmful?

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:11.100
And is believing in God and religion,

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.540
does it stand in the way
of emancipating humanity?

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.060
And it makes the point
that religion is a very

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.827
negative role, in particular because it

00:52:19.827 --> 00:52:23.420
blinds people to the
way the world really is.

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.200
I was wondering if you
could comment on that.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.510
- Yeah, thank you, I
haven't read that book,

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:29.580
somebody earlier gave me a copy,

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.975
I think a group of you all are here.

00:52:32.975 --> 00:52:35.451
(chuckles) Thank you.

00:52:35.451 --> 00:52:37.730
So I don't have anything
directly to say to that

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:39.190
'cause I haven't read the book.

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:42.860
I have read the other neo-atheists,
as they're being called,

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:47.850
Dawkins and Hitchens and
and Sam Harris, and...

00:52:48.928 --> 00:52:51.540
I think the thing that is
most disappointing to me

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.770
about these authors is that
they know very little about

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.630
religion, as a rule, and they
make claims about religion

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:03.570
that simply are sophomoric and silly.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.060
And that I think if there's
going to be a bona fide

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.820
attack on religion, it has
to be somebody who actually

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.820
understands religion, and doesn't make

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.350
claims about religion that aren't true.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.933
I mean Sam Harris acts as
if everything that's evil

00:53:14.933 --> 00:53:17.310
that has ever happened in the
world is because of religion.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.530
Well I think that's completely bogus.

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.830
I think religion in
fact does a lot of good,

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:24.670
as well as a lot of evil,
and that you can't blame

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:28.680
a religion for everything
wrong that's happened.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.910
But again I haven't read this book,

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:32.850
so I can't really comment on it.

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:35.100
- [Male] One quick comment and a question,

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.070
my comments is that if Jesus
said he's coming back soon

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:40.760
or within in this lifetime,
two thousand years later

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.310
to him showing up I think there should be

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:46.440
a statue of limitation and
which just says, forget it.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:51.050
My question, you mentioned
Exodus and Deuteronomic history,

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:54.510
in your opinion how much
of that is really history

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.630
and how much is that bunch of herdsmen

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:59.311
sit around fireplace shooting the bull?

00:53:59.311 --> 00:54:00.240
(Bart laughs)

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.540
- Okay so these are my
two choices (laughing).

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.703
I think that the,

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:10.982
I personally am skeptical
about most of the incidents

00:54:10.982 --> 00:54:14.640
narrated in Exodus and the
Deuteronomistic history.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.490
I think the later you get in
the Deuteronomistic history

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:19.990
the more you're actually getting history.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:24.820
But I am closer to those
scholars who call themselves

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.600
minimalists when it comes
to things like the Exodus.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.260
I don't really believe that
there was a parting of the

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.100
Red Sea and that the entire
Egyptian army got drowned,

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:35.320
and that that were millions of these

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.870
Israelites wandering
around the wilderness.

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.130
I just, I don't think that happened.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.480
- [Male] I really appreciate
everything you said,

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.080
but at the end you talking about kind of

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.900
the summation, about suffering.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.720
Maybe there's not an answer,
but at least there should be

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:56.720
a response, which I find
kind of agnostic in itself.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.630
If we look at the world and
the suffering that's happening

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:03.670
in the world, and where
that's coming from,

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.080
there is obviously an
answer it seems to me,

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.140
I mean you have, you know,
everybody in the world producing

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.610
everything, you have a small
group of people that are

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.410
in control of that, and
we could take care of all

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:17.270
the starving and the
people dying on thirst

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.430
and preventable diseases almost overnight.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:20.263
- Yes.

00:55:20.263 --> 00:55:23.630
- [Male] And to say that,
you know, all we can have

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:27.910
is a response to that, and not an answer,

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:32.910
seems again to go back to this
biblical understanding that

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:35.327
the poor will always be with us,

00:55:35.327 --> 00:55:39.163
and this is just human nature
and all of these other things

00:55:39.163 --> 00:55:42.730
that the Bible, and other
religions, really put forward.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.340
So it it seems to me that there's still

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:49.290
even within what you're
saying, a kind of a default

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:54.090
back to the sense of morality
which in fact belief in God,

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:58.023
belief in things unseen
and biblical in other

00:55:58.023 --> 00:55:59.913
ancient scriptures --

00:55:59.913 --> 00:56:01.570
- Yes.
- Have as a substance.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.220
- No I understand how you're
hearing me, and I think

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.660
you're not hearing me the
way I mean to be heard.

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.280
That that's not what I really mean at all.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.920
Part of our response
to suffering is in fact

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.320
to deal with just what
you're talking about.

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.180
I mean we are at a moment in history

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:20.010
when there is absolutely no reason

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.980
for there to be starvation in the world.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.210
We have more food in the world than is

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:27.470
necessary for everybody to be overweight.

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:31.310
We can solve malaria, we can
solve all sorts of things,

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:33.980
so I don't mean that we
should just be complacent

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.331
about that, I think we
in fact really, and,

00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:39.695
you know, we lack the political will.

00:56:39.695 --> 00:56:42.240
That's the only thing, we lack the

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.940
political will to do what's necessary.

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.870
So I completely agree with that,
but when I say that there's

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:51.620
no answer, I just mean in kind
of the philosophical sense.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.260
Why is there a tsunami that
kills 300 thousand people?

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.510
I mean it just doesn't,
you know for some of us,

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:01.150
it just baffles our minds, or,

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:03.530
a couple years ago there
was this earthquake

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:07.930
in the Himalayas that left,
that killed 50 thousand people

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.610
and left three million people
facing winter without shelter.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.230
And I'm not, so when I'm saying
is there an answer to that,

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:18.230
I'm saying there's no, stuff happens.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:20.057
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

00:57:20.057 --> 00:57:22.665
(applause)

00:57:22.665 --> 00:57:26.665
