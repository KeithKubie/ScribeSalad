credit card field that this is actually
 

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.540
credit card field that this is actually
a credit card field and so the way it

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.550
a credit card field and so the way it
 

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.640
a credit card field and so the way it
works is that all of your services will

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:05.650
works is that all of your services will
 

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.040
works is that all of your services will
use a bunch of heuristics or other

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.050
use a bunch of heuristics or other
 

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.840
use a bunch of heuristics or other
techniques and then will extract data

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:09.850
techniques and then will extract data
 

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.030
techniques and then will extract data
from the views to figure out what that

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:09.910
in Android oh when the autofill order
 

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.129
in Android oh when the autofill order
field capability was introduced in

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:11.139
field capability was introduced in
 

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:12.989
field capability was introduced in
Android but we found out that they're

00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:12.999
Android but we found out that they're
 

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:15.449
Android but we found out that they're
not always as granular as user may want

00:14:15.449 --> 00:14:15.459
not always as granular as user may want
 

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:17.759
not always as granular as user may want
for instance if you look at name there's

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:17.769
for instance if you look at name there's
 

00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:19.619
for instance if you look at name there's
only one in four names there's no

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:19.629
only one in four names there's no
 

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:20.910
only one in four names there's no
distinction between first name and last

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920
distinction between first name and last
 

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.470
distinction between first name and last
name for that reason we're introducing

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480
name for that reason we're introducing
 

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.989
name for that reason we're introducing
soon extended of the field hints so

00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:27.999
soon extended of the field hints so
 

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:29.730
soon extended of the field hints so
those new hints will be included in the

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:29.740
those new hints will be included in the
 

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.590
those new hints will be included in the
compatibility library and it will give

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600
compatibility library and it will give
 

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.689
compatibility library and it will give
you more control over all different kind

00:14:33.689 --> 00:14:33.699
you more control over all different kind
 

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:35.340
you more control over all different kind
of things you may want to have in your

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.350
of things you may want to have in your
 

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.799
of things you may want to have in your
application so I was talking about names

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:37.809
application so I was talking about names
 

00:14:37.809 --> 00:14:40.679
application so I was talking about names
you see we have now a greater breakdown

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:40.689
you see we have now a greater breakdown
 

00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:41.819
you see we have now a greater breakdown
of all the different names you could

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:41.829
of all the different names you could
 

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:44.220
of all the different names you could
have in your in your app as well address

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.230
have in your in your app as well address
 

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.030
have in your in your app as well address
and other other types so we saw how you

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040
and other other types so we saw how you
 

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.699
and other other types so we saw how you
can actually help other fields so she

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:50.709
can actually help other fields so she
 

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:52.410
can actually help other fields so she
has the right thing in your app however

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:52.420
has the right thing in your app however
 

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.179
has the right thing in your app however
there are cases where you actually don't

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:54.189
there are cases where you actually don't
 

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:56.460
there are cases where you actually don't
want or the field to suggest anything we

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:56.470
want or the field to suggest anything we
 

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.110
want or the field to suggest anything we
can imagine imagine you have an app

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120
can imagine imagine you have an app
 

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.210
can imagine imagine you have an app
where you have an activity to add

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:00.220
where you have an activity to add
 

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.999
where you have an activity to add
friends with their phone numbers so that

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:03.009
friends with their phone numbers so that
 

00:15:03.009 --> 00:15:04.889
friends with their phone numbers so that
activity without only one field which is

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:04.899
activity without only one field which is
 

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:06.660
activity without only one field which is
phone number when the user taps that

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:06.670
phone number when the user taps that
 

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.929
phone number when the user taps that
fields taps that field autofill might

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:09.939
fields taps that field autofill might
 

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:11.519
fields taps that field autofill might
detect it as a phone number but in that

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:11.529
detect it as a phone number but in that
 

00:15:11.529 --> 00:15:12.929
detect it as a phone number but in that
case we obviously don't want to suggest

00:15:12.929 --> 00:15:12.939
case we obviously don't want to suggest
 

00:15:12.939 --> 00:15:14.249
case we obviously don't want to suggest
the phone number as a user's phone

00:15:14.249 --> 00:15:14.259
the phone number as a user's phone
 

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:15.569
the phone number as a user's phone
number because this is for adding

exclude descendants and what that does
 

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.670
exclude descendants and what that does
is that exclude all the nodes located

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680
is that exclude all the nodes located

that means you have access to the

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160
that means you have access to the
 

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.640
that means you have access to the
backend you you're sending the director

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:18.650
backend you you're sending the director
 

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.400

do things in your apps you'll inevitably

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:12.590
do things in your apps you'll inevitably
 

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.370
do things in your apps you'll inevitably
run into the problem of abuse so we're

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:15.380
run into the problem of abuse so we're
 

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.510
run into the problem of abuse so we're
gonna cover a couple different

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520
gonna cover a couple different
 

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.270
gonna cover a couple different
categories the first is about the

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280
categories the first is about the
 

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.360
categories the first is about the
creation of illegitimate accounts so you

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:22.370
creation of illegitimate accounts so you
 

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.680
creation of illegitimate accounts so you
might have encountered this before as

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:23.690
might have encountered this before as
 

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.030
might have encountered this before as
you build an app you'll have people

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.040
you build an app you'll have people
 

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.180
you build an app you'll have people
often through automation trying to

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.190
often through automation trying to
 

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.670
often through automation trying to
create accounts at scale and there's a

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:30.680
create accounts at scale and there's a
 

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.290
create accounts at scale and there's a
variety of different tools that you are

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:32.300
variety of different tools that you are
 

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.910
variety of different tools that you are
able to use to help mitigate this

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:33.920
able to use to help mitigate this
 

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.580
able to use to help mitigate this
problem so one of the first ones that we

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:36.590
problem so one of the first ones that we
 

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.040
problem so one of the first ones that we
recommend is using a trusted identity

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.050
recommend is using a trusted identity
 

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.380
recommend is using a trusted identity
provider for your users so encouraging

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:41.390
provider for your users so encouraging
 

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:42.700
provider for your users so encouraging
people to go through something like a

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:42.710
people to go through something like a
 

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.130
people to go through something like a
sign-in with Google flow and the

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.140
sign-in with Google flow and the
 

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.050
sign-in with Google flow and the
opportunity the advantage here is that

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.060
opportunity the advantage here is that
 

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.970
opportunity the advantage here is that
these identity providers like Google

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:48.980
these identity providers like Google
 

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.370
these identity providers like Google
have done a lot of checks on their users

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:51.380
have done a lot of checks on their users
 

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.380
have done a lot of checks on their users
so in the case of Google accounts when

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:53.390
so in the case of Google accounts when
 

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.140
so in the case of Google accounts when
someone creates a new Google account we

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.150
someone creates a new Google account we
 

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.360
someone creates a new Google account we
look for all forms of automation try to

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:58.370
look for all forms of automation try to
 

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.160
look for all forms of automation try to
detect that and stop these accounts from

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.170
detect that and stop these accounts from
 

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.380
detect that and stop these accounts from
being created in the first place so what

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:02.390
being created in the first place so what
 

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:03.550
being created in the first place so what
you can do as an application developer

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:03.560
you can do as an application developer
 

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.770
you can do as an application developer
is when you see someone come in with a

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:05.780
is when you see someone come in with a
 

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.960
is when you see someone come in with a
Google sign-in account you have we will

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:07.970
Google sign-in account you have we will
 

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.420
Google sign-in account you have we will
know that this person has a been through

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:10.430
know that this person has a been through
 

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.160
know that this person has a been through
checks from Google and you're getting

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.170
checks from Google and you're getting
 

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.050
checks from Google and you're getting
those for free by just having a user use

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.060
those for free by just having a user use
 

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.020
those for free by just having a user use
these flows beyond that of course people

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.030
these flows beyond that of course people
 

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.050
these flows beyond that of course people
may sign up with other mechanisms and

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:19.060
may sign up with other mechanisms and
 

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.240
may sign up with other mechanisms and
things like verifying users phone

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:22.250
things like verifying users phone
 

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.280
things like verifying users phone
numbers or forms of payments can be

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.290
numbers or forms of payments can be
 

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.900
numbers or forms of payments can be
additional signals that you look at to

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:25.910
additional signals that you look at to
 

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.820
additional signals that you look at to
try to mitigate abuse from these types

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:27.830
try to mitigate abuse from these types
 

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.040
try to mitigate abuse from these types
of account creation now the thing to

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.050
of account creation now the thing to
 

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.050
of account creation now the thing to
keep in mind here is that adding checks

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:32.060
keep in mind here is that adding checks
 

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.060
keep in mind here is that adding checks
on people's phone numbers or forms a

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.070
on people's phone numbers or forms a
 

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.160
on people's phone numbers or forms a
payment introduced additional friction

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.170
payment introduced additional friction
 

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.690
payment introduced additional friction
into the onboarding flows you're trying

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:37.700
into the onboarding flows you're trying
 

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.490
into the onboarding flows you're trying
to build for users so you have to use

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:39.500
to build for users so you have to use
 

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.320
to build for users so you have to use
them really carefully and there's the

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:41.330
them really carefully and there's the
 

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.510
them really carefully and there's the
tools like Carlos mentioned earlier the

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520
tools like Carlos mentioned earlier the
 

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.910
tools like Carlos mentioned earlier the
SMS retriever that can help you verify

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:45.920
SMS retriever that can help you verify
 

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.410
SMS retriever that can help you verify
something like a phone number more

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:47.420
something like a phone number more
 

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.510
something like a phone number more
easily by automatically reading the

easily by automatically reading the
 

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.390
easily by automatically reading the
contents of an SMS that contains a

contents of an SMS that contains a
 

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.300
contents of an SMS that contains a
one-time code so keep that in mind when

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:55.310
one-time code so keep that in mind when
 

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.440
one-time code so keep that in mind when
you're building flows where you have to

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:56.450
you're building flows where you have to
 

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.540
you're building flows where you have to
verify additional user information and

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:58.550
verify additional user information and
 

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.780
verify additional user information and
finally there are api's on Android that

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:01.790
finally there are api's on Android that
 

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.450
finally there are api's on Android that
help you detect and prevent the usage of

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:04.460

like scripts and BOTS and let's go into
 

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.880
like scripts and BOTS and let's go into
a little bit of detail about those too

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:09.890
a little bit of detail about those too
 

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.370
a little bit of detail about those too
so the first one here is the safety net

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.380
so the first one here is the safety net
 

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.280
so the first one here is the safety net
API and so the safety net API will help

API and so the safety net API will help
 

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.350
API and so the safety net API will help
give you an assertion or an attestation

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360
give you an assertion or an attestation
 

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.130
give you an assertion or an attestation
that the user of your app is on a

legitimate real device how this works is
in calling a play services API you can

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:27.740
in calling a play services API you can
 

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.680
in calling a play services API you can
ask the device to collect a bunch of

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:29.690
ask the device to collect a bunch of
 

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.350
ask the device to collect a bunch of
information send that to Google and have

return this assertion back to your app
once you have this information you can

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:42.860
once you have this information you can
 

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.920
once you have this information you can
send it to your own server and then use

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:44.930
send it to your own server and then use
 

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.290
send it to your own server and then use
it as a signal in your own onboarding

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:47.300
it as a signal in your own onboarding
 

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.200
it as a signal in your own onboarding
flows you have positive reinforcement

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:50.210
flows you have positive reinforcement
 

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.820
flows you have positive reinforcement
that this is in fact a legitimate device

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:51.830
that this is in fact a legitimate device
 

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.310
that this is in fact a legitimate device
so if you think about it when someone is

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320
so if you think about it when someone is
 

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.590
so if you think about it when someone is
trying to create accounts at scale it

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600
trying to create accounts at scale it
 

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.510
trying to create accounts at scale it
really becomes really expensive when

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520
really becomes really expensive when
 

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.040
really becomes really expensive when
they have to have real devices in order

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.050
they have to have real devices in order
 

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.130
they have to have real devices in order
to create those accounts but sometimes

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:03.140
to create those accounts but sometimes
 

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.320
to create those accounts but sometimes
having a real device isn't enough and

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:05.330
having a real device isn't enough and
 

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.480
having a real device isn't enough and
there's another option here which is to

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:07.490
there's another option here which is to
 

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.570
there's another option here which is to
put reCAPTCHA flow into your apps now

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:10.580
put reCAPTCHA flow into your apps now
 

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.040
put reCAPTCHA flow into your apps now
again this is one that you want to use

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.050
again this is one that you want to use
 

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.020
again this is one that you want to use
judiciously because people will

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.030
judiciously because people will
 

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.150
judiciously because people will
potentially run into this when they are

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.160
potentially run into this when they are
 

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.850
potentially run into this when they are
legitimate users and this is going to

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:18.860
legitimate users and this is going to
 

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.550
legitimate users and this is going to
add additional friction for those users

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:20.560
add additional friction for those users
 

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.780
add additional friction for those users
so keep in mind that this should only be

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:22.790
so keep in mind that this should only be
 

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.640
so keep in mind that this should only be
used when you really need it when you

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:24.650
used when you really need it when you
 

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.130
used when you really need it when you
have indication that this is a risky

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:27.140
have indication that this is a risky
 

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.350
have indication that this is a risky
transaction or that there is some form

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360
transaction or that there is some form
 

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.980
transaction or that there is some form
of abuse that's happened in the past

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:31.990
of abuse that's happened in the past
 

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.140
of abuse that's happened in the past
okay with that you've hopefully created

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:35.150
okay with that you've hopefully created
 

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.910
okay with that you've hopefully created
an account that's legitimate and the

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:36.920
an account that's legitimate and the
 

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.140
an account that's legitimate and the
next problem that you'll have to go

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:38.150
next problem that you'll have to go
 

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.810
next problem that you'll have to go
through is keeping that account safe so

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:40.820
through is keeping that account safe so
 

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.330
through is keeping that account safe so
preventing bad actors from accessing

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:43.340
preventing bad actors from accessing
 

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.270
preventing bad actors from accessing
this account and stealing user data

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.280
this account and stealing user data
 

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.650
this account and stealing user data
performing transactions that could be

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:47.660
performing transactions that could be
 

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.470
performing transactions that could be
harmful to the users of your apps so for

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480
harmful to the users of your apps so for
 

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.610
harmful to the users of your apps so for
this you can use several of the

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:51.620
this you can use several of the
 

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.570
this you can use several of the
technologies that we've already

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:52.580
technologies that we've already
 

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.400
technologies that we've already
mentioned the first one that we brought

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:54.410
mentioned the first one that we brought
 

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.410
mentioned the first one that we brought
up earlier was using Google sign-in and

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:56.420
up earlier was using Google sign-in and
 

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.360
up earlier was using Google sign-in and
a trusted identity provider and this is

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:58.370
a trusted identity provider and this is
 

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.070
a trusted identity provider and this is
a great opportunity because Google does

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080
a great opportunity because Google does
 

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.930
a great opportunity because Google does
so many checks when people activate

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:01.940
so many checks when people activate
 

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.760
so many checks when people activate
their Google accounts on an Android

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:03.770
their Google accounts on an Android
 

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.740
their Google accounts on an Android
device you've probably encountered this

device you've probably encountered this
 

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.780
device you've probably encountered this
yourself that we do things like send

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:07.790
yourself that we do things like send

settings and audit where their account
 

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.150
settings and audit where their account
is active and look at a multitude of

you can leverage as a developer by

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:21.500
you can leverage as a developer by
 

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.870
you can leverage as a developer by
simply having someone go through a

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880
simply having someone go through a
 

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.580
simply having someone go through a
Google sign-in flow and have those

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:24.590

they will happily enter that into this
 

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.220
they will happily enter that into this
malicious phishing website or or app so

Android that provide resistance to
phishing and so these are api's that

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:07.950
phishing and so these are api's that
 

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.730

information to help mitigate against the
phishing problem now there's a couple of

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:22.830
phishing problem now there's a couple of
 

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.770
phishing problem now there's a couple of
different flows that this supports so

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:24.780
different flows that this supports so
 

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.450
different flows that this supports so
for example imagine you have a user

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460
for example imagine you have a user
 

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.520
for example imagine you have a user
coming to your app logging in for the

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.530
coming to your app logging in for the
 

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.020
coming to your app logging in for the
first time and then enrolling a

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.030
first time and then enrolling a
 

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.480
first time and then enrolling a
fingerprint you can really easily check

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:32.490
fingerprint you can really easily check
 

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.830
fingerprint you can really easily check
that it's that person when they come

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840
that it's that person when they come
 

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.200
that it's that person when they come

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.600
back using this flow known as local user
verification furthermore you can support

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:38.610
verification furthermore you can support
 

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.430
verification furthermore you can support
this cross device usage where someone

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440
this cross device usage where someone
 

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:40.980
this cross device usage where someone
comes back

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:40.990
comes back
 

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.860
comes back

them on this new one so there's a couple

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:50.710
them on this new one so there's a couple
 

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.049
them on this new one so there's a couple
different flows that you can support

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:52.059
different flows that you can support
 

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:53.880
different flows that you can support
here and there's a few things that you

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:53.890
here and there's a few things that you
 

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.799
here and there's a few things that you
really should keep in mind so the first

00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:55.809
really should keep in mind so the first
 

00:26:55.809 --> 00:26:58.440
really should keep in mind so the first
is about biometrics the biometrics on

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:58.450
is about biometrics the biometrics on
 

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.810
is about biometrics the biometrics on
