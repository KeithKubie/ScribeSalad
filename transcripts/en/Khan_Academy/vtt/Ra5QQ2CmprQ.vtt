00:00:00.842 --> 00:00:02.861
- When I look through
the lens, I feel like I'm

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:04.192
in a whole new universe.

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:06.982
Having a camera, I don't
know, it makes me different

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:09.046
than other people, you know? (giggling)

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:11.116
Getting that picture,
it's like you can't fake

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:14.279
that expression, you
can't fake that emotion.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.112
You know what I mean?

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:16.427
That's why I'm there.

00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:18.906
I say you know what I mean way too much.

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:21.979
(uptempo music)

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:22.967
It's for the yearbook.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:24.586
It's really hard studying for the SAT

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:26.860
because you have so many things to do.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.719
You're not gonna get
better in one sitting.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.128
You kinda have to be immersed in it.

00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:33.589
You have to use that
experienced that you've gained

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.158
over and over and over.

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:37.673
Like you're able to spot the quality

00:00:37.673 --> 00:00:42.279
in something that you do
when you care about it.

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:43.903
I'm usually like hey,
this is not good enough.

00:00:43.903 --> 00:00:48.374
I need to get better just
purely out of my own desire

00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:50.291
to do good, to do well.

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:52.925
I'll say it how I want to say it.

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:53.758
No, I'm just kidding.

00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:54.591
I'm joking.

00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.841
(upbeat hip hop music)
