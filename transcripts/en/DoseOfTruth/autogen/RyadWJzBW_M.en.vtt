line length you know so you draw two

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
line length you know so you draw two
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.820
line length you know so you draw two
lines on the board and they're the same

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
lines on the board and they're the same
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.880

one person and they say no those lines
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299
one person and they say no those lines
are different in length and you ask

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
are different in length and you ask
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.470
are different in length and you ask
another person they say well yeah

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
another person they say well yeah
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.880
another person they say well yeah
they're quite different in length and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
they're quite different in length and
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250

another person says yeah this sure I can

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
another person says yeah this sure I can
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.420
another person says yeah this sure I can
see the difference in length and then

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
see the difference in length and then
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459
see the difference in length and then
you ask the poor pigeon you know are

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
you ask the poor pigeon you know are
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.200

they different in length and he says yes
you know and you can understand why it's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
you know and you can understand why it's
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
something wrong with all of them which
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.910
something wrong with all of them which
seems unlikely or he's the victim of a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
seems unlikely or he's the victim of a
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620
seems unlikely or he's the victim of a
conspiracy which is a little on the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
conspiracy which is a little on the
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960
conspiracy which is a little on the
paranoid side but happens to actually be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
paranoid side but happens to actually be
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.830
paranoid side but happens to actually be
true in this case or he's just not

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
true in this case or he's just not
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.120

looking at it right and you might think

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
looking at it right and you might think
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160
looking at it right and you might think
well the humble thing to think is he's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
well the humble thing to think is he's
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.289
well the humble thing to think is he's
wrong and so you know the fact that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
wrong and so you know the fact that
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300
wrong and so you know the fact that
somebody might go along with the crowd

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
somebody might go along with the crowd
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.179
somebody might go along with the crowd

might be where a psychology class got

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
might be where a psychology class got
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880
might be where a psychology class got
together and decided they play a trick

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
together and decided they play a trick
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.249
together and decided they play a trick
on the professor and the trick was that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
on the professor and the trick was that
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.560
on the professor and the trick was that
he would walk back and forth they and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
he would walk back and forth they and
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569
he would walk back and forth they and
and the trick was that they wouldn't pay

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
and the trick was that they wouldn't pay
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.130
and the trick was that they wouldn't pay
any attention to him at all if he was on

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
any attention to him at all if he was on
 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.510
any attention to him at all if he was on
the left side of the room you know they

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
the left side of the room you know they
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.790
the left side of the room you know they
talked a bit and look look up and if he

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
talked a bit and look look up and if he
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.199
talked a bit and look look up and if he
was on the right side of the room then

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
was on the right side of the room then
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.710
was on the right side of the room then
they'd really focus in and pay it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
they'd really focus in and pay it
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.800
they'd really focus in and pay it
and the story goes that by the you know

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
and the story goes that by the you know
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.540
and the story goes that by the you know
by several weeks of this little trick

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550
by several weeks of this little trick
 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.100
by several weeks of this little trick
they had him like lecturing right beside

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110
they had him like lecturing right beside
 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.300
they had him like lecturing right beside
the door you know and he wouldn't move

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
the door you know and he wouldn't move
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310
the door you know and he wouldn't move
from that spot and so the reason I'm

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
from that spot and so the reason I'm
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.720
from that spot and so the reason I'm
telling you that is because it's pretty

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
telling you that is because it's pretty
 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.420
telling you that is because it's pretty
obvious that people can respond to the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430
obvious that people can respond to the
 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.730
obvious that people can respond to the
cues that a crowd is delivering you know

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740
cues that a crowd is delivering you know
 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.980
cues that a crowd is delivering you know

individuals and talk to them and they're
sort of reflective of the crowd and then

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820
sort of reflective of the crowd and then
 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.860
sort of reflective of the crowd and then
you can tell if everybody's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870
you can tell if everybody's
 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.620
