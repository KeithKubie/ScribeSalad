[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.700
LISETTE TITRE-MONTGOMERY:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.890
So I'm the art manager
at Ubisoft San Francisco,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.290
and I've been a game
developer for over 16 years.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.620
So my journey to tech
is a little different.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.120
I didn't start in
computer science,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.330
but I was drawn to tech
through my love of art.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.165
As a young child, I
was always drawing.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:28.540
In fact, I used
to get in trouble

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.190
all the time for drawing in the
back of the Bible in church.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.410
And I was always
looking for a medium

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.590
that I could find my
self-expression in.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.770
So in high school I was taking
drawing, painting, photography,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.050
pretty much anything I
could get my hands on.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.569
But it wasn't until
I saw "Toy Story,"

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:47.860
and that's when it all clicked.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.870
It was a mix of left
brain and right brain.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.679
I was always a really
strong student.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.220
However, I was always looking
for something a little bit more

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.720
challenging than
just traditional art.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.380
Shortly after
seeing "Toy Story,"

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.895
I found my bachelor's program,
and I graduated with a degree

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.280
in computer animation.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.970
And I quickly realized
that I was not

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.950
going to find the job
I wanted in Florida,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.830
so I packed up my suitcases
and the workstation

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340
I built by myself, and
I moved to California.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.080
And I was very fortunate
that I got my first job

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.870
working in games.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.130
So Freekstyle was
a motocross game.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.690
And it is, essentially,
you are riding

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.910
on these very
over-the-top tracks,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.140
and you're also trying to,
essentially, race other racers.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.430
The big challenge with this
was it was my first game.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.000
So my school training
trained me for film,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.770
but it did not train
me for game engines.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.950
So I had to really learn how to
get all of my art and content

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.174
into the game.

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:43.590
So that was a big
challenge, but I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.260
think I really fell in love with
all the technical challenges

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.090
that were involved in it.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.744
So I realized after
shipping Freekstyle,

00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:54.410
that if I was going
to really make games

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.360
I needed to go the best
place to do it at the time.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.250
And that was EA.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.680
So I got hired as a
senior artist at EA,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.270
and my first game
was Tiger Woods 2006.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.090
It was also a launch
title for the PS3

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.284
and the 360, which means we kind
of knew what the specs were,

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:13.700
but we didn't have
final hardware.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.670
And we had to figure all
this out in time to launch.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.470
So a lot of the challenges
with Tiger Woods

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.970
was trying to figure
out how to get clothing

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.080
to animate without having
dynamic cloth simulation,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
and also how to make realistic
African-American skin

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.520
and hair with all of the
new processing and power we

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.480
had with the new technology.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.350
So I really focused on trying
to make Tiger Woods's skin

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.220
look great.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.530
And I even went as far as
to go to the weave shop,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.360
buy weaves and
braids, and scan them

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.250
in so that we had
accurate representation

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.570
of African-American hair.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.037
After Tiger Woods
was the Simpsons.

00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:50.620
So the big challenge
with the Simpsons

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.690
is that we were working
on a 2D show on a 3D game.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.440
So we had a 3D open
world space and we

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.300
need it to feel like
the town of Springfield.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.550
And we especially needed the
characters to stay on model.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.510
So for example, Lisa,
that you see here,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.490
she needed to look
exactly like she

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.060
would in the show at any
possible model, and any angle

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.610
that the camera could-- that
the user could set the camera.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.710
So I literally
spent a [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.790
shaping Lisa's hair from
every possible camera angle

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.412
that the user could place it.

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.870
So it was a huge challenge,
but it was a very well-received

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.780
product.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.420
So my next challenge
was Dante's Inferno.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.640
And Dante's Inferno, just
like the classic story,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.440
is based on hell.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.350
So you're journeying through the
nine different circles of hell

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.550
through this game.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.110
And working on this game
kind of felt like that.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.090
This was the first time we
use distributed development.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.390
So this was 2008 at the time.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.670
So we didn't have Slack,
we didn't have Skype,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.650
we didn't have video chatting.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.442
It was me working with a
team in China over email,

00:03:56.442 --> 00:03:58.900
and trying to tell a team of
artists what they needed to do

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.006
to get the game in the engine.

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:02.130
So it was a huge challenge.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.350
And we were also trying to get
all this content in the game

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.640
with a smaller team.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.100
So I had to learn how to do
lighting and special effects

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.470
and get all this
content in the game.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.095
And it came out very well.

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:13.970
It was well-received.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.950
And it was one of
the first games

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.831
to actually get a
Super Bowl commercial.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.590
So after shipping
Dante's, I decided

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.240
I wanted to work at
a different studio,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.740
so I went to Backbone
Entertainment.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.500
And Backbone Entertainment had
a relationship with Harmonics.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.360
And Harmonics develops
Dance Central 3.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.090
So the big challenge
with Dance Central 3

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.580
was actually designing a game
for players who are in motion.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.180
So you use the Kinect in
order to execute the moves

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.860
that you do onstage.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.489
So while you're in
motion, you have

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:44.280
to figure out where
you are, whether you're

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.980
executing the moves
properly, and also

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.560
whether you are scoring up.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.380
So we had to develop
technical ways and visual ways

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.850
to communicate to the player.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.890
So something as simple
as a character's texture

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.430
on their clothing, if it was
too small, it would be blurry,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.830
and it could literally make
a player miss the beat.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.070
We also had to find ways to
communicate to the player

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.330
that they were doing well.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.910
And we couldn't rely on
our usual techniques,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.580
which is a small button at
the bottom or a health bar.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.920
So we literally designed the
environments to give feedback.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.310
So as you are doing well,
the world would light up,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.610
and the whole scene would
function like an equalizer.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.610
So we had to use very, very
unique design challenges

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.560
and use those techniques to
communicate to the player.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.187
So my current challenge
is South Park.

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:34.020
I'm working on the next
sequel to South Park

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.995
called South Park, the
Fractured Butthole.

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:39.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.350
And our challenge
with this product

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.870
is actually eliciting
an involuntary response

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.820
from the player,
which is laughter.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.714
How do you use game mechanics
to make someone laugh?

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:50.630
And that's our big
challenge for this product,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.255
and we're having a
great time doing it.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.735
So along my journey as a
developer over 16 years,

00:05:57.735 --> 00:06:00.110
it's been very apparent to me
there are not enough people

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.610
of color in the industry.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.275
And I was always a little
bewildered about this.

00:06:04.275 --> 00:06:06.650
And it wasn't until I got the
cover of "Black Enterprise"

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.950
that I started to
understand the answer.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.670
I got letters from
all over the country,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.700
from parents and
children wanting

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.750
to know, my child loves games,
I want them to get interested

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.390
in technology.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.410
How can I use this?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.650
How can we leverage this?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.920
To, I didn't think
black women made games.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.390
I didn't think
that was possible.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.015
So it became very
apparent to me that I

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:28.874
needed to start speaking
out about what I did.

00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:30.290
So the first thing
I started doing

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.040
was going out and volunteering
and doing career conferences,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.350
and also doing career
days at school.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.200
So these are the students
from the Meadowood Livingston

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.820
school in San Francisco.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.800
It's one of the only
African-American-focused

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.680
schools in San Francisco
that's publicly funded.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.000
Shortly after that,
word got out that there

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.370
was a black female game
developer willing to speak,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.610
and I started getting
contacted by nonprofits.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.890
One of the first nonprofits
to reach out to me

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.390
was Black Girls Code.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.760
And at the time,
Kimberly Bryant was just

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.880
a small after-school
program in the Bayview.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.790
So I went out and I spoke, and
sort of shared my experiences

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.800
as a game developer,
and I still continue

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.500
to volunteer with
Black Girls Code.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.152
They're actually
doing a hackathon

00:07:15.152 --> 00:07:16.860
in the next few months
and they're really

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.360
looking for volunteers.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.670
So shortly after
Black Girls Code,

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.560
I got contacted
by Youth Uprising.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.980
Youth Uprising is a community
center in East Oakland,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.080
and they provide a
safe space for students

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.020
to learn technology,
music, arts.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.180
And the goal of
Youth Uprising was

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.330
for them to reach out to me and
my organization at the time,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.950
Blacks In Gaming.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.080
So I worked with Youth
Uprising on coming up

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.630
with an after-school program,
an eight-week program,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.940
where we can train students
on game development

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.290
and coding skills.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.780
And that program was recognized
by Governor Jerry Brown.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.990
My current passion project
is Gameheads Oakland.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.200
So Gameheads Oakland was
founded by Damon Packwood.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.510
He actually just won an
Echoing Green fellowship

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.790
for the program that
we're working on.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.830
And we volunteer and work
with students 15 to 24

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.520
on game development
skills and coding skills.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.270
One of the great things
about this program

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.730
is that I tap my network
of game developers

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.560
and we bring them in
and provide mentorship

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.454
to every single student, and
this entire program is free.

00:08:26.454 --> 00:08:27.870
We're also looking
for volunteers.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.039
So I was very honored to be
invited to the White House

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.610
this August to participate
in an LGBTQ program.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.370
And what we were doing
was brainstorming

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.060
on solutions and technology
to improve inclusivity

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.440
in tech hiring.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.490
So I was honored to meet
Megan Smith, the former CTO

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.780
of the United States.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.540
And we were able to spend
a day in the White House

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.708
and really think about ways we
can make tech more inclusive.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.140
So if you want to know
more about what I do,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.920
you can reach me at my
website lisettetitre.com.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.910
and you can also find me on
Twitter at zette16@gmail.com,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.650
and please reach
out to the orgs,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.460
and the many orgs you'll
hear about today, with some

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.170
of your time in volunteering.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.450
Those organizations really need
your technology experience.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.650
And just seeing more
women and women of color

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.720
will let the next generation
know what is possible.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.560
Thank you.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.810
