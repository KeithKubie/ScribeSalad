00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.450
LUCAS CUSUMANO: Thank you.

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.726
Open your mouth and say, aah.

00:00:01.726 --> 00:00:03.127
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN: Aah.

00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:04.210
LUCAS CUSUMANO: Excellent.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.980
Any pain?

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.080
NARRATOR: Scenes like
this take place every day

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.460
in doctor's offices.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.230
And at Einstein
Medical Center, that's

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.810
exactly what this is, a scene.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.590
The doctor is a medical student.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.810
And a patient, an actor.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.410
LUCAS CUSUMANO: Any
pain right there?

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.910
OK.

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:25.270
NARRATOR: At facilities
around the country,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.020
medical schools employ
standardized patients, or SPs,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.940
who are often
professional actors,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.670
to give students an education
into the real world.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.130
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN: We
are creating characters

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.090
with the information that the
medical school will give us.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.760
In order for it to be
effective, we as actors

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.820
have to truly believe that
we're in the pain that we're in,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.519
and we need the
help that we need.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.060
MARLENA DATER: You
have certain lines

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.090
that when they ask you
this, you should say this,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.340
to keep it standardized
while the students are

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.210
given equal opportunity.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.360
And also it's videotaped.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.830
The students get
to go back later,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.870
and look, and watch, and see.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.110
And also I'm grading the
students as well, not only

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.740
on their history taking and
their physical exam skills,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.410
but most importantly, how they
made me feel as a patient.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.290
NARRATOR: Testing scenarios
range from simple office visits

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.570
to comforting family members
that might have just lost

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.590
a loved one.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.750
The cases are full
of details and clues

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.600
that the students must navigate
to find the right diagnosis

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.912
or response.

00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:28.370
LUCAS CUSUMANO:
Perfect, excellent.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.140
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN:
And sometimes there

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.080
are red herrings.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.710
Sometimes there is information
that you think is significant,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.530
but in fact, it's in there to
send them down the wrong path

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.897
and to trap them.

00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:41.980
LUCAS CUSUMANO: When someone
came for a shot then,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.045
what were you doing at the time?

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:46.280
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN: I
had just finished lunch.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.675
LUCAS CUSUMANO: OK.

00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:48.790
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN: It came
on as I was [? in labs. ?]

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.650
LUCAS CUSUMANO: How
severe is this pain?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.858
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN: It's
probably a six or a seven.

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:54.190
LUCAS CUSUMANO: OK.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.010
DR. FELISE MILAN: Using this
kind of modality for assessment

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.190
has really become the gold
standard, if you will,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.690
in medical education.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.220
And ultimately in
their fourth year,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.520
the students have to pass a 12
encounter standardized patient

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.219
test to get a license
in this country.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.260
LUCAS CUSUMANO: I would
say the first time I ever

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.400
worked with an SP, it
was a little daunting.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.510
I didn't really even know
what to do, other than to say,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.580
hi, my name is Luke.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.670
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN: And It
won't be my heart, will it?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.855
LUCAS CUSUMANO: Oh, what's
going on with your heart?

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:30.310
Are you concerned
about this being--?

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.090
GALEN MURPHY-HOFFMAN:
Well, I-- just my father

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.280
had a heart attack
and died of it.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.010
So I, was-- I guess,
just wanted to make sure

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.680
that-- I don't know if
anything in the stomach

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.777
is about the heart.

00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:41.860
LUCAS CUSUMANO: I think
that's the reality of what

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.650
a health care system is now.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.480
We have to make these very
empathetic interactions

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.090
happen very quickly,
and get the information

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.070
as quickly as possible,
while still trying

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.820
to maintain our
humanity and everything

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.470
that people expect as doctors.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.840
NARRATOR: According to the 2016
Medscape Physician Compensation

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.040
Report, most patients
only have 13 to 15 minutes

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.260
with their doctor at
an average appointment.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.660
Doctors have to learn to
be efficient in that time

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.567
but also develop
a bedside manner.

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:10.441
MONICA: Hi, Joanne.

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:11.884
My name's Monica [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:12.852
I'm a medical student.

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:14.790
I'm working with
your doctors today.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.090
MARLENA DATER: My
favorite role to play,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.085
and one I get cast in a
lot, is adolescent roles.

00:03:21.085 --> 00:03:22.835
It's an acting process
for me, just trying

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:23.960
to be, like, disinterested.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.250
Oh my god, I don't
really want to be here.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.180
MONICA: Why do you think your
mom wanted you to come in?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.680
MARLENA DATER: I
don't know, like,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.180
I've been having
these headaches,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.383
but, like, I don't think it's,
like, a big deal, but whatever.

00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:40.264
If she does, she'll come in.

00:03:40.264 --> 00:03:42.514
MONICA: Can you tell me some
more about the headaches?

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:43.680
MARLENA DATER: I don't know.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.631
I don't know, it's,
like, a headache.

00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:48.199
How do you explain that.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.740
DR. FELISE MILAN:
We're really asking

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.320
them to use multiple
parts of their brain

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.150
at once, because
they're concentrating

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.450
on being another person and
truly being in that role.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.310
At the same time,
they have to remember,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.430
did the student ask
me if I had a fever?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.770
Did the student ask me
what medicines I take?

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.620
And how did the
student ask me that?

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.940
To watch them do what they do,
and to see how fabulous they

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.344
are at it, is remarkable.

00:04:14.344 --> 00:04:16.260
MARLENA DATER: Standardized
patient work, it's

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.660
like immediate
gratification and reward.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.279
Because you are
affecting a student.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.750
You're affecting future
doctors of the world.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.280
And that sense, the world itself
because of all the patients.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.070
And it's just such
a rippling effect.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.445
I love this work, love it.

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:32.820
NARRATOR: Watch
this next episode

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.380
about a group of
grad students who

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.770
are developing a game changing
technology by converting a cell

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.150
phone camera into a microscope.
