00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.919
Usually, satellites are put in a graveyard
orbit and left to die, or shot out into space,

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.720
or burned up in the atmosphere...

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720
But not THIS ONE!

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.769
This one we're going to SAVE!

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.300
Hey everyone Trace here with your weekly space
update from DNews!

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.039
We've talked a lot about dead satellites and
space junk, but this isn't a binary state,

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.900
there are satellites in the middle which are
more like... abandoned sats... and one of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.640
those might just come back from the dead.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.480
The International Sun-Earth Explorer 3 -- or
ISEE-3 -- was launched in 1978 and placed

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.500
in a libration point -- or a Lagrangian point.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.769
Without getting too technical, the five L-points
are places where gravity allows satellites

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.100
, rocks and dust to stay in a single spot
as Earth moves.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.050
It's like a synced up orbit.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.730
The ISEE-3 was put at a sun-orbiting L-point
and left to measure plasma ejection, cosmic

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450
wind and magnetic energy.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.600
A few years later, it was renamed International
Cometary Explorer or ICE and tasked to be

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.190
the FIRST SATELLITE to meet a comet.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.830
NASA used the gravity of the moon and earth
to slingshot into the tail of a comet, beating

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.440
the Russians, Europeans and Japanese.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.650
And just because we've got a bad ass over
here: in 1986, it met up with a Halley's comet.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.830
After its triumphant success, the satellite
kept flying... studying coronal mass ejections

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.470
on a 30-year orbit around the sun.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.040
When it passed us again in 1997, NASA was
all like, "nah bro.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.510
We've got newer stuff to worry about."

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.920
And the mission was retired.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.880
But now, a crowdfunded campaign to reboot
the ISEE-3 is underway by private citizens!

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.080
Their plan was to raise 125,000 dollars to
be able to contact the ISEE-3 and command

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
it to fire its jets, placing it back in its
original Lagrangian point.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.820
The team has already detected communications
from the satellite, and hope to get help from

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.220
the Internet at large to fund and analyze
the data that ISEE-3 is still capable of sending!

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.650
Their crowdfunding campaign ended on Wednesday,
and as of the time we shot this video, they've

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.850
raised almost 150,000 dollars!

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.950
They've got a power amplifier, access to a
radio telescope and they're setting up a transmitter.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.820
NASA has approved their plan to contact and
control a satellite no longer in use, and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.110
they now have until mid-June 'til their window
closes and then the satellite will never have

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.790
been contacted in living memory!

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.129
It's all very exciting!

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.780
Assuming all goes well and they can contact
ISEE, there's no way to know what instruments

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.120
are working after three and a half decades
in the harsh environment of space.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.560
NASA knows the transmitters were working,
and it had fuel in the tanks, but that's really

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560
all.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.120
It's been in hibernation mode for a long time
and electronics aren't magical.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.510
These people will have to find technology
capable of contacting the satellite in its

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.650
native language -- which if you think about
how much computers and wireless transmission

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.760
has changed, is no small feat.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.760
It's going to be a big effort.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.530
Luckily, they've got a retired ISEE NASA engineer
on their team!

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.530
That should help.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.010
The citizen scientists believe if it works,
they'll be able to put ISEE back at the original

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.740
lagrangian point and resume study of space
weather.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.260
Then in the coming years they plan to orchestrate
a lunar flyby, followed by another comet meeting

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.440
in 2018!

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.130
This is the first time private citizens will
have legally and actually acquired a NASA

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.950
satellite.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.830
Private science with government equipment!

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.830
Stellar!

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.130
What do you think?

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.290
We've got comments for a reason, get down
there and leave some.
