00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( theme music playing )

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:37.537
( electronic orchestral
music plays )

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:06.766
( applause )

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.601
Paul Miller: If many of you
are aware of my music

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.805
over the last 20 or
15 years or so,

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:17.076 line:0%
I have always... kind of
engaged with the idea that

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:20.980 line:0%
digital media is about this
notion of a global vocabulary.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.249
And I firmly believe that
as we move further

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.517
into the 21st century,

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.353
one of the major issues
facing us is climate change.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.589
I don't think it's a debate,
I don't think it's something

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.224
where the numbers
and the science is unsettled.

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:35.027
It's very clear that
this is a major issue.

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.964
But I also think it's
very clear that the arts have

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.666
an incredible and
very powerful role to play

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.301
in raising awareness.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.303
So, tonight what I want to do
is walk you through

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.171
some of the issues
that face me as a composer.

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:48.107
And I also want to kind
of walk you all

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.308
through my hard drive here,

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.876
some of the issues
that I'm thinking about

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:53.413
as I look at the role
of the composer and the artist

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:57.550
and the writer and this era of
just very, very radical change

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.084
in the environment.

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:01.754
So, what I want to do
is walk you guys

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.656
through some of the material
that drives,

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.125
why I think the Arctic is
so important.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.927
I ended up writing
a book about

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.428
the Arctic and Antarctic,

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:12.031
but mainly from
the viewpoint of science.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.567
First, we looked at
proto-scientists..<i> .</i>

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.369
Galileo and Kepler.
And Johannes Kepler,

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.138
in 1611 he was on his way home

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.073
and a snowflake landed
on his sleeve.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.975
And essentially
this is considered to be

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:26.845
one of the first mathematical
treatises looking at how...

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:29.014
mathematics in nature
are in dialogue.

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.683
And I love thinking about that

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.452
because he ends up
writing this essay,

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.619
Six Sides Of A Snowflake.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.154
And what ends up
happening is...

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.923
that set the tone for
how we think about

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.258
geometry in nature.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.894
So let me just show you...
kind of what that looks like

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.229
as I think
it's always important.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.632
Here... when you see
an ice piece of crystal here,

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:49.335
you are seeing essentially
permutation of form.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.936
You are seeing a geometry
at work,

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:53.539
a very beautiful precise
sense of nature.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.042
And above all,
what ends up happening is...

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.010
this is pure mathematics.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.445
So the song
you are about to hear

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.946
is called "Ice Sonification"

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:04.583
and it's based on this idea
that Johannes Kepler's essays

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:08.321
and his equations generated
a whole sensibility that...

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.589
here we are
in the era of algorithms.

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.792
Next thing you know,
we can take that math

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.493
and make it become music.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.462
So, let's lead you through it.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.731
This is what they call
Max MSP patch

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.532
and this is the music
and software

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:21.967
that you're going to be hearing
in a moment.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.303
Essentially what we do is
take the equations,

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.872
plug it into the software

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.840
and use it to generate
mathematically correct,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.209
very specific sound patterns

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.278
and again you are going to be
seeing, that basically

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.314
the mathematical
equivalent of ice.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:42.088
( electronic music playing )

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:32.372
( electronic orchestral
music playing )

00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:34.353
( applause )

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:38.090
My next book actually is
about apps and design

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.693
and I was really
interested in the tension

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:41.827
between those instruments,

00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:43.896
which are incredibly
beautiful instruments.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.831
The cello has been around
for several hundred years,

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.067
the violin also has
a long history.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:51.003
How do we figure on
the role of apps and design

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.505
in a modern sensibility
with a composer

00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:55.841
who is very intrigued by data?

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:58.710
So, I came up with an iPad app

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.213
and what we are
going to be doing now is

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:03.249
essentially
as a virtual string quartet

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.150
with two turntables,
violin and cello.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.319
So when I was
in the Arctic Circle

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.720
with the Sierra Club crew,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.223
we ended up meeting
this incredible tribe

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:12.558
called the Gwich'in people

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.694
and they are
one of the oldest nations...

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.796
first nations
in North America.

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.398
They are over
20,000 years old civilization.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.568
And I took a long walk with
one of their tribal elders

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.737
and they would just look...
pointing at the landscape,

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:26.205
I said,
"this is quite beautiful,

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.741
it's really amazing,"
and the guy was essentially

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.810
like "well, we don't know
how to describe this,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.144
it shouldn't be green,"
you know.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:33.579
I was like, "Oh!" you know.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:36.915
So for me as a Southerner,
you know someone from DC,

00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:38.417
going to one
of the most remote

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.586
northern parts of the U.S.
and seeing green,

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.853
I thought that was amazing.

00:08:41.853 --> 00:08:44.123
For them,
it was a sign of disaster.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:47.893
So this next piece is
dedicated to the people that

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:50.529
think that there's no
debate about climate change.

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:52.531
So, this next piece
is called...

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:53.866
"Check Your Math."

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:08.214
( electronic music plays )

00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:25.598
( whirring )

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.205
( electronic orchestral
music plays )

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:49.956
( music tempo increases )

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.962
( music continues )

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:43.803
( music continues )

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:58.343
( applause )

00:12:58.343 --> 00:13:00.346
Paul Miller: Thank you.

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:04.083
( outro music )
