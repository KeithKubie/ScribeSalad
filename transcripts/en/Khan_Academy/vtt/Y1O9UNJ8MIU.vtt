00:00:01.423 --> 00:00:02.718
- [Voiceover] Have you ever wondered

00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:04.968
what a chemist really does?

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:07.759
In this series we asked people
with chemistry backgrounds

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.277
to share their stories.

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:12.884
We have people from all
different fields and careers.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.596
For example, we have
an interview of someone

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:18.047
who works in forensics,

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:22.548
which is closely related
to analytical chemistry.

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:24.548
We also have people from

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.753
the field of science illustration

00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:34.252
and medicine.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:39.536
Since if you've ever
thought about being pre-med,

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:41.721
or doing anything else
related to medicine,

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:43.541
you probably know by now
that you'll be taking

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.139
a fair number of chemistry classes.

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:49.357
We have someone who works
in industry as a researcher

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:51.357
developing new products.

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:57.477
We also have someone who
works as a programmer

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:02.499
at Khan Academy actually.

00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:06.535
We have a bunch of other
interviews for careers

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:08.917
where it was a little
harder to find pictures,

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:11.184
but they're all really cool jobs.

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:13.767
We have fields that are covered

00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:18.436
include patent law and science media,

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:24.943
which includes things
like making and producing

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:28.992
and hosting science TV shows.

00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:32.145
We have an engineer who

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:37.102
was not a chemistry major

00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:38.885
but had to take some chemistry classes,

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:42.218
and ended up using chemistry in her job.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.355
We have an epidemiologist,

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:50.355
which is a really hard
word to spell, miologist.

00:01:54.643 --> 00:01:58.643
It's also a really
interesting career, and more.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.661
We hope to continue
adding to this collection

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.637
of interviews over time,
so please check back.

00:02:05.637 --> 00:02:07.707
But hopefully you can tell from this list

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:10.789
that all of these people
who studied chemistry

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.274
are doing a lot of different things.

00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:14.107
So there's a lot of ways
you can use chemistry

00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:16.524
as part of your career after school.

00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:19.538
We hope you find these interviews
interesting and helpful

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:23.705
in figuring out what you
might want to do as a career.
