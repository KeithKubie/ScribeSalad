00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.010
It's a good thing moons aren't a measure of
worth, because Jupiter would be the coolest

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.010
thing floating.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.310
I mean, PLUTO has FIVE!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.880
We've got one.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:19.640
Just one measly little moon.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.080
A staple of alien worlds in science fiction
is multiple moons (or suns), because we lowly

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.990
Earthlings have only ever had the one.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.460
The creation of which is a touchy subject,
but you can see more on that if you subscribe

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.550
and check out my video on it; but why do we
keep living moonogamously while planets like

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.120
Mars get to take both of their gals for a
spin?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.630
We only have one moon because of the way the
solar system was formed!

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.120
There are two categories of planets, terrestrial
and jovian -- the terrestrial planets: Mars,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.860
Earth, Venus and Mercury; only have three
moons in TOTAL.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.840
Mars has two, Phobos and Deimos, and we have
one The Moon or Luna.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.030
Mercury and Venus are left all alone.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
Jovian planets, on the other hand, have scores
of moons!

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.010
Jupiter has more than 60, Saturn also is over
that sextalunar threshold, Uranus has 27,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.289
and Neptune has 14.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:18.869
New Horizons is getting closer to Pluto as
we speak, and imaging Pluto's FIVE moons.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.869
FIVE.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.380
PLUTO IS A DWARF PLANET and it's swinging
with more moons than us.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.729
WTF pluto.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.069
We don't know the EXACT reason different planets
have different satellites -- the technical

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.829
term for a moon -- but planets acquire satellites
through one of three possible ways.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.970
ONE, they get smacked by another body that
causes a chunk to begin to orbit; TWO, they

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.490
capture it using their gravity to snap a passing
celestial body.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.810
THREE, they form alongside a planet from an
accretion disk.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.659
The first theory is likely how Earth got Luna
up there.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.130
The second explains Mars' moons.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.799
Mars is very close to the asteroid belt that
sits between the terrestrial and jovian planets;

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.170
it could have easily grabbed its proto-planet-sized
satellites from there.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.380
It also may explain Pluto's five tiny moons.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.819
Pluto's smallest satellites, Nix and Hydra,
are little icy bodies which probably got too

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.930
close and were trapped by Pluto's gravity.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.269
The accretion disks in the third theory, vogue
with the idea of solar system and planetary

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.269
formation.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.980
As a solar system forms, dust gathers, spinning
into a disc.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.329
Eventually, gravity pulls the dust and gas
together, forming a planet, while any gas

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.800
flying around the edge forms planetesimals
by coalescing around tiny chunks of ice, rock

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.700
or flakes of metal or dust.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.459
Sometimes those planetesimals slam together
forming satellites -- which is probably how

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.459
Jupiter got so many.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.200
Venus may have had a moon at one point, but
a paper from CalTech postulated the yellow

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.519
planet suffered an impact which reversed its
spin, causing its moon to crash into its surface.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.470
Eventually, the satellite was absorbed and
it merged with the planet.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.650
Mercury has no moon because it's so small;
and although that didn't stop Pluto or Mars

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.739
-- Mercury has the added difficulty of being
closest to the Sun.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.850
The solar wind is strong with all us terrestrial
planets, blowing away material that might

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.390
have formed accretion disk planets, and affecting
satellites more than with jovian planets.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.959
The thing is, we only DISCOVERED other moons
existed when Galileo spotted Jupiter's four

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.530
largest in 1610; these so-called Galilean
moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Calisto lit

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.769
up astronomers' collective imaginations in
a fire still burning today.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.920
It was only in the 1970s that we finally confirmed
Mercury's LACK of moon, when scientists used

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.280
instruments on Mariner 10 to peek at the tiny
planet.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.799
As we've learned more about satellites, missions
have been proposed to study them and not just

00:03:46.799 --> 00:04:21.620
their parent planets.
