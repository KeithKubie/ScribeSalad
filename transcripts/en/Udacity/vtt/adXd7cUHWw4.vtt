00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, unlike the previous example,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
this is a little bit harder to see.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Certainly it's not the case that there's

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
nice white space in between separating them.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It seems to be a little tangled up,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but we can figure out the number of components,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and one way to do it is we can just start systematically

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
seeing what's connected to what.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So starting from this node here,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we can see this node can reach this one,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and this one,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
well, and itself,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and did we miss any?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Yeah, this node, which is part of that set--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
call that the purple group, group A--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
can also reach this node.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But notice that's as far as it goes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
All the purple nodes are connected to other purple nodes

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but not to the nonpurple nodes, and in fact,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you can see that the nonpurple nodes can all speak to each other.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So in fact, there's two separate,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
disconnected components in this example.
