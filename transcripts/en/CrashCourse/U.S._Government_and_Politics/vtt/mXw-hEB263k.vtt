00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.020
Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Civics
and today we're gonna look at the basics of

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.040
a system that affects all our lives: the law.
And no, we're not going to be talking about

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.220
the laws of thermo-dynamics. That's Hank's
show. Though we will be bringing the heat, ha!

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.660
The law affects you even if you never committed
a crime because there's so much more to the legal

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.820
system than just criminal justice, and even though we're
going to focus mainly on courts, the law is everywhere.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.380
If you don't believe me, read the user license
on your next new piece of software, or if

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.119
you fly anywhere read the back of your plane
ticket. Hopefully won't be more entertaining

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.140
than what you're watching now, but that's
examples of the law.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.120
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.160
In general, courts have three basic functions,
only one of which you probably learned about in

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
your history class. The first thing that courts
do is settle disputes. In pre-modern history

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.030
(which is way easier to understand than post-modern
history), kings performed this function, but

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.750
as states got bigger and more powerful it
became much easier to have specialized officials

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.520
decide important issues like who owned the
fox you caught on someone else's land. Or

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.220
what does the fox say, which was disputed
a lot back then.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.909
The second thing the courts do is probably
the one you heard about in school, or on television,

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.569
or perhaps while studying for the standardized
test, and that's interpret the laws. This

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.620
becomes increasingly important when you actually
try to read laws, or when you realize that

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.920
legislators are often not as they might be when
writing laws in the first place. Take a look at the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.930
Affordable Care Act. There are a few
famous careless errors in that.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.420
Finally courts create expectations for future
actions. This is very important if you want

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.470
to do business with someone. If you know that
you'll be punished for cheating a potential

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.310
business client, you're less likely to do
it. Still you might, 'cause there are a lot

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.900
of jerks out there who would. Are you one
of them? Don't be! At the same time if you

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.110
know that people will be punished for cheating
you you're more likely to do business. And

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.280
it's courts that create the expectation that
business will be conducted fairly.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.630
Interpreting the laws can help this too, since
the interpretations are public and they set

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.970
expectations that everyone can understand
and know what the law means and how it applies

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.640
and then world peace. No more law breaking
ever.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.740
The first thing to remember about courts in
the U.S. is that most legal action, if it

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.240
occurs in court at all, occurs in state court.
And if it occurs at night, it occurs in Night Court.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.460
Because this is mainly a series about
federal government, and not Indiana government

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.500
or sitcoms about court in New York, I'm going
to focus mainly on the federal court system

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.950
which has four main characteristics.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.110
One, the federal court system is separate
from the other branches of government. The

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.000
executive could do the job, just like kings
used to but we have separation of powers so

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.900
we don't have to be at the mercy of kings.
Have you seen Game of Thrones?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.379
Two, the federal courts are hierarchical,
with the Supreme Court at the top and turtles

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.790
all the way down. Nope -- not turtles -- sorry
I meant lower courts. What this means is that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.150
when a lower court makes a decision it can
be appealed to a higher court that can either

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.430
affirm or overturn the lower court's decision.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.640
The third feature of federal courts is that
they are able to perform judicial review over

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.349
laws passed by Congress and state legislatures,
and over executive actions.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.590
And the fourth aspect of federal court system
is that you should know that the federal judges

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.120
are appointed for life, and their salaries
can't be reduced. This is to preserve their

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.800
independence from politics. Sounds like a
pretty sweet deal.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.519
Remember when I told you that the legislature
makes the laws? Well, that was true, but it's

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.489
also not the whole story. Legislatures both
state and national make laws and these written

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.700
laws are called statutes. In continental Europe
those are pretty much all the laws they have. Statutes.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.280
Statutes everywhere! And statues. That place is
filled with art. They had the Renaissance there, y'know?

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.550
But in the U.S. and England, which is where
we got the idea, we have something called

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.659
common law, which consists of the past decisions
of courts that influence future legal decisions.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.550
The key to common law is the idea that a prior
court decision sets a precedent that constrains

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.810
future courts. Basically if one court makes
a decision, all other courts in the same jurisdiction

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.540
have to apply that decision, whether they
like it or not. The collection of those decisions

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.200
by judges becomes the common law.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.920
I don't have to have a reason to punch the
eagle.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.739
I should probably point out what courts actually
do and explain that there are two different

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.260
types of courts that can make civil law. What
differentiates the two types of courts is

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.200
their jurisdiction, which basically means the
set of cases that they're authorized to decide.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.580
Trial courts are also called courts of original
jurisdiction. These are the ones you see on

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.510
TV and they actually do two things. First,
they hear evidence and determine what actually

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.080
happened when there's a dispute. This is called
deciding the facts of the case. Not everything

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.030
that happened or that may be important qualifies
as a fact in a court case. Those are determined

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.060
by the rules of evidence, which are complicated and
would really slow down an episode of Law and Order.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.540
After the trial court hears the facts of a
case it decides the outcome by applying the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.709
relevant law. What law they apply will depend
on statutes and in some cases what other courts

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.730
have said in similar situations. In other
words the common law.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.060
You might have noticed that I've been referring
to courts, not judges or juries, because not

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.799
all trials have juries. Bench trials have
only a judge who determines the facts and

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.430
the law. Besides, who decides what in a court
case isn't really that important. More than

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.130
90% of cases never go to court by the way,
they just get settled by lawyers out of court.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.040
But say you actually go to court and you lose.
Naturally, you'd be upset.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.420
Especially if you're a sore loser, like me.
Shut up.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.840
You have a choice. You can give up and go
back to your normal, loser life or you can

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.780
appeal the trial court decision to a higher
court. An appeals court that has, you guessed

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.740
it, appellate jurisdiction. Did you actually
guess that? That'd be amazing.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.480
Appeals courts don't hear facts -- who wants
those -- they just decide questions of law

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.160
so you don't have to bring witnesses or present
evidence, just arguments. In most cases, if

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.830
you want to bring a successful appeal, you
need to show that there was something wrong

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.880
with the procedure of your trial. Maybe the
judge allowed the jury to hear evidence they

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.280
shouldn't have heard, maybe one of the jurors
was a cyborg.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.900
Here's the way that these courts connect to
what I was saying before about common and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.030
statutory law. Most common law is made by
appeals courts. And because appeals courts have

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.860
larger jurisdiction than trial courts, appeals decisions
are much more important than trial court decisions.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.060
So now I'm going to talk about the three types
of law, and it's gonna get confusing. We should

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.100
probably go to the Thought Bubble for some
nice, compelling, intriguing animations.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.410
The two main types of law are basically the
Bruce Banner of law. They're the criminal

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.170
law and civil law, but they can sometimes morph
into the Incredible Hulk of laws: public law.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.290
"Public law, smash abuse of government authority!"

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.280
If you watch TV or movies, or read John Grisham
novels, you're probably familiar with criminal law.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.460
Criminal laws are almost always statutes
written by legislatures, which means that

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.870
there is an actual law for you to break. In
most states the criminal laws are called the

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.259
penal codes. In a criminal dispute -- and it's
a dispute because the government says you

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.580
broke the law and you will say you didn't --
the government is called the prosecution and

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.410
the person accused of committing the crime
is called the defendant.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.370
Almost all criminal cases happen at the state
level and for this reason it's hard to know

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.270
exactly what is or what is not a crime in
each state. Although murder is a crime everywhere.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.740
There are also some federal crimes like tax
evasion, mail fraud, and racketeering.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.590
If you're suing someone or being sued, you're
in the realm of civil law. Civil cases arise

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.430
from disputes between individuals, or between
individuals and the government, when one party,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.610
the plaintiff, claims that the other party,
the defendant, has caused an injury that can

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.740
be fixed or remedied. If the plaintiff proves
his or her case the defendant must pay damages.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.060
If you lose a civil case you don't go to prison
or jail in most circumstances, but you may

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.360
end up losing lots of money, and that sucks.
I love money.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.419
Cases about contracts, property, and personal
injuries, also called torts, are examples

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.519
of civil law. So under certain circumstances
a civil or criminal case can become public law.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.759
This happens when either the defendant
or plaintiff can show that the powers of government

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.559
or the rights of citizens under the Constitution
or federal law is involved in the case.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.980
Also if the law gets exposed to gamma rays.
"Law, smash!"

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.880
For example, in a criminal case where the
defendant claims that the civil rights were

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.569
violated by the police, the decision can become
public law. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:52.470
So those are the basics of the court system
in the U.S. And you can see that there's a

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.139
lot to keep straight. There are types of courts,
basically trial courts and appeals courts,

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.619
on both the state and federal level. And there are
types of laws, basically statutory and common laws.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.960
The fact that we have both state and federal
statutory law is an example of federalism in action.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.680
The U.S. unlike most other nations has both
statutory and common law, but most of the

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.700
time when we're talking about federal laws we're in
the realm of statutes, or maybe the Constitution.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.180
When you study American government, most of
the cases you read about are examples of appeals

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.449
and of public law. How this all works in practice
is even more complicated. And the adaptability

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.860
of the American legal fabric allows statutes to stretch
to fit the growing and changing American society.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.300
Much like Bruce Banner's incredibly elastic pants.
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:42.180
I'm getting angry! Oh no! Ahhhh! I'm not wearing
elastic pants! Oh no! Ahhhhh!
