Hi! Miriam here making a guest appearance in the middle of the unit.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.869
Your task for this quiz is going to be to implement adaptive step sizes.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.979
We've already provided Huen's method for you.

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.699
So you just have to determine the next value of the step size h.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.769
There's one important change to the framework, however.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.559
You see we're dealing with single vectors here. We're no longer filling arrays of vectors.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.649
So the reason that we just are using single vectors is because we don't know upfront

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.789
how many steps the simulation is going to have.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.789
The number of steps is going to depend on the values h that are being computed.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.848
So we're not storing a history of x and b anymore

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:37.719
because we don't know how many entries that history would have to contain.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.019
So when we plot the result, we're not going to be plotting a whole curve.

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.689
We're going to be plotting just a single dot at each different location.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.350
Now you can see that in addition to the step size h right here,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.897
we've also created a variable for you called h new.

00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:53.779
Inside this while loop, we want h to store the current step size

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:57.709
and then we'll compute the next step size as h new.

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:03.518
At the end of each step, we want to add h to the time it has past, just what's happening right here

00:01:03.518 --> 09:59:59.000
and I want to set h equal to h new, which signals that we move onto the next step.
