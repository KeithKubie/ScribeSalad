00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.911
So whenever we want to add rational expressions together we should find the

00:00:03.911 --> 00:00:08.199
lowest common denominator of our fractions. The lowest common denominator is the

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.230
product of all of the different factors that appear in each denominator. Keep in

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.129
mind that we want to take the highest power of any factor that appears in a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.332
denominator. We're not going to jump into the entire process yet. Let's just get

00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:25.572
comfortable with this first step of finding the lowest common denominator.
