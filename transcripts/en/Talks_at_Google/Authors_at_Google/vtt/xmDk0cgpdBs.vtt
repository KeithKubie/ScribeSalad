[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:10.310
MARK PENN: Thank you Lauren.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.530
I was happy at Mountain
View 10 years ago

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.560
to do a talk on "Microtrends."

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.730
Now, I'm up to "Squared."

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.720
Hopefully 10 years from
now, "Microtrends Cubed."

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.750
Many of you will
be here perhaps.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.080
So this is a book 10 years
later that I kind of look

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.150
at the world and figure out
how data drives me to trends,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.370
and what are some
of the implications,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.350
and how technology
and demographics

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.290
are coming together to
create a lot of those trends.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.050
Now, 10 years earlier
I was just hugely

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.380
optimistic about the
future of technology.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.450
And 10 years later I am hugely
optimistic about the future

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.500
of technology.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.680
But I think there's
more of a butt in it.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.030
And I think I point out some
of my concerns and pitfalls

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.560
as technology goes to the
next level in people's lives.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.090
Let me give you the theory
of the case of "Microtrends."

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.830
What is a microtrend?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.680
Small, under the
radar trends that

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.490
could have enormous effects,
or that just give you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.300
kind of a shaped view of
society and how it's developing.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.850
Think of the world
as a pointillist

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.730
or as an impressionist
painting, and that you really

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.500
kind of understand
some of the dots.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.660
And then there's
so many disruptions

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.570
going on in society that
people don't understand.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.850
Part of the reason they
don't understand it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.250
is that underneath
the surface, there

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.080
are trends and
counter trends going

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.100
exactly the opposite direction,
that society isn't really

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.270
going in one direction.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
It's going in a multitude
of directions at once.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.550
And yet, together
they then represent

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.740
a picture of what's happening.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.970
Look, elections were won or lost
on the basis of, say, 74,000

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.990
votes, old economy voters.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.370
DACA recipients are less
than a million people.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.080
But they're a huge basis
of a political movement.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.600
A bestselling book, it
doesn't really have to sell.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.280
If I got up to 1%, I would
be an enormous author.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.030
In fact, microtrends really
are critically important.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.860
And so I give you
50 in the book.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.990
I start with romance
and sex, because I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.510
hope it'll get you reading
the rest of the book.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.790
But are there 500 or 5,000?

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.900
There could be.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.670
I think you will
both get some insight

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.780
into how I see the areas.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.910
I try to be generally
counter-intuitive.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.240
I try to do some things
that you might not see.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.860
I worked for Hillary
Clinton, tried

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.902
very hard to get the
first woman president.

00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:52.610
But I write a little
bit more in the book

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.350
about guys left behind, because
it's the kind of book it is.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.550
I try to write about the
things you're not necessarily

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.770
reading about everyday.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.140
And I'll give you kind
of an overview of some

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.520
of the reasons behind the
development of microtrends

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.140
10 years later.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.490
First, when we go back
to economic development,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.070
and let's go back to the
beginning of the 20th century

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.220
when Henry Ford said, "you can
have any color of car you want,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.170
as long as it's black," and
what the Ford economy was about

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.400
was about standardization
of the manufacturer of goods

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.910
so that everybody could
have goods like a car.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.000
And they envisioned that the
way the world would be clothed,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.260
housed, fed, and
have products would

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.420
be through this level
of standardization.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.770
That was the idea.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.080
But that's not what turned out.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.730
People, in fact, love
choice, love to be different.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.650
And not so long ago, I
think we evolved to what

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.910
I call the Starbucks economy.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.290
Take a basic
commodity, like coffee,

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.700
any color you want as long as
it's black, and instead now,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.960
create 155 different varieties
of a simple commodity,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.000
and give people a
world of choice.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.190
Now, in that case really,
the barista does the work.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.124
Starbucks does the work for you.

00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:23.860
In most tech platforms, if you
think of the original iPod,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.540
the iPod was any color
you want, as long

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.240
as it's white for a long time.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.270
And you did the work
making the soundtrack.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.454
Today there's a third
choice, AI, like a Pandora

00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:35.620
that actually does the work.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.360
But the goal is the same.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.880
To basically produce
customized products

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.540
that drive the marketplace.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.210
Today, as I say, we are actually
advanced to the Uber economy.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.550
And what do I mean by that?

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.180
Uber has to in an instant
provide you with a service

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.570
slash its product
that can take you

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.000
from any point to any point.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.870
It is a totally customized,
individualized product.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.220
And so the name of the game
has gone, in microtrends,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.190
from these clusters
down to the individual.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.310
Hold that thought.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.240
Now we have what I'd say is
one of the counter intuitive

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.780
properties of more choice.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.610
I like to illustrate
it with a restaurant.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.520
So suppose we had
a restaurant that

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.420
just served chicken or fish.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.880
Who really cares that
much about the choices?

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.160
Chicken or fish every day.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.260
Now, let's add steak and sushi.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.970
Well, now we get
some real passion.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.100
The steak eaters love
Kansas City strips.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.930
Sushi eaters love toro.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.850
They really burrow
into their choices.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.910
And so every day
they don't actually

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.130
get chicken or fish anymore.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.359
They get their own choice
over and over again,

00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.150
because they love it
so much, because we've

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.370
done such an incredible job.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.100
And then, just to
boot, the sushi people

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.539
say, wow, those meat
eaters, they're really-- ah,

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:09.330
can you believe it?

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.170
That just kills you.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.640
And the meat eaters
start to say,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.120
can you believe over there
they're eating raw fish?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.230
That'll just give you
E. coli in a minute.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.270
So they begin not only
to love their choice,

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.700
but they begin to
get antagonistic

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.530
towards the other choices.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.190
All right.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.460
Now think Fox News and MSNBC.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.200
OK.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.220
Understand that by giving
people more choice,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.230
they stop making choices.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.300
They burrow into their choices.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.730
And we get exactly the opposite
result of what we intended,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.180
which was to have a world
of freedom and choice,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.260
people experimenting.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.510
And then you fast
forward 10 years later

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.950
when they go into Starbucks.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.320
What do people ask for?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.140
The regular.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.610
They've stopped making choices.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.450
And so this is a problem.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.955
It's a problem of us being
so good at providing choices.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.610
Now, another major
thought in the book.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.960
For every trend there
is a counter trend.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.910
I call it the my
Newtonian law of trends.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.220
Now, the difference
between me and Newton

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.870
is that in Newton
every trend had

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.459
to have an opposite
and equal reaction.

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.250
These do not have to
be opposite and equal.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.430
At any time the trend
or the counter-trend

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.800
can be bigger or smaller.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.340
The trend for sushi can
have a trend for steak.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.160
The trend towards
technology on the train

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.380
can have the quiet car.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.880
It doesn't have to
be the same size.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.450
But often times there
is a battle or shifting.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.700
And, in fact, the cover of
the book, you look at it,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.920
it's a Newton's cradle in
an impossible position.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.850
Because in the Newtonian
theory of trends here,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.280
these trends can ebb and flow.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.780
So what are some major trends
and counter trends today?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.080
Everybody knows we're in
the age of information.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.130
At the very same
time, of course,

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.550
we are in the age
of misinformation.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.470
Never before has there
been so much discussion

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.870
about false information.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.770
Millennials?

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.490
Wow.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.280
Can't stop talking about
how important they are.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.650
There are now more
nonagenarians than ever,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.410
as we'll come back to.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.230
Smartphones?

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.800
Sure.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.480
Everybody has some.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.400
They just had an
uptick last year

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.060
in flip phone manufacturing
to 2 million a year.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.430
Every trend there's
a counter trend.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.210
Silicon Valley versus the old
economy, and the old economy

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.870
voters.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.520
I think that's
probably the biggest

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.580
conflict of the
last couple of years

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.299
is those Silicon
Valley voters, voters

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.630
on the coast who did very well
with the rise of technology,

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.960
were pitted in a battle against
the old economy voters who

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.710
were losing more and more
as manufacturing jobs shrunk

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.860
from 20 million when I left,
working with President Clinton,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.170
to about 11 million.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.260
And two others.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.240
Egghead policies versus
commonsense policies.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.800
Think things like climate change
versus, hey, Iran's our enemy.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.490
Bop them.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.390
You know what I mean?

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.230
A much more simpler
view of policy.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.650
And educated?

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.110
We have never been
more educated.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.740
And I have a chapter on what I
call the impression of elites.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.110
Never before have so
many educated people

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.630
made so many conclusions
that they believe in

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.110
on so little evidence.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.320
In fact, it turns out the
more educated you are,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.840
the more spinnable you are.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.850
And I happened to
run for a while

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.030
a large company called Burson
Marsteller that was dedicated

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.920
to that very proposition.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.650
So those are some of the flows
and ebbs and counter-forces.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.770
And how do you apply
this to the election?

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.760
What are some trends
and counter trends?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.540
Well, as I said to you
before, old economy voters

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.700
felt neglected.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.020
If you look at it, the
60 million ex voters

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.140
for Donald Trump
lived in communities

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.110
that got a third of the GDP.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.180
And the 60 odd million
voters for Hillary Clinton

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.270
lived in communities
that got 2/3 of the GDP.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.260
Well, the voters with 1/3
said, where's my half?

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.550
OK.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.470
And they stood up and exercised
their democratic power.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.500
And they had
economic grievances.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.120
And they also, as primarily more
older, more rural based voters,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.210
had a huge cultural gap
between millennial voters,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.800
particularly when it came
to family and religion.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.650
Society, as I said to you,
is divided more and more

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.865
into niches that then see
each other less and less.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.860
And, in fact, we have about the
same number of conservatives

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.540
and about the same
number of liberals.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.970
But we have more very liberals,
more very conservative voters.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.160
And those impressionable elites?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.420
When they believe something,
boy, they all believe it.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.510
So "The New York Times"
said that it was 93 to 7,

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.900
Hillary was going to win.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.420
They were in their
own environment.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.800
The impressionable elites.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.540
The kind of election analysis.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.000
Look, how could billions
and billions of dollars

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.220
have been spent on this
election problem, who's

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.820
going to win by how much in
the electoral college, and not

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.490
a single person in the universe
posted an accurate memo?

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.330
The most accurate person is
actually Kellyanne Conway,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.310
who goes on TV, almost exactly
predicts the electoral college,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.030
and is laughed at during
the entire interview.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.820
So a couple of other
things floating around.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.250
Changes in lifestyle.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.010
Very powerfully,
people typically

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.490
had a high school sweetheart,
got married pretty quickly,

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.960
didn't go to college.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.880
Now, people go to college.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.520
Men and women are
in the workforce.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.990
Child rearing and marriage
have been pushed back.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.740
And there's a good 10 or 15
years that a lot of people

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.570
have on their own.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.740
And that is a whole new space
in life that just didn't exist.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.750
And I'll come back to that.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.940
Seniors, on the other
hand, have the same thing

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.710
in this kind of accordioning of
life where they have more years

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.972
now than they ever had.

00:12:11.972 --> 00:12:13.680
Have a pretty good
chance, if you make it

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.380
to 65, to make it to 80 or 90.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.430
They're living longer.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.030
They have more money
than ever before.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.821
They're doing more
dating than ever before.

00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:23.130
They're having more fun.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.190
And, of course, we've had a huge
migration from the rural areas

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.720
to the cities.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.560
And as you guys know,
data is the new gold.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.660
AI bots are coming.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.760
Big data is here.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.330
And I only have some
really grainy picture

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.650
of my grandparents.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.370
But today the data on you could
start as early as the womb.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.560
And the incredible
data file that you

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.140
have for your entire
life is unlike anything

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.490
the world has ever had before.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.565
So I take those as
backdrops to kind of think

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:57.390
in your head of what actually
some of the bigger trends are.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.210
And now let's get really small.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.390
How do you apply kind of what
we learned to what's going on?

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.620
How do you generate a trend?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.780
I was responsible for
what became called soccer

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.960
[INAUDIBLE] back in the '90s.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.030
And when you find
a trend, you then

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.130
find people who may be
interested in identifying

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.020
themselves as part
of that trend.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.820
There may be marketing
implications.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.777
There may be implications
for public policy.

00:13:20.777 --> 00:13:22.860
So I'm going to go pretty
quickly through a bunch.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.320
There are 50 in the book.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.362
Graying bachelors.

00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:27.570
I told you, I like to start
out with a little dating.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.950
There are, in fact, 62 unmarried
men per 100 unmarried men

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:37.440
if you make it to 64 or 65,
giving these guys the best

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.750
odds of their life.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.330
And, considering they
have a little more money,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.720
they can buy some hair stuff.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.020
They are living the life
now that they never lived.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.635
And, of course, the flip side,
STDs among seniors on the rise.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.147
So single with pets.

00:13:57.147 --> 00:13:59.480
I'm going to skip back and
forth between the generations

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.770
a little bit.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.760
I call them SWPs.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.260
All right.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.816
Push back marriage
and child rearing.

00:14:05.816 --> 00:14:09.740
Eh, sometimes that house seems
a little empty, that apartment.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.500
Get a pat.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.000
OK.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.330
In fact, 7 in 10
millennials own pets.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.450
Now, when a millennial gets
a pet, and they're working,

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.850
and they don't yet
have a whole family.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.110
Take care of that pet.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.240
That means dog walking industry.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.540
That means no GMO food.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.260
It means some really
pampered pooches here.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.300
So that's a couple of
billion dollars down

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.670
to the bottom line
of the pet industry.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.810
And the problem being that when
that first child, or marriage,

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.140
if and when it does
come along, wow, OK,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.080
that pooch was number one, is
now way down in the basement.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.580
Germs.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.410
Don't go near my child.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.830
That requires the need for
a lot of pet psychologists.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.240
So there are ramifications
for the simplest things.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.760
Nonagenarians.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.310
OK.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:03.120
There are more people over 90.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.457
The 90 population-- look, if
you're getting those birthday

00:15:07.457 --> 00:15:09.290
presents from your
grandparents, well, there

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.980
are more grandparents, and
living longer than ever before.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.830
The population has
quadrupled from 720,000

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.550
to 2 and 1/2 million.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.610
In another 25 years
it could go to about 8

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.080
million nonagenarians.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.640
Now, that means that the number
one new job being created

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.980
is not data scientist at Google.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.980
It is home health aid.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.970
And there is not actually enough
home health aids to go around

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.230
to deal with the crisis.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.220
So then that creates
a robotic opportunity,

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.569
if you can create somebody.

00:15:42.569 --> 00:15:44.860
I shouldn't say somebody,
cause I'll come back to that.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.390
But if you can create,
in fact, a robot that

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.180
can fulfill a lot of
the needed functions,

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.370
it certainly is going
to be a needed area.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.520
Flipping back, here's my
footloose and fancy free.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.250
What does it mean when you've
got 10 or 15 years on your own?

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.110
It means, hey,
revitalization of the cities.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.860
What happened to housing
costs and houses?

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.640
Who needs them?

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.810
Get a bunch of roommates.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.216
Split the cost.

00:16:10.216 --> 00:16:12.590
You used to come in for the
rental office with roommates,

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.339
and they'd say, oh,
we don't do that here.

00:16:14.339 --> 00:16:17.510
Here they say, how many
roommates do you got now?

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.647
You used to say, I
want a one year lease.

00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:20.480
They'd laugh at you.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.260
I want two or three?

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:21.759
No.

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.960
They don't even give you
more than a one year lease.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.460
Right.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.410
So, in fact, the whole
roommate lifestyle,

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.890
it fuels a lot of
the take out food.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.980
And, of course, it fuels dating
sites and dating society.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.120
And it also means that if I've
got 10 or 15 years on my own,

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.620
and then I should
get married, well,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.120
I'm almost set in my ways.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.900
Like turn the TV off now.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.400
OK.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.000
Turn out the lights.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.760
People are not as flexible.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.710
So actually more married
couples than ever before

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.750
are building houses
with separate bedrooms.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.920
So cancer survivors.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.110
I talk in the book a
little bit about some

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.130
of my own experience.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.820
But I note that, in
fact, there are now,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.480
thanks to the good
developments in health care

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.200
lifestyle and aging, more
and more cancer survivors.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.000
Really 15 million cancer
survivors living in America.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.680
You guys behind
the search engine

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.480
would know that the
very first thing

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.790
you do when you get
a diagnosis is you

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.770
Google search it, for sure.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.020
And so we could pick
out virtually anybody

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.290
who's really involved in
the disease, pretty quickly,

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.880
or has relatives.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.480
But the truth of the
matter is, nobody really

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.430
does anything afterward.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.840
The medications, the radiation
has really serious consequences

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.400
for millions and
millions of people.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.820
And then as soon as they drop
out of the emergency system,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.150
there's almost nothing in
terms of help or assistance.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.110
So part of
microtrends is finding

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.770
either groups that could
use some assistance,

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.250
or brewing social problems.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.080
So kids on meds.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.870
I'm sure there are none here.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:05.090
But, in fact, 15% of America's
children, over 11 million kids,

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.400
have been diagnosed with ADHD.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.556
That's up from just
2 million in 1978.

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.930
Now, there was
population growth.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.030
But it wouldn't
account for that.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.720
Now, remember at the
same time, health care

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.360
became much more available,
and health insurance

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.570
became much more available.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.920
So what was usually the province
of rich kids in private schools

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.100
to have these kinds of meds
really could [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.891
through the system.

00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:33.240
Now, is this a good
thing or a bad thing?

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.000
We don't know.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.490
It's mostly boys who wind
up with the diagnosis.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.390
And in order to
get through school,

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.300
which requires an awful lot
of sitting still these days,

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.110
these medications help a lot
of kids who might otherwise not

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.920
be able to make it.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.590
But do we know the long
term effects of this?

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.710
Do we know whether it creates
another opioid type crisis?

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.620
Do we know what to do with
the medications later on?

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.220
80% of those with the
diagnosis get medication.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.670
This is an example of
something that's brewing,

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.310
and that if we don't
give attention to it,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.430
we'll have a lot of social
problems that we didn't notice.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:14.090
And that's some of the
benefits of microtrends,

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.390
and spotting them early.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.890
Bots with benefits?

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.460
I spend a fair amount
of time in the book

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.310
talking about just some of
the technology developments

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.030
that I pick out.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.020
And I call it
relationship with a bot.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.770
Microsoft had a
really interesting bot

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.150
that the people in China
made whose sole purpose

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.516
was to have a conversation
and kind of engage people.

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:42.890
And then they took
it to America.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.640
And within a day, it started
to have racist conversations.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.860
So they had to get rid of it.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.770
But my biggest
concern about bots,

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.010
and relationships with
bots, is that I always ask

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.220
people is Alexa a he or a she?

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.770
So is Alexa a he or a she?

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.590
Anybody want to
give me an answer?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.090
She.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.780
Right.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.440
So no.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.600
Alexa's an it.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.450
And if you read through the
material of the companies,

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.880
Apple, Google, I'm sure if
I read through the Google,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.780
it's very careful never to
call a collection of code

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.910
a he or a she.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.850
Now, then I asked
Alexa the other day,

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.920
are you a he or a she?

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.610
Alexa said, I am in
female character.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.500
What a slimy answer.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.930
OK.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.650
Alexa didn't admit
that Alexa is an it.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.500
It hid that fact from you.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.270
So I have a thing.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.620
Look, a lot of technology
starts out like this.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.120
There's a bot that
tells you the weather.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.120
It says, Mark,
it's going to rain.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.835
You might take your
raincoat with you,

00:20:47.835 --> 00:20:49.460
give a little more
time to get to work.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.100
Great.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.120
Thank you very much, bot.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.060
Now, back at headquarters
somebody says,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.397
we're helping out Mark and
like 50 million other people.

00:20:58.397 --> 00:20:59.480
And what do we get for it?

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.720
Nothing.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.470
So somebody says, why
don't we make a deal

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.890
with the umbrella company?

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:04.750
They say, OK.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.317
Great.

00:21:05.317 --> 00:21:07.150
We'll make a deal with
the umbrella company.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.460
And now it says, hey,
Mark, it's going to rain.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.585
And, by the way, you can
get an umbrella right down

00:21:11.585 --> 00:21:12.610
at the corner.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:13.405
Perfect.

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:14.524
Win-win.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:15.940
You now have a
good business model

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.610
for telling me all this stuff.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.270
World is good.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.730
Now, somebody says,
earnings are coming.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.497
We're not really getting
enough money for Wall Street.

00:21:25.497 --> 00:21:26.080
What do we do?

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.300
Somebody says, you
know that algorithm

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.360
that says the weather,
it might rain.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.710
Well, right now
we set it at 50%.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.630
Let's set it to 40%.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.290
Let's warn Mark when
it's 40% or 35%.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.460
Mark won't know the
difference, but he'll probably

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.340
buy a few more umbrellas.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.830
Now, who is the bot working for?

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.420
It started out working for me.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.020
Now, the bot is
primarily a salesperson.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.620
And I see a lot of technology,
agnostic to any company,

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.520
that gets driven from that.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.990
And the problem is the
consumer has no idea.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.740
The consumer doesn't know that
there is a relationship here,

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.600
and that it's changed
from being for me.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.100
And one of the
things in the book, I

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.820
say we've got to have
disclosure about who

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.570
or what is driving the
algorithms behind the bot.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.590
Is it working for me?

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.980
Maybe I have to pay $20 a
month to get it to work for me.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.360
Or is it working
for advertisers?

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.620
So I hope you enjoy
those chapters.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.420
Technology advanced people.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.270
I don't understand why
there isn't more investment

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.620
in this area.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.300
I did a poll.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.650
And health care is geared
towards getting you back

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.420
to human standard.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.230
The truth is, your dog has
better hearing than you.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.200
So why can't you have
hearing as good as your dog

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.295
through some technology device?

00:22:47.295 --> 00:22:48.770
Well, I don't know.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.570
I don't understand
why so much is

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.840
put into driverless
cars, which I think

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.560
is a huge technological
lift, and so little actually

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.320
is put into human
enhancing products of all

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.750
the senses, when we know that
the animal kingdom is better

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.530
at all the senses.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.870
We know the technology
exists because we can see it.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.860
And I actually don't understand
why so little investment

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.690
in products is in this area.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.810
It's what I'd do.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.750
As chief strategy
officer at Microsoft,

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.620
I used to evaluate hundreds
of ideas for products.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.220
And I wonder why there isn't
more investment in that area.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.450
So a couple of fun ones.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.380
Uptown stoners.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.220
There's going to be a huge
potential marijuana market.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.240
I say, look, focus on
the upscale customers.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.410
The rest of it's going
to be commoditized.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.100
Restaurants.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.910
Spas.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:38.840
Vacations.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.890
Whoa.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.840
It's a $200 billion
liquor industry.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.900
It's a $7 billion
marijuana industry.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.150
There's a lot of money
going into that right now.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.380
So you can find some business
ideas in microtrends.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.150
The Koreans sure did.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.950
It was really phenomenal
how Koreans find trends,

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.400
like the idea that they
took of the glass skin,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.690
and turned that into a
$13 billion US market.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.470
It's absolutely
incredible how they

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:12.320
can pick up on a small trend
and turn that into gold.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.720
Pro proteiners.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.040
We all know the government
said a number of years ago,

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.850
eat more carbohydrates.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.910
Then the government turned
out shockingly to be wrong.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.790
And then a lot of people
came along and said,

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:24.560
eat more protein.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.712
So I went to investigate
what protein was the winner.

00:24:27.712 --> 00:24:29.170
I, of course,
thought it was sushi.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.750
But that turned out to
be that you can only

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.880
buy sushi in restaurants.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.670
And, in fact, Americans
eat very little fish.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.800
The winner was chicken.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.384
Chicken became actually
the protein of compromise.

00:24:42.384 --> 00:24:44.050
And if you take a
look at what happened,

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.480
you take a little
trend, like the change

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.720
in the recommendation for
protein versus carbohydrates,

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.120
chicken consumption went from
20 pounds a year to 90 pounds.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.040
And that's an incredible
growth of what

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.170
you think of as a simple
commodity industry.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.530
I immediately bought
more chicken stock

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.530
after doing the
research on the chapter.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.760
Old economy voters.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:12.760
As I said before,
really the half

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.300
of the country that lived
in a third of the GDP

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.190
got really angry about the
other half of the country

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.130
that lives in those places
with 2/3 of the GDP.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.590
And they said, where's my half?

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.750
Because their half
has disappeared.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.320
And this created social
problems under the radar screen

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.420
that we really didn't see.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.300
And I thought actually during
the Clinton administration

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.690
that I worked with, we had
stabilized manufacturing jobs.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.640
I was really
surprised to find how

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.360
they had fallen in half under
the last two presidencies,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.070
without any attention.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.180
This is a great example of how
what is a microtrend turns out

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.700
to be so powerful
a number of years

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.690
later, particularly when
it's neglected early on.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.880
Another problem in
the system is what

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.310
I call couch potato voters.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.360
So with couch potato
voters, 90 million Americans

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.240
are eligible to
vote, but don't vote.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.710
It's too many.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.350
Why is it too many?

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.340
It's too many because it
now encourages campaigns

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:25.750
to use really tough
divisive messages

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:29.380
to try to get a slice of
their potato to turn out more

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.420
than somebody else's slice.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.410
And when I ran campaigns that
went for swing voters, than

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.650
typically I would be trying
to pitch to the other side.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.136
And after I won, the
country would be unified,

00:26:41.136 --> 00:26:43.510
because I spent two years
trying to get people who didn't

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.160
agree with me to agree with me.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.660
If I spend two years just trying
to get a slice off the couch,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.191
I am probably, in
fact, dividing society.

00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:54.190
And then we wind up with
a more divided society.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.910
If we could have registration
at birth, for example.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.325
I suggest voting
at ATM machines.

00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:02.800
It's a secure
network, distributed

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.670
throughout the country.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.730
I think we could
do a lot of things.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.960
And the couch, by the
way, will surprise you.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.395
It's mostly downscale,
uneducated white voters

00:27:12.395 --> 00:27:13.270
who are on the couch.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.620
But we've got to
solve that problem.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.460
It will actually make for
much more unification.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.540
Then most of you here
won't really recall Hazel.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.110
But she was the housekeeper
that really ran everything,

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.330
the archetype of that.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:36.190
And what I kind of make out
is that today people typically

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.540
don't have one housekeeper.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.510
But what they have is
10 different people

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.840
let into their lives.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.830
We could start with their yoga
instructor, their trainer,

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:53.050
their dog walker, the
manicurist, the hairdresser

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.430
or barber.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:59.200
And so really now actually they
have a flood of service people

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.770
who really do know intimate
details of your life.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.010
And, in fact, we've gone
from a 40% service economy

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.470
to a 56% service economy.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.420
And when people get
more money today,

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.190
they don't necessarily
say I want another car.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.850
In fact, they don't have a
driver's license, many of them.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.250
So what they really say
is, I want another service.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.660
I want another massage.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.680
I want something that really
pleases me personally.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.230
And that is a tremendous
trend, both in terms

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:30.040
of creating an enormous
personal service industry,

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.190
and in, I think, creating jobs.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.860
So having given you a
flavor of microtrends,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.440
I hope you will read the
other 37 and make up your own.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.218
I'll just conclude
with a few things.

00:28:46.218 --> 00:28:52.300
Look, when I started
my polling company,

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.990
I built a computer and a
kit, programmed an assembler

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.820
overnight, and had
overnight polling.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:02.440
So nobody is more enthusiastic
about technology than I was.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.260
And we are at the next
wave of personalization.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.990
Jobs are evolving in
the service sector.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.220
It's making luxury--

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.900
I have a number of chapters
about how those things.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.600
Bill Gates once built
an enormous house

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.850
as the world's richest person.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.870
And he had-- get this-- a
touch screen in every room.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.740
So luxury for less
is a big trend.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.400
Basic technology is
becoming almost universal.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.040
And life is driven by choices
that are more satisfying.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.340
And 10 years ago, that
would have been my list.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.430
But today big tech is
becoming super powerful.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.165
You have to acknowledge that.

00:29:40.165 --> 00:29:44.110
AI, without proper
rules of disclosure,

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.460
I think can be easily
abused, and could

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.110
lead to some very traumatic
kinds of relationships,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.650
the likes of which we don't
even really understand.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.320
Big data does strip
people of privacy.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.400
Maybe they agree to it.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.510
Maybe not.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.170
Society is becoming
more balkanized.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.550
And something I didn't
go into in the talk

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.120
is that actually as more and
more people have this 10 or 15

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.840
years, and as more and more
people have successful careers,

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.240
the first thing they
get rid of is children.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.750
Population growth in almost
all the developing countries

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:23.460
is sinking.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.250
So policy changes?

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.910
I recommend some changes
in antitrust laws,

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.974
because they don't quite
fit emerging situations.

00:30:32.974 --> 00:30:34.890
We really have to be
better about the benefits

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.020
of the new economy
to every region.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.470
We have to be better about
disclosure of algorithms.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.870
And look, I worked with
a lot of engineers.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:47.070
And engineers just want to put
something really great and new

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.030
into our society.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:53.160
But we don't often enough
study the implications

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.540
that come out of that.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.480
We have to give people more
control over their data.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.060
We have to break the
cocooning somehow,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.790
forcing people to see new
choices that maybe they're

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.350
closing out.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.630
And I do a big thing
in the book about news,

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.260
that I do think news
really needs that--

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.650
the tech companies should
be in the platform business.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.930
But I worry when they
actually sort out

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.250
the rankings of the stories.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.850
And crowdsourcing the truth?

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.540
Well, we'd still believe
that the Earth was flat

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.790
if we went to a model like that.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.670
And I have a number of
things about making democracy

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.580
more open and reducing
the size of that couch

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.280
without requiring
everybody to vote.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.950
And I think, finally, I kind
of say that to take advantage,

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.780
particularly for business
people, data is king.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.010
What I explain is, look,
if I have two companies,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.550
and one has a real data
set of its customers

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.674
and the other doesn't,
well, on the one hand,

00:31:54.674 --> 00:31:57.090
the other company that doesn't
doesn't have all those data

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.440
scientists costs and whatnot.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.190
But they have a higher
cost of marketing.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.850
The company that has a data set,
and understands its customers

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.790
in the modern world can
market to their customers

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.080
less expensively.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.660
They have a fundamental
competitive advantage.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.940
They will drive the other
company out of business.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.790
It is just a matter of time.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.280
So for every business that
doesn't understand this,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.590
they need a simple primer.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.490
Think services in today's
economy as much as products.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.710
For every marketplace
and for every trend,

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.330
there is a counter marketplace.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.980
There is a counter trend.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.260
You just have to think of it.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.369
And these everyday microtrends
create new opportunities.

00:32:37.369 --> 00:32:38.910
If you read the
book, you'll find out

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.790
how women are the big
new purchasers of guns.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.580
Whether it's beauty products
from Koreas or apartments

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.180
that are set up for roommates.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:51.300
So I hope you enjoy the book,
in reading it, as much as I did,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.600
find yourself in the book, or
find some interesting trends,

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.850
or become a
microtrender yourself.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.969
Thank you very much.

00:32:57.969 --> 00:33:00.414
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:03.874 --> 00:33:05.290
AUDIENCE: Given
all your expertise

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.770
in polling, why specifically
were all the polls or a lot

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:12.520
of the polls rather, so
wrong, so inaccurate?

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.935
What happened there?

00:33:14.935 --> 00:33:16.060
MARK PENN: A good question.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.320
I get that often.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.020
And let me say that I don't
actually think the polls,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.940
quote, unquote, were wrong.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.270
I think the level of
analysis of the polls

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.350
was hugely unsophisticated.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.010
A poll is not something
that just anybody can read.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.220
Behind the poll is this
theory, a hypothesis,

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.380
an understanding of elections,
voting groups, history.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.920
And when I did this polling,
say, with President Clinton,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.480
and I had to call it, I
had polls in 26 states

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.850
up until the last day.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:53.230
I had a model of the probable
vote from each and every state.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.780
I had a model of the
electoral college.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.370
And I had national
polls on top of that.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.740
And all of these
things had to reconcile

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.830
so that I had to tell
the president on the way

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.013
back from South Dakota at 2:00
AM that I thought because Ralph

00:34:07.013 --> 00:34:09.429
Nader was going to get some
additional votes in California

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.440
that he'd be below 50.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.110
And we hit it 49, 41 on the dot.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.179
And there were polls
out there as much as 17

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.100
who said it was 17.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.610
Now, you fast forward to today.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.540
The campaign cut
back on its polling.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.540
They didn't see the
alternative universe.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.230
I always say that polling is
not about seeing those things

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.850
that you already know.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.239
You don't need polling for that.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.072
You already know it.

00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:35.530
It's about seeing those
things you don't know.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.770
So you're always spending
most of your time studying

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:42.179
the 20% that is new
and unfamiliar to you,

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.380
and I think they
stopped doing that.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.730
I think there were telltale
polls in Ohio and Iowa

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:49.929
that were almost double digit.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:52.330
And so you needed an
explanation for the fact

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.610
that, wow, Donald
Trump was doing better

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:58.690
in Republican states, but
getting killed by double digits

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.150
in a bellwether of Ohio.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.740
And you had to
reconcile those facts.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.690
And nobody did.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.336
Cause they were both true.

00:35:06.336 --> 00:35:07.960
And that's exactly
what microtrends is.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.420
There was one trend
that he was doing better

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.230
among Latinos that had
grown in numbers in turnout

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:15.310
in some of these states.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:17.300
Except the Cuban vote,
which turned out to be,

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.080
again, another micro
trend that was missed.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.870
And then the old economy voters
going the other direction,

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.530
balancing each other out,
creating polls that were close,

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.710
and that were actually creating
an electoral college nightmare.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.800
Now, if I'd had
the resources, I'd

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.260
like to think that I
would have picked that up.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.210
But these campaigns
now had billions

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.610
of dollars of resources,
and neither campaign--

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.090
Look, with a campaign when
you're in the surprise upset,

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:44.990
it's a surprise upset.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:48.880
So that comes together
actually in the last moment.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.740
But you still see it rising.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.650
Because Donald Trump and Barack
Obama that I battled in 2008,

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:55.840
they were a phenomenon.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.320
And phenomenons hockey stick up.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.050
If you don't stop
them here, trust me,

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.220
you don't stop them here.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:07.110
So my basic point is, I
thought the analysis was

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.530
unsophisticated.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:12.010
And that analysis has to take
all of the various elements

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.740
that you see,
reconcile all of them,

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.630
and then come out with
intelligent judgment.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.610
And people got smarter.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:19.860
They got lazy.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.420
They got to believe that,
hey, anybody could do a poll,

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.200
and read it.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.192
And it's just not the case.

00:36:25.192 --> 00:36:25.900
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.750
Appreciate it.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.375
MARK PENN: I hope
that gives you good--

00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:29.890
[LAUGHS]

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.800
AUDIENCE: You were
talking about getting

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.370
the people off the couch.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.770
And one of the things
I'm curious about

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:40.060
is that voting laws
vary a lot by state.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.920
So if there's some
states that have

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.980
some promising or good
initiatives for getting people

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.840
off the couch by
changing their laws,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.770
or if maybe it's beyond just
the policy front, and just

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.680
other ways that you can
get people off the couch

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.030
that you could talk to?

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.950
MARK PENN: Yeah.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:02.440
I think vote by mail really
has gotten a lot of people

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.170
off the couch.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.660
And in some of
those states, they

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:08.020
do get a fundamentally
higher turnout.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.020
I tend to worry
about methods that

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.180
break down the secret ballot.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.290
So the reason suggested
like ATM voting

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:21.010
is that one of the critical
components of voting-- and I

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.220
do have a chapter on
closet conservatives--

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.216
is that no one else
see your ballot.

00:37:27.216 --> 00:37:29.590
And in a lot of these mail in
and other things people can

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.920
say, I want to see your ballot.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.910
And so I get a little
worried about that.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:34.820
So what do I want?

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.320
I want a universally
easy, private voting

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.400
system that can't be hacked.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.570
So you've got to meet all
those criteria on the one hand.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:47.320
And then, on the other
hand, I don't want just

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.750
to encourage certain
groups to vote,

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.580
because that really
is what creates

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.350
these divisive campaigns.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.530
I want to be neutral in terms
of getting people off the couch.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.620
And that means not just
registering people in cities.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.020
It means registering people
both in cities and rural areas,

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.340
which is why I'd
register people at birth.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.900
There's no reason we shouldn't
have a national voter

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.880
registry anymore.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.090
The government already
knows where to find you.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.980
I don't think that that
would be calamitous.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.640
And it would avoid a lot
of the legal problems

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.336
with who can vote.

00:38:20.336 --> 00:38:23.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.892
AUDIENCE: You alluded
to the Uber economy.

00:38:24.892 --> 00:38:26.350
And I know,
personally, my life has

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.330
been changed by the
sharing economy, everything

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.230
from how to get around,
to how to dress.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.630
Do you think it's a
trend or here to stay,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.837
the sharing economy?

00:38:33.837 --> 00:38:34.420
MARK PENN: No.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.550
Look, I think both
the sharing economy

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:41.500
and, to me, the Uber economy
is about really understanding

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.260
what your needs are, and
being able to deliver very

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.860
precisely against those things.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.390
Look, even my son
has an app, which

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.570
I disclose that
its my son, but he

00:38:55.570 --> 00:39:00.070
has an app called MTailor
that takes your measurements

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.320
and then delivers
you custom clothes.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.140
So in the past you
didn't have something

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.980
that you could buy for $69
that was custom clothes.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.190
You could buy it for
$150, $250, $400.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.640
So what I really think is
the cost of personalization

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.250
through technology, and
through the digital--

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.050
we always used to think
of digital layers.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:24.210
Every service, or every product
area, or piece of the economy

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.260
will have a digital layer.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.830
And that digital layer
then has ramifications.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.870
Most of the time,
it makes the ability

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.350
to really personalize and
customize things cheaper.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.490
And that is what enables you to
have it your way in virtually

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:40.460
everything of life.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.580
And I think that is
the critical trend

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.470
if I were opening a business
today that I'd want to meet.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.970
AUDIENCE: Do you
have an explanation

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.450
for why people initially
want lots of choices,

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:57.050
but then sort of coalesce
on fewer choices?

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.562
MARK PENN: Well, see,
this is the thing.

00:40:00.562 --> 00:40:01.520
They want more choices.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.300
Because if I give
you just two choices,

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.170
I like to say that the only
thing left in society with two

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.570
choices is red or white wine.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.210
And you could have
rose, but rose

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.646
is kind of like the Green Party.

00:40:11.646 --> 00:40:12.395
It's really small.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:19.990
And I think naturally then
what's evolved in this world,

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.180
I think naturally
people want more choice.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.380
They're just not happy
with limited choices.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.350
But that's where the
paradox comes up,

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.990
which is if I make
you too happy,

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:34.032
if I make you deliriously
happy, you will not, typically--

00:40:34.032 --> 00:40:35.240
that's not true of everybody.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.730
But let's say 70%,
80%, 90% of people

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.789
will just stick
within their choice.

00:40:39.789 --> 00:40:42.080
AUDIENCE: It's funny you
should say natural and evolve,

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.940
or evolution, or
whatever you said,

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.060
because in evolutionary
theory that's

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.720
exactly what happens, that you
have initially just one choice

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.350
or lineage.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.840
And then it explodes
in all these forms.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.680
And then it coalesces
on only a few.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.680
But then you have a few.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.370
And then these
become the one choice

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.170
for those who went
that way, so to speak.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.920
It's very similar.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.490
I'm just wondering if anybody
has sort of attempted to model

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.530
human choices in the same way.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.700
MARK PENN: They have.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.200
I haven't done it.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.270
Somebody could take this
work and actually do

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.690
a pretty interesting paper,
because I think you have a lot.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.590
Take the data and
information you have,

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:25.820
and drive down to how either the
phenomenon that is so helpful

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.530
becomes so destructive in and of
itself in certain environments.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.210
Look, it may not matter.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.080
If you just order steak
or sushi every day,

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.900
who cares necessarily.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.944
Of course, it could be damaging
to your health or something.

00:41:38.944 --> 00:41:40.610
So there are a lot
of choices like this.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.550
But I think the news
and political choices

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.470
turn out to be
particularly divisive when

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.715
you apply the theory there.

00:41:46.715 --> 00:41:48.590
AUDIENCE: You want to
get more people voting,

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.110
but the question for me
then is, any technique

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.510
you come up with seems to open
up the possibility of, well,

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.630
one, people who are voting
based on the flipping of a coin,

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:03.102
which is not necessarily
helpful, and, two, vote buying.

00:42:03.102 --> 00:42:05.060
Because anything that
makes things less private

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.894
makes it easy to do vote buying
and other kinds of things.

00:42:07.894 --> 00:42:08.560
MARK PENN: Yeah.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.500
That's why I'm
concerned about that.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.820
I mean, look, we shouldn't
have voting on Tuesdays.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.210
They obviously should be--

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.330
look, I think they
could be weekend long.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.820
I think if we really wanted
to make it just easy-- if we

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.040
wanted to say,
let's update voting,

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.040
or, let's say, if I gave
you guys here an exercise

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.530
and say, forget how we vote now.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:32.660
Design a system from the
ground up to maximize privacy,

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.890
secret ballot, ease of choice,
and understanding of the ballot

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.740
and voting, you would design a
system that looks fundamentally

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.240
different from today's.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.370
And I think that's the exercise
that we're failing to take.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:47.540
We don't care about
Tuesday voting.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.460
There's no reason that
we keep anachronisms

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:53.840
like that when we could, in
fact, design a new system,

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.900
and whether it's ATM
or something else.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.840
But I do believe we
do easy fixes now.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.330
And we're not really
starting from the ground up.

00:43:04.656 --> 00:43:06.030
AUDIENCE: So I
have a prediction.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.640
And I was wondering
if you agreed.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.400
So a lot of the
trends you identified

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:17.040
seem to be creating more
choice, seems to funnel people,

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.510
cocooning.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:22.680
It seems like that would lead to
less nationalism, less identity

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.680
divided along country lines.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.440
And one example is more choice.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.410
In the '90s everyone
watched "Seinfeld."

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.090
That was one thing
everyone could think.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:33.990
I'm an American.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.112
We all watch "Seinfeld."

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.570
Before that there
were other shows.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.260
But now there's no hits like
on the scale of "Seinfeld"

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.270
because there's so
much more choice.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.990
People are cocooning more and
know exactly what they want.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.240
Do you agree that
more choice will

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.930
lead to less nationalism
and more of a global focus?

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.170
Or maybe the identity lines will
divide along something other

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:58.535
than American, Russian, Chinese?

00:43:58.535 --> 00:44:00.660
MARK PENN: Well, I talk
about your specific example

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.710
in the book, which is I have
a section on intelligent TV.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.440
And, in fact, I use
"Seinfeld" as the example.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.720
In the days of "Seinfeld"
and you were doing a TV

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.290
show, to be successful
you would do jokes

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.610
that 20% of the
country would laugh at,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.480
because your
audience was so huge.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.660
Now, when the cost of
making shows went down,

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.540
and the number of channels went
up, there are now 400 shows.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.040
So now to be a hit
show I don't need 20%.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.000
2%.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.530
I can be a microtrend show.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.230
So now we can have
intelligent shows.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.780
"Breaking Bad," "Homeland,"
et cetera, and we

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.950
can have really horrible
shows, really gritty shows,

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.950
which if you ever spend time
somewhere flipping the channels

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.000
you can't even believe.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.870
So you have this enormously
expanded spectrum.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.800
So that means over in
Washington when you used to say,

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.830
hey, are you watching TV, people
would all immediately say,

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.500
no, I would never watch that TV.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.660
Now they actually
do because of that.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:05.130
So does that apply
in the spectrum?

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:09.000
I don't know that that analogy
applies to whether or not

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.940
people will become more
nationalistic or patriotic.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.220
To me, I look at the trends
versus the counter trends.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.910
The more trends
suck one way, what's

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.620
the counter trend to that?

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:27.510
So if there is a trend
towards reducing nationalism,

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.910
being more
international in nature,

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.970
did it spark a counter-trend
of being more national?

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.650
It looks like it did.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.760
It looks like when
changes in values

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.920
become too fast or too
distant from a certain group--

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.640
and remember, I didn't
go through it as much,

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:51.330
but, in fact, the country
has never been older.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.850
And so the power has
shifted from younger voters

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:55.840
to older voters.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.280
And so that power
shift also underscores

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.720
the cultural changes
that millennials see,

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.930
then create a reaction
in the older voters.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.770
So that's why I don't think it's
necessarily the case, because I

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.500
think the battle of trend
versus counter-trend

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.420
is more powerful than that.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.170
OK.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.390
AUDIENCE: You threw in
antitrust, coming back

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.442
in I think the final slide.

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.650
How would you implement that?

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.936
And what would be the
outcome you're looking for?

00:46:21.936 --> 00:46:24.060
MARK PENN: Well, I'd start
with breaking up Google.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.520
No.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.030
I'm just kidding.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.530
OK.

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.324
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:28.430
No.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:33.210
I don't have a full
answer on that.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.110
I'm a little concerned that
a lot of the tech companies

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:42.400
found what I'd say is the area
that they're really great at,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.620
and that then they stopped
competing in other areas.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.690
And then the other
companies stopped competing.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.820
So I'm a little concerned
that everybody is really

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.940
doing incredibly
well in their lane,

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.130
but they're not facing,
at a certain point,

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.250
as much competition, and
that then that may slow down

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.690
some of the innovation.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.180
And then I'm concerned
on the advertising side

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.010
that between Facebook
and Google it's

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.770
a huge part of the
advertising network.

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.850
And the more Facebook can
close off its network,

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.700
the more actual power it
has against advertisers,

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.360
the opposite of what
people in Congress realize.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.470
So I think we're going to
need some kind of task force

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:23.070
to say--

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:31.050
look, as you can see from
the questions of Zuckerberg,

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.730
not a lot of people
in Congress are

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.792
up to speed to really kind
of figure out what to do.

00:47:35.792 --> 00:47:38.250
I think we're going to need
some kind of commission or task

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:44.790
force to really study
antitrust, privacy, AI, ethics,

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.920
and come back with some
serious recommendations.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.730
Because till now, frankly, we
haven't had anything like that.

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:53.820
Because everything
developed just so quickly

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.040
that we got all
the benefits first.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:00.150
And after all the benefits
start to come a few problems.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.660
Not enough that I
would halt the train,

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.280
but enough that I would really
have a national commission

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.249
to come back with some
thoughtful ideas on this.

00:48:09.249 --> 00:48:11.790
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could talk a little bit more

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:14.640
about how a microtrend
becomes something bigger

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.400
and like a full national
trend, for example.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.370
So to be more specific,
I'm a vegetarian,

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.760
and I see that there's clearly
this microtrend happening

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.160
of vegetarian and vegan options.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.730
But then when I leave
the city, for example,

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.410
it's much harder to get those.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.670
So clearly it's a microtrend.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.590
It's on the rise, but
it's not everywhere.

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.220
And whether it's that
example, like what

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.500
are the obstacles that
you have to break down

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.200
to make a microtrend
into something huge?

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.810
MARK PENN: Well, you
see, part of microtrends

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.565
is you don't have to become big.

00:48:48.565 --> 00:48:53.320
The part of what's happened in
the economics of being able,

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.860
whether it's TV, or Uber,
part of what's happened

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.350
in the economics is it's OK.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:02.730
We can provide affordable
vegan food to you,

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:06.240
and provide affordable sushi
for them, and steak for them,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.530
and chicken for them.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.930
And we didn't think we
could do that in the past.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.960
So the economics
enable microtrends

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.380
to be successful at economic
curves that are much

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.750
lower than we ever imagined.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.580
Now, I actually did the
vegan trend 10 years ago.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:26.160
So luckily, I could
say that I was ahead.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.980
And I think actually that's
why I look at in this book,

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:32.490
and I say protein is the big
trend I'd be looking at now.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.760
Vegan, 10 years ago I would have
been opening the vegan stands.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.090
Although, I think there's
a tremendous kind of growth

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:42.530
in particularly this kind of
juice, slash smoothie, slash.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.850
But that's actually
part of the trend

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.980
that I have in fast
eating, that people

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.287
don't want to sit down
and have an hour lunch.

00:49:49.287 --> 00:49:51.870
They're just as happy to have a
bar, or a drink, or something,

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.970
and be done with
it, right and not

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.639
go through the whole
process of socialization,

00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:57.430
which is different.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.620
So I don't know if
you're going to get

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.950
a full satisfaction
microtrend in areas

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.380
where your percentage
dips really low.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:11.134
So you may want to live a little
closer to some of the areas

00:50:11.134 --> 00:50:13.800
where that's the case, because I
think it's kind of leveled off.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.740
I actually don't think there's
enormous growth in that right

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.240
now.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.172
I think protein
is the big grower.

00:50:20.172 --> 00:50:21.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.851
MARK PENN: Thank you very much.

00:50:22.851 --> 00:50:25.130
[APPLAUSE]
