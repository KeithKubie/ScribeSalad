00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.165
We are constantly asked for our opinions.

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:19.489
Which team do you think will win the Super Bowl?

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.541
Who wore it better on the red carpet?

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.795
Who are you going to vote for for mayor?

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:26.802
Public opinion polls are everywhere.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.925
Important decision makers in American government

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.158
have long relied on public opinion polls

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:34.052
throughout elections and important legislation.

00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:36.825
The problem is public opinion isn't easy to track

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.460
and, often times, isn't even right.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.148
In 1948, the &lt;i&gt;Chicago Daily Tribune&lt;/i&gt; ran a now famous headline:

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.117
"Dewey Defeats Truman,"

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:49.519
they cried in big, bold, black and white letters.

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:50.913
The problem is

00:00:50.913 --> 00:00:53.241
that Dewey hadn't defeated Truman.

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.073
The &lt;i&gt;Tribune&lt;/i&gt; had relied on polls to come to their conclusion.

00:00:57.073 --> 00:00:58.452
Whoops!

00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:01.330
This happens all the time because public opinion polls

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.491
are either inaccurate or misleading.

00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:06.151
So, why are they wrong?

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:08.508
And why do we keep using them?

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:11.085
First, let's start with an important term:

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:12.701
sample.

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.193
A sample is the group of people

00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:17.515
that respond to questions during a public opinion poll.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.100
A poll's quality rests largely on its sample,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.061
and a sample can be bad in a few key ways.

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:24.655
It can be too small,

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:25.963
too narrow,

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:28.818
or the poll itself can be too difficult.

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:31.444
Polls that are too small are bad for obvious reasons.

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:33.116
And while you can't possibly ask

00:01:33.116 --> 00:01:35.699
every single person in America for their opinion,

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:36.908
the more people you ask,

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:39.614
the more accurate your prediction.

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:41.372
Polls that are too narrow,

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.039
that only ask a certain type of person a question,

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.666
are bad, too.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.372
Consider a poll about whether or not

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.546
the potato is the best vegetable in America.

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:53.000
If you only asked people in Idaho,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.209
where the state food is the potato,

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.303
chances are that you would get a much different answer

00:01:57.303 --> 00:01:59.829
than if you asked people in the state of New Mexico,

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.642
where the state vegetable is beans.

00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:05.062
Getting the right kind of diversity in your sample

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.468
means making sure that your sample has a range

00:02:07.468 --> 00:02:08.312
of ages,

00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:09.151
races,

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:09.815
genders,

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:11.102
and geographic regions,

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:12.986
just to name a few.

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:16.906
Finally, polls that are too hard can't tell you much either.

00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:19.593
If you're asking people for their opinions on things

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:21.787
about which they have no prior knowledge,

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:23.950
the results will be pointless.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.393
You're better off shaking a Magic 8 ball.

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:28.070
It's not just the people you're asking

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.752
that can cause bias, though.

00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:33.171
The person doing the asking is part of the problem, too.

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.217
That's called interviewer bias.

00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:38.177
Interviewer bias is all about the effect

00:02:38.177 --> 00:02:40.346
that the person asking the questions

00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:42.136
has on the sample.

00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:44.858
Humans generally don't like confrontation.

00:02:44.858 --> 00:02:48.306
People worry that their answers may make them look bad.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:50.123
Therefore, we find that people tend to give

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.540
socially desirable responses,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.103
not necessarily their honest opinions,

00:02:55.103 --> 00:02:56.901
because they don't want to come across

00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:57.703
as heartless,

00:02:57.703 --> 00:02:58.305
racist,

00:02:58.305 --> 00:02:59.784
or bigoted.

00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:02.451
And the way we word our questions matters too.

00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:05.663
When polls purposely sway the answers one way or the other,

00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:07.550
it's called a push poll

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.895
because it pushes people to answer a certain way.

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:12.629
"Would you vote for candidate Smith?"

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.289
is a perfectly normal question.

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.980
"Would you vote for candidate Smith

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.632
if you knew that he robs senior citizens?"

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.539
is a push poll.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:22.744
So, if polls are open

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.120
to all sorts of manipulation and inaccuracies,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.391
why are they still so prevalent?

00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:30.075
Despite their flaws, public opinion polls provide us

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.356
with some sense of the thoughts and moods

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:34.275
of large groups of people.

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:36.923
They offer politicians the chance to pass legislation

00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:39.609
they think a majority of Americans will support.

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.711
They help fashionistas on TV

00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:45.302
know which star wore the dress better on the red carpet.

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:47.956
Finally, they make us,

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:49.623
the people who get polled,

00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:52.835
feel as though our voice has been heard.

00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:55.377
So, next time you get a phone call asking your opinion,

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:57.174
or if you see a poll online,

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:59.597
take some time to think about who is asking

00:03:59.597 --> 00:04:01.418
and why they're asking.

00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:03.918
Then, take that poll, and its results,

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:05.640
with a grain of salt

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.103
or a potato.
