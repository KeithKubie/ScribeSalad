MELINDA EPLER:
I'm Melinda Epler.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.530
WAYNE SUTTON: I'm Wayne Sutton.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.400
And we're the founders
of Change Catalyst.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.920
We empower inclusive and
sustainable innovation

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.420
globally.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.378
MELINDA EPLER: Welcome
to this series sponsored

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:20.570
by Women Techmakers,
Google's program that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.940
provides visibility,
community, and resources

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.190
for women in technology.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.050
Together we're helping tech
hubs to develop more inclusive

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.750
cultures, programs, and spaces.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.180
WAYNE SUTTON: Spaces can
create a positive or negative

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.740
experience for people
in your community.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.890
Without conscious and
intentional design,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.870
your space can be
welcoming or intimidating,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.480
or even threatening.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.182
If you manage a dedicated
space or if you're

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:45.890
using a space for your
community to meet,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.920
consider how inclusive the
environment is for everyone.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.690
MELINDA EPLER:
Accessibility-- this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.750
is a big one that starts before
you even get to the front door.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.210
Some questions to
ask yourself include,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.090
is your location accessible
to public transit?

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.980
The further away you
are from public transit,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.860
the harder you will have
to work to invite people

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.544
with disabilities
to your programs.

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:07.460
WAYNE SUTTON: Do you
have accessible entrances

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.210
in restrooms and kitchens?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.380
Will someone who is
blind or in a wheelchair

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.770
be able to access directional
signage in your facility?

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.830
Do your events have accessible
signs, hours, and seating?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.380
MELINDA EPLER: And of course,
is your website accessible?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.720
We did an accessibility
audit for a client

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.420
and found that the Register
button on their event site

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.414
wasn't accessible to
people who are blind.

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:30.080
Make sure that people
of all backgrounds

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.142
can access your site.

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:33.350
WAYNE SUTTON: Decor-- from
the paintings on the wall,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.020
furniture, carpet
colors, or wall color--

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.630
how you design your
physical space matters.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.210
Seek input from your
hub diverse community,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.440
while creating an experience to
allow everyone to be themselves

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.590
and productive.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.506
MELINDA EPLER: Make sure
to look at the design

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:50.250
through the lens of gender,
race, ethnicity, religion,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.220
sexual preference, age, ability,
and socioeconomic status.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.810
And while many
restrooms traditionally

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.250
have been male or
female, consider

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.820
creating a gender-inclusive
or gender-neutral restroom.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.670
This allows transgender and
gender non-binary people

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.837
to safely use the restrooms.

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:08.045
WAYNE SUTTON: It also allows
people with disabilities

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.919
to have a caretaker
of a different gender

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.720
assist them in the restrooms.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.790
It takes a little
getting used to at first.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.030
But in a short amount of time,
it will become the new normal.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.310
And many will find
it a huge relief.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.650
Different religions require
different prayer times.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.510
Be sure to offer
people a safe space

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.800
to practice their religion.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.790
MELINDA EPLER:
Additionally, many people

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.560
thrive when they
meditate during the day.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.890
These spaces can be offered
for quiet meditation as well.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.710
Women who are breastfeeding
need a safe, quiet, clean,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.130
and private space to pump
breast milk several times a day.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.130
This should be as comfortable
as possible and absolutely not

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.797
in the restroom.

00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:42.254
WAYNE SUTTON: This
room should have

00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:44.080
a lock, a microwave,
a refrigerator

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.060
where moms can
store breast milk.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.880
Offer water.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.520
And have a comfortable
seat and an outlet.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.860
Ideally, it is
also near a source

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.740
of both hot and cold water
for washing their hands,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.740
pump attachment, and milk
collection containers.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.823
MELINDA EPLER: There's a
huge return on investment

00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:01.430
here, as you'll reduce
turnover rates and absenteeism

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.220
significantly and have happier,
more productive members

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.292
of the community.

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:07.250
WAYNE SUTTON: Providing
childcare opportunities

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.790
to parents shows that you
value their family's well-being

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.837
and personal life.

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:13.670
MELINDA EPLER: Studies
have shown repeatedly

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.940
that childcare in the workplace
improves productivity, attracts

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.610
and retains employees
or co-working teams,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.790
reduces absenteeism, and
provides overall happiness

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.059
and relief for parents.

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.850
WAYNE SUTTON: If you
can't offer childcare,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.580
consider offering
childcare reimbursements.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.730
Often childcare centers
are far from tech hubs.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.620
If this is the case
in your community,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.320
consider becoming an advocate
for bringing childcare centers

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.764
closer to your facility.

00:03:37.764 --> 00:03:39.680
MELINDA EPLER: As an
inclusive physical space,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.600
your code of conduct
is your law of the land

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.540
that signals accountability
and that you value and care

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.610
about the well-being
of your community.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.890
Display your code of
conduct in central areas

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.980
accessible to everyone.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.970
WAYNE SUTTON: Provide
responsible ways

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.550
for your community to report
any behavior that does not align

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.750
with your code of conduct.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.916
MELINDA EPLER: Include your
legal team and inclusion

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:01.310
community on the process of
creating disciplinary methods

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.890
if anyone gets out of line.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.120
WAYNE SUTTON: Your code of
conduct is your enforcer

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.770
and the face of
your organization

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.895
values that you care about.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:09.853
To get started with
creating a code of conduct,

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:10.820
visit the links below.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.028
MELINDA EPLER: If you offer
free food in your kitchen

00:04:13.028 --> 00:04:15.620
or at events or you have a
cafe or even vending machines,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.589
make sure you include food
that addresses community needs.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.130
That means offering vegetarian,
vegan, halal, kosher,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.750
and gluten-free foods.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.690
Additionally, survey your
community for ongoing dietary

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.464
needs.

00:04:27.464 --> 00:04:28.880

MELINDA EPLER: And share this
series with your community.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.980
Let's work together to
create inclusive tech hubs

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.860
around the world.
