00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.110
PROFESSOR: Because
some of this course

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.370
was shot in two different years,
two different notations systems

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.370
were used.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.300
And I'm going to
explain both of them

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.750
so that when you encounter
them in the videos

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.000
of the recitations of the
videos of the lectures,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.480
you'll be able to use either
of the notation systems

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.000
interchangeably.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.630
So the two notation
systems would

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.460
refer to how we explain position
vectors, velocity vectors,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.260
and vectors of any
kind that might

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.070
be associated with translating
and rotating reference frames.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.010
So in this diagram,
I've got a rigid body.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.220
And attached to that rigid
body is a reference frame.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.850
I'll call it XYZ.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.530
Attached and moves
with the body.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.360
And that's reference frame AXYZ.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.170
And the whole system is
translating and rotating

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.780
in an inertial frame O, capital
X, capital Y, capital Z.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.790
And I need to be
able to describe

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.180
the position and the
velocity of this rigid body,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.540
and a point on this
rigid body, which I'll

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.540
call B, which might
actually even be moving

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.610
with respect to the rigid body.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.510
So the position of
this reference frame

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.870
in System I-- this is Notation
System I-- we designate

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:03.170
as R of A in reference frame
O. And the O is in superscript

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.750
that precedes the R.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.920
Point B is R of B in
O. And this vector

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.500
is R of B with respect
to A. And we write it B.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.060
And with respect to
A is a superscript.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.780
So this essentially,
the superscript version

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.390
of the notation.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.790
We do the same thing in
a slightly different way

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.154
in which we say with
respect to is a slash.

00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:34.550
So A, with respect
to frame O, is

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.700
written RA/O. Point B
is RB/O. And the vector

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.050
that goes from A
to B is R of B/A.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.450
So the two are
exactly equivalent.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.050
And we'll go one step farther.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.920
And that is to take the time
derivative of this vector B

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.220
and use it to derive expressions
for velocities in a rotating

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.340
and translating frame.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:21.100
The position RB, for
example, using this notation,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.880
with respect to O,
is RA with respect

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.320
to O plus RB with respect to A.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.800
So it's just a vector sum,
this vector plus this vector

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.110
equals that vector.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.460
And we want to take the time
derivative of this expression

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.890
for RB with respect to
O. And it will give us

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.460
an expression for the velocity
of point B with respect

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.960
to the O frame.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.930
And here, I've written this
out in both notation systems.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.490
So in the notation system where
we use slash O as the with

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.440
respect to, the velocity
of B, with respect to O,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.590
would be the velocity
of that frame,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.110
translational velocity
of A with respect to O,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.600
plus the time derivative of the
vector RB with respect to A.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.980
And that time derivative must
be taken in the inertial frame,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.670
So /O.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.400
This term expands
into two pieces.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.300
So this is equal to, again,
V of A with respect to O,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.030
but now a derivative of RBA,
with respect to the A frame.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.220
This is as if you were
sitting on that rigid body.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.600
Is that vector getting
any longer or shorter?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.180
Plus the rotation, omega of
the body with respect to O

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.140
cross-product with RBA.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.850
I've left out underscores
here to emphasize

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.440
that these are vectors.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.650
But these are all vectors.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.050
And in the alternative
notation system,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.080
the /Os become superscripts.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.960
So the velocity of B
and O is the velocity

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.260
of A with respect to
O plus the velocity

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.750
as seen from the
point of view of being

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.180
on the rigid body plus-- this
is the contribution to velocity

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.490
as seen in the
inertial frame caused

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.200
by the rotation of the body.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.840
And that's the two
different notation systems.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.530
And you'll see these used
on solutions to problems.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.430
You'll see them in
either of the two

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.710
frames are either of the
two notation systems.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.380
And you will see these notation
systems used in lecture

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.840
and in these recitations.
