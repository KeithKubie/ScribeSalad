00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:01.638
- [Voiceover] The rate

00:00:01.638 --> 00:00:04.124
at which rainwater flows into a drainpipe

00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:05.666
is modeled by the function R,

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:09.847
where R of t is equal
to 20sin of t squared

00:00:09.847 --> 00:00:13.723
over 35 cubic feet per hour.

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:18.042
t is measured in hours and 0
is less than or equal to t,

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.541
which is less than or equal to 8,

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:21.931
so t is gonna go between 0 and 8.

00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:23.419
The pipe is partially blocked,

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.518
allowing water to drain out the other end

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:29.710
of the pipe at rate modeled by D of t.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.124
It's equal to -0.04t to the third power

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:38.124
plus 0.4t squared plus
0.96t cubic feet per hour.

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:40.844
For the same interval right over here,

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:44.304
there are 30 cubic feet
of water in the pipe

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:47.097
at time t equals 0.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:48.205
Alright, Part A.

00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:51.335
How many cubic feet of rainwater

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:52.629
flow into the pipe

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.288
during the 8 hour time interval

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.471
0 is less than or equal to t

00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.395
is less than or equal to 8?

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:02.064
Alright, so we know the rate,

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:06.235
the rate that things flow
into the rainwater pipe.

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:09.544
Let me draw a little rainwater pipe here

00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:11.531
just so that we can
visualize what's going on.

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:16.377
So if that is the pipe right over there,

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:18.866
things are flowing in

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:22.316
at a rate of R of t,

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:27.180
and things are flowing
out at a rate of D of t.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.292
And they even tell us that
there is 30 cubic feet

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.370
of water right in the beginning.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.738
But these are the rates of
entry and the rates of exiting.

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:39.650
So they're asking how many
cubic feet of water flow into,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.091
so enter into the pipe, during
the 8-hour time interval.

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:45.727
So if you have your rate,

00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:49.269
this is the rate at which
things are flowing into it,

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:51.242
they give it in cubic feet per hour.

00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:55.160
If you multiply times some change in time,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.374
even an infinitesimally
small change in time, so Dt,

00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:01.243
this is the amount that flows in

00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:03.612
over that very small change in time.

00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:05.121
And so what we wanna do

00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:08.383
is we wanna sum up these amounts

00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:10.787
over very small changes in time

00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:14.200
to go from time is equal to 0,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.265
all the way to time is equal to 8.

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:19.229
So this expression right over here,

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.760
this is going to give us

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.129
how many cubic feet of
water flow into the pipe.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.465
Once again, what am I doing?

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:27.483
R of t times D of t,
this is how much flows,

00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:31.627
what volume flows in over
a very small interval, dt,

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:32.927
and then we're gonna sum it up

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:35.226
from t equals 0 to t equals 8.

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:37.606
That's the power of the definite integral.

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:39.963
And so this is going to be equal to

00:02:39.963 --> 00:02:44.963
the integral from 0 to 8 of 20sin

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.997
of t squared

00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:52.948
over 35 dt.

00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:55.627
And lucky for us we can use calculators

00:02:55.627 --> 00:02:57.439
in this section of the AP exam,

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.747
so let's bring out a graphing calculator

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.505
where we can evaluate definite integrals.

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:04.494
And so let's see.

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:05.403
We wanna do definite integrals

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:09.079
so I can click math right over here,

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.484
move down.

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:12.183
So this function, fn integral,

00:03:12.183 --> 00:03:14.621
this is a integral of a function,

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.641
or a function integral right over here,

00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:18.165
so we press Enter.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.695
And the way that you do it

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.239
is you first define the function,

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.505
then you put a comma.

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:24.780
Then you say what variable is the variable

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.324
that you're integrating with respect to.

00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:28.321
And then you put the
bounds of integration.

00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:30.217
So I'm gonna write

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:33.136
20sin of

00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:36.367
and just cuz it's easier
for me to input x than t,

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:37.714
I'm gonna use x,

00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:39.188
but if you just do this

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:40.988
as sin of x squared over 35 dx

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:42.392
you're gonna get the same value

00:03:42.392 --> 00:03:44.168
so you're going to get

00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:47.522
x squared

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.751
divided by 35.

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.586
Close that parentheses.

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:55.105
So that is my function there.

00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:57.616
Actually, I don't know if
it's going to understand.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:06.303
Let me put the times 2nd, insert, times

00:04:06.303 --> 00:04:08.381
just to make sure it understands that.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.622
Ok, so that's my function

00:04:10.622 --> 00:04:12.642
and then let me throw a comma here,

00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:15.440
make it clear that I'm
integrating with respect to x.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.356
I could've put a t here

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:18.761
and integrated it with respect to t,

00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.270
we would get the same value.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.917
Comma, my lower bound is 0.

00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:25.425
And my upper bound is 8.

00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:27.364
And then close the parentheses

00:04:27.364 --> 00:04:30.213
and let the calculator
munch on it a little bit.

00:04:30.213 --> 00:04:31.378
And we get

00:04:31.378 --> 00:04:34.861
76.570

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:36.530
so this is

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.565
approximately

00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:40.014
Seventy-six

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:41.071
point

00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:44.647
five, seven, zero.

00:04:44.647 --> 00:04:46.215
Now let's tackle the next part.

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:50.174
Is the amount of water in the
pipe increasing or decreasing

00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:53.633
at time t is equal to 3 hours?

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:56.851
Give a reason for your answer.

00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:00.114
Well, what would make it increasing?

00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:03.421
Well if the rate at
which things are going in

00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:05.719
is larger than the rate
of things going out,

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:09.165
then the amount of water
would be increasing.

00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:10.178
But if it's the other way around,

00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:12.174
if we're draining faster at t equals 3,

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.578
then things are flowing into the pipe,

00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:17.259
well then the amount of
water would be decreasing.

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.586
Let me be clear, so amount,

00:05:24.143 --> 00:05:25.984
if R of t

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.535
greater than,

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:29.356
actually let me write it this way,

00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:31.260
if R of 3, t equals 3

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.815
cuz t is given in hour.

00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:35.092
t is measured in hours.

00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:38.017
If R of 3 is greater than D of 3,

00:05:39.353 --> 00:05:41.953
then D of 3,

00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:44.635
If R of 3 is greater than D of 3

00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:46.237
that means water's flowing in

00:05:46.237 --> 00:05:47.375
at a higher rate than leaving.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:51.049
So that means that water in pipe,

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:53.440
let me right then,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.539
then

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.552
water

00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:59.034
in pipe

00:05:59.034 --> 00:06:00.387
Increasing.

00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:02.577
Increasing.

00:06:03.717 --> 00:06:05.747
And then if it's the other way around,

00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:08.034
if D of 3

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.519
is greater than R of 3,

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:12.818
then water in pipe decreasing,

00:06:12.818 --> 00:06:14.791
then you're draining faster
than you're putting into it.

00:06:15.871 --> 00:06:20.834
Then water in pipe

00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:22.290
decreasing.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.290
decreasing.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.215
So we just have to evaluate
these functions at 3.

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:27.922
So let's see R.

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:29.721
Actually I can do it right over here.

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:32.519
So let me make a little line here.

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:37.129
R of 3 is equal to,

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.636
well let me get my calculator out.

00:06:39.636 --> 00:06:41.718
This is going to be,

00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:43.860
whoops, not that calculator,

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.889
Let me get this calculator out.

00:06:47.322 --> 00:06:50.924
And I'm assuming that
things are in radians here.

00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:53.258
So I already put my
calculator in radian mode.

00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:54.268
So it's going to be

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:57.247
20 times sin

00:06:58.097 --> 00:07:01.925
of 3 squared is 9,

00:07:01.925 --> 00:07:04.088
divided by 35,

00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:07.072
and it gives us, this is equal to

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.857
approximately 5.09.

00:07:12.994 --> 00:07:16.740
So this is approximately

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.262
5.09

00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:23.757
and D of 3 is going to be approximately,

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:26.692
let me get the calculator back out.

00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:27.797
So it is,

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:34.231
We have -0.04

00:07:34.513 --> 00:07:35.653
times

00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:38.160
3 to the third power,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.076
so times 27,

00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:46.063
plus 0.4

00:07:46.063 --> 00:07:47.113
times 9,

00:07:48.173 --> 00:07:49.690
times 9, t squared.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.261
plus

00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:57.284
0.96

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:00.908
times t,

00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:02.331
times 3.

00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.046
And this gives us 5.4.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.047
So this is equal to 5.4.

00:08:12.047 --> 00:08:16.715
So D of 3 is greater than R of 3,

00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:21.633
so water decreasing.

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:23.809
We're draining faster than
we're getting water into it

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:26.817
so water is

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:31.528
decreasing.
