00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's take a look at the same concept

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but do it backwards.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's assume that we've fixed the problem from the last quiz.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to assume that number is preferred to word.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Whenever we could match something as a number, we'll match it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as a number instead of a word.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What I'm going to do is write out a few phrases,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a few sentences, and I want you to notice

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which of them could produce, could be decomposed into a word

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
followed by a word followed by a number.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Multiple, multiple choice.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Check all that apply.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Which of these 4 inputs could break down into word, word, number

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
using the rules that we've been going over so far?
