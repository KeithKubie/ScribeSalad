00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:15.636
[ typing ]

00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:18.536
&gt;&gt;We start with immersion,
where we dive in and begin

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:21.176
to become exposed to the
realities of what we're trying

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:22.286
to pursue, and these other...

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:25.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: English teacher Susan
is explaining a learning expedition

00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:28.716
to parents who are considering
enrolling their students

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:32.976
at Casco Bay High School.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.836
&gt;&gt;Susan: Then building background
knowledge in social studies class,

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:38.696
they looked at the Great Depression
and tried to unearth what happened

00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:40.696
in that economic crisis
and how can we compare...

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:42.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The project McCray
and her students are diving

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:47.606
into explores the realities
and impact of homelessness

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:53.556
in their hometown of Portland, Maine.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:56.176
&gt;&gt;Susan: Then investigation comes,

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:58.196
and that's when we started
these documentary projects,

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.586
where we went out and had
the opportunity to talk

00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:02.866
to people who've experienced
homelessness.

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:06.666
&gt;&gt;Susan: The work that we do that we
believe in, it has to be compelling

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:10.516
and it has to be looking at the real
world, so we designed this expedition

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:14.026
to act as a case study
of one policy issue.

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:18.526
Policy is compelling
because it is about need,

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.486
but it can become very academic,

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:23.826
and I think what we can lose
is the notion of human story

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:27.976
and how these issues impact
and affect real lives.

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:30.796
&gt;&gt;Okay, how long have
you each been homeless?

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:32.736
&gt;&gt;I've been in and
out of the shelters on

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:34.096
and off, like, 22 years, and...

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:37.116
&gt;&gt;Susan: So, what this project
has done is allowed us to look

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:38.966
at the historic piece, while
at the same time looking

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.826
at the contemporary
economic crisis and then

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:43.536
to really make a link
with a human being.

00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:45.436
&gt;&gt;So, how did that affect you?

00:01:46.116 --> 00:01:48.656
&gt;&gt;Because of the way you
have to live and the fact

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.196
that you may not be proud of it.

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:53.666
Wears on your self-esteem, no
matter how good your self-esteem is.

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:56.026
It's going to be --
it's very draining.

00:01:56.836 --> 00:01:59.936
&gt;&gt;Emma: Even knowing that there's
a large homeless population

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:03.746
in Portland, like, it's something you
know, but actually being able to talk

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:07.006
to people about it is -- it's
something really different,

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.126
and that's what I really like
about expeditions like this.

00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:13.326
You get to really know it
rather than just look at it

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:14.476
and be like, "Oh, that's nice."

00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:18.976
Like, you're immersed, so...

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:20.116
&gt;&gt;You know the drill idea.

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.286
Keep that a little bit higher up.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:22.816
&gt;&gt;Hold on a second.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During the
eight-week project,

00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:28.136
students will write their own
individual profiles and contribute

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:30.276
to a group multimedia presentation.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.036
&gt;&gt;Should I redo that?

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:32.286
&gt;&gt;Yeah. We already -- we can't...

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:35.066
&gt;&gt;Susan: I mean, it's incredible
what we're able to do so simply.

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:38.266
We just click on GarageBand
and it goes.

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:41.636
Everybody's got a cell phone
that can take a picture,

00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:44.966
and everybody can load the
image onto the computer

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:48.246
in the classroom instantly, and
with my LCD projector, boom,

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:49.446
we're looking at people's work.

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:52.326
&gt;&gt;We talked to Alden in the
back room of Down-Home Cookin',

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:54.266
a small coffee shop on Preble Street.

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:56.416
&gt;&gt;Susan: I think it's easy for
people sometimes to think, "Oh, well,

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.396
this multimedia is kind
of gimmicky," right?

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.616
"It's just for the
sake of the polish.

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:01.916
Where's the learning in it?"

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:05.226
&gt;&gt;...told us he had been homeless on
and off for three or four years now.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.606
&gt;&gt;Susan: Well, I try peer
critique all the time.

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.166
I'm still trying to
work on how am I going

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:10.776
to make peer critique
happen more effectively

00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:11.716
when we work on our writing?

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:14.666
And in this project they've each
written their personal pieces,

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.786
and then I've asked them to
each take a piece of that

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:20.226
in their team to produce one story.

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:24.016
Well, the process that went on
there, I mean, kids were riveted,

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:27.696
and here's this authentic reason:
"I think we should use your opening,

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.326
because your -- I really liked
your description of the setting

00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:33.606
and what was going --
and the character there,"

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:36.836
and that's high-level thinking
and crafting of narrative.

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:37.906
They're critiquing.

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:40.186
&gt;&gt;So I think that was really
working was their slides.

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:43.196
I don't know how to
explain it, but it just kind

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:46.876
of meshed, like with their words.

00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:48.236
&gt;&gt;People lose hope out
there, paver-marked,

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:50.736
talk about why homeless
people stay homeless.

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:53.796
They get stuck and feel
like there's no way out.

00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:57.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: On this night, McCray's
students read the profiles they've

00:03:57.076 --> 00:03:58.946
written to this group of parents.

00:03:59.796 --> 00:04:01.806
Days later, at a local art gallery,

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:05.706
they will present their multimedia
products to their primary audience:

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:07.726
the subjects of their work.

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:09.296
&gt;&gt;We walked up three
flights of stairs

00:04:09.296 --> 00:04:13.476
in the Oxford Street shelter
past 154 6-inch-thick mats.

00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:14.426
The shelter...

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:16.456
&gt;&gt;Susan: The process is
driven by culmination,

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:19.486
because we all get involved when we
know that we have a real audience,

00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:21.556
and our real audience
is our community

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:24.106
but most significantly
the people we interviewed.

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:27.086
What could matter more than making
sure the story is right for them?

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.436
&gt;&gt;Andrew is 46 years old.

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:32.226
There was nothing about
Andrew that stood out.

00:04:32.636 --> 00:04:35.376
