00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.330
was for billions of dollars now the
thing I really think is kind of

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340
thing I really think is kind of
 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.339
thing I really think is kind of
objectionable about that is you've

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349
objectionable about that is you've
 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.069
objectionable about that is you've
already paid to have that data analyzed

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079
already paid to have that data analyzed
 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.110
already paid to have that data analyzed

permission to further monetize that data
 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.550
permission to further monetize that data
just because they have it to other

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560
just because they have it to other
 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.289
just because they have it to other
people so you know to me there's a huge

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299
people so you know to me there's a huge
 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.520
people so you know to me there's a huge
amount of institutional lag here you

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530
amount of institutional lag here you
 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.190

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120
behind practice that I think we're in
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.520
behind practice that I think we're in
for a big reckoning

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
for a big reckoning
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.780
