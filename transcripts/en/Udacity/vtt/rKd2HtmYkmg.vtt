00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.540
Welcome back. We now launch into the study of distributed systems. This is an

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.640
exciting field. On a personal note, I

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.370
started my academic career as a researcher of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.420
distributed systems in the mid 80s. Part of the fun, but there's a lot

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.680
of parallels between distributed systems and parallel

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.630
systems. What fundamentally distinguishes a distributed system from

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.520
a parallel system is the individual autonomy for

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.180
the nodes of a distributed system as compared to

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.150
a parallel system, and the fact that the interconnection

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.820
network that connects all the nodes in a distributed

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.110
system is wide open to the world, as

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.530
opposed to being confined within Iraq. Or a room

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.730
or a box. However, as the feature size of

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.020
transistors in silicon continues to shrink due to advances

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.560
in process technology and break throughs in

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.800
VLSI technology, many of the issues that are

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
considered to be in the domain of distributed

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.280
systems and are surfacing even within a single

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.580
chip. But I digress. In this lesson

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.630
we are going to learn the fundamental communication

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.010
mechanisms in distributed systems and what an operating

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.200
system has to do to make communication efficient.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.450
As in the previous lessons, you will

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.010
see the symbiotic relationship. Between hardware in the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.110
form of networking gear and the operating system

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.710
software stack, particularly the protocol stack, to make

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.830
the communication efficient. We'll start this lesson

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.860
module with a definition and a shared understanding

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.680
of what we mean by a distributed system. But first, a quiz to get you started.
