1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,161
Okay.

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:07,161
So we've been talking about
alkenes and they're polymerization.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,900
And now we'll go onto
the triple bond analogs,

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:14,720
the settled liens for just a little bit,
and then onto a conjugated system,

5
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:18,420
starting with Al Alec,
intermediates, and then die jeans.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,820
And then in general about linear and
cyclic conjugation and aero materiality.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,880
So we can generalize from what
we know about Alkenes to uh,

8
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:34,350
settled liens. We have the same
kinds of reactions, additions of Hbr,

9
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,660
addition of water,
addition of h two.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,190
But all of these have a little
bit of a different twist. A HBR,

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,820
we already mentioned this, but I'll go
over it again, the stepwise edition,

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,790
but Mark Kaufman to cough
the addition of water.

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:52,791
We see the possibility of Quito enal
to automatism and regio selection as in

14
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,750
alkenes. Uh, and then in h two,

15
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:02,040
there's a question of a stepwise edition,
one double bond,

16
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,470
and then the other one multiple
bond and than the other.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,480
And the question of Stereo
selection. And finally, uh,

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,340
some stuff about acidity
and base catalyzed,

19
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:13,650
I saw memorization of a settled liens,

20
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:18,390
which you'll see are much more
acidic than alkenes are. Okay.

21
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,310
First we talked about this
already, but just to go over
it quickly, once again, uh,

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,670
it's possible to add HBR to a triple bond,
like one heck sign.

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,970
And you can use a catalyst that helps
make the HBR more acidic and you can get a

24
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:36,180
single addition to give the heck
scene to Bromo one heck scene.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,410
And you often use an inhibitor so that
you don't get free radical addition of

26
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,244
Hbr.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Now we mentioned before it was a hundred
to a thousand times slower than the

28
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,200
comparable ionic addition to the alkene.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,340
And the reason is the vinyl cad ion
is not so great at an intermediate.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,960
And you can see that already in gas
phase ionization of the chlorides,

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,970
the one that gives the ethyl cad ion,
uh,

32
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,210
requires only 193 kilocalories
per mole to ionize the chloride.

33
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,870
But the,
uh,

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,920
vinyl compound to make the vinyl cat
ion requires another 32 kilocalories per

35
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,430
mole. It's hard to make the
vinyl cad. I am so that,

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,690
that's what of course you make when you
added the proton to the, to the, uh,

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,730
hexine. And it's possible to
isolate that in 40% yield,

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,440
which seems funny as we mentioned before
because if it's so if it's not very

39
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:36,180
reactive wouldn't the hexane you make be
even more reactive so that it would be

40
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:41,181
impossible to isolate something that
was part way along and the so you can go

41
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:44,850
further to to to dive Romo Hexane.
Uh,

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,410
obviously it's slower and it gives
a second Markovnikov addition.

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,490
Right,

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,440
which if the Bromo substituents slows the
addition to an alkene in order to make

45
00:02:55,441 --> 00:03:00,100
it slower than the initial addition
to the already slow alcaide.

46
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,560
Why is the or orientation Mark Kaufman
the cough and we saw the resolution to

47
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,670
that riddle a few lectures ago that
the halogens do two things. They elect,

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,350
they withdraw electrons through the sigma
bond and therefore make it harder to

49
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,530
form the cad ion.
But if you formed the cad ion,

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,180
make it next to the halogen so that at
least you can profit from stabilizing the

51
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:26,110
unshared pair on the halogen.
Okay. We saw that before.

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,410
Now hydration and
hydrogenation of Al kinds.

53
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,600
First hydration, we can do the same kind
of thing. We did the before the ALC,

54
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:38,380
oxy mercury nation, which
you may remember, forums,

55
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:43,120
an unsymmetrical bridged ion,
then water can open it up

56
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,250
and you get the addition
of mercury in Oih,

57
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,440
hydroxy mercury or Asian.

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,180
Now remember what we did before when this
was an alkene to begin with and we had

59
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:59,620
a single bond in the product.
Nobody wants the mercury compound.

60
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:01,990
What do you do? What,
why did people make it?

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,433
Yeah,

62
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,300
the next step was reduction.

63
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:11,320
Remove the mercury and replace it
with age so that what you added was

64
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:13,300
effectively water.
Right?

65
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,560
So they used sodium borohydride
to do that. However,

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,060
it doesn't wait around for you to do
that under these conditions because you

67
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:26,320
have acid there.
And with the double bond,

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,520
it's possible for the acid
to, uh, to add to it now. Uh,

69
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,450
so you get that cat eye on
what's good about that cat I in?

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,720
Why is that easier to form than it
would have been if it had just been

71
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:42,261
irregular?

72
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:47,261
Alkene Lisa,

73
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,010
what does the o have to do with it?

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,433
Uh,

75
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,720
no. Well they're a double bond.
Gets farmed, rolled him lately.

76
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,650
But what's good about the cad ion
when you have the oxygen next door,

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,020
Brandon,
what do you say?

78
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,810
Yeah,
it has

79
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,950
unshared electrons in the P orbitals
that can be stabilized by the vacant p

80
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:14,790
orbital next door.

81
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,270
So that there's a resonance structure
that makes it unusually stable.

82
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,400
A Homo Lumo interaction.
But what leaves then is the mercury plus.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,833
Okay,

84
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,650
so you get this compound,
which is an Ian Ole,

85
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,640
it's noticed that it was formed with
Markovnikov orientation as it would have

86
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:38,880
been the case if it started
with an alkene. Right.

87
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,180
But enols can undergo this same acid
catalyzed reaction to get that cat ion,

88
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,510
which is stable as we can see
in that resonance structure.

89
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,860
And what could that do?

90
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,773
Yeah,

91
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,980
well, who's a proton? Okay, so
it gives a key tone. This is,

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,360
this got traditionally the name
Quito, Ian, all Tao Tom Terrorism.

93
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,660
Tau Tau means equivalent to,
right.

94
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,870
So the idea was that the ketone and anal
inner inner converted so easily that it

95
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,730
was impossible to
isolate one or the other.

96
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,700
So that's a really easy alcoholic
rearrangement from one end of the,

97
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,350
from one alley lake
position. To the other. Okay.

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,360
And we talked about about the Keto enol
equilibrium last semester when we were

99
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:34,760
talking about bond strings. Just to remind
you, this is where we went through it,

100
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,090
added up the bonds and showed that the
ketone is much more stable than the Ian

101
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,090
all, I'll just flip through that. That's
just a, so when you're reviewing it,

102
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:47,190
you can look at it there.
Okay, so it goes to the ketone.

103
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:51,860
So the product from hydration
of the of an Al kind is not,

104
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,780
is a ketone. Okay, I'll Coxy mercury
ration of an Alpine. You don't,

105
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,320
doesn't wait around to do the
sodium borohydride reduction.

106
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,550
Now remember you could do the other thing
and an alkene add in the other Riggio

107
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:08,180
chemistry by using a boring,
for a settled liens,

108
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,570
you use a special Bahrain which has a VI.
What you get,

109
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:13,430
you get a vinyl,

110
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:18,431
boring is the product and it won't add a
second time if you have those are prime

111
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:24,710
groups sufficiently hindered so that
it's so that it blocks access. Okay.

112
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,380
Away you can do that is with a compound
called die. Same Old Boring, uh,

113
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,480
which is made with Bh
three and that alkane.

114
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:34,970
So you might think about
what the r groups are.

115
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,990
They are prime groups that you put on
there to make that hindered one with a

116
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,980
single age that an ad's only once.
So you get that vinyl boring.

117
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,790
And what do you remember
what you did with,

118
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,550
with boranes when we were added to a
double bond? What was the next thing?

119
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,290
Hydro duration.
And then what

120
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,940
incidentally, this reminds me that a week
from today is, uh, we have another exam,

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,650
right? And it'll cover at
today's and Wednesdays lectures.

122
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,050
I'll give a review
session Wednesday evening.

123
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,400
I'll tell you it probably eight to 10.
Uh,

124
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,680
and um, uh, so you have a
week to learn this stuff.

125
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,840
That's good news. Okay. Anyhow,
in the, it was hydro ball ration,

126
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,760
oxidation was the next thing.

127
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Remember you treated it with hydrogen
peroxide and alk oxide to make the a

128
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,290
boring into an alcohol.
Right. And then, uh,

129
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,620
in this case we have a,
uh, an anal as above.

130
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,790
So that'll I summarize
to a carbonyl compound.

131
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:45,170
But notice it was anti Markovnikov
addition above was mark [inaudible] the

132
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:48,590
oxygen went to the more
substituted center. This one,

133
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,210
the trick you use when you do boring
the the o goes to the less substituted

134
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,640
center.
So in that case you get an Aldehyde.

135
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,420
So the h two on one carbon and the oh
on the other ad in one sense here and in

136
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,800
the opposite sense here.

137
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,480
So that's nice because if
you're a synthetic chemist
that gives you the control

138
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,070
of which product you want to get,

139
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,420
you can use one method to get the Markov
knockoff ketone and the other to get

140
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,520
the anti Markovnikov Aldehyde.

141
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
So this is hydration with either Riggio
specificity but also we could talk about

142
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:29,811
hydrogenation adding h two and here it's
a question of stereo specificity up at

143
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:31,531
the top there.

144
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:36,180
If we take a an alpine and reduce it
with h two and a catalyst as we talked

145
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,250
about with an Alkene,
uh,

146
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,310
you can get first this alkene
and you use a special catalyst.

147
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,020
This is called, was developed by a guy
named Lyndon lar and he added, led to the,

148
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,550
to the palladium catalyst. Led is a
poison for catalysts. You makes the,

149
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,590
it makes the catalyst less active.

150
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,340
Why might you want the
catalyst not to be very active,

151
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,260
Chris?
So it doesn't go all the way.

152
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,340
It'll do the acetylene but it won't do
the Alkene so you can stop and get it

153
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,870
there. If you use a more reactive
catalyst, you can go all the way. Okay,

154
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,150
so that deactivates the palladium and
stops at the alkene stage and notice the

155
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:22,180
two hydrogens came in from the same side,
so it's a sin addition.

156
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,520
For example,
you get a 97% of that sin addition.

157
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,110
If the are, is this ch two
taken three times ester group.

158
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,010
Okay.
Now on the other hand,

159
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:39,810
if he use sodium and ammonia a thing
called a dissolving metal reduction,

160
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,920
you get the opposite stereo specificity.

161
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,350
It's an anti edition right?

162
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,480
Now it might wonder that the sin
addition we talked about before,

163
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,680
it's the same thing in an alkene about
how the Palladian comes in and attack.

164
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:59,490
Then it gets replaced by one hydrogen and
buy another hydrogen always front side

165
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:03,300
attack so that it comes out to be sin.
That one won't surprise you.

166
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,340
But why does this one give Auntie?
Uh,

167
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,070
the key is that it's a dissolving
metal reduction. Incidentally,

168
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,840
in that case with and propyl groups,

169
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:17,700
it's an 80 to 90% yield of that anti
edition. And I think none of the sin.

170
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay.
So it's a dissolving metal reduction.

171
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:26,001
So sodium actually dissolves in ammonia
to give electrons and sodium plus.

172
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:31,590
So it's a very interesting I and pair,
it's an electron and sodium ions.

173
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,270
Of course the electron is solved aided by,
by ammonias around and about it,

174
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,530
and it looks blue.
The solutions of electrons.

175
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,290
Okay. Now if you have an acetylene, an
electron will add to it. What? Orbital.

176
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,610
We'll go into what's,
what's the Lumo going to be?

177
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,520
[inaudible] what do you say?
Yeah,

178
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,190
high star. So notice it puts
in, there already is a, uh,

179
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,740
a pair of electrons in that
corresponding pi orbital.

180
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,660
So now you have three electrons
among those two p orbitals.

181
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,070
So you can write it as one being an an
I n with two electrons and the other

182
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:15,250
being a radical with the third electron.
Okay?

183
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,920
So we have an anti on
radical as an intermediate.

184
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,890
That of course is a very strong base,
the carbon and iron,

185
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,810
so it can react with the ammonia
and pull off a proton, right?

186
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,200
So we've added an electron and a proton
that's the equivalent of adding a

187
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:35,140
hydrogen atom, although it's
done as two stages. Okay,

188
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,940
so we get this a vinyl radical,
which is bent,

189
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,843
right?

190
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,590
Their sp squared hybridized
at that functional carbon,

191
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,700
but they invert easily in
the case of a radical right?

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,550
So it goes back and forth between the,

193
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,310
the RB on the same side
and the opposite side.

194
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,700
Now which one do you think is favored?

195
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:03,480
Obviously the one with the art groups
on the opposite side. So at equilibrium,

196
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,620
that's the one you have.

197
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,140
And now a second electron comes along
and goes into that singly occupied

198
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:13,590
orbital. So now you're going to
have a pair of electrons there.

199
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:17,760
We'll write the minus charge in
that sp squared, hybridized orbital,

200
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,280
but now it's harder to invert.
Remember x h three how he,

201
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,910
how if you added bore electrons, it
ceased to be plainer and became pyramidal.

202
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,600
The same idea here. So now it
doesn't flip back and forth rapidly.

203
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,523
Uh,

204
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,950
so a second proton can be
taken away from the ammonia.

205
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,700
Yeah.

206
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,570
And we get that product and the
two H's are on opposite sides.

207
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,270
It's an anti edition.
Why auntie?

208
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,270
It's because the,
that,

209
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,710
that isomerization of the radicals
favored the one with the RS far apart from

210
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:54,544
one another.

211
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,500
Then it got trapped as the anti on in
that geometry and then it went on to give

212
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:04,210
the anti product as we and gave
yields of on the previous slide.

213
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Now the final special thing about Al
kinds that we're going to talk about is

214
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:15,020
their acidity and how that relates
to isomerization of Al kinds.

215
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,370
So we looked before at
these PKA values for,

216
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,710
for a carbon nitrogen,

217
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:24,460
oxygen in the order you
would expect them to be,

218
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,820
but that if you have an sp
squared hybridized carbon
or an sp hybridized carbon,

219
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,470
they get much more acidic.

220
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,443
Yeah.

221
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,060
We talked about this before, and in
some cases, if you have next door, uh,

222
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,190
if you're breaking a ch bond and next
door, there's a double bond you can get,

223
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,100
uh, you can get a extra acidity. Okay?

224
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,350
That stabilization. Okay. So
anyhow, we looked at those PKA is,

225
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:01,000
and here we can see, uh,
the energies of these, uh,

226
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,510
three isomers of an Alpine.
So you have the Alpine on the left.

227
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:10,040
The lowest energy is heavily substituted
on the far right is one that it's the

228
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,660
end of the chain. So not being,
uh, not having as many, uh,

229
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,890
carbon carbon bonds with
a special sp hybrid.

230
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,570
It's not as stable. And in the
middle we have the dying version,

231
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,170
the one to dying.
So at equilibrium,

232
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,190
you would strongly favor the,
the internal acetylene.

233
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,280
But how do you establish
and equilibrium among these,

234
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:38,930
you have to move hydrogens around.
So at equilibrium,

235
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,340
given those energies,

236
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,520
there's only 0.1% of the one to die
[inaudible] and 0.03% of the terminal

237
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,610
acetylene. So very little of those. Okay.

238
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:52,550
So we just talked about the
fact that that the Acetyl,

239
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,890
that the terminal acetylene could be,

240
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,130
or the internal acetylene could be
acidic because of the Pi bonds next door

241
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,330
making the anti and more stable.

242
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,050
So deed you could do that or you could,

243
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,170
you could do this one that was
on the previous slide as well.

244
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,600
Or You could do the terminal acetylene,

245
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:16,601
which is the easiest one to take off to
put the electrons in the low energy sp

246
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:17,600
hybrid orbital.

247
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,590
Now the PKA over here is 38 so that
means that the KIA is 10 to the minus 38

248
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,683
right?

249
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,760
Or the energy involved in getting up
there is about 51 kilocalories per mole.

250
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,160
Okay. Over on the right, it's
33 kilocalories per mole.

251
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,310
Still way up hill,
right?

252
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,180
So those energies are quite far above the,
we know this,

253
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,160
that's what we know from the pks.

254
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,360
So if we wanted to take off a proton
and then put it back on and take off a

255
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:54,620
different one, put it back on and
finally go to the final and ion,

256
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,930
we'd have to go way up and energy.

257
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,500
If you have to go up 51
kilocalories per mole,

258
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,720
that's not a very fast process.

259
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,250
The rate constant for that would be 10
to the 13th per second times 10 to the

260
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:12,080
minus 38 or the halftime would
be about 10 to the 17 years,

261
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:17,000
which is about 10 to the fourth times the
time that's elapsed since the big bang.

262
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:20,720
So don't wait around for
that one to happen. Okay?

263
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,740
So obviously you're not going to be able
to isomerize that way by just letting

264
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:26,600
it ionize off of Proton.

265
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,050
But if you put hydroxide in,

266
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,470
it reacts with the Proton to make water
and that's worth 21 kilocalories per

267
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:40,640
mole.
Remember the PKA is 16 uh,

268
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,660
four thirds of 16 is a is 21
so 21 kilocalories per mole.

269
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:50,810
So that makes it 21 kilocalories
easier to make the ani.

270
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,840
And because you're not making
proton, you're making water. Okay?

271
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,490
So that's going to lower these,

272
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,670
is that going to do the trick
to be able to isomerize?

273
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Well now it's half time would be
about 30 years at room temperature.

274
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,760
Okay. But if you warmed it to 150
k it would be about two minutes.

275
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,090
So if you heat it up, you
could make the, the uh,

276
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,800
I saw memorization occur and then no
matter which of these you start with,

277
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,520
it's going to equilibrate.
And this is the lowest energy form.

278
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:28,521
And that's going to be everything except
there's going to be 0.1% here and 0.03%

279
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:33,150
there. Okay? So no matter which of these
you start with, you're going to get that.

280
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,063
However,

281
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,240
suppose you use a really
strong base like amid,

282
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,010
so now the, that favors a
loss of a proton. That is,

283
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:48,180
it'll take the proton by
45 kilocalories per mole.

284
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:52,230
So now we're going to lower those
ions even further like that.

285
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,880
And notice what happens on the far right.
It goes all the way down there.

286
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,040
And that's now the lowest energy forum.
If you have Nh two minus.

287
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,650
So instead of having it be all here,

288
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,820
which is what you're going to have in
any equilibrium among the neutral forms,

289
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,350
right? This is going to be
the lowest energy form, right?

290
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,550
So everything will be over there.
7.2 kilo calories down,

291
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,950
which means that at equilibrium you're
going to have only 0.01% of this stuff,

292
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:27,480
which was always the favorite stuff
before. So everything is now over here.

293
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,400
So the trick is now you
neutralize it very rapidly.

294
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,863
Right?

295
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,700
So the trick to obtain a
terminal acetylene remember
that an eye on is the one

296
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:41,340
that has the,
the anti and on the last carbon.

297
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,060
That's why it's such a stable
an ion cause it's sp hybridized.

298
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,570
So you equilla break with an amid base
in an amine solvent to form the terminal

299
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,254
an eye on.

300
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,360
Then you quench it by adding water to
donate a proton to the terminal and I and

301
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,010
and also to the R and, h. So
you have only hydroxide now,

302
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:05,880
which is too weak to allow
equilibration or if you want to,

303
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,570
you could just add acid so that you
don't even have, Ooh, they're all of,

304
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,040
that's gilding the lily.

305
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,980
You've already made it by not
having that really strong base.

306
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,720
So you stopped the equilibrium,

307
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,400
you'd put the Proton on the
terminal acetylene so you
could go from the internal,

308
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,450
the more stable when usually to the
terminal acetylene using this trick.

309
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,670
Okay. So that's all I wanted to
say about, about uh, settled liens.

310
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,790
And now we're going on for the next,
uh,

311
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,060
these two lectures and a
little bit probably still
beyond the exam to talk about

312
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,280
conjugation and Aram [inaudible].

313
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,540
So conjugated Pi Systems is
what you're talking about.

314
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:50,541
The name conjugated comes from an
interesting route that conjugated systems,

315
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:55,600
or when you have pi bonds
separated by a single,

316
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,900
a single bond and they're
called conjugated because
there are yoked together.

317
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,810
The word yoke is the same root.

318
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,430
It's a yolk comes from younger ray
from Yougo on which is to join,

319
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,150
right? So they're joined together.
They don't act independently.

320
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,580
We talked about this already in the first
exam and we may mentioned when you've

321
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,950
memorized functional groups and on the,
on the exam,

322
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:25,090
I had a thing that had both the carbon
eel and an amine and they were near one

323
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:29,000
another. But it's not a car video group
and an amine group. It's an amid group,

324
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,110
they are conjugated and they
behave in their own special way.

325
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,200
So now we're going to
talk about a conjugation.

326
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,840
So conjugation is where the
localized orbital picture, which is,

327
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,230
uh,

328
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,280
which remember we've talked so much about
pairwise to Adam's coming together to

329
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:48,490
give a bond and an anti bond or
isolate at the Tommy core bundles.

330
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,110
That was our intermediate between
hydrogen, like atomic orbitals,

331
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,460
which we really understood.

332
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:58,570
We had a table that we can draw
them out and the Computer Mos,

333
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:03,100
which looked very complicated, but in,
in between where these pairwise things,

334
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,270
right?

335
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,080
But sometimes we have to think more deeply
when these things are conjugated and

336
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:12,970
they don't behave that way. Okay. So
when does conjugation make a difference?

337
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,500
So first we're gonna look at experimental
evidence and then we're going to go

338
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,340
into the theory.

339
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,330
So a classic example
is Alec Stabilization.

340
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,420
Allie will comes from the word,

341
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:30,230
the same as I only or l and
French meeting garlic. There's a,

342
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,060
a sulfide in garlic, uh,
that, that has an owl,

343
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,560
a double bond than a carbon bumble bond,
single bond,

344
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:40,210
and then the functional
group assault side.

345
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
So that's an alcoholic sulfide
came from garlic, right?

346
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:48,340
So Allie ill is these three carbons
in a row, double bond, single bond.

347
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,440
So you can get special stabilization
when you have functional groups involved.

348
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,270
When you have a intermediates involved,

349
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:56,950
they're like the cat eye and intermediate.

350
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:02,310
So the energy for pulling off a chloride
for a primary and secondary are these

351
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:06,640
values in the gas phase? Of course,
very hard to separate the ions,

352
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,900
but if it's Alec, it's as good
as being secondary. Right?

353
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,300
So Al Lily because very good,
right?

354
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Or if you look at anti and look at the
PKA of the Oah here at 16 we know if you

355
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:24,850
have a double bond here, falls by uh,
by six orders of magnitude, right?

356
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,190
And then the case where
it's an oxygen here,

357
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:31,000
it falls by another five
orders of magnitude than you
actually call it an acid.

358
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,171
Okay.

359
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:36,640
So the anti is getting much more stable
when they're out allelic by about eight

360
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:41,500
kilocalories per mole in the case
of the, of the eternal. Okay.

361
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,600
Or free radicals.

362
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,260
If you look at the bond energy
of a normal ch bond hundred one.

363
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,430
But if you make a double bond next
door so that this is Al Lilly, it's 89,

364
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,970
it's stabilized by about
13 kilocalories per mole.

365
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,230
So there's stabilization of these reactive
intermediates when their ally lake.

366
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,630
Okay. Now let's look at some
more detail about some of these.

367
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:10,220
Like the cat I an intermediate,
the addition of Hx to Butte to dying.

368
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,800
We talked about HX,

369
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,620
a halogen acids add into
single double bonds.

370
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:20,090
How about add into two double bonds.
Okay, so it might have 78 degrees.

371
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,090
You can add HBR to Buda dying and you
could imagine the h plus going on one of

372
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:28,190
the internal carbons to
generate that cat ion.

373
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,470
Or it could go on the terminal carbon,

374
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,580
the other Riggio chemistry and
generate that cat eye. And uh,

375
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,910
which of those do you think
is more likely to get,

376
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,000
which one would you prefer if
you were the proton I Asia,

377
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,730
the lower one. Why? First it's,

378
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,360
it's secondary and it's
also a little lake, right?

379
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:55,160
Which the first one isn't because from
this, from this carbon to the double bond,

380
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,310
there's an intervening saturated carbon,
right?

381
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:01,000
It's not two double bonds or two,
uh,

382
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,280
two sets of p orbital
separated by a single bond.

383
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,750
There's no overlap between this p
orbital and that p orbital. Okay?

384
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:13,751
So this was the second one is of course
also that because those are resonant

385
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:17,540
structures, but as I used to tells
us the top one doesn't look so good,

386
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,040
so we're going to get one of those.
But then in a second step we add bromide,

387
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,790
right?
If we do that at minus 78 degrees,

388
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,780
of course we generated the
bromide when we attack the Proton.

389
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,630
Uh, so, uh, we could imagine getting
those two forms by attacking this,

390
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,120
uh, this intermediate, this intermediate,

391
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:42,920
which is denoted by two resonance
structures. Uh, now in fact,

392
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:47,840
you get those in the
ratio, 80% to 20%. Um,

393
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,280
does that surprise you?
What would you expect for the,

394
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,090
for the ratio of these two here
you have a terminal double bond.

395
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,360
Here you have an internal double bond,
which one is more stable?

396
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,800
Do you like to have double bonds, more
substituted or less substituted? Arvin,

397
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,460
do you remember more substituted?
So this is backwards, right?

398
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:12,470
It's four to one in the wrong direction.

399
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,740
Now that means that if you
allow it to equilibrate,

400
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,550
it'll go the way our of and wants it to,
right?

401
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,330
But the initial product formed
it really low temperature.

402
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:28,130
It dry ice temperature
is backwards. Okay. Uh,

403
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,990
you can cause this, this in fact
can, can ionize to make the,

404
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,340
to make, go back to the cat I
and then come back and that,

405
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:39,020
that's a root for equilibration
between these two.

406
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,380
And you can encourage the bromide to
come off by putting ferric bromide if you

407
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:46,560
want to. It'll go faster. But at
any rate, that's the equilibrium.

408
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:52,470
So this is called kinetic
versus thermodynamic control.

409
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,570
So thermodynamic his equilibrium.
But kinetic is what you get first.

410
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,700
And those aren't necessarily the same.

411
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,701
It's this case we've seen before where
you start and you go up a certain rate

412
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:09,030
and then down to a product.
Or You could go to a more stable product.

413
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,630
Hammond would say you'd go faster
to the more stable product,

414
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:17,490
but sometimes remember it crosses and
it's easier to get to the, to the,

415
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,030
uh, to the less stable product.
And that's example here.

416
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,380
It's a kinetic controlled
under at low temperature. Now,

417
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,810
why,
why,

418
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,930
when it's a question of rate
the first one to be formed.

419
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,370
Why do you think you formed the top one?
Anybody got a theory?

420
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,950
Yeah. How's it church? What
about the positive charge?

421
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,230
Right? It looks like this is a sec.
This is a secondary versus primary,

422
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:54,290
more of this.
So that's where at attacks,

423
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,590
that looks like a good explanation and
that's what you'll see in almost all

424
00:27:57,591 --> 00:28:01,700
textbooks. So very good on a
rock. You can write a textbook.

425
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,950
Okay,
let's look at the,

426
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,880
let's look at the orbitals
that are involved in this
just for fun quickly. Okay,

427
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:13,280
so here's a top view down on the
four p orbitals of the [inaudible].

428
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,640
And here's the side view, right?
So here's the homo minus one.

429
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,450
That's the favorable combination
of those four p orbitals.

430
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,323
Okay.

431
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,210
And here's the homo.
That's the unfavorable combination.

432
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:32,230
It's Pi on this side, Pi on this
side, but unfavorable between them.

433
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,600
Okay?
That's the homo.

434
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,860
The Lumo has two nodes
among the four P orbitals.

435
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,440
And what do you think the
Lumo plus one looks like?

436
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,640
It's got three nodes. So you got
no nodes, one node, two nodes,

437
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,750
three nodes, okay. For combinations
among Lewis P orbitals.

438
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,060
Now the homo is the one you want to
attack with the, with the Proton.

439
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,630
Okay?
So where should you attack it?

440
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,720
Probably you get the best
overlap around in there, right?

441
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,100
Or You could look at how the, the, the uh,

442
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,700
potential on the surface that we've talked
about to see where the best place for

443
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:16,240
a proton is and it's in the orange region.
So that's,

444
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:18,460
that seems to more or less agree.
It's about there.

445
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:22,090
So that's where the Proton should
attack at the terminal, uh,

446
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,470
at the terminal carbon.

447
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,030
And then it would give the
pro penal cad I ion, right?

448
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,950
Which is shown here. There are three
hydrogens on this carbon here. Okay?

449
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:36,790
So that's the best product
then. Okay, now that's the,

450
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,300
the homo minus four.
It's a little bit silly to look at that,

451
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,510
but it's a ch bond that's hyper conjugated
a little bit with the [inaudible].

452
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,460
Now we have three P
orbitals here, here, here.

453
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,480
The one that was here became
part of this ch bond. Okay. Now.

454
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:53,590
How about the rest of them?

455
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,063
Okay,

456
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,290
here's the homo.
It's the pie.

457
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,020
Here's the Lumo one node.
And here's the Lumo plus one,

458
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,030
two nodes among those three p orbitals.
Okay, so that's the pro penal cad.

459
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,690
I am, uh, there's the Lumo that,

460
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,710
that you're going to want to attack
if you're the bromide, right?

461
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,920
So you could attack at either end,
not at the middle.

462
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,743
Okay.

463
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,810
And if you look at the
surface potential, uh, the,

464
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,800
the worst place for, uh, uh, a proton,

465
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,900
uh, uh, is where it's very blue here.

466
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,740
So that would be the best
place for bromide to come,

467
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,400
but it's in the plane of the ring.
It's not a place you can form a bond.

468
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,170
Okay?
Okay.

469
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,060
If you're willing,

470
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,210
if you want to come in from the
top where you can form a new bond,

471
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,190
it's a little bit green there and a
little bit blue, even better there.

472
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:03,191
So the blue place plus 144 would be the
best place to attack if you want to form

473
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:07,670
a bond, that's where bromide would
tend to be in order to attack.

474
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,410
So one would think that that this is
exactly what honor Rog has proposed,

475
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,450
right?
That it should attack there.

476
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:19,451
But here's a really interesting paper
that was published in 1979 where what's

477
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:21,890
being added to his,
not Buda dying,

478
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,610
but Penta dying another
methyl group on there.

479
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,440
So they add DCL,
which adds to the end to get the,

480
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,150
as one would expect to get the more
substituted Al Lilly [inaudible].

481
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,500
Right?

482
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,790
But now there's something interesting
about that that's symmetrical except for

483
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:43,730
the fact that there's a deuterium there,
right?

484
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,260
So if a bromide now comes in,
or in this case they use chloride,

485
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,660
it could attack either here or
here, right? If it attacks here,

486
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,190
you get the one, two edition
d and cl. If at attacks here,

487
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,130
you get one for edition d and CS.

488
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,763
Okay.

489
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,140
Now if it had to do with,

490
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,750
with the kind of thing
we talked about before,

491
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,730
where's the best place to put a chloride?

492
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,050
Where do you get the best overlap and
so on? That's the same here and here.

493
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,370
Right?
So it should be 50 50 in this case,

494
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,860
because of the intermediate
being symmetrical.

495
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,800
When it was beauty to die and we didn't
have this methyl group and it was

496
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:28,550
unsymmetrical and we did the analysis
of the previous slide where it would be

497
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:32,870
the best place to attack, but now it's
symmetrical. So we should get 50 50.

498
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,440
So here's the product distribution done
at a bunch of different solvents at

499
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,200
different temperatures.
And just look at a couple of these.

500
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,280
If you do it at room temperature
at 25 degrees, you get a,

501
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,320
you get a half.
Again,

502
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:50,000
as much of this as you do have this
more chloride ads here than here.

503
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,310
And if you do it at low temperature,

504
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,790
you'll get three times as
much addition here as here,

505
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,370
even though it's symmetrical.

506
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,920
So we've got to find some other
reason why when we do this,

507
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,790
the chloride tends to attack
here rather than here.

508
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,360
One,
two addition rather than one for addition.

509
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,930
Canadian buddy gets a reason for that.
Well,

510
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:20,080
let's look at the mechanism.
The first thing that happens is the,

511
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,550
we put a proton on and generate the,

512
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,140
this uh, cad ion and also
chloride. Now do you have an idea?

513
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,950
That's good.

514
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,220
Hi Alicia.
It's closer,

515
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,590
it has to move farther to get to one
four because this backside attack on the

516
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:45,591
hydrogen meant that the chloride has to
be out here someplace closer to this end

517
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,060
then to this end.
Right.

518
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,210
So it appears that rapid collapse of
this ion pair that you made before they

519
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:59,211
could I and could move independently and
established true symmetry that competes

520
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,100
so that the collapse competes with the
motion that would make a truly symmetric.

521
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,540
So it looks like it might
not have anything to do with
where the charges on the

522
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:13,530
surface or which resonance
structure is better. Right?

523
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
It's just where the chloride got formed,

524
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,150
ended at attacks really quickly when
the eye pair of collapses. So you had,

525
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,880
you could have written a textbook
but you might not have been. Right.

526
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,670
Okay. Now, uh,

527
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,260
Lle transition states also are unusually
stable and we actually mentioned this

528
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:36,040
before, but if you look at
the, uh, an sn one reaction,

529
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,950
so you're breaking away to
get a cat eye on, uh, the,

530
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,460
the relative rates are if you
take a hundred for t butyl,

531
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:46,540
which is very easy to form the t butyl
cat eye, and the secondary is, is, uh,

532
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,710
10 to the fourth times slower and
the primary just doesn't happen.

533
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:55,120
It's way slower than that. Okay. But
if it's how lily, then it's five,

534
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,370
five times faster than secondary,

535
00:34:57,371 --> 00:35:00,070
even though you might think
it would be primary. Right?

536
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,750
And if it's Allah Lake with a methyl
group on it to make the cat eye and more

537
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:08,150
stable that you're forming, when
you break off chloride, it's, it's,

538
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,950
it's all half as fast as a
tertiary t butyl chloride.

539
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,930
If you put two methyl groups
there, it's, it's very much faster.

540
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,040
63 times faster than t butyl.
Right?

541
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,650
And if you put a methyl group here,
however, on this carbon that is,

542
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,130
so we've put a methyl group here,
it accelerates enormously.

543
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,690
If we put two Bethel groups there,

544
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:35,290
I really accelerates if we put
a methyl group here. However,

545
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:40,050
on the other end of the, or pardon me,
down in the middle w wait a second. No,

546
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,910
I, I had a, my game here,

547
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:45,900
sorry if we put it on the other
end is just as good. Okay.

548
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,590
But this is what I wanted to tell you.
If you put the methyl group in the middle,

549
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,090
it doesn't help at all.

550
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,030
So the methyl group has to be on one
end or the other of the cad I and you're

551
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:01,590
gonna make when you lose the chloride,
right? In order to get that acceleration,

552
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:05,040
if you put it in the middle, it doesn't
help. So again, we could look at the,

553
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,780
where the charge is in the cad ion and
you have to put the math for the methyl

554
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:14,580
to be effective and accelerating it in
an accelerated. The sn two reaction.

555
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,030
Sn One reaction. It has to be
where the charge is going to be.

556
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,780
Now how about sn two. Okay.
If we take the rate of of uh,

557
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,960
ethyl chloride to be one
reacted with f oxide,

558
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,090
it's 37 times faster.
If it's Alec at 97 times faster.

559
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,020
If you put a methyl lawn
and 560 times faster,

560
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:41,730
if you put two methyls on right,
if you put the methyl in the middle,

561
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,050
it, it, uh,

562
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,520
it doesn't help compared to the
compared to not have it in the methyl.

563
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,110
But if you put a Bethel at this end,
remember before when we were doing sn,

564
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,570
one forming the cat died.

565
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,610
We could put it either at this end or
this end and got the same right now it's

566
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:03,930
slower here. Any idea why it should
be slower in this case for the sn two

567
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,600
how about the rate of t butyl for sn?
Two

568
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,440
pft. Butyl three. Methyls
and you want to do sn two

569
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,650
very hindered, right? So this hinders
the approach because you're a member,

570
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:25,880
you're making a pentavalent
carbon in the transition state.

571
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,900
So Al Will Lake helps,

572
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,990
but this time you can get help from the
math at this end, but not at this end.

573
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,060
Okay. Now another. So we
looked at the alley cat ion,

574
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,390
we looked at the transition states and
Barb in form involved in forming the cad

575
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:48,560
ion and in the sn two process.
Now let's look at the alcoholic and ion.

576
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,440
And that's easy,
easily done by looking at the acidity.

577
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,880
So we have a PK of something like 52.
It's hard to measure for that,

578
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:59,870
but if you have, it's
alcoholic, it's 43 right?

579
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:05,110
And that's helped by a nine powers of
10 are about 11 kilocalories per mole of

580
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,810
stabilization for losing
that Proton at equilibrium.

581
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:12,260
And if you have a been a federal
ring there in what's called,

582
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:17,120
it's been Zelig and now it's even more
so about 16 kilocalories per mole.

583
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:20,840
So again, having these pie things
where they can overlap with the,

584
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:24,260
an eye on that's being
formed is a very favorable,

585
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:28,550
the order of 10 or 15
kilocalories per mole. Okay.

586
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,420
How about free radicals? Well,
here's a very interesting, uh,

587
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,270
these figures came out of this
paper by Ziegler. This Siegler is,

588
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,070
is not the Seigler who teaches Kevin to
20. This is the one who invented Ziegler,

589
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:46,960
not a polymerization. And that
became quite wealthy. Okay. So,

590
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:51,340
uh, so in 1942 working in
Germany at the Second World War,

591
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:55,840
he was studying this process,
he could get a 58% yield of,

592
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,760
of substitution.

593
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,870
This is this bro emanation
as a substitution pulling
off one of these hydrogens

594
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,060
and replacing it by bromide.
Okay, now heat for this purpose.

595
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:10,840
The paper that describes this
describes this particular calm, proud,

596
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:15,550
which is called [inaudible] sucks
and emod. Right? And in the,

597
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:18,760
in ether solve it in
30 minutes using light.

598
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,730
What is the fact that he was using light?
Suggest

599
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,020
that it might be a free
radical chain reaction, right?

600
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,730
He was able to get this 58% yield. Now
what's an brought, where does he get the,

601
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:34,390
and Bromo sucks. Inhibit. So
that compound is succinic acid.

602
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,850
Hey, he reacted it with
base to make the ad ion.

603
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,680
Does it surprise you that that ad I
could be formed with hydroxide? Remember,

604
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:49,681
and h has a pka of in the of
a 30 or something like that

605
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,400
and hydroxide is only a
16 at the PK of water.

606
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,160
How is it able to pull off that
Proton? What's good about that? And I,

607
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:00,994
and that we formed

608
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,880
Megan, do you have any idea can stabilize,

609
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,380
right? Yeah. To Carbondale.

610
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,190
Pi Stars to sets that stabilize the
high energy electrons are this nitrogen.

611
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,340
Okay. So you could make that out
iron, but it can, uh, that the PK,

612
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,840
incidentally that is 9.5
it's a very strong, uh,

613
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,880
acid as Nh bonds go.

614
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,080
And that could do an sn two
reaction on a br two to put,

615
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:33,080
brought me in on the nitrogen and
make the burrow, my dad and I,

616
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:36,080
and together with the sodium
ion that came from hydroxide.

617
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,690
So that's how he got NBS.
But you can take it apart again if you,

618
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,000
instead of using base use acid,
so if you,

619
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,390
if you use Hbr,
you can protonate this,

620
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:50,960
you could protonate that oxygen or they
could draw a resonance structure here

621
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,440
like that.
So it's easy to protonate here,

622
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:00,070
but now you can take the burl bide
and do an sn two reaction on the Br.

623
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,690
Right? So you generate
this now neutral, right,

624
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,900
which is an even or that easily I
saw him rises to back to the starting

625
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:11,511
material.

626
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:16,340
So base you could make this with
burl mead and if you add HBR,

627
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:20,360
you come back, right? And
of course also get br too.

628
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,620
That was what was formed here.

629
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,180
So you can get the br two back
again if you want to from NBS.

630
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,160
Now back to the reaction.
Uh,

631
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:34,210
we could imagine doing a reaction
of br two with a double bond.

632
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,090
What reaction have we talked about?
Br plus a double bond.

633
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,960
It's the addition electrophilic
addition to a double bond, right?

634
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,480
We talked about this a good deal.

635
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,100
No doubt it will be covered
on the exam next Monday. Okay,

636
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,740
you do this here at room
temperature in the dark.

637
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,430
You hit the bro Ammonium ion first.
Remember how we talked about that?

638
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,870
And then you get anti audition. Okay? Now,

639
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,530
but suppose you want to do substitution.
That's what Ziegler dead, right?

640
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:12,790
He didn't add bro mean to the double bond.
He replaced an aloe lake,

641
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,080
hydrogen with bromine.

642
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,920
So those substitutions are typically
free radical substitutions.

643
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,670
So you could have this same compound,
but I show the hydrogens,

644
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,950
because if you have ways to get a
free radical, like a bromine atom,

645
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,680
it can pull off. Get HBR.
I had this, but remember,

646
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:34,600
we use bromine here, not chlorine
because it's slow and selective.

647
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:40,000
So if you use chlorine, uh, it
also takes not only this hydrogen,

648
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:43,480
but also this hydrogen almost
this rapidly. It's not selective,

649
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:46,540
but bromine is selective.
It's uphill, okay?

650
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,870
Then you can react it with
br two and replace, uh,

651
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,770
where the hydrogen is with bromine.
So you've done alkylate Brahman nation,

652
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,490
and of course the, uh, uh, this,

653
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,420
this alcoholic intermediate
was resonant of this farm.

654
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:05,440
You could have put the bromine either
here or here. So you also get that,

655
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,450
which is the same material in the case
shown. But if you had a substituent,

656
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:11,800
it would be in a different position.

657
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,800
If you had something on
the ring substituted here,

658
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,450
it would be a different compound.
Okay? And it also gives a bromine atom.

659
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:23,890
Why is that relevant?
What happens to the bromine atom?

660
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,420
Math,

661
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,990
it gets reused. Theoretical
chain. It goes back.

662
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,070
Let's start. It's a chain reaction. Okay,

663
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,050
so how do you control what you're going
to get? Are you going to get bromine,

664
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:42,850
bromine edition or alcoholic substitution?
Right?

665
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,900
Can you think of any way of controlling
which of these you put bromine in?

666
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,640
Which of these things is going to operate?

667
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:50,980
Okay?

668
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,810
Is there a way any handle you have on it?

669
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:57,640
Matt can use photo initiation to get
the rat if you use notice this one? Yes,

670
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,140
it's done in the dark. Right? If we
don't, if we can't get the radical,

671
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:05,700
we won't do this one. Okay, so one,
I want ideas to keep it in the dark,

672
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,440
right? Don't use the initiator.
Okay. Now suppose we want,

673
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:13,080
so that'll allow us to do this one,
that dark one.

674
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,870
How do we get this one to happen?
Well,

675
00:44:15,871 --> 00:44:19,290
you might say we use light
or using initiator, right?

676
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,650
But this can still happen.
If you have the light on,

677
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:26,610
you can still get that right.
It doesn't require dark.

678
00:44:26,611 --> 00:44:29,220
It's just this one requires light.
Okay,

679
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:31,890
so this one would also be
going on but another way,

680
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,580
which is to minimize the
concentration of br too.

681
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,340
Now why does that have
anything to do with it?

682
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,680
This is a really interesting thing about
the kinetics of the top reaction, right?

683
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,890
It's second order in br too.

684
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,500
That looks really weird.

685
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:56,610
Why do you need two molecules
of bromine in order to do this?

686
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,210
Yeah.

687
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,790
The reason is that you want to make,

688
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,310
when you get the Br plus coming on,

689
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,160
br minus is coming off from br too.

690
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,520
So you have to get br minus and in fact
br minus is stabilized by reacting with

691
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:17,910
Vr too to give br three minus.

692
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,240
So in fact what happens is that the br,

693
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:26,270
the second VR two helps the bromide
leave from br plus in a non polar solvent

694
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:31,410
like this, right? So it's second
order. So that means if you,

695
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:36,411
if you have a really low concentration
of br to this one gets really slow

696
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:41,080
because it's a bad leaving
group, right? It's like make,

697
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:46,310
making the BR minus leave by putting
br two in is like making Ooh lead by

698
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:51,140
putting a proton on it. Make it a better
leaving group. Okay, so we want to,

699
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,320
if we minimize the concentration
of br two will slow this one down.

700
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,110
But that reaction with
VR too is very fast.

701
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,550
Remember the first step of
this is is endothermic is slow,

702
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,400
but that's step is really fast.
Okay.

703
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,520
So we can tolerate a low
concentration of br for this purpose.

704
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:10,980
But how are you going to do it?
Right?

705
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,270
Cause suppose you'd put in just a TD
about have just a teeny amount of br two

706
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:17,520
there. Okay. This starts in,

707
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:22,521
but quickly you've exhausted the br
two and now the radical chain stops.

708
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,620
Right? And that's the end of the
line right now you could say,

709
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:29,550
I'll just, I'll, I'll,

710
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:34,410
I'll very carefully run in
br to very slowly, right?

711
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,800
Just to balance out.
But when you put a drop in,

712
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,690
the bromine concentration is
higher in that drop locally, right?

713
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:46,770
So you're going to get this reaction
because of the local high concentration of

714
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:48,810
br too.
Right?

715
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,280
But this is where it Siegler comes
in with his clever NBS molecule.

716
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,080
This looks like it's tedious to
impossible to maintain a really low

717
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,350
concentration of br too,
while it's being consumed all the time.

718
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,120
But notice that this
reaction also yielded Hbr,

719
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,450
right?
Whenever that happens.

720
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,870
And if we have envy and Bravo
[inaudible] sucks in amid plus Hbr,

721
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:21,120
that's the reaction we looked at on the
previous slide that destroys and Bromo

722
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:24,280
sucks.
Cinnamint takes it back to succeed him it.

723
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,950
And remember what the other product was.

724
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,920
Okay.
B

725
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,710
R two.
So isn't this neat?

726
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,790
Whenever a br two bollock
tool gets used up,

727
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,310
a new br two molecule is
created by this reaction, right?

728
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,490
So it automatically maintains the
minimum possible concentration of br too.

729
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,720
Every time you use it,
you get a new one.

730
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,470
You don't have to sit there
with your bureaucrat trying
to run it in very slowly.

731
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,670
So that's the trick with an
Bromo sucks and emit now.

732
00:47:57,671 --> 00:48:02,350
So we've looked here at a lot of
different Alec stabilizations, right?

733
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,540
But dining's can also be conjugated.
And how much is that worth?

734
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,140
Okay. We can look at the heat
of combustion of this one,

735
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:12,760
which where they're not conjugated,

736
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:15,820
and this one where there's
across across a single bond,

737
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,620
these isomers of one another,

738
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,280
and you can see that it's the
conjugation seems to be worth about seven

739
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:26,281
kilocalories per mole or down here it
seems to be worth about eight kilocalories

740
00:48:26,711 --> 00:48:31,360
per mole. But these numbers, all of
their claimed to be very precise,

741
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,480
are big numbers,
right?

742
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,770
And that I think that precision might
be a little bit overstated, right?

743
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,520
If you look at the heat of hydrogenation,
that heat that's given off,

744
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:46,900
when you add h two then you can see that
these are all 30 I'm going to let you

745
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:51,710
go after you make two
guesses. Okay, now guess what?

746
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,610
It should eat this double bond.
The stove on this double bond,

747
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,790
they all give off 30
kilocalories per mole of heat.

748
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:03,030
How much should this one give off when
you hydrogenate both double bonds.

749
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,410
16 lean.

750
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,450
How about this one
now,

751
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,460
how about this one?
Something bigger.

752
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,860
So conjugation, this one is more stable.
It doesn't give off as much heat, right?

753
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,630
And it seems to be stable by about
four kilocalories per mole. Okay.

754
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:35,290
Now you can go.
