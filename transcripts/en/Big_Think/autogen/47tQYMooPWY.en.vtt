00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889
ways to approach the problem with men
 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.440
ways to approach the problem with men
one is when you're looking at labor

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450
one is when you're looking at labor
 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.330
one is when you're looking at labor
force participation if you're looking at

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340
force participation if you're looking at
 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.179
force participation if you're looking at
prime age males you have a lot of folks

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189
prime age males you have a lot of folks
 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.600
prime age males you have a lot of folks
who don't have college educations who've

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610
who don't have college educations who've
 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.300
who don't have college educations who've
basically seen the labor market you know

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310
basically seen the labor market you know
 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.099
basically seen the labor market you know
their labor market position deteriorate

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109
their labor market position deteriorate
 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.589
their labor market position deteriorate
very very fast and the reaction has been

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599
very very fast and the reaction has been
 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.450
very very fast and the reaction has been
to withdraw from the conventional world

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460
to withdraw from the conventional world
 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.689
to withdraw from the conventional world
of work now you know what's the problem

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699
of work now you know what's the problem
 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.250
of work now you know what's the problem
with that well the big problem is when

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260
with that well the big problem is when
 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.079
with that well the big problem is when
you're not attached to the labor force

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089
you're not attached to the labor force
 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.000
you're not attached to the labor force
you also start losing your connection to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010
you also start losing your connection to
 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.889
you also start losing your connection to
a lot of these basic bourgeois norms and

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899
a lot of these basic bourgeois norms and
 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.580
a lot of these basic bourgeois norms and
habits that are you know part of you

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590
habits that are you know part of you
 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.340

know life as a citizen in a free society

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350
know life as a citizen in a free society
 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.740
know life as a citizen in a free society
and then you're more inclined to engage

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750
and then you're more inclined to engage
 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.139
and then you're more inclined to engage
in pathological behaviors you're more

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149
in pathological behaviors you're more
 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.270
in pathological behaviors you're more
inclined to kind of have these masculine

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280
inclined to kind of have these masculine
 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.160
inclined to kind of have these masculine
impulses to provide and what have you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170
impulses to provide and what have you
 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.470
impulses to provide and what have you
kind of corrode and manifest themselves

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480
kind of corrode and manifest themselves
 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.009
kind of corrode and manifest themselves
these really ugly forms so that I think

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019
these really ugly forms so that I think
 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.450
these really ugly forms so that I think
is what I think is the biggest and most

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460
is what I think is the biggest and most
 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.369
is what I think is the biggest and most
pressing problem that is particularly

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379
pressing problem that is particularly
 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.919
pressing problem that is particularly
pressing in the context of an economic

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929
pressing in the context of an economic
 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:08.880
pressing in the context of an economic
downturn like the one we're going

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890
downturn like the one we're going
 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.380
downturn like the one we're going
through

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390
 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.750
well I think that there are lots of big

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760
well I think that there are lots of big
 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.390
well I think that there are lots of big
structural changes that have happened in

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400
structural changes that have happened in
 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.070
structural changes that have happened in
the economy and they've been going on

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080
the economy and they've been going on
 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.410
the economy and they've been going on
for decades but now they're accelerating

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420
for decades but now they're accelerating
 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.080
for decades but now they're accelerating
by virtue of this downturn as happens in

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090
by virtue of this downturn as happens in
 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.230
by virtue of this downturn as happens in
any downturn and you know in broadest

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240
any downturn and you know in broadest
 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.760
any downturn and you know in broadest
sense it's this idea that you know

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770
sense it's this idea that you know
 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.140
sense it's this idea that you know
you're moving from a world that relies

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150
you're moving from a world that relies
 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.420
you're moving from a world that relies
on brawn to one that relies increasingly

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430
on brawn to one that relies increasingly
 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.550
on brawn to one that relies increasingly
on brainpower but beyond that it's also

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560
on brainpower but beyond that it's also
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.410
on brainpower but beyond that it's also
a world that relies on certain kinds of

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420
a world that relies on certain kinds of
 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.870
a world that relies on certain kinds of
social intelligence on being able to

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880
social intelligence on being able to
 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.940
social intelligence on being able to
kind of construct networks that can be a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950
kind of construct networks that can be a
 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.820
kind of construct networks that can be a
value to you that can enhance your

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830
value to you that can enhance your
 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.249
value to you that can enhance your
resilience in a rapidly changing economy

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259
resilience in a rapidly changing economy
 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.300
resilience in a rapidly changing economy
and again if you basically rely on your

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310
and again if you basically rely on your
 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.180
and again if you basically rely on your
strength in order to earn you an income

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190
strength in order to earn you an income
 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.790
strength in order to earn you an income
in a way that's not terribly specialized

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800
in a way that's not terribly specialized
 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.950
in a way that's not terribly specialized
in a way that requires you to take you

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
in a way that requires you to take you
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.780
in a way that requires you to take you
know direction but not necessarily even

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790
know direction but not necessarily even
 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.389
know direction but not necessarily even
have to take it very well that's just

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399
have to take it very well that's just
 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.370
have to take it very well that's just
gone and it's not only gone in the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380
gone and it's not only gone in the
 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.960
gone and it's not only gone in the
United States it's gone in societies

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970
United States it's gone in societies
 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.180
United States it's gone in societies
like you know China and increasingly

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190
like you know China and increasingly
 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.160
like you know China and increasingly
India societies that we think of as you

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170
India societies that we think of as you
 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.680
India societies that we think of as you
know nipping at our heels but this kind

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690
know nipping at our heels but this kind
 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.270
know nipping at our heels but this kind
of large-scale dislocation is taking

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280
of large-scale dislocation is taking
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.010
of large-scale dislocation is taking
place almost everywhere and then

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020
place almost everywhere and then
 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.720
place almost everywhere and then
societies in which it's not taking place

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730
societies in which it's not taking place
 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.020
societies in which it's not taking place
are being badly left behind in a lot of

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030
are being badly left behind in a lot of
 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.910
are being badly left behind in a lot of
other important respects I think if Iran

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920
other important respects I think if Iran
 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.289
other important respects I think if Iran
does a really good example of this as a

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299
does a really good example of this as a
 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.449
does a really good example of this as a
society in which men retain this kind of

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459
society in which men retain this kind of
 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.640
society in which men retain this kind of
very dominant position but at the cost

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650
very dominant position but at the cost
 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.540
very dominant position but at the cost
of economic stagnation

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550
 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.600
well I think on the global scale it's

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610
well I think on the global scale it's
 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.120
well I think on the global scale it's
more it's more interesting because it's

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130
more it's more interesting because it's
 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.060
more it's more interesting because it's
a lot sharper if you look at China for

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070
a lot sharper if you look at China for
 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.050
a lot sharper if you look at China for
example where you have this large

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
example where you have this large
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.120
example where you have this large
population of surplus males you're

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130
population of surplus males you're
 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.380
population of surplus males you're
talking about tens of millions of people

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
talking about tens of millions of people
 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.290
talking about tens of millions of people
who could theoretically contribute to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300
who could theoretically contribute to
 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.140
who could theoretically contribute to
chaotic violence to networked violence

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150
chaotic violence to networked violence
 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.840
chaotic violence to networked violence
gang violence etc if they don't find

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850
gang violence etc if they don't find
 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.470
gang violence etc if they don't find
some way of you know being stable

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480
some way of you know being stable
 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.360
some way of you know being stable
productive contributing members of the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370
productive contributing members of the
 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.000
productive contributing members of the
broader society and I think that Iran

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010
broader society and I think that Iran
 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.640
broader society and I think that Iran
similarly is a society in which the kind

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
similarly is a society in which the kind
 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.710
similarly is a society in which the kind
of taste for male dominance is such that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720
of taste for male dominance is such that
 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.320
of taste for male dominance is such that
it will lead to entrenched poverty for

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
it will lead to entrenched poverty for
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.260
it will lead to entrenched poverty for
long periods of time you see this across

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270
long periods of time you see this across
 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.550
long periods of time you see this across
much of the world it's interesting the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
much of the world it's interesting the
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.530
much of the world it's interesting the
extent which female literacy predicts

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
extent which female literacy predicts
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.790
extent which female literacy predicts
whether or not a society is going to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800
whether or not a society is going to
 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.770
whether or not a society is going to
experience an economic take off there's

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780
experience an economic take off there's
 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.330
experience an economic take off there's
almost you know there's such a tight

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
almost you know there's such a tight
 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.620
almost you know there's such a tight
correlation between these two things

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630
correlation between these two things
 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.990
correlation between these two things
it's quite remarkable similarly when you

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000
it's quite remarkable similarly when you
 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.610
it's quite remarkable similarly when you
look at domestic violence within a

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
look at domestic violence within a
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.560
look at domestic violence within a
society and how strongly that correlates

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570
society and how strongly that correlates
 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.870
society and how strongly that correlates
with how externally aggressive that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880
with how externally aggressive that
 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.910
with how externally aggressive that
society is or the level of political

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920
society is or the level of political
 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.070
society is or the level of political
instability that society experiences

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080
instability that society experiences
 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.480
instability that society experiences
it's pretty interesting it again men

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490
it's pretty interesting it again men
 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.920
