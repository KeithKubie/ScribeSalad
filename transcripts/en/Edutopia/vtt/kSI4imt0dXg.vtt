00:00:00.326 --> 00:00:05.346
&gt;&gt;Catherine: These are the keys to
participating in a conversation fully.

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.206
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Sometimes we all need
a little bit of a kick-starter

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:10.446
to feel like we can contribute.

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:21.156
&gt;&gt;Children are going to struggle a bit,
depending on how confident they feel,

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:26.706
in speaking up in class and yet
this teacher wants everybody

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:28.606
in the class to feel valued.

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:32.026
So the kids are all learning phrases

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:36.316
that can inspire other kids
to contribute more easily.

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:39.056
&gt;&gt;Catherine: We're trying
to build a conversation here

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:41.516
that is a community of
caring and respect.

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:44.206
So look at your talk
moves on the table today,

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:45.796
and I have a post-it note here for you.

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:52.156
&gt;&gt;Talk moves are essentially sentence
starters that students can use

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.846
to get themselves into the conversation,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.116
and to draw other people
into the conversation.

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.616
&gt;&gt;I taped the talk moves
right on the table,

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:09.156
so that they would be ever
present in everyone's mind.

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:12.406
&gt;&gt;Today, I want you to keep
track of your talk moves.

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:16.416
&gt;&gt;Every time they used a talk move,
they'd put a check on their sticky note.

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.116
&gt;&gt;So if somebody at your table looks

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:20.156
like they don't have a
talk move check mark yet,

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:23.986
invite them into the
conversation. How could you do that?

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:25.536
&gt;&gt;Philip: Say, like,
"What do you think?"

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:27.826
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Definitely.
Would you use their name?

00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:28.486
&gt;&gt;Philip: Yeah.

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:29.816
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Awesome.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:36.166
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Everything about activating
a child's cognitive skills begins

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.096
with activating their
social connectedness.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:44.776
Verbalizing and using language, and
working with peers creates that kind

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:49.846
of social stimulus that drives
the development of the brain.

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:52.886
&gt;&gt;Philip: I pretty much look
at the thing every single time,

00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:56.236
to see if there's something I can
say, like a clarifying question.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:02:01.086
&gt;&gt;Can you explain more about,
like why you would get in trouble?

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:06.426
&gt;&gt;Salma: He spray painted something
on his rival soccer team's school.

00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:13.296
&gt;&gt;When you ask a person a clarifying
question, it's either, "Oh,

00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:16.256
I heard you said," or, "Can
you repeat what you said?"

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.936
or "To add onto."

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:19.756
&gt;&gt;Catherine: They help enormously

00:02:20.126 --> 00:02:24.416
with language learners. They
give everybody a platform to jump

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:28.646
into a conversation, because half the
sentence is there for them already.

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:33.026
But they also challenge other types
of learners who may be accustomed

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:35.796
to doing independent work,
and they need a bridge

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:38.006
to collaborate more with a group.

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:42.706
It pushes kids out of their comfort
zone of social conversations,

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:45.216
and it moves them more
towards a professional

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:47.746
and an academic kind of register.

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:50.916
&gt;&gt;Student: All his accomplishments
and tasks,

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:55.366
like all the other marches he
had, like Martin Luther King--

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:04.576
&gt;&gt;Student: I heard you say
previous marches. Like,

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:06.346
does it say it say anything
about what he was involved with?

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:09.196
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, like he was
in Martin Luther King marches.

00:03:09.486 --> 00:03:12.956
&gt;&gt;Catherine: I do talk moves because,
in order to have a great discussion,

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.286
everyone has to feel like
they're a part of it, and valued.

00:03:16.516 --> 00:03:21.786
And when they walk away, they really
have bridged a gap with someone

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:25.716
that maybe they wouldn't necessarily
talked to, or talked to on that level.

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:30.556
&gt;&gt;Pamela: This teacher is aware of
children having different levels

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:34.476
of comfort and discomfort, of
making their skills visible,

00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:39.726
and she's getting kids to
support each other's participation

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:41.746
with these talk moves.

00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:48.156
This teacher created a pathway for every
single child in this class to belong.
