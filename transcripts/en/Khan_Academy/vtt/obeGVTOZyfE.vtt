00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.750
I've talked a lot about how our
change in internal energy

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.830
of a system can be due to some
heat being added to the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.530
system, or some work being added
to the system, or being

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.840
done to the system.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.700
And I'm going to write it again
the other way, just

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.900
because you see it both ways.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.370
You could say that the change
in internal energy could be

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.900
the heat added to the
system minus the

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.500
work done by the system.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.820
So there's two questions
that might naturally

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.000
spring up in your head.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.250
One is, how is heat added to or
taken away from a system?

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.000
And how is work done, or done
by, or done to a system?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.370
The heat, I think, is
fairly intuitive.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.720
If I have a-- and we'll be a
little bit more precise in the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.510
future of this, but I just want
to give you the sense of

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.500
what we're talking about-- if I
have some system here, some

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.560
particles in some type
of a canister.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.650
And it's at temperature, I don't
know, let's say it's a

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.820
temperature T1.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.170
I'll even give it a-- say
it's at 300 kelvin.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.860
If I want to add heat to this
system, what I can do is I can

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.010
place another system right
next to it, maybe

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.900
right next to it.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.610
Who knows what size it is.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.280
And it's got some
particles there.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.610
But its temperature is much,
much, much higher.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.095
So this system's temperature,
I'll say temp T2 is equal to,

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:39.210
I don't know, let's say
it's 1000 kelvin.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.810
I'm just making up numbers.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.900
So what's going to happen in
this situation, you're going

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.880
to have heat transferred from
this second system to the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.560
first system.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.780
So you're going to have heat
going into the system.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.870
Now, heat and, work and even
internal energy, this goes

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.290
back to our conversation
of macrostates versus

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.240
microstates.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.620
Heat is changing the macrostate
of our systems.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.120
This system is going to
lose temperature.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.750
This system's going to
gain temperature.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.110
But we know what's happening
on a micro level.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.650
These molecules are going
to lose kinetic energy.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.665
These molecules are going
to gain kinetic energy.

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:15.600
How is that actually
happening?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.040
Well, we assume that there's
some type of a container here.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.170
Maybe it's a solid wall.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.320
These molecules are going to
bump into that wall, and are

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.260
going to make the particles in
that wall vibrate, and then

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.350
they're going to make the
particles in the green

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.150
container's walls vibrate.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.860
And so when the green
container's molecules touch

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.960
the wall, they're going to
bounce off with even more

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.250
kinetic energy, with even more
velocity, because of that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.300
vibration in the wall will push
them back even further.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.090
So that's essentially how you
get this transfer of kinetic

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.690
energy, or this transfer
of heat.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.820
I think that's fairly
intuitive.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.240
If we put this next to a cooler,
a system with lower

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.330
temperature, we would
lose kinetic energy,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.120
or would lose heat.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.390
And there's other ways
that we can do it.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.580
We could compress the-- well,
I don't want to talk about

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.050
that just now, because that'll
be touching on work.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.740
So, how can we add or subtract
work to a system?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.420
And this one's a little
bit more interesting.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.255
Let's go back to our
piston example.

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:14.280
Let me just draw some
lines here.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.680
So I have my container.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.580
There you go.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.240
It's got a little movable
ceiling to it.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.930
That's my piston.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.150
And go back to the example.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.530
Because what we're going to be
dealing with-- especially once

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.810
I go into the pressure volume
diagram, the PV diagram that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.610
I'm about to go into--
we want to deal with

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.270
quasi-static processes.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.440
Processes that are always close
enough to equilibrium

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.990
that we feel OK talking
about macrostates like

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.110
pressure and volume.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.020
Remember, that if we just did
something crazy and the whole

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.040
system is in flux,
those macrostates

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.260
aren't defined anymore.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.140
So we want to do a quasi-static
process.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.660
So I'll have pebbles instead
of one big rock.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.280
I'll draw the pebbles a little
bigger this time.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.270
And I have some pressure.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.250
So that's my piston and
it's being kept

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.120
down by these rocks.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.430
It's being kept up by the
pressure of the gas.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.700
The gas is bumping into
this ceiling.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.770
It's bumping into everything.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.310
The pressure at every point in
the container is the same.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.110
It's at equilibrium.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.300
Now, what happens in that
example where I removed one

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.350
rock from that?

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.445
So let me copy and paste that.

00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:29.270
So if I remove one rock from
this thing right here.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.000
Copy and paste.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.910
So that's the same thing.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.060
Now let me remove a rock.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.900
I'll remove this top
one, was removed.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.220
What's going to happen?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.150
Well I now have less weight
pushing down on the piston,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.600
and I have a certain amount
of pressure pushing up.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.620
The system, it'll very
temporarily go out of

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.220
equilibrium, but it'll be a very
small difference in how

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.120
much we're pressing down on it,
so hopefully it won't be a

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.940
huge change in our
equilibrium.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.500
We'll stay pretty close to it.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.790
But we know from the previous
example, instead of this thing

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.390
flying up, it's going to
shift up a little bit.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.300
This is just going to shift
up a little bit.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.690
Right when we do it it's going
to be like that, right there.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.150
And let me fill in that part
with black, because it's not

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.553
like the space disappeared.

00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:26.450
So let me fill that
in right there.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.570
So our little piston will move
up a very small amount.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.040
And what I claim is, when this
happened, when I removed this

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.110
little pebble from here, the
system did some work.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.010
And let's just think
about that.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.800
So work, according to the
definitions that you learned

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.810
in first-year physics, and when
you're using classical or

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.200
dealing with classical
mechanics, you learn that work

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.160
is equal to force
times distance.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.910
So if I'm claiming that when
this piston moved up a little

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.570
bit, when I removed that pebble,
I'm claiming that this

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.420
system here did some work.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.820
So I'm claiming that it applied
a force to this

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.200
piston, and it applied
that force to the

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.160
piston for some distance.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.660
So let's figure out what that
is, and if we can somehow

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.380
relate it to other macro
properties that we know

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.890
reasonably well.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.940
Well we know the pressure
and the volume, right?

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.760
We know the pressure that's
being exerted on the piston,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.070
at least at this
point in time.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.750
And what's pressure?

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.845
Pressure is equal to
force per area.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.420
Remember, this piston, you're
just seeing it from the side,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.630
but it's a kind of a flat plate
or a flat ceiling on top

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.800
of this thing.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.330
And at what distance
did it move it?

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.860
You know I could blow
it up a little bit.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.980
It moved it some-- I didn't draw
it too big here-- some x,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.230
some distance x.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.520
So this change, it moved it up
some distance x there, right?

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.640
So what is the force that
it pushed it up?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.300
Well, the force, we know
its pressure, the

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.720
pressure's force per area.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.550
So if we want to know the force,
we have to multiply

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.020
pressure times area.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.370
If we multiply both sides of
this times area, we get force.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.620
So we're essentially saying
the area of this little

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.025
ceiling to this container right
there, you know, it

00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:34.060
could be, I could draw with some
depth, but I think you

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.800
know what I'm talking about.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.032
It has some area.

00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:39.870
It's probably the same area as
the base of the container.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.450
So we could say that the force
being applied by our system--

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.280
let me do it in a new color--
the force is equal to our

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:57.580
pressure of the system, times
the area of the ceiling of our

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.470
container of the piston.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.950
Now that's the force.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.080
Now what's the distance?

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.390
The distance is this
x over here.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.680
The distance is-- I'll do it
in blue-- it's this change

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.090
right here.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.510
I didn't draw it too big,
but that's that x.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.850
Now let's see if we can
relate this somehow.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.190
Let me draw it a little
bit bigger.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.035
And I'll try to draw in
three dimensions.

00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:21.650
So let me draw the piston.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.100
What color did I do it in?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.460
I did it in that brown color.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.480
So our piston looks something--
I'll draw it as a

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.300
elipse-- the piston
looks like that.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.679
And it got pushed up.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.130
So it got pushed up
some distance x.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.669
Let me see how good
I can-- whoops.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.400
Let me copy and paste
that same--

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.503
So the piston gets pushed
up some distance x.

00:08:48.503 --> 00:08:51.711
Let me draw that.

00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:54.217
It got pushed up some
distance x.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.930
And we're claiming that our--
oh sorry, this is the force.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.180
Sorry, let me be clear.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.700
This is the force, and
this is the distance.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.650
So work is equal to our force,
which is our pressure times

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:16.670
our area, times the distance.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.870
I want to be very
clear with that.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.990
Because when I wrote this I
said, OK, the force that we're

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.430
applying is the pressure we're
applying, times the area of

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.670
our cylinder.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.620
This is the area of our
cylinder right here.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.130
That's the area of our
cylinder right there.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.880
So if you do the pressure
times this

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.610
area, you get the force.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.940
And then we moved it
some distance x.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.800
Now, we could rearrange this.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.230
We could say that the work is
equal to our pressure times

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.480
our area, times x.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.660
What's this?

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:57.620
What's this area, this area
right here, times x?

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.420
Well that's going to be our
change in volume, right?

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.530
This area times some height
is some volume.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.090
And that's essentially how
much our container

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.210
has changed in volume.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.060
When we pushed this piston up,
the volume of our container

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.760
has increased.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.610
You can see that, even looking
from the side.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.760
Our rectangle got a
little bit taller.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.500
When you look at it with a
little bit of depth, you see

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.450
the rectangle also didn't
get taller.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.240
We have some surface area.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.560
Surface area times
height is volume.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.840
So this right here, this
term right here,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.820
is a change in volume.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.000
So we can write work now in
terms of things that we know.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.220
We can write work done
by our system.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.985
Work done is equal to pressure
times our change in volume.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.560
Now this has a very interesting
repercussion here.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.800
So we could-- actually many--
we can rewrite our internal

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.050
energy formulas.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.970
So, for example, we can write
internal change and internal

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.640
energy is now equal to heat
added to the system, plus the

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.565
work-- let me say minus the
work done by the system.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.430
Well what is the work
done by the system?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.010
Well it's the pressure of the
system times how much the

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.990
system expanded.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.470
In this case, the system is
pushing these marbles, or

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.940
these pieces of sand up.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.470
It's doing work.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.140
If we were doing it the other
way, if we were adding the

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.430
sand, and we were pushing down
on our little canister, we

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.300
would be doing work
to the system.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.460
So this is the situation where
I'm doing here, where I'm

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.880
removing the sand and the piston
goes up, essentially

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.300
the gas is pushing up on
the piston, the system

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.880
is doing the work.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.000
So if we go back to our little
formula, that internal energy

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.170
is heat minus the work done by
a system, so done by, then we

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.430
can write this as, this is equal
to the heat added to the

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:05.460
system minus this quantity, the
pressure of the system,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.565
times the change in volume.

00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:11.020
And it's interesting, if the
volume is increasing, then the

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.520
system is doing work.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.230
And this applies-- we're going
to talk a lot more about

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.640
engines in the future-- but
that's how engines do work.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.410
They have a little explosion
that goes on inside of a

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.580
cylinder that pushes up on the
piston, and then that piston

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.150
moves a bunch of other stuff
that eventually turns wheels.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.850
So the volume increases, you're
actually doing work.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.590
So I'm going to leave you
there in this video.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.470
In the next video, we're going
to relate this, this new way

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.780
of writing our internal energy
formula, and we're going to

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.050
relate it to the PV diagram.
