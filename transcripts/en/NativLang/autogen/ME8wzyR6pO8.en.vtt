00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.380
 China has a long tradition of linguistics. 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.580
 Do you know that Chinese scholars have long studied the pronunciation of ancient languages? 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.600
 It has been several centuries ahead of the Europeans' formation of the ancestral language. 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.380
 This video will tell the story of the Chinese revealing the ancient imperial language. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 The pronunciation of Chinese has always caused me a headache. 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.380
 It started on the day when Grandpa gave me a dictionary and several tapes as a birthday present. 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.580
 But recently, I have delved into hundreds of pages in Chinese history. 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.880
 Do you know what I found? I am not alone. 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.500
 Many Chinese scholars are also deeply confused about the pronunciation of Chinese, and this history is quite long. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 For example, this buddy. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.760
 The scholar began to construct language in the 1840s. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.180
 I have already told the story of constructing a language: Compare a set of languages, 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420
 Divided into a language tree, 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.140
 Finally, construct their common ancestors. 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.580
 However, this story is a bit different. This scholar's name is Chen Hao. 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.760
 He is faced with a historical problem that has not been solved for hundreds of years: 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.740
 How do you let the classic literature read its original sound? 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.960
 How to let the poems written by the ancients rhyme again? 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.000
 The problem is: you don't have a recording, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420
 No phonetic symbols, 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.680
 Not even ABC. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.580
 The object you want to deal with is the "word", which is the "Chinese character" we discussed earlier. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.660
 Each word represents a monosyllabic word or word formation component. 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.500
 Chen Yu looked at the book in front of him. This book has been around for a long time, and it is even dull. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.440
 But the story behind it is quite exciting. 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.840
 Before 1261, a Mr. Lu (Lu Fayan) invited eight friends to gather together overnight. 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 They have a wine companion and talk about it. 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.880
 Late at night, the friendly chat ended and a fierce debate began. 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 The subject of the debate is the precise pronunciation of ancient documents. 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.240
 "The reading of the northerners is wrong!" "No, the talents of the South are wrong!" 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.520
 "Don't make a noise!" Lu Fayan dampened his brush. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.860
 I wrote an outline for the later "Chang Yun". 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.160
 The book is finally divided into five volumes. 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.000
 11,000 Chinese characters are classified into four tones. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.200
 Subdivided into different rhymes. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.540
 Then he splits the pronunciation of each Chinese character. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.640
 How to dismantle it? Also find two Chinese characters! 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.120
 The upper word indicates the initial, 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.320
 The lower word indicates the finals including the tones. 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.140
 Take a word for example, it means "Oriental." 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.660
 Its initial is indicated by "de" / tək̚ /, and the final is indicated by "red" / ɦuŋ /. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.620
 According to the pronunciation of the scholar, it reads /tuŋ/. We will discuss the constructed ancient sounds at the end. 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.820
 With this method called "reverse cut", you can get a syllable reading! 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.560
 It's really easy to understand, full of wisdom! 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.800
 But it can't describe the overall appearance of the Chinese phonology. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.280
 In order to solve this problem, the poets need to go further: 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.440
 Arrange such information into a rhyme. 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.460
 The book "Rhythm Mirror" written in the 12th century contains many such rhymes. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.780
 What appears on the screen is the first rhyme in The Mirror. 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.460
 The first label gives the serial number of the rhyme: First. 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.420
 And the finals of Chinese characters: /uŋ/. 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.960
 The top row is the six pronunciation parts of the consonant. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.240
 Below are four tones. 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.180
 Each tone is divided into four "etc.", and "etc." contains more syllable information. 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.760
 However, the interpretation of "equal" is still controversial. 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.820
 Try it out: Help me find an initial that belongs to the "tongue", that is, the tongue of the modern linguistics. 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.440
 "Clear", that is, clear consonants, 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 The word that belongs to the first tone. 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.880
 We got a syllable like this: "East" / tuŋ/. 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.740
 Next to it is a word that belongs to "Second Clear", which is the aspirate consonant, which is "pass" /thuŋ/. 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.400
 "Cloudy" means "dirty" or "muddy", which means a voiced consonant, 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.940
 Then we get the same "/" / ŋ /. 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.400
 well! So what are these circles? 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.900
 What do they mean? 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.380
 "There is no such syllable." 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.020
 So, if you are looking for a "clear" "lip" that belongs to the first tone, 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.860
 You will find that there is no record such as /puŋ/ in this book. 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.280
 However, there is "Peng" / buŋ /, which means "Peng Cao". 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.480
 In this way, you have unearthed the ancient pronunciation, which is the rhyming method of Chinese. 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.850
 For centuries, confident scholars have used this method to read the pronunciation of ancient Chinese syllables. 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.490
 There are 36 initials in the education of Chinese. 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.200
 But Chen Hao does not believe this conclusion. 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.340
 He combed the ancient reverse cut, 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.420
 Carefully tie the initials and initials, finals and finals. 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.600
 There are several problems with the ties. 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.260
 The number of initials in Chinese is not 36, but 41. 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.220
 There are 5 initials to be separated. 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.440
 The problem is not limited to this: The word sound in the rhyme picture is different from the "cut rhyme". 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.020
 This is two different stages of Chinese. 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.280
 Subsequent research will prove that the early nature of (cut rhyme) is already very complicated. 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.100
 It is a hodgepodge of several ancient Chinese pronunciations. * * This view is still debated in the academic world. 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.460
 Recall the argument they had about the South and the North on that night. 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.580
 This seems to be true. 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.480
 But after Chen Hao’s efforts, we only got many categories. Different boxes. 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.880
 Tone box. 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.640
 The initials box. 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.440
 The box of the finals. 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.500
 I can't stand guessing and guessing. 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.460
 What exactly is the actual pronunciation of these boxes? 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.040
 At the beginning of the 20th century, a Swede traveled to China to study these ancient rhymes and rhymes. 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.520
 Then add the most important piece to this puzzle: the various Chinese dialects that have been passed down to the present. 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.420
 Gao Benhan is obsessed with this. 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.580
 He designed the survey plan and went to various places to record dialects. 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.020
 With the results of the survey, different rhymes are filled with real pronunciations. 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.100
 How did he do that? Let's use the fourth tone, which is called "into the sound". 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.820
 In the coastal areas of southern China, the sound word has a stop. 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.220
 For example, this ancient Chinese character means "country". 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.760
 It is pronounced /kuo˧˥/ in Mandarin, but Cantonese is pronounced /kwok̚˧/. 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.760
 Which dialect is more ancient? 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:35.160
 Let's take a look at the list of "Dialects" listed by Gao Benhan, the last three languages: Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese. 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.440
 These three languages ​​use "out-of-domain sounds". 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.620
 Basically, when Chinese characters borrow these languages, the pronunciations that these people think are. 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.420
 Among the three languages, the word "country" also has the "k" at the end. 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:56.760
 The evidence all points to the ancient pronunciation of the word "country" ending in consonants, /kwək̚˧/. 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.880
 Linguists continue to perfect the structure of speech and depict the voice of ancient Chinese. 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.980
 Although such pronunciation is like a foreign language in today's Mandarin. 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.200
 They even revealed some important differences that Gao Benhan did not notice, such as "heavy bonds." 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.220
 They also let me learn the Chinese pronunciation in this effort, and learned another thing: 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.580
 This is not a single language called "Ancient Chinese." 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:29.220
 No, this is a period in the history of language called "Chinese Middle Ages." 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.200
 "Middle Ages"...because there is a more ancient language waiting to be discovered, 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.400
 It is still a thousand years older than "Chinese for Middle Ages". 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.180
 Maybe one day, we can understand the rhyming way of ancient Chinese. 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.740
