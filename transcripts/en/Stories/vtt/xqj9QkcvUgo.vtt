00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:07.197
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:08.780
NARRATOR: Off the
coast of California,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.780
scientists from
UC Santa Cruz are

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.720
scouring the ocean
for what they hope

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.420
is the key to
fighting a new breed

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.673
of drug-resistant superbugs.

00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:18.710
BRYSON VOIRIN: So we're
out here in Monterey Bay

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.876
looking for the next potential
medical breakthrough.

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:22.210
But how are we going to do that?

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.250
ROGER LININGTON: So the
first thing we need to do

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.180
is make our scuba diver
collect the samples.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.910
And so we're going to
take this ring down there.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.110
And we're going to make
pairs of duplicate samples

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.490
during the dive in as
many discrete locations

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.970
as we can, and then
take these samples back

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.440
to the lab for workup.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.330
BRIAN VOIRIN: And how
cold is the water?

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.530
ROGER LININGTON: Oh.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.695
The water's 55.

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:39.550
BRIAN VOIRIN: You've
got a dry suit.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.180
ROGER LININGTON:
I've got my dry suit.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.650
You're wearing a wet suit.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.566
We'll see how we fair.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.990
So there hasn't been
a new antibiotic

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.520
developed in about 20 years.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.840
And the rate of resistance
to existing antibiotics

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.780
in hospitals can run
upwards of 40% to 60%.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.730
Given that it takes
about 15 years

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.510
to bring a drug to market,
there was a real pressing crisis

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080
in the antibiotic
discovery arena.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.710
NARRATOR: According to the CDC,
at least two million people

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.200
in the US become infected
with drug-resistant bacteria.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.510
And at least 23,000
die each year

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.320
as a result of these infections.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.180
BRYSON VOIRIN: I mean,
you say it's a crisis.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.860
I mean, if you had to rate
it on a scale of 1 to 10,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.680
where are we at on
the antibiotic crisis.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.520
ROGER LININGTON: 11.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.820
It's very serious.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.070
We are about to return to
a pre-antibiotic era, where

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.080
even basic surgeries and
other medical procedures

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.200
can lead to death by septicemia
and other untreatable bacterial

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.940
pathogens.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.440
NARRATOR: The history
of antibiotics

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.450
is relatively short.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.600
In 1928, Scottish
scientist Alexander Fleming

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.560
discovered penicillin
capable of killing bacteria.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.350
Scientists Howard
Florey and Ernst Chain

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.890
then mass-produced it in
time for use on Allied forces

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.040
during World War II,
the first example

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.310
in which more soldiers died
in battle than from infection.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.481
It drastically changed the
world of modern medicine

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.730
and extended the average
human lifespan significantly.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.361
Not many more antibiotics have
been developed since then.

00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:15.860
BRYSON VOIRIN: Now, why has the
discovery of new antibiotics

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.390
kind of fallen by the wayside
in the past 30 or 40 years?

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.181
ROGER LININGTON:
Developing new antibiotics

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.340
is not the most effective
way to make a steady profit.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.450
If you make a new drug
for asthma or diabetes,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.930
that's a drug which patients
will take likely every day

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.210
for the rest of their lives.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.250
So from an economic
perspective, drug companies

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.930
don't have much incentive to
develop new antibiotic drugs.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.000
NARRATOR: As Fleming accepted
his Nobel Prize in 1945,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.940
he warned that the misuse
and overuse of antibiotics

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.630
could result in
drug-resistant bacteria.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.610
And he was right.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.050
ROGER LININGTON: If you put
antibiotics into heavy use,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.192
then eventually
bacteria will find a way

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:54.650
to become resistant
to those drugs.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.290
If it hasn't been helped by
the poor use of antibiotics

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.830
for people with
flu-like symptoms,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.080
if you have a viral infection,
antibiotics don't help.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.530
And the more you
take antibiotics,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.320
the more you are
helping to sort of build

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.800
that pool of resistant strains.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.080
BRYSON VOIRIN: It's kind of
like the boy who cried wolf.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.380
Like, if you cry
wolf all the time

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.170
and then we actually have a
wolf, then it doesn't work.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.470
ROGER LININGTON: Right.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.970
Exactly.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.330
It's a combination of factors
that have led to this.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.400
NARRATOR: Roger's team of divers
collect sand from the seafloor,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.290
a relatively
understudy environment

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.080
for medical research,
but one that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.130
is rich with unknown chemistry.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.320
These scientists hope that
the microbes within the sand

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.690
will lead to new and powerful
drugs to fight bacteria.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.900
However, the search
area is very large.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.570
And it may take
years to determine

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.714
if these samples hold a cure.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.380
BRYSON VOIRIN: So
let's see the samples.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.660
ROGER LININGTON: OK.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.490
So here we are.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.710
So this is what we managed
to get on this dive.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.001
Although they may look pretty
similar to the naked eye,

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.100
at the microbial level,
every one of these

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.987
is a completely
different population.

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:49.820
BRYSON VOIRIN: And it's
literally just sand.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.153
ROGER LININGTON: It's just sand.

00:03:51.153 --> 00:03:54.100
So this is very low impact
science on the environment,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.870
but the potential
applications are huge.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.026
So what happens next
is we'll take the sand,

00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:00.400
put it on Petri
dishes, and allow

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.560
those microorganisms to grow.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.990
And then, a microbiologist
will look at those

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.947
and select specific species
for study for their chemistry.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.780
BRYSON VOIRIN: So this
could come from this.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.946
ROGER LININGTON: Absolutely.

00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:13.320
It's possible that the
microorganisms in this sample,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.560
may one day make compounds which
we can add to tablets like this

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.550
to treat diseases.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.410
BRYSON VOIRIN: The
cure to what we're

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.993
looking for could be anywhere,
in the ocean, in the mountains,

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:21.560
in the sky.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.089
ROGER LININGTON: Right.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.670
And if you tried to
do that discovery

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.960
in a random way, where you
went into the environment

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.510
and picked microorganisms
at random, you would fail.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.700
There are many millions of
sequences that we have not yet

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.660
investigated.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.580
Deciding how to do
that in an ordered way

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.510
is the challenge for the next
generation of natural product

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.010
scientists.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.390
SPEAKER 1: This episode is

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.266
NARRATOR: On another
episode of Seeker Stories.

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:11.890
SPEAKER 2: So this
woman is allowing us

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.290
to take pictures of the bears.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.604
Here they are in their cages.

00:05:15.604 --> 00:05:16.104
Hi.

00:05:16.104 --> 00:05:18.760
So pretty.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.780
So there is one, two, three,
four, five, right there.
