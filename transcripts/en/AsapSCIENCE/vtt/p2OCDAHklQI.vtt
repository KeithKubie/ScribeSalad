00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.740
There’s nothing quite like hearing a fart,
and knowing the painful inevitability of it

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.580
crossing your nose’s path. But, if you could
react quickly enough, do you even stand a

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.650
chance to escape it’s smell? Could you outrun
a fart?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.560
If you’re trying to outrun the sound...good
luck! Sounds are vibrations that travel through

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.500
particles in a wave, and their speed is dependent
on the medium they’re travelling in. For

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.240
example, sound travels 4x faster in water
than air, because the particles are much closer

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.930
to together, meaning they more quickly transmit
vibration energy. When travelling through

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:41.500
air at sea level and 15℃, sound travels
at 340 m/s - way faster than the fastest man

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.899
on earth, Usain Bolt, who can only move 12.4
m/s. Not even the fastest animal, the peregrine

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.240
falcon which can travel 82 m/s - could soar
past the sound of it’s own toot.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.280
But it’s the smell that most are concerned
about escaping anyway, and here’s where

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.240
it gets a bit more complicated. Unlike sound
waves and visible light which travel through

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.890
the air, smell is made up of the odour compounds
that create the air. When you cut the cheese,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.560
odor molecules travel through the air and
up your nose where they bind to odorant receptors.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.970
And each individual has a unique set of receptors,
meaning we all perceive smell differently.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.950
At the basic level, smells travel through
the process of diffusion whereby particles

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.090
move from area of high concentration to low
concentration, until reaching a state of equilibrium.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.720
But the composition of every fart is unique,
based on the food you ate, your gut bacteria

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.180
breaking it down, and the swallowed air you
took in. Yup - farts are like snowflakes;

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.079
each with it’s own variance. But the average
fart tends to be composed of 59% nitrogen,

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:52.110
21% hydrogen, 9% carbon dioxide, 7% methane,
3% oxygen, and only around 1% is made up of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.409
the smelly stuff. Even knowing this, we would
still need to know the concentration at the

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.040
source, the temperature, air pressure, and
wind movement in the room - which even in

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.820
a very still room is significant. Anecdotal
evidence on the internet suggests that farts

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.420
are ejected at about 3 m/s, but there is little
scientific evidence to back this up.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.669
However, if we take into account the temperature
of the gas, pressure and kinetic energy of

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:20.189
molecules, then the kinetic theory of gasses
can help predict the average speed of a gas

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.719
molecule. But since a fart is made up of many
molecules, let’s just focus on one of the

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.010
smellier parts: skatole. If we use the kinetic
theory of gasses, assume that the fart is

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.019
at body temperature, and then we plug in the
molar mass of skatole, we calculate that the

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:42.309
smelly skatole may be travelling around 243
m/s! Which is obviously faster than a human

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.309
can move.

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:47.459
Of course, these molecules aren’t travelling
in an uninterrupted line but are constantly

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.769
colliding into other air particles and physical
matter. As a result the gas cloud as a whole

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.180
travels much slower still guided by diffusion.
And it doesn’t take into account any air

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.650
movement like wind or the ejection direction,
which could either work for or against you.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.329
So, while you certainly can’t run faster
than the absolute speed of smelly fart particles,

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.900
with a little luck, you might be able avoid
the fart itself!
