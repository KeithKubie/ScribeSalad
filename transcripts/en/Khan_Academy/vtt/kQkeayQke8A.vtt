00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.066
- [Voiceover] So we
have a number line here

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.100
with zero at the center and
then on that number line

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.068
we've marked off some numbers.

00:00:07.068 --> 00:00:08.500
So, to the left of the number line

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.167
we have the number a,

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:11.867
and then we have the number b here,

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:13.166
a little bit closer to zero,

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.133
and then on the right side of zero

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.300
we have the number c.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.766
And then after that, we have a bunch

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:22.166
of statements dealing with inequalities.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.433
Now, what I want you to
do is pause the video

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.000
and think about which of
these statements are true,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.900
which of these statements are false,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.633
and maybe which of these
statements you don't have

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.733
enough information to figure out.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.466
So, I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.467
You've tried to figure out
which of these are true,

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.000
which of these are
false, and which of these

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.466
you can't figure out.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.333
So, let's do them together.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.133
So, this first statement says

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.652
negative b is less than negative c.

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:51.300
So, we do know for a fact
that b is less than c.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.299
We know that b is less than c.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:57.563
How do we know that?

00:00:57.563 --> 00:01:00.133
Well, b is to the left
of c on the number line.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.066
It's that straight forward.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.000
So, we know this. This is definitely true.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.272
But what about negative b?

00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:08.740
Is negative b less than negative c?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.633
So, let's think about where negative b is

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.200
on this number line.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.533
So, negative b I will do in yellow.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:19.033
So, negative, negative b
means the opposite of b.

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:22.433
So if b is one hash mark
to the left of zero,

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.566
negative b is going to be one hash mark

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.734
to the right of zero.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:30.166
So, that right over there,
is going to be negative b.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.200
And now, where is negative c?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.266
Once again, negative
c, this literally means

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.933
the opposite of c.

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:39.633
C is one, two, three, four, five

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.100
hash marks to the right of zero.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.566
And so negative c is going to be

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.533
one, two, three, four, five

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.300
hash marks to the left of zero.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.133
And actually, let me do
this in a different color.

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.766
So, negative c I will do in purple.

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:59.185
This right over here is negative c.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:03.900
So, let's compare, is negative
b less than negative c?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.200
No, negative b is to the right of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.642
negative c on the number line.

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:10.733
Negative b is greater than negative c.

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.667
So, this is not true.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.900
Negative b is to the right of negative c.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.081
Negative b is greater than negative c.

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:21.102
And if this is a little
confusing, just think about it.

00:02:21.102 --> 00:02:23.271
Since b is a negative number,

00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:27.100
negative b is going to
be a positive number.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.396
And since c is a positive number,

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:31.502
negative c is going to
be a negative number.

00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:35.233
So, it makes complete sense
that a positive number

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.830
is going to be greater
than a negative number.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.033
And you see it here,
negative b is to the right of

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.366
negative c on the number line.

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.033
So, we can rule this one out.

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:48.009
So the next question, is
negative b greater than zero?

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.600
Well, we already plotted negative b,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.133
it's going to be one to the right,

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:52.533
or one hash mark to the right,

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.633
we don't know how much each
of these hash marks represent,

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.000
but it's going to be to the right of zero.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.567
So, it is greater than zero.

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:03.515
This is true. That is true.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:07.533
All right, now is a greater than b?

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:08.558
Well, let's look at it.

00:03:08.558 --> 00:03:11.233
A is to the left of b on the number line.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:14.200
A is more negative than b.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.956
So, a is less than b, not greater than b.

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:19.466
So, this is not going to be the case.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.098
In order for something to be greater than

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:23.400
something else, it would have
to be to the right of it.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.733
For a to the greater than b,

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:26.433
it would have to be to the right of b.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.000
But we see, a is to the left of b.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.100
A is less than b.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.133
All right, one more to think about.

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:35.671
Negative a is greater than c.

00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:39.133
So, we know that a isn't greater than c,

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:40.933
a is to the left of c.

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:42.966
A is a negative number,
it's to the left of zero,

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:46.200
c is a positive number,
it's to the right of zero.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.000
But what about negative a?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.100
Well, let's draw that.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.366
Let me do this in a color
that I haven't used yet.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.567
Negative a, where would that be?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:59.567
Well a is one, two, three, four, five, six

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:03.366
hash marks to the left of zero.

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:04.800
And so negative a is going to be

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.700
six hash marks to the right of zero.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.800
So, let's count that.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.266
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:15.800
So, negative a is going
to be right over there.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.033
And notice, negative a
is to the right of c,

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:22.600
so negative a is greater than c.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.867
This is true.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:25.000
And if you get confused, if you say,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.767
wait, this looks like a negative,

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.534
how can it be larger than a positive?

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:32.233
Remember, negative a itself
is a negative number.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:35.500
And a itself is six
hash marks to the left.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.178
So if you take the opposite of that,

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:38.533
you're going to get a positive number.

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:40.833
You're going to get six
hash marks to the right.

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:42.700
And c, which was already
a positive number,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.840
is only five hash marks to the right.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.771
And so, negative a, this is
going to be a positive number,

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:51.399
and it's going to be greater than c.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:53.357
It's to the right of c.
