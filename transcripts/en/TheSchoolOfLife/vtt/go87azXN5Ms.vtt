00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.160
One of the unexpectedly important things

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.260
that art can do for us is teach us how

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.960
to suffer. It can do so by evoking

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.269
scenes that are dark melancholy or painful

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.300
and that normalize and lend dignity to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.890
the feelings of suffering that we might

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.109
otherwise be experiencing in isolation

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.260
or confusion. They reveal with grandeur

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.689
and technical skill that grief belongs

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.820
to the human condition. Caspar David Friedrich

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.488
a painter of sublime sadness

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:36.329
was born in 1774 in Greifswald, an ancient

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.219
trading town in the far north of Germany

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.230
on the Baltic coast. It was a beautiful

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.719
place in a severe northern sort of way.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.160
As a child he loved the way the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.079
pinnacles spires and towers at the town

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.480
loomed above the trees in the haze of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.489
the very early summer mornings. His

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.800
father was a modest artisan of few words

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.289
and little warmth and his beloved mother

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.570
died when he was only young. When he was

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.000
13 he saw his younger brother Johann

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.100
Christopher fall through the ice of a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.970
frozen lake and drown. He grew up shy

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.040
taciturn and intense. He was trained as a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.020
painter from an early age, but there were

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.850
many years of poverty and hardship

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.950
before his distinctive style began to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.200
emerge. The taste of the era favored

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.869
sunny classical landscapes. Summer in

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.060
Italy was the ideal. But Friedrich was

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.520
drawn to aspects of nature that up to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.189
that point people thought of as

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.990
uninteresting and disagreeable cold, damp

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.560
mornings, glacial nights by the sea the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.259
pale hour before the sun rises, the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.909
flooded fields of late spring.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.549
Frederich's first mature work, his first

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.470
big picture where he started to present

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.899
his own view of life was a shock to his

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.340
contemporaries. Instead of the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.770
conventional angels, weeping saints and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.869
soldiers he depicted the crucifixion of

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.340
Jesus is happening on top of a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.770
mountainous crag amidst Teutonic fir

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.229
trees with the sun's rays striking the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.270
clouds behind. Friedrich realized then

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.009
that nature could express many of the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.049
solemn moods that had previously been

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.149
associated with the literal rendition of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.159
the Christian story. With time he

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.960
dispensed with direct references to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.149
Jesus all together. But he retained the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.550
atmosphere of tragedy and grief

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.650
associated with his life and death.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.260
He found that tall trees mountains, mists,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.810
the rising of the moon, the stillness of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.270
water at night, open heathland, and fog

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.700
could carry many the same messages about

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.970
pain, love, suffering and redemption as

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.490
the Christian theologians once found in

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.350
the Gospels. He remains a painter

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.180
uniquely suited to those who no longer

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.030
believe but who remain attracted to the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.250
serious emotions that accompany belief.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.850
In 1818 when he was 43 Caspar David

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.490
married 25 year old Christian Caroline

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.040
Bommer they had two daughters, Emma and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.680
Agnes Adelheid and a son Gustav Adolf.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.870
And it seems on the whole to have been a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.190
pretty good relationship.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.140
Caroline appears in many of his pictures

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.510
although usually alone. Friedrich was

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.370
drawn to painting people on their own

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.920
as if what is most important about us only

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.690
comes to the surface when we are away

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.940
from the chatter of civilization. He

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.830
himself only had a handful of friends

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.960
and rarely left his simply furnished

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.060
studio. Instead of solitude being

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.650
something that we need to evade with

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.350
business, drink, or sexual fantasies

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.420
Friedrich suggests it is something that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.460
brings us into contact with our deepest

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.590
possibilities. He also believes that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.050
harshness of nature could put the sorrow

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.690
of the human condition into a consoling

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.970
and redeeming perspective. Humans can be

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.910
cruel, fate can be remorseless, but

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.710
contemplating the ineluctable collision

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.580
of icepacks takes us out

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.920
of ourselve, beyond the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.500
particular envy, wound, or disappointment

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.880
that is tormenting us

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.710
reducing our sense of personal

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.440
persecution. Works like moonrise over the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.510
sea make us aware of our insignificance

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.690
in the vast natural world exciting a

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.280
sense of the pettiness of man's

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.410
disasters in comparison with the waves

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.960
of eternity, leaving us a little readier to

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.150
bow to the incomprehensible tragedies

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.370
that every life entails. From here

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.560
ordinary irritations and worries are

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.870
neutralized. Rather than try to redress

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.790
our humiliations by insisting on our

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.550
wronged importance we can, by the help of

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.830
a great art work, endeavor to apprehend

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.410
and appreciate our essential nothingness.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.470
Friedrich uses this striking jagged rock

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.079
formation, a spare stretch of coast, the

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.550
bright horizon far away clouds and

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.340
pale sky to induce us into a mood of

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.500
redemptive sadness. The smaller islands

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.690
of rock were once just as dramatic and

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.610
thrusting as the major rock formations

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.250
just beyond, the long slow passage of

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.470
time will one day wear them down as well,

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.449
above the more clouds which catch light

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.610
on their undersides and pass on in their

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.680
transient pointless way totally

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.020
indifferent to all of our concerns. The

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.849
pitcher does not refer directly to our

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.039
relationships or to the stresses and

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.229
tribulations of our day-to-day lives. Its

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.629
function is to give us access to a state

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.400
of mind where we are acutely conscious

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.039
of the largeness of space and time and

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.590
the insignificance of our situation

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.539
within the greater scheme. The work is

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.629
sombre rather than sad, calm but not

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.539
despairing. In that condition of mind or

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.610
to put it more romantically state of

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.830
soul we are left as so often with

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.229
Friedrich's work better equipped to

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.599
deal with the intractable intense and

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.400
particular griefs that lie ahead of us.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.099
Like many artists Friedrich was not

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.870
terribly successful during his own

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.789
lifetime. He was admired and his work

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.919
purchased by a small group of serious

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.990
people and two of the most delightful

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.969
painters of the era Kersting and Dahl

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.490
were his friends he died in his mid-60s

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.430
in 1840 almost forgotten. He did not know

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.590
that, in the distant future his work

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.900
would be deeply admired. Not because it

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.090
cheers us but precisely because it knows

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.400
how to reframe and express the sadness

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.779
that is part of all of us.
