00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.310
Math is about communication.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.520
It's about conveying ideas,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.530
like relationships between
two different variables.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.530
For example, how much money I make and
how many hours I work.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.880
Usually, there's a mathematical
relationship there.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.850
And sometimes, we talk about
that relationship with numbers

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.080
when we use rates or
we talk about it with equations.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.390
But sometimes we like to use pictures,
and

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.830
the pictures we use are called graphs.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.790
And in this lesson, we're going to talk
about how to generate those graphs and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.670
how to convert between graphs and
equations.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.650
So let's get started.
