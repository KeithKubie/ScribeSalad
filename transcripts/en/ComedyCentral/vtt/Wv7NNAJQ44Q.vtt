YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
A PALM READ--

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.879

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.849
- UM, YOU--I IMAGINE
THAT BEING A CELEBRITY

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.383
IS VERY, VERY STRESSFUL.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.919
- NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S REALLY FUN.

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:27.754
IT'S REALLY FUN.

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:31.625
IN TERMS OF
KEEPING UP PUBLIC APPEARANCES

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:32.860
AND--AND ALL THAT.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.298

IT SHOULD'VE COME

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.543
THAT MISS TISDALE
WAS ACTING COY.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.245
TO A CELEBRITY,
AN EVENING OF SEX

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.447
IS A COVETED PRIZE
THAT CANNOT BE HANDED OUT

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.716
TO JUST ANYONE
WITH NO APPARENT BENEFIT

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.784
IN THE FORM OF DRUGS
OR CAREER ADVANCEMENT.

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.319

- OH, BOY.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.901
- MY INTEREST IN THIS DATE

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.737
ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE FOOD,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.438
EVEN THOUGH
