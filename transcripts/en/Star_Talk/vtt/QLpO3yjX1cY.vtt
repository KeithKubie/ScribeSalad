00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
Gary: Okay so you're here in New York and I'm
thinking because you've got a lovely cap

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.880
and a sweater on that it's all about the
President's Cup, so let us know exactly what's going on.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.120
Chuck: What is the President's Cup Series because some of our listeners

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.260
are just sports fans but they may be
just discovering golf.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.660
Neil: President of what? Who's president's cup is that?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.000
Chuck: I'm the president of golf. That's right! Okay, sorry.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.010
Geoff: Well I guess if you've been on this planet for a while I guess

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.230
you probably have heard of something
called the Ryder Cup which is

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.660
basically the European Tour versus the
US tour in golf, kind of a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.670
bragging rights kind of thing it's been
going on for a really long time and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.920
that's become a really really big event
but that's owned by the PGA of America.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.210
At the PGA Tour which is really kind of
the powerful organization which kind of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
runs the tour on a regular basis kind of
wanted to get in on the mix so they

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.719
created their own thing called the
President's Cup which is the US team

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.010
versus everyone else in the world except
for Europe which is quite a lot of good

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.549
golfers. Generally there's four
or five of the top ten in the world of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.840
this out of that sort of area of the
world so they created this event I think

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.900
in the early 90s. This is about nine or
ten now it's every two years every other

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.189
Ryder Cup year so it's um this year at
Liberty National which is staring at the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.160
Statue of Liberty and the skyline in New
York

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.140
Chuck: And happens to be the very best

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.500
golf club in the world outside of any
other golf club I own so sorry.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.340
Chuck: Man this guy knows what he's doing!
Geoff: We're staying down um kind of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.040
Wall Street way - Battery Park - we get
the ferry everyday. And if

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.030
anyone ever wants to see professional
golfers actually get truly passionate go

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.759
to a President's Cup a Ryder Cup because
it means a lot more when you're playing

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.930
for everyone else.
Gary: Who's gonna win? One word answer.
Geoff: Internationals. Gary: Yeah there you.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.810
Neil: And which president does it refer to?
Geoff: All of the above.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.240
Chuck: Every president there's ever been. 
Geoff: 45 of them. Neil: Oh, it's an American President's Cup. Okay I'm sorry.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.900
Geoff: Well they didn't a name and it was a good name. The presidents didn't have one so now they've got one.
Neil: Okay!

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.560
Gary: Geoff Ogilvy, absolute pleasure. 
Chuck: I hope we can get you back.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.520
You are really cool to talk to! 
Neil: Just a quick thing...the putting green...

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.700
That's actually real grass? Geoff: Real grass. Neil: Because I've never seen grass that looks like

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.900
putting green grass. You guys must like genetically engineer that stuff.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.900
Geoff: Believe it or not we do, I think
maybe we should come back and talk about it.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.100
Chuck: Absolutely on, we'll get a greenskeeper in! Well, that's our Playing With Science show.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.480
