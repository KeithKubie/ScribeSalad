&gt;&gt; Hey James, you know what I love doing?

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.870
&gt;&gt; Talking about baseball?

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.480
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, besides that.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.740
I love using the console to play with websites.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.630
&gt;&gt; That is fun. &gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.090
You know, what? Actually, the sounds like a good idea.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.660
In the instructor notes, you'll find a line of code I want you to copy.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.480
Open up another tab and go to Udacity.com.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.600
Open up the Console, paste in that line of code and press Enter.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.110
What do you see?
