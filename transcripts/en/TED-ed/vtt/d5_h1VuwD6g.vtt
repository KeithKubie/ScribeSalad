00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.295
My name is Tom Chi.

00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:17.814
I spent two years of my life

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:19.478
building the user experience team

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:21.611
for the Google X division of Google,

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:24.398
and it's a place I affectionately call

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:25.814
the Department of Science Fiction

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:27.618
because of the futuristic nature

00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:29.525
of the types of projects we took on:

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:30.695
self-driving cars,

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:31.461
Google Glass,

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:34.462
and other things that you'll see soon enough.

00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:37.171
So, for those who haven't heard of this project,

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.192
this is what Google Glass looks like.

00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:43.146
It allows you to overlay digital things into your eye sight

00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:46.027
while still maintaining being part of the world.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:48.077
So, if I, you know, were to pull out my cell phone

00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:51.093
and look into it, I'm basically out of this world now,

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:54.333
like, I'm in my own little cell phone-tablet world, what have you.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.415
But, Google Glass has the vision of allowing us

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:59.507
to continue to be in the world

00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:03.620
but also have access to the digital things that we need and love.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.238
Now, I am going to ask you a real simple question about Google Glass:

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:08.245
how would you prototype this experience?

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:09.702
How long do you think it would take you

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:13.766
to make the first working version of the headset display?

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:19.346
Okay, a little bit on the long side.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:22.419
The answer is one day.

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:23.549
And here's what it looked like.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.474
So, basically the magic piece is the coat hanger.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.911
The coat hanger, I bent it in a specific shape

00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.577
and the top loop goes around your neck

00:01:31.577 --> 00:01:34.502
and then the bottom loop rests against your chest

00:01:34.502 --> 00:01:37.805
and it allows me to carry a piece of plexiglass

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.199
on with a little sheet protector.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.503
So these are the things you put your book reports in

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:42.575
so they don't get wet,

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.157
I literally got at the drug store.

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:46.684
You know, have it out at the end of the plexiglass

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:48.932
and then it gets projected onto with the pico projector

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:51.196
that's connected to a Netbook.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.923
And using this set-up, within one day

00:01:52.923 --> 00:01:55.261
we're already able to start having the experience

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:57.755
of what it looks like to have digital things

00:01:57.755 --> 00:01:59.486
overlaid on your physical world,

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.083
be able to move around with it,

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.040
and also use the Netbook to try out

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.203
tons and tons of different ideas around software.

00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:10.798
Now, after you start getting something like that working,

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:13.249
you know, a really important problem comes up,

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.588
like you're wearing this thing on your head,

00:02:15.588 --> 00:02:17.155
it's like a pair of glasses,

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:21.090
so you don't have a mouse or a keyboard or a touchscreen,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.223
all the ways you are used to interacting with a machine.

00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:27.060
So, we thought for a second,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.239
well, maybe we could do something

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.572
like, you know, what was shown in &lt;i&gt;Minority Report&lt;/i&gt;.

00:02:30.572 --> 00:02:32.278
So, for folks who haven't seen that,

00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:34.951
basically Tom Cruise is manipulating software

00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:36.454
with his hands in front of his face

00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:38.534
and photos are flying over here

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:40.524
and his email is over here

00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:41.758
and so on and so forth.

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:43.008
So I'll ask the the same question again,

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:44.829
how long do you think it would take

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.778
to have the real experience of doing something like that?

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:53.284
Two years, OK.

00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:55.759
Somebody said one day.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.173
45 minutes.

00:02:58.173 --> 00:02:59.587
So here's how it looks.

00:02:59.587 --> 00:03:01.647
So you wear the thing that we saw that first time

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.707
because you need some way to go project things,

00:03:03.707 --> 00:03:06.153
but what happens is we got two hairbands,

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.752
which I think was the hardest part we had to do,

00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:09.723
ask people for their hairbands.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:12.897
But you put one hand in each hairband

00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:14.634
and attach that hairband,

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:17.032
we tied a fishing line.

00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:19.897
And the fishing line goes over the top of a whiteboard

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.284
and then goes down to this little assembly

00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:23.834
that's taped to the floor.

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:24.646
And what this means is

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:26.950
every time I move my hand in any direction,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.599
it adds tension to the line

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.921
and it does the following with the assembly on the floor.

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:35.529
So, the other end of the fishing wire is attached to a chopstick

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.513
and it's not because I'm Asian,

00:03:37.513 --> 00:03:39.118
there's just a cafeteria nearby,

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.320
I don't just carry chopsticks on me.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.546
But, I tied it to the end of a chopstick,

00:03:45.546 --> 00:03:47.590
I clipped it into a binder clip,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.488
and then put it over a pen,

00:03:49.488 --> 00:03:50.779
and basically what happens then

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:52.146
is when you move your arm

00:03:52.146 --> 00:03:54.107
and it produces tension on the wire,

00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:55.877
the chopstick comes down like a lever

00:03:55.877 --> 00:03:57.941
and clicks a presentation clicker,

00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.899
one hand moves the presentation forward,

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.250
the other hand moves the presentation backwards.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.762
So this was built in 45 minutes

00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:05.286
and that meant shortly afterwards,

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.450
we were having experiences

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.849
like looking at an image gallery

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.244
and saying, "next image,

00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:10.212
next image,

00:04:10.212 --> 00:04:11.429
previous image,"

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:13.227
or looking at our emails and saying,

00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:14.681
"let me click into this email,

00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:16.168
let me click reply now."

00:04:16.168 --> 00:04:19.334
And this was exactly the experience of what it was like

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:21.575
to go control software with your hands.

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:23.179
And ultimately, what it taught us is

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.214
we probably shouldn't have this in the product.

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:26.259
We learned a lot of things

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.710
about the social awkwardness of it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.361
and some of the ergonomic aspects of it

00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.643
that you couldn't have figured out

00:04:32.643 --> 00:04:35.008
ahead of just thinking about it.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:38.006
And, ergo the second prototyping rule,

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:40.374
which is "doing is the best kind of thinking."

00:04:40.374 --> 00:04:41.696
They teach you to think a lot in school,

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:44.487
but I think it is a little bit overrated.

00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:48.121
Now last example, you know,

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.350
actually Google is not the first team

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.649
that's tried to go make something like this

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:54.174
and if you search for headset display,

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:56.143
you get tons of images of teams

00:04:56.143 --> 00:04:58.638
that have built various systems like this,

00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:00.428
but I can tell you at a glance

00:05:00.428 --> 00:05:02.949
that none of these pieces of hardware

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.314
are comfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes

00:05:05.314 --> 00:05:07.489
except for maybe the helmet over there,

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:09.715
but then you got to wear a helmet.

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:12.091
So, you know, how would you go figure out a way

00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:15.312
to go wear something like this comfortably?

00:05:15.312 --> 00:05:18.251
The answer is really basic materials:

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.239
modeling wire,

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:19.902
paper,

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:20.400
clay,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.371
and using something like this

00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:24.900
is able to make something look like a pair of glasses really quickly.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.659
I cut out pieces of clay that weighed

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.253
exactly the same amount as the electronic components

00:05:29.253 --> 00:05:31.710
that we were talking about putting on the device,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.039
wrapped it in paper so you didn't get clay on your face,

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.169
and then taped it to the modeling wire in various places

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.899
to go experiment with how a pair of glasses could fit on you.

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:43.015
And, we discovered something really important then.

00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:45.600
Like, if you look at this drawing on the bottom,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.051
it turns out that the weight of a pair of glasses

00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:51.384
is actually mostly perceived

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.845
through how much weight is on your nose.

00:05:53.845 --> 00:05:56.767
And, it also turns out that your ears can carry

00:05:56.767 --> 00:05:58.299
a lot more weight than your nose,

00:05:58.299 --> 00:05:59.648
and that is a totally different experiment,

00:05:59.648 --> 00:06:01.231
you can ask me about that.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.782
But, because of that fact,

00:06:03.782 --> 00:06:06.544
if you put weight behind your ears,

00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:10.086
it allows your ear to go act like the fulcrum of a lever

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:13.444
and it then takes weight off of your nose on the front.

00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:15.552
And, actually, you can try this now, anybody with glasses,

00:06:15.552 --> 00:06:18.761
if you push very gently on the back of your glasses,

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:21.626
you'll find, actually your glasses feel tremendously lighter.

00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:23.404
Now, this meant that we not only discovered

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:25.706
something interesting about how to go,

00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:28.775
you know, that's useful for developing a device like this,

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:30.675
we actually discovered something pretty fundamental

00:06:30.675 --> 00:06:33.475
that never been discovered about glasses, period.

00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:34.749
So, if you have really heavy glasses,

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.770
you could do this and you would be more comfortable.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.665
Now, the last point I want to make is

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:42.150
about two types of learning

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.393
because through the process of rapid prototyping,

00:06:44.393 --> 00:06:46.970
you are able to learn very quickly.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.893
It's a very specific type of learning.

00:06:48.893 --> 00:06:51.391
The type of learning that you usually learn in school

00:06:51.391 --> 00:06:52.843
I call book learning.

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:54.948
It comes from what humanity already knows

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:59.032
and it's a necessary foundation for you guys to go and explore the world.

00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:00.618
But there is a totally different type of learning,

00:07:00.618 --> 00:07:02.265
which I call expansive learning,

00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:05.238
and this is the learning you do on behalf of humanity.

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:05.516
Right?

00:07:05.516 --> 00:07:07.025
You are creating something new,

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:09.270
you are expanding into the possibilities,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.383
and you're building the sphere of human knowledge in that process.

00:07:13.383 --> 00:07:15.982
And, we think about these things and as soon as you hear

00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:18.177
like, ok, the infinite realm of possibilities

00:07:18.177 --> 00:07:19.394
beyond the sphere of human knowledge,

00:07:19.394 --> 00:07:21.718
you might be thinking there's the scientists

00:07:21.718 --> 00:07:23.664
at the Large Hadron Collider

00:07:23.664 --> 00:07:25.303
who have these amazing instruments,

00:07:25.303 --> 00:07:27.316
like that's their job, right?

00:07:27.316 --> 00:07:32.734
But the truth is that this action is available to all of us,

00:07:32.734 --> 00:07:33.174
you know,

00:07:33.174 --> 00:07:34.978
it's not just for the scientists,

00:07:34.978 --> 00:07:37.314
it's also for the poet or the songwriter

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:40.850
that expresses an emotion for the first time in a unique way.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.511
It's also for the person that has an amazing business idea

00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:46.869
that they're certain could help millions of lives.

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:50.595
And, it's the realm of using paper, clay, and tape

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.694
in order to go find a new insight

00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:54.823
in an ancient technology.

00:07:54.823 --> 00:07:56.970
So now that you know a lot about rapid prototyping,
