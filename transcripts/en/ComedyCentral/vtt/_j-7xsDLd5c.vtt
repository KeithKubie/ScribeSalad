00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.400
- Ever since I moved to New York,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.300
people are always asking me if I've ever

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.490
had a New York moment.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.280
Like they'll say, "Oh my god
Aparna, have you ever had

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.810
um like, a New york moment?"

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.100
Well one time I saw a
black guy with a mohawk

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.930
walk by a white guy with a mohawk

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.890
and they both high fived,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.610
so I made a wish, 'cause
I know how miracles work.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.960
But apparently, that's not a
real enough New York moment,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.610
'cause everyone's all
like, "No, Aparna, I mean

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.507
like a New York moment."

00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:34.730
So I stopped and I thought about it,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.300
and I was like, "Well one time I

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.010
saw a fresh pile of dog poop

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.087
with a used condom on top of it."

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.030
I know, I was there, and that's
when I came up with a game

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.630
called "Too much
information, or not enough?"

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.370
You're right, there are
no winners in that game,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.270
you just start an Instagram account

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.060
and you keep it moving.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.420
So then I started to think, maybe I never

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.160
have a real New York moment.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.680
Then one day, I'm walking down the street,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.410
we're not that different, you and I,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.210
and I see a delivery truck
rolling down the hill

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.640
with no driver in it.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.540
At first I didn't pick
up on it right away,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.490
you know, 'cause it wasn't about me,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.710
but then I saw UPS driver
running after the truck.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.570
And I was like, "I went to college,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060
I know what's going on here."

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.630
The UPS truck was headed
straight for this guy

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.367
in a bicycle and it's like, "Game on."

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.140
Then, as if in a movie, the UPS driver

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.110
power jogs up to the truck,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.110
does a lazy triple axel
into the driver's seat,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.760
pulls the brake like an
old-timey train conductor,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.003
and the truck stops just
short of the guy in the bike.

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.140
The guy in the bike looks
up at the guy in the truck,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.440
they share this long moment,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.380
and then I swear to you,
they both just shrugged!

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.087
As if to go, "New York,
what're you gonna do?"

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.370
I was like, "Seriously? That's it?"

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.130
But then this stranger
walking by outta nowhere

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.470
hands me this giant slice
of pizza, piping hot,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.000
and I was like, "New York, I get the hype,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.560
I get the hype."

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560
(smooth jazz music)
