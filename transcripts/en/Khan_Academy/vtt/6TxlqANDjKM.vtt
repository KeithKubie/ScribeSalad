00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.580
Graph f of x on
the given domain.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.390
So f of x is equal to 4
times the absolute value

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.800
of x plus 6 minus 8.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.960
And the domain is x
between negative 8--

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.940
including negative 8.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.481
This bracket means that we're
going to include this endpoint.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.437
And negative 2.

00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:18.020
And we're going to
include negative 2.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.390
The bracket means we're
going to include it.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.140
If we didn't want to
include the endpoints

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.710
we would use parentheses.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.380
What are the coordinates
of the vertex?

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.140
So let's think about
the vertex first.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.200
The vertex you can view it as
the corner of an absolute value

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.990
function.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.560
And so it's either going
to be the maximum point

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.970
or the minimum point
of the function.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.120
Now over here let's just
think about it a little bit.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.987
When would this hit a
maximum or a minimum point?

00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:46.070
Well, we know that the
absolute value of something

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.040
is always going
to be nonnegative.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.770
It could be 0.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.530
That's why I'm not
saying that it's always

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.405
going to be positive.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:53.320
It's going to be nonnegative.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.846
So we have something that's
nonnegative right over here.

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.720
And then we're multiplying
it times something

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.040
that is positive.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.320
So this thing, the whole
expression over here,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.050
nonnegative times a positive is
always going to be nonnegative.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.000
So it's either going
to be 0 or greater.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.940
So this thing is
always going to be

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.140
adding to the value of f of x.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.500
So the minimum value
of f of x happens

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.060
when this whole thing is 0.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.670
And then when this whole thing
is 0 then f of x is negative 8.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.820
That is the minimum value.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.630
At any other point this thing
is going to be larger than 0.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200
So let's just think about when
does this whole thing equal 0?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.920
Well, this whole thing is going
to be equalling 0 if x plus 6

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.130
is equal to 0.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.950
And when does x plus 6 equal 0?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.460
Well, when x is
equal to negative 6.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.560
When x is negative 6 then
this whole thing is 0

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.920
and f of x is equal
to negative 8.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.422
So that's the vertex.

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:55.130
And that's going to
be the minimum point.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.740
This is going to be an
upward opening absolute value

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.690
function.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.774
So now let's just draw it.

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.148
And what we could
do is, we could

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:02.450
put some points at the vertex.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.221
So let's put some points.

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:04.720
Let's see.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.440
Negative 6, negative 8.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.390
Negative 6, negative
8 is right over there.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.230
Let me scroll down.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.350
Make sure you can
see that point.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.647
Negative 6, negative
8 is right over there.

00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:21.230
And I actually want to make you
see the function definition as

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.730
well.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.146
Now let's just think about
what it does at the boundaries.

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:26.050
On either side it's
going to be a line.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.570
So when x is negative
8, what is f of x?

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.750
Negative 8 plus 6 is negative 2.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.250
Take the absolute value of that.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.150
That is going to be 2
times 4 is 8 minus 8 is 0.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.380
So you have the point
negative 8 comma 0.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.200
And then let's think about what
happens at the other boundary.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.470
When x is negative 2.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.750
Negative 2 plus 6 is 4.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.465
The absolute value of 4 is 4.

00:02:56.465 --> 00:03:01.550
4 times 4 is going to
be 16 minus 8 is 8.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.560
So it's going to be the
point negative 2, 8.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.500
And just like that,
I think we're done.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.470
Yes, we are.
