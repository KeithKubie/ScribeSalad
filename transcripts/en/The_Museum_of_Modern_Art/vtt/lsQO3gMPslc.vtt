00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.119
So these works are for our Adrian Piper show, which is in 2018, and when we were examining

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.530
these to think about having them in the show,
we realized that they are all hinged down

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.920
to their matte boards in a way that looked
like it could be problematic for removal.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.170
So we wanted to get these in early because
we didn't know how much time this treatment

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.470
would take, and there are 35 of these works.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.100
With the adhesive we found on these drawings,
it was unusually yellowed to what we would expect

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.309
to see, because adhesives do yellow wihen
they age, but this was such a bright yellow,

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.990
that we wondered if there was something else
going on that we didn't know about.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.140
And luckily, here at MoMA, we have two conservation
scientists.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.920
So when we run into a question about materials
like this we can have them perform analysis

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.460
and hopefully, get some answers.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.960
So our scientists took a sample of the adhesive
we had gotten from the drawing and he ran

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.140
some analysis.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.040
And here, he ran FTI...FT...sorry...on the
sample.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.710
And he found that it is similar to an adhesive
used in masking tape.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.439
And you can see here this red line on the
spectra is the adhesive from the Piper, and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.509
then, this purple line is a reference of painter's
masking tape, and you can see that the peaks

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.909
match fairly well.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:17.650
Luckily, in our explorations of these works,
we found that the adhesive is quite flexible,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.200
which you can see some of the adhesive right
there from another drawing, and the paper

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.060
is quite strong and thick.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.190
So we start by...

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.310
I'm going to put some weights here, so the
work does not move.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.520
But we can just go in with a thin , metal
tool, a micro-spatula, and start working through

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.610
the adhesive.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.829
And you can actually see the tool moving under
the paper.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.890
This adhesive is quite flexible still, but
over time it will get more rigid.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:21.400
So this is something when we find it on an
artwork, we want to remove as soon as we can.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.260
I have his conclusions.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.650
Technical grade plasticizers often discolor
to begin with and will get worse over time.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.500
If given enough time, they will migrate into
and discolor the paper, and his recommendation:

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.489
use a conservation quality adhesive.

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.950
Which is always what we advise people.
