00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:07.791
In 1925,

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:10.831
Frida Kahlo was on her way home 
from school in Mexico City

00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.911
when the bus she was riding 
collided with a streetcar.

00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:18.011
She suffered near-fatal injuries 
to her spine, pelvis and hips,

00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:20.561
and was bedridden for months afterward.

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:21.731
During her recovery,

00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:24.051
she had a special easel 
attached to her bed

00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:26.181
so she could practice 
painting techniques.

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:27.431
When she set to work,

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:31.691
she began to paint the world according 
to her own singular vision.

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:33.030
Over the course of her life,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.780
she would establish herself as the creator
and muse behind extraordinary art.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.127
Though you may have met 
Kahlo's gaze before,

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:45.437
her work provides an opportunity 
to see the world through her eyes.

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.177
She painted friends and family,

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:49.597
still lives and spiritual scenes;

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:51.737
but it was her mesmerizing self-portraits

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:54.127
which first caught the world’s attention.

00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:55.147
In an early work,

00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:57.507
"Self Portrait with Velvet Dress,"

00:00:57.507 --> 00:01:03.257
the focus is on her strong brows, facial 
hair, long neck and formidable stare.

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:04.935
Such features remained,

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:08.805
but Kahlo soon began to present herself 
in more unusual ways.

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:09.895
For example,

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:12.325
"The Broken Column" uses symbolism,

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:17.955
religious imagery and a ruptured landscape
to reveal her physical and mental state.

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:22.443
In 1928, Kahlo started dating 
fellow painter Diego Rivera.

00:01:22.443 --> 00:01:26.450
They became lifelong partners and 
cultivated an eccentric celebrity.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.150
Together, they traveled the world and 
dedicated themselves to art,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.840
Communist politics and 
Mexican nationalism.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.900
Kahlo and Rivera shared a 
deep affinity with Mexicanidad,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.120
a movement which celebrated indigenous 
culture after the Revolution.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.390
In her daily life, Kahlo wore 
traditional Tehuana dress

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.370
and immersed herself 
in native spirituality.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.230
And in her work,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.900
she constantly referenced 
Mexican folk painting,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.680
incorporating its bright colors

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.250
and references to death, 
religion and nature.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.580
With her imagery of giant 
floating flowers,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.280
undulating landscapes, transplanted body 
parts and billowing clouds of demons,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.324
Kahlo has often been associated 
with Surrealism.

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:10.484
But while surrealists used dreamlike 
images to explore the unconscious mind,

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:14.724
Kahlo used them to represent her 
physical body and life experiences.

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:16.755
Two of her most-explored experiences

00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:19.415
were her physical disabilities 
and her marriage.

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:21.005
As a result of the bus accident,

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.685
she experienced life-long health 
complications

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.865
and endured many hospitalizations.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:28.945
She often contemplated the physical and 
psychological effects

00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:30.715
of disability in her work;

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.255
painting herself in agony,

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.155
recuperating from operations,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:38.215
or including objects such as her back
brace and wheelchair.

00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:41.476
Meanwhile, her relationship with Rivera
was tempestuous,

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:44.176
marked by infidelity on both sides.

00:02:44.176 --> 00:02:46.226
At one point they even divorced,

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:48.046
then remarried a year later.

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:49.096
During this period,

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:52.226
she painted the double self-portrait 
"The Two Fridas,"

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:56.416
which speaks to the anguish of loss 
and a splintered sense of self.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.671
The Frida to the left has a broken heart,

00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:02.331
which drips blood onto her 
old-fashioned Victorian dress.

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:06.071
She symbolizes a version of the artist 
who is wounded by the past–

00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:10.331
but is also connected by an 
artery to a second self.

00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.181
This Frida is dressed in Tehuana attire–

00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.631
and although she remembers Diego 
with the tiny portrait in her hand,

00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.101
her heart remains intact.

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:23.451
Together, the two suggest a position 
caught between past and present,

00:03:23.451 --> 00:03:26.127
individuality and dependency.

00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:30.197
Kahlo died in 1954 at the age of 47.

00:03:30.197 --> 00:03:31.750
In the years after her death,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.800
she experienced a surge in popularity 
that has lasted to this day.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.850
And although her image has proliferated,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.170
Kahlo’s body of work

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.367
reminds us that there are no simple truths

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:46.037
about the life, work and legacy of the 
woman behind the icon.

00:03:46.037 --> 00:03:49.725
Rather, she put multiple versions of 
her reality on display–

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:53.725
and provided us with a few entry-ways 
into the contents of her soul.
