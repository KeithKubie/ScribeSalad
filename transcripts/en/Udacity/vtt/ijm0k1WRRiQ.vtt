00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.440
-4 squared, with parentheses, is 16.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.035
That's because -4 squared,

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:11.466
with parentheses is the same
thing as -4 times -4.

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.428
The base is -4.

00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:17.985
The negatives cancel each other out,
and we're left with a positive answer.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:24.687
-4 squared without parentheses is
the same thing as -1 times 4 squared,

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:30.476
which is the same thing as -1
times 4 times 4, which is -16.

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:34.388
-2 to the fourth,
with an exponent, gives 16.

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:39.288
That's because -2 to
the fourth with parentheses is

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:44.302
the same thing as -2 times
-2 times -2 times -2.

00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:47.953
There are an even number of
negative signs being multiplied, so

00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:52.160
they cancel each other out, and
I'm left with a positive answer, 16.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.687
-2 to the fourth is -16, because -2 to

00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:01.693
the fourth without
parentheses is effectively,

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:05.758
-1 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:08.232
The base is positive 2.

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:10.410
And what I'm left with is -16.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.457
-3 cubed is -27.

00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:18.425
That's because -3 cubed is -1 times 3

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:22.432
times 3 times 3 which is -27.

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:26.932
Remember that if a negative sign is to
be included in the base of an exponent,

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:30.002
the base including the negative
sign should be in parentheses.
