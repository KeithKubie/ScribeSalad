00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.590
We're on problem 245.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:14.410
If x plus y is equal to a, and
x minus y is equal to b, then

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.070
what is-- they want to know
what 2xy is equal to.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.760
Let's solve for x and y in terms
of a and b, and then

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.520
just figure out what
this equals to.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.030
So we have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.650
Let's just add them together
to solve for x.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.470
We get x plus x is 2x-- the
y's cancel out-- is

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.953
equal to a plus b.

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:39.990
Or x is equal to a
plus b over 2.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.540
Now if we had x plus
y is equal to a-- I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.560
just re-wrote this.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.090
And now if we multiply both
sides of this by negative 1,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.870
so we get minus x plus y
is equal to minus b.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.450
And now add these
two equations.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.570
So I'm essentially subtracting
this equation from that one.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.970
That cancels out, so I get 2y is
equal to a minus b, or y is

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.650
equal to a minus b over 2.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.750
And now we can figure out
what 2xy is equal to.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.090
2xy is equal to 2 times a
plus b over 2, times a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.530
minus b over 2.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.060
This 2 will cancel out with
one of these 2's.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.320
And we're left with--
and what's a plus b

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.850
times a minus b?

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.200
It's a squared minus
b squared over 2.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.450
Which is choice A.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.740
Problem 246.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.540
Let me do it in magenta.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.940
246.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.720
A rectangular circuit board is
to have width w inches-- let

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.390
me draw it.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.710
So let's say it has width
w inches, perimeter of p

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.070
inches-- so let me just put that
at the side right here--

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.790
perimeter of p inches, and
area of k square inches.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.830
Which of the following equations
must be true?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.340
And so they want us to
relate this width to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.260
the area to the perimeter.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.390
Let me introduce another
variable.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.650
Let's call this, right here,
let's call this the height of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.450
the circuit board.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.010
So now we can do some
interesting things.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.170
If that's the height, then
that's also the height.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.620
If that's the width, then
this is also the width.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.350
So let's see what the
perimeter would be.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.610
It will be 2 times the width,
plus 2 times the height is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.490
equal to the perimeter.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.600
And then we could also
say width times

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.040
height is equal to area.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.920
But if we can solve for height
in terms of the perimeter and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.550
the width, then we could use
that to get an expression that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.300
doesn't involve this variable.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.710
So let's do that.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.470
So if you divide both sides of
this by 2, you get width plus

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.960
height is equal to
perimeter over 2.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.800
And then you get height is
equal to perimeter over 2

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.050
minus width.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.870
And so the area, k, will
be equal to the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.550
width times the height.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.390
Instead of writing an h there,
let's write what we just

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.380
figured out.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.720
p over 2 minus w.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:38.055
And then that is equal to
pw/2 minus w squared.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.720
Let's see, when I look at the
solution, they don't have any

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.772
fractions in it, so let's
multiple both sides of the

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:43.210
equation by 2.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.930
We can ignore this. k is equal
to pw/2 minus w squared.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.190
Multiply both sides by 2,
you get 2k is equal

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.930
to pw minus w squared.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.510
Let's add w squared
the both sides.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.910
You get w squared plus
2k is equal to pw.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.480
Let's subtract, because all of
the choices have them setting

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.690
equal to 0.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.490
So then we could subtract pw
from both sides, and you get--

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.900
oh wait, I made a mistake.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.510
If we multiply both sides of
this by 2, 2 times k is 2k.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.760
2 times pw/2 is pw.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.350
2 times minus w squared
is minus 2w squared.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.010
So in this step we have to add
2w squared to both sides.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.640
Sorry about that.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.400
So we have 2w squared plus
2k is equal to pw.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.080
Subtract pw from both sides, you
get 2w squared minus pw,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.480
plus 2k is equal to 0.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.010
And that is choice E, right?

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.770
2w squared minus pw plus 2k.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.600
That is choice E.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.450
Next question.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.710
Problem 247.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.300
An arithmetic sequence is a
sequence in which each term

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.160
after the first is equal to the
sum of the preceding term

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.930
and a constant.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.400
If the list of letters shown
above is an arithmetic

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.410
sequence-- so they wrote
p, r, s, t, u.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.430
So all they're saying is that,
the difference between p and r

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.500
is going to be some number.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.810
And the difference between
r and s is going to

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.490
be that same number.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.775
And the difference between
s and t is going to

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:19.980
be that same number.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.210
So an example of an arithmetic
sequence, this could

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.220
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.550
Because every number is one more
than the one before it.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.440
So anyway, they say which of the
following must also be an

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.030
arithmetic sequence?

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:45.240
So choice one, they write
2p, 2r, 2s, 2t, 2u.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.960
Well, let's just use
our example.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.960
If this was p, r, s, t, and u,
what is 2 times all of that?

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.230
Well, then it'll be 2, 4-- no
no, sorry-- it'll be, yeah, 2,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.510
4, 6, 8, 10.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.765
So now instead of incrementing
by one every time, we're

00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:03.990
incrementing by two
every time.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.160
But it's still an arithmetic
sequence because the

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.400
difference between each
number and the number

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.410
before it is a constant.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.280
It's always equal to 2.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.950
So choice number one
is definitely

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.400
an arithmetic sequence.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.650
Choice two.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.560
And if you say, well, that works
for that example, how do

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.690
I know it'll work for
all examples?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.040
So the other way to think
about is, whatever the

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.130
difference is between p and r,
now you're going to have twice

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.960
the difference between
2p and 2r.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.070
And it was the same distance
between r and s, now you're

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.600
going to have twice that
distance between 2r and 2s.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.640
So here in our particular
example, we went from 1 to 2,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.940
but it could have been
something else.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.290
OK, Statement two says, p
minus 3, r minus 3-- so

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.070
they're just shifting
everything; I don't even have

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.470
to write them alll-- all
the way to u minus 3.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.700
So they just took everything in
this sequence and made them

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.420
three less.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.650
But if r minus p is equal to
some number, r minus 3, minus

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.640
p minus 3 is going to be
the exact same thing.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.380
I can even prove that
to you, right?

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:11.950
r minus p-- sorry, r minus
3, minus p minus 3.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.940
That's equal to r minus
3, minus p plus 3.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.920
And so these cancel out.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.220
So the difference between this
and this ends up to be r minus

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.950
p, the difference between
that and that.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.850
And that should make sense
intuitively, we're just

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.740
shifting all the numbers
down by three.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.700
So that shouldn't change the

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.030
difference between the numbers.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.935
So two is still an arithmetic
sequence.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.270
Statement three.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.200
p squared, r squared-- so we're
just squaring all the

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.870
numbers-- t squared,
and u squared.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.380
So let's just use our
particular example.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.660
If p was 1, then p squared is
1, 2 squared is 4, s squared

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.690
is 9-- right, 3 squared is
nine, 4 squared is 16.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.470
Now what's the difference
between the numbers?

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.340
The difference here is three.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.460
The difference here is five.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.470
The difference here is seven.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.920
And this is interesting in and
of itself, that-- well, first

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.460
of all, let's just answer
our question.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.360
The difference is now
not constant.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.930
We have a different difference
between each successive

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.890
number, right?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.800
At the beginning, the difference
is two every time.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.980
Here it's three, then it changes
to five, then it

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.120
changes to seven.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.790
So three is not an arithmetic
sequence.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.760
So the answer is
D, one and two.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.820
This is something interesting.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.990
And if you've never experimented
with it, this is

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.289
something to look at.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.650
I've always been fascinated by
the distance between the

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.440
perfect squares increases by
increasing odd numbers, which

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.200
is just something
to think about.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.775
Anyway, next problem.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.350
Actually, I have two problems
left out of all of the

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.880
problem-solving problems, so
instead of just doing one

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.340
problem and going over time, let
me do two of them in the

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.000
the next video.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.550
See you soon.
