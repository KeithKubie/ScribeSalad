00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.870
Hey guys, Matt here for Science or Fiction
and today I’ll tell you how I plan to live

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.660
forever with antioxidants.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.060
I just bought a TON groceries. I've got some blueberries here, we have some dark chocolate.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.820
This is gonna be awesome, right? Oh!

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.200
Can antioxidants really lead to a longer,
healthier life?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.260
Maybe you’ve heard that certain berries
or nuts are good for you because of the antioxidants.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.920
And all that dark chocolate that you like to eat around the holidays, you know, like Christmas,

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.399
Valentine’s Day, Passover, Easter, Arbor
Day.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.130
Everyone eats chocolate on Arbor Day, right?

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.600
Well, those antioxidants are going to help
you live longer, too.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.700
Or is it the opposite?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.070
I mean, these headlines makes it seem like
you should lock that chocolate up and throw

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.920
your acai bowl in the trash.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.180
So which is it?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.840
Will antioxidants help you live longer, or
stop you from living all together?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.220
Well, like a 2006 Facebook relationship status,
it’s complicated.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.720
First you should know there’s a thing called
“free radicals” which is not only an excellent

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.670
band name, but they are also the natural by-products
of chemical processes like those that occur

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.470
when our bodies turn food into energy .

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.810
Free radicals steal electrons from our lipids,
nucleic acids, and proteins which slowly damages

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.390
our genetic material and contributes to the
aging process.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.340
And that’s where antioxidants come in.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.200
Antioxidants intervene by providing extra
electrons to free radicals so they stop stealing

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.290
them from other places in our bodies.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.990
So it would seem eating a bunch of antioxidant-rich
foods like blueberries should then slow the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.760
aging process, right?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.220
Well living longer isn’t as simple as just
ridding your body of free radicals.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.660
One study indicated that free radicals may
be a product rather than a cause of aging,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.760
and in some circumstances, free radicals may
actually increase the longevity of cells.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.700
Now, research has shown that people who eat
more fruits and vegetables, which happen to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.020
be high in antioxidants, have a lower risk
of disease.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.360
But there’s no proof that it’s the antioxidants
in the food that’s causing this.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.640
There’s also little evidence that taking
supplements full of antioxidants like vitamin

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.920
C, or beta-carotene offer any significant
effect on heart disease, cancer, or other

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.149
chronic conditions, although the jury is still out on Vitamin E.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.590
You’re Ok for now Vitamin E, but I’ve
got my eye on you.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.920
So antioxidants may not have all the health benefits that the media and nutrition companies claim.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.140
But could antioxidants actually be bad for
you?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.050
When it comes to antioxidant supplements,
maybe.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.939
A study showed that one source of antioxidants,
beta-carotene, may increase the chances of

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.019
developing lung cancer in men who are heavy smokers.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.709
Rates of skin cancer were shown to be higher
in women who took a combination of vitamin

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.680
C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, selenium, and
zinc.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.480
And studies have shown that rather than increasing
lifespans generally, antioxidant supplements

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.340
may be associated with a shorter lifespans.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.600
In the end, antioxidant supplements are a
mixed bag that you might want to be careful with.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.099
But antioxidant heavy foods, like dark chocolate
and blueberries, really, don’t have enough

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.099
antioxidants to probably do much of anything.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.430
So keep on eating those, but only because
they’re delicious, not because they’ll

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.560
extend your life.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.870
Which reminds me, does anybody want any blueberries?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.300
How about some dark chocolate?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.160
I bought way too much.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.020
I thought I was going to live forever. No?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.740
So antioxidants might not be that good for you, but vitamins are definitely good for

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.049
you, right?

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:16.720
...Right?
