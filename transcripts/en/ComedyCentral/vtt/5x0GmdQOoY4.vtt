ANNOUNCER:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
 please welcome</i>

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:07.740
<i> the second President of the
 Confederate States of America.</i>

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:09.776
(applause and cheering)

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.912
-(applause and cheering swell)
-(camera shutter clicking)

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.782
Oh, yeah. Wow.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.350
-Wow.
-Mr. President?

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.085
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.887
-Mr. President?
-Mr. President?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.356
I'm gonna get mean
and divisive in a few minutes,

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:26.225
but first,
I want to take a moment

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:28.661
to acknowledge the tragic victim

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.097
of the events
in Charlottesville.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.232
<i> -Me! </i>
-(laughter)

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:35.935
You are not the victim
of Charlottesville.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.337
You barely even
denounced the hate groups.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.573
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Let me finish.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.842
Because I am now
going to denounce

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.944
the worst hate group
of them all--

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.579
the press.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.147
I hate you!

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.450
So you're a hate group
with your stupid glasses...

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.985
Okay, you're calling the press
a hate group

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.787
when you side
with white supremacists?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.090
I don't side
with white supremacists, honey!

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.991
I don't see color.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:03.062
I can't, because on Monday,
I stared directly into the sun.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.131
(laughter, applause)

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:08.067
-Afghanistan question, go.
-That's not how this works.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.435
-Sir, you can't tell us
what to ask. -You can't do that.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:10.636
-That's not how it works.
-What are you talking about?

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.738
Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.540
-Excuse me! Excuse me.
-Okay. No. -Come on.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.375
-No. Sir, what are you doing?
-Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:18.344
-Excuse me. Well, no.
-(indistinct chatter)

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.779
Look, there they go.

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.547
They're turning the cameras off

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.283
because they don't want you
to see this!

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.685
No, we're not.
The cameras are on.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.187
-They're your cameras!
-No, no, no! No, no, no!

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.956
Look at me.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.825
Whatever camera
you're watching me on right now

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.561
has been turned off!

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:37.730
Why can't you just
tell people the truth?

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.732
Don't question me!

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.100
You people need to be civil.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.303
That's why
tonight's theme is "civility."

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.873
We need to return
to the genteel ways

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.041
of our Southern whatever...
Who cares?

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:50.576
You know, I don't care.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.245
This is ridiculous.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.513
Here's what I mean.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.681
I'm only talking
to white people,

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:58.951
and if you think about it
that way, I kind of make sense!

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:01.187
-You represent all of Americans.
-(indistinct chatter)

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.623
We might be battling,
but, please,

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.825
let's keep our war civil.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:08.060
-A civil war.
-(laughter)

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:10.663
I'm the president.
Can you secede it?!

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.065
Let's roll!
