00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.835
Let f be a real-valued function
defined on the interval from 0

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:05.680
to infinity.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.770
It does not include 0.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.490
And f is defined
as the natural log

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.780
of x plus the definite
integral from 0

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.270
to x of the square root of
1 plus sine of t, d of t.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.650
Then which of the following
statements are true?

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.909
And so more than one
of these might be true.

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:20.950
So let's figure them out.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.160
So A says, the
second derivative--

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.840
there's two apostrophes here.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.860
The second derivative of f
exists for all x between 0,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.230
or really, all x greater than 0.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.340
Then they say the
first derivative exists

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.840
for all x greater than
0, and the derivative

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.234
is continuous on that interval,
but not differentiable.

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:40.900
OK, so everything
they're doing, they're

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.627
relating the function
to the first derivative

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:44.710
and the second derivative.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.293
So let's just figure
those things out.

00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:48.320
So let's just write
the function first.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.320
I'll just rewrite it here.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.620
The function f is equal
to the natural log

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.140
of x plus the definite
integral from 0

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.410
to x of the square root
of 1 plus sine of t dt.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.620
The derivative of f-- so
let me write it over here.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.650
So f prime of x is going to
be equal to the derivative

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.900
of this first term.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.390
Derivative of natural
log of x is 1/x.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.860
And then derivative
of this, that's

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.680
just the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.890
It's going to be just this
inside expression with respect

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.800
to x, as a function of x,
so plus the square root of 1

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.330
plus sine of x.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.570
Let's get the second
derivative now.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.550
The second
derivative-- I'll do it

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.459
over here-- f
prime prime of x is

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.500
going to be equal to the
derivative of this term.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.160
This is x to the negative 1.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.990
So it's going to be negative x
to the negative 2 or negative 1

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.350
over x squared.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.020
That's negative x
to the negative 2.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.360
You could view it that way.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.490
And then plus-- so
let's do the chain rule.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.990
What's the derivative
of the inside?

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.400
Derivative of 1 plus
sine of x is cosine of x.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.570
So plus cosine of
x times-- now, it's

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.690
1 plus sine of x to the 1/2.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.090
So it's going to
be times 1/2 times

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.070
1 plus sine of x to
the negative 1/2.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.610
So I took the derivatives.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.440
Now let's look at the choices.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.650
So the first choice says
the second derivative

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.190
of the function exists
for all x greater than 0.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.080
If you're going between 0 and
infinity and not including 0,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.460
this is essentially for
all x greater than 0.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.430
Let's see if that is true.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.570
So over here, the
one area-- so this

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.540
would be undefined
if x is equal to 0,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.572
but that's not in the
interval over here.

00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:41.530
So let's just be clear.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.850
When you take something to
the negative 1/2 power--

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.210
let me rewrite it like this.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.850
I could rewrite it as--
instead of writing it

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.670
to the negative 1/2
power, I could write it

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.080
in the denominator as the
square root of 1 plus sine of x.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.330
So if this denominator
becomes undefined,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.050
the second derivative
won't be undefined.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.919
So let's think about when that
denominator might be undefined.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.460
So it'll be undefined
if it equals 0.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.530
So 1 plus sine of
x is equal to 0.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.700
Well, it's going to be
equal to 0 if sine of x

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.900
is equal to negative 1.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.010
And sine of x can equal negative
1 at x is equal to-- let's see.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.040
If you go around
the unit circle,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.590
sine is the
y-coordinate, so it has

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.680
to go around-- you
can either go down.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.730
It would be negative 90 degrees
or positive 270 degrees.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.921
Or if in radians, if x is equal
to-- because we're assuming,

00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:40.420
or at least I'm assuming that
we're dealing in radians here.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.290
If x is equal to 3 pi
over 2, assuming we're

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.270
in radians, that will
make this undefined.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:58.360
So this f prime prime
not defined at x

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.360
is equal to 3 pi over 2, which
is clearly in this interval.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.680
So choice A is false.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.417
Choice A does not work.

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:08.000
Now let's see.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.250
Choice B says f
prime of x exists

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.900
for all x's greater than 0.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.900
Well, that seems to be the case.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.050
You can't put x equal 0, but
that's not in the interval.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.050
And f prime is continuous
on 0 to infinity.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.530
Yeah, it's continuous-- no
obvious discontinuities here--

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.231
but not differentiable
on 0 to infinity.

00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:28.980
Well, it's clearly not
differentiable at 0

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.590
to infinity.

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:34.560
The first derivative or
the second derivative

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.750
does not exist at x is
equal to 3 pi over 2.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.460
We just saw that.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.770
f prime of x is not
differentiable at 3 pi over 2.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.220
So everything in this is true.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.372
Everything is true.

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:48.830
It's not differentiable there
because the second derivative

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.340
is not defined at 3 pi over 2.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.230
Let's do part C
now, part C. There

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.590
exists an alpha
greater than 1 such

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.940
that the absolute
value of f prime of x

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.700
is less than the absolute value
of f of x for all x essentially

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.280
greater than-- for all x
greater than that alpha.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.780
So let's think about this.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.500
Let's think about
this a little bit.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.880
What we want to show is
that, beyond some threshold,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.330
the derivative is always
going to be smaller

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.400
than the original f of x.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.060
The derivative will always
be smaller than f of x.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.339
So the first thing we might
want to see-- so let's

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.130
just compare the parts
that are comparable.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.480
So let's compare, first of
all, the natural log of x.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.450
Let's compare the
natural log of x to 1/x.

00:05:38.997 --> 00:05:40.330
Let's just set a threshold here.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.700
So is there a number
so at any number

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.300
larger than that,
the natural log

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.577
of x is always going
to be larger than 1/x?

00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:51.160
And the number that
pops into my head,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.870
just because it's an easy number
to work with with natural logs,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.630
is e.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.300
So for x is greater than
e, it's pretty clear

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.650
that the natural log of x is
going to be greater than 1/x.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.490
Think about it.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.730
At e, it's going to evaluate
to the natural log of e, which

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.596
is 1.

00:06:11.596 --> 00:06:14.400
And 1 is clearly
greater than 1/e.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.420
e is 2.71 and so
on and so forth.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.130
So this is clearly true.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.680
And then as you get beyond e, as
you get numbers larger than e,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.970
as this becomes
e plus something,

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.160
this number will become larger.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.940
And then this number over
here will become smaller

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.500
because we'll be dividing
by a larger number.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.870
So it's clear that it
exists just for this part,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.214
for the first part, the
natural log of x beyond e.

00:06:37.214 --> 00:06:38.880
And we just have to
find some threshold.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.620
That might not be
the first threshold.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.440
But the natural log of x is
definitely greater than 1/x

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.770
when x is greater than e.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.520
Now let's see if we can find a
threshold for the second part.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.250
And if we can, then
we can literally just

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.310
pick the larger of
the two thresholds,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.200
and then that will be a
threshold above which f of x

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.260
will always be larger
than f prime of x.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.770
And to think about
it, we just have

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.140
to see that essentially
this part of the function--

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.910
let me write it this way.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:17.820
If I define this as h of x,
this right here is h prime of x.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.300
We've already shown that for
x is greater than e, h of x

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.870
is greater than h prime of x.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.430
We've seen that already.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.070
Now let me define
this over here.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.540
Let me define that as g of x.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.320
Let me call that g of x.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.130
And then this is its derivative.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.610
This is g prime of x.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.010
That is g prime of x.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:51.500
Now, let's just draw g of x.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.580
Actually, let me draw g
prime of x right over here.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.390
Let me draw it.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.300
It's actually a pretty
straightforward graph to draw.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.480
So let me draw it over here.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.620
So when x is equal to 0,
sine of 0 is 0 plus 1.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.750
You take the square root.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.590
So 0, 1, that's the first point.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.980
That is f of x equal to
1 when x is equal to 0.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.300
And then the next interesting
point, maybe we'll

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.080
take x is equal to pi over 2.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.740
So when x is pi over 2,
sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.752
1 plus 1 is 2, take
the square root.

00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:29.210
So it's going to
be the square root

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.450
of 2, which is someplace around
here, so the square root of 2.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:40.120
And then let's just take when
x is pi, sine of pi is 0.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.130
This becomes the
square root of 1 again,

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.059
so we're back over here.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.100
Then let's go to 3 pi over 2.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.610
Sine of 3 pi over
2 is negative 1.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.420
Negative 1 plus 1
is going to be 0,

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.450
so we're going to be down here.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.670
And then we go again to 2 pi.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.840
Sine of 2 pi is 0.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.617
0 plus 1 is 1.

00:09:02.617 --> 00:09:04.450
Take the square root,
you're back over here.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.080
So this graph, g prime
of x we're calling it.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.700
This graph over here
looks like this.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.150
It looks something like.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.670
This is my best
attempt at drawing it.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.910
It just keeps oscillating.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.618
If its maximum point
is square root of 2,

00:09:18.618 --> 00:09:21.150
its minimum point is 0,
and it keeps oscillating.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.272
So this is g prime of x.

00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:26.140
G prime of x is equal
to the square root

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.410
of 1 plus sine of x.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.600
Now, what is g of x?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.290
What is this thing over here?

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.260
Well, this is the
definite integral from 0

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.630
to x of this thing.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.900
So you take any x-value,
this thing over here, g of x,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.350
is the area over here.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.490
So what's happening here?

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.410
So let's think about this.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.880
As we get to larger
and larger x-values,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.990
the area gets bigger
because this line never

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.990
drops below the x-axis.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.640
So as we get larger
and larger x-values,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.860
this area just keeps getting
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:12.130
So we can write g of x
unbounded as x goes to infinity.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.840
G of x approaches infinity.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.626
What about g prime of x?

00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:17.960
g prime of x, it maxes out.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.030
It just keeps oscillating
between 0 and square root of 2.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.160
So g prime of x max-- or maybe
I should write it this way.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.140
The max of g prime of x is
equal to the square root of 2.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.010
So it's pretty clear
that at some point

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.800
this area is going to be either
some x-value or this area

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.860
is going to be more than
the square root of 2.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.000
Let's call that point alpha.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.070
And after that alpha,
where maybe it's over here,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.460
I mean, clearly we could
say, at x equals 10,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.750
we definitely have a lot
of area under this curve.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.200
The area is definitely bigger
than the square root of 2.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.075
So let me just write it
there because we just

00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:56.610
need to find some boundary.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.354
Let's just say at x
greater than-- I'm just

00:11:01.354 --> 00:11:02.520
picking an arbitrary number.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.170
At x is greater
than 10, it's clear

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:13.020
that the integral from 0 to
x of the square root of 1

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:19.760
plus sine of x, or I should
say 1 plus sine of t dt,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.570
it's clear that that
is going to be greater

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.169
than the square root
of 1 plus sine of x,

00:11:26.169 --> 00:11:27.210
because this is the area.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.300
At any value above
10, this thing at most

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.534
can ever get to
square root of 2.

00:11:34.534 --> 00:11:36.700
This thing's just going to
keep growing and growing.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.500
At 10, it's already
going to be larger

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.740
than the square root of 2.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.570
So we know that
there's some boundary.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.610
So for x is greater than 10--
so let's write it this place.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.560
So for x greater
than 10, well, 10

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.770
is definitely greater than e.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.130
We know that h of x is
greater than h prime of x.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.340
We know that's true.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.920
10 is clearly greater than
e, so we can state that.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:08.450
And we also know that g of x
is greater than g prime of x.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:15.350
So we know that f of x, which
is equal to h of x plus g of x,

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.994
is going to be greater
than f prime of x, which

00:12:19.994 --> 00:12:21.910
was the derivative, the
sum of the derivative,

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.040
which is equal to h prime
of x plus g prime of x.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.350
So we know that this is true.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.850
We can make alpha equal 10 and
this thing is going to be true.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.560
So this is true.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.780
Now let's do part D. There
exists a beta greater than 0

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.440
such that the
absolute value of f

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.040
of x plus the absolute
value of the derivative of f

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.160
is going to be less than
or equal to beta for all x.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.940
Well, we already
know that f of x

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:57.870
is unbounded, because
this integral part of it

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.090
right here just
keeps increasing as x

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.527
gets larger and
larger and larger.

00:13:01.527 --> 00:13:02.360
It never dips below.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.640
We never have negative area.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.860
So this area just keeps growing.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.590
So this is unbounded.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.980
And actually, so is
the natural log of x.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.360
The natural log of x is
also going to be unbounded.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.210
So you cannot say that it's
going to be less than some

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.030
value because it's going
to approach infinity.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:26.180
So it's not going to
be less than some value

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.380
for all x from 0 to infinity.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.370
So you can't bound it.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.940
This is an unbounded function.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.030
Just this part alone is
an unbounded function.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.690
f prime of x is-- well, even
there you have to be careful.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.650
But f of x is clearly unbounded,
so this can't be true.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:51.770
There's not any kind of roof
you can put on the-- well,

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.160
I think you get
the general idea.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.340
So this is definitely not true.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.923
So the answer here is B and C.
