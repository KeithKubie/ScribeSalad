00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.110
In the video that I just did,
where I try to more rigorously

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.910
prove the Gibbs free energy
relation, and that if this

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.620
relation is less than zero
then this is spontaneous.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.890
I took great pains to make sure
that we use the proper

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.100
definition of entropy.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.080
That every time that we said,
OK, a change in entropy from

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.870
here to here is the heat
absorbed by a reversible

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.050
process divided by the
temperature at

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.290
which it was absorbed.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.630
And the change in entropy of
the environment is the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.990
opposite of that and, of course,
that is equal to zero.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.860
And I was very careful to
use this definition.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920
And so you might have been
asking, hey Sal, there's a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.690
much simpler definition or
proof in my textbook.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.720
And I don't if it's in your
textbook, but it's in some of

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.290
the ones that I've seen
and in some of the web

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.470
pages I've looked at.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.960
Where they use a much simpler
argument that gets us

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.240
eventually to this Gibbs
free energy relation.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.800
And I thought I would go over
it because as far as I can

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.080
tell, it's incorrect.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.940
And what the argument tends to
go, is it says, look, the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.519
second law of thermodynamics
tells us, that for any

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:13.870
spontaneous process, that delta
S is greater than zero.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.900
I agree with that completely
right now.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.900
And in order for delta S, and
that's delta S of the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.120
universe, is greater
than zero.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.760
And that means that delta S of
the system plus dealt S of the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.390
environment is going to
be greater than zero.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.090
and then this is the step that
you'll often see in a lot of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.020
textbooks and a lot of websites
that I disagree with.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.670
They'll say delta S of the
environment is equal to the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:53.100
heat or, let me say, the heat
absorbed by the environment,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.860
divided by the temperature
of the environment.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.540
And let's just say for
simplicity that everything

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.685
here it's in some type of
temperature equilibrium.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.390
And it tends to be when we're
dealing with stuff in our

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.150
chemistry sets in our
labs, whatever else.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.169
But the the reason why I
disagree with this step right

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.810
here, that you see in a lot of
textbooks, is that this is not

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.000
saying anything about the
reversibility of the reaction.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.810
You can only use this
thermodynamic definition of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.930
entropy if you know this heat
transfer is reversible.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.370
And when we're doing it in
general terms, we don't know

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.070
whether it's reversal.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.690
In fact, if we're saying to
begin with that the reaction

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.340
is spontaneous, that means
by definition that it's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.810
irreversible.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.370
So this is actually an
irreversible transfer of heat,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.990
which is not the definition
of entropy.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.990
The thermodynamic definition
of entropy is a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.200
very delicate one.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.030
You have to make sure that it
is a reversible reaction.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.470
Obviously, in a lot of first
year chemistry classes this

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.160
doesn't matter.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.620
You're going to get the
question right.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.790
In fact, the question might be
dependent upon you making this

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.760
incorrect assumption.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.550
So I don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.620
But I want to show you that
this is not a right

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.050
assumption.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.450
Because if you're assuming
something is spontaneous, and

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.105
you're saying, OK, the change in
entropy in the environment

00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:13.400
is equal to the amount of heat
the environment absorbs,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.330
divided by T-- this is wrong
because this is not an

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.030
irreversible reaction.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.690
But let's just see how this
argument tends to proceed.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.270
So they'll say, OK, this is
equal to delta S of our system

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.440
plus the change in heat of our
environment, divided by the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.260
temperature of our
environment.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.980
They'll call this for the
environment, and that of

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.940
course has to be
equal to zero.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.400
And they'll say, look, the
heat absorbed by the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.760
environment is equal to the
minus of the heat absorbed by

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.680
the system.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.170
Right?

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.230
It's either the system is
giving energy to the

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.160
environment or the environment
is giving energy or heat to

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.650
the system.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.770
So they are just going to be
the minus of each other.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.170
So the argument would go, well
this thing I can rewrite.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.130
This equation is the change in
entropy of the system, instead

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.220
of writing a plus Q of the
environment here, I could

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.480
write a minus Q of the system
over T is greater than zero.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.279
And then they multiply both
sides of this equation by T

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:24.230
and you get T delta S of the
system minus the heat absorbed

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.230
by the system is greater
than zero.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.760
You multiply both sides of this
by negative one and you

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.880
get the heat absorbed by the
system minus the temperature

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.990
times the change in entropy of
the system is greater than

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.120
zero-- I'm sorry, is less than
zero when you multiply both

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.090
sides by a negative, you
switch the signs.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.660
And then if you assume constant
pressure, this is the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.250
change in enthalpy
of the system.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.330
So you get the change in
enthalpy minus the temperature

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.485
times delta S of the system
is less than zero.

00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:56.450
And they say, see this shows
that if you have a negative

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.230
Gibbs free energy or change in
Gibbs free energy, then you're

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.260
spontaneous.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.400
But all of that was predicated
on the idea that this could be

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.780
rewritten like this.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.500
But it can't be rewritten like
that, because this is not a

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.520
reversible process.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.170
We're starting from the
assumption that this is a

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.560
spontaneous irreversible
process.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.410
And so you can't make this
substitution here.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.700
And that's why in the earlier
video I was very careful not

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.090
to make that substitution.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.210
I was very careful to say, oh,
you know, the change in

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.450
entropy of an irreversible
system that goes from here to

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:39.800
here is the same as the change
in entropy as an irreversible

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.920
system that goes from
there to there.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.090
Or let me say this
differently.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.550
The change in entropy of a
reversible system from there

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.570
to there is the same as
an irreversible system

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.300
from there to there.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.920
Although you don't know what
goes on in between for the

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.240
irreversible.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.040
And so that's why I made
this comparison.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.340
This thing, and this thing are
the same, but then we compared

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.830
the heat absorbed by an
irreversible system, and we

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.910
showed that it's less than the
heat absorbed by a reversible

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.090
system because it's generating
its own friction.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.760
And from that, we got this
relation, which we were able

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.250
to then go and get the Gibbs
free energy relation.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.730
So, anyway, I don't want to make
a video that's too geeky

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.470
or too particular, or
kind of trying to

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.330
really pick at the details.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.210
But I think it's an important
point to make because so much

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.000
of what we talk about,
especially in thermodynamics,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.485
is our definition of entropy.

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:33.090
And it's very important we use
the correct one, and we don't

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.700
take what I would argue are
incorrect shortcuts, because

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.320
this is not the definition
of entropy right there.
