As we go to our next game,
#OscarsSoWhite.

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.740
#OscarsSoWhite.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.113
As you probably heard,
uh, no actors of color

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.915
were nominated
at the Academy Awards this year.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:19.052
So all the nominees just look
like a pristine snowcap.

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.155
Uh, despite amazing performances
in movies like <i>Creed</i>

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.757
and <i>Straight Outta Compton-- </i>
I was really surprised,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.927
especially by that. So, the
ceremony's gonna look more white

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.998
than, like, a chardonnay line
at a Coldplay concert, uh...

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.333
Luckily, the hashtag,
#OscarsSoWhite,

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.836
has been really hilarious
all week, like this tweet.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.238
"#OscarsSoWhite that the bear
in <i>Revenant</i> would have snagged

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:41.041
a nomination if she were polar."

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:47.648
-That's good. That's good.
-Well done, Marlon James.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:50.184
So we thought we'd get in
on the action.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.352
Comedians, please give me
as many #OscarsSoWhite tweets

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.755
as you possibly can
in 60 seconds. And begin.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.591
-Adam Savage. -They won't let
their daughter date the Tonys.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:00.928
Points. Ron Funches.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.430
#OscarsSoWhite they're giving
a lifetime achievement award

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.698
to the movie <i>Powder.</i>

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.034
Points. Adam.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.769
The after-party's
at Cracker Barrel.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.904
Points. Ron Funches.

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.239
Actually,
I heard the after-party

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.240
was at Boston Market.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.242
Points. Ron Funches.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.511
I heard they're attempting
to adopt Chris Rock.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.513
Points. Rich Eisen.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.181
It's a Matthew McConaughey
Joint.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.183
Points. Adam Savage.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:25.652
Music by Macklemore
and Mumford &amp; Sons.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.487
Points. Rich Eisen.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.156
A brunette counts as diversity.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.892
Points. Rich Eisen again.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.394
Spike Lee will be played
by Channing Tatum.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.996
All right, points.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.096
Perfect.
