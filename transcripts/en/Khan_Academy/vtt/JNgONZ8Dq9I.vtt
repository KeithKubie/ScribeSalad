00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.940
- [Instructor] The idea
of genetic engineering

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.530
is something that we associate
with the 20th century.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.910
We didn't even know

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.660
that genes were actually
the mechanism of heredity

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.590
until the middle of the 20th century.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.620
And the direct modification
of genes for some purpose

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.180
really didn't even start
happening until the 1970s.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.580
But it's worth noting that human beings

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.090
have been, in some ways,
influencing the genetics

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.830
of organisms for a very,
very, very long time.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.940
For example, in nature you have
things that look like this.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.740
We call them wolves.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.350
But today in our lives,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.440
we also have things that look like this.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.890
Now these dogs did not
come about naturally.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.430
They came about from many
generations of breeding,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.690
of human beings taking things

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.400
that started off looking
like wolves or foxes,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.740
and selecting for certain traits.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.420
They might have selected for traits

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.020
that maybe they're small, and
they look more like puppies,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.540
even when they're full grown.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.440
Or traits that they are more docile.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.560
They're more likely to listen

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.800
to what a human being says to do.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.210
Or traits that they're
good at killing rodents,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.730
or whatever else it might be,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.410
and over time, repeated
selection of those traits

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.450
led to what we see as these
different breeds of dogs.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.560
So even though human
beings were doing this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.860
for hundreds and thousands of years,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.230
they were influencing
what DNA gets passed on

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.290
from one generation to another.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.220
They didn't know about
the actual genetic code,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.400
but it was a form of genetic
manipulation nonetheless.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.310
Similarly, if you look
into the plant kingdom,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.560
when you go to the store and
you see that sweet apple,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.080
things like that might not have existed

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.960
in the form that you see them today.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.160
It is very likely, in fact
most agricultural products,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.190
people might have found wild apples,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.610
and we could be talking
thousands of years ago.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.350
They might have found wild apple trees.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.060
Let me draw a quick apple tree here.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.124
And they might've found

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.740
that the apples were a little bit sour,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.140
and small, and hard to
eat, and hard to digest,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.190
but over time, people selected the trees

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.070
that had sweeter apples,
that had larger apples,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.020
and made the conditions

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.360
so that they were more
likely to reproduce.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.130
So over time, you got
larger and sweeter apples

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.670
like the type that you see at your store.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.503
And as I mentioned,

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:29.000
most agricultural products
that we have today

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.360
are the result of hundreds
or thousands of years

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.430
of this type of breeding.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.340
So even though that might
not be the formal definition

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.760
of genetic engineering,
which typically is referring

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.670
to something like gene modification,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.190
which we've only been able to
do in the last few decades,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.750
human beings have been
doing some type of influence

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.070
on organisms' DNA for
a very, very long time.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.880
But with that said, in
the last few decades,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.540
we've been able to become
much, much more precise

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.920
with influencing DNA
through genetic engineering.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.753
In other videos,

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:05.720
we'll go more detail
about how that is done,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.953
but you have this idea of recombinant DNA,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.950
where you could take
genes from one organism

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.800
and put them in another organism.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.210
And you might say, why is this useful?

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.700
Well let's say there is
a tree you wanna grow.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.200
Let's say it's an apple tree,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.900
but it's very susceptible to
a certain type of disease,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.400
and if that disease hits,
you lose all of your crop.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.910
But what if you could insert
into the DNA of that apple tree

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.910
maybe a gene that makes it
more resistant to that disease?

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.790
And this is what people actually do today.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.210
So they will insert DNA,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.500
and it could be from
some pretty wild things.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.250
I've read stories about
inserting insect DNA into a plant

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.650
so that it will be more
robust in some way or another.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.070
Now this idea of recombinant DNA

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.420
and genetically modifying food,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.640
this is often known as a
genetically modified organism,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.550
this is somewhat controversial.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.480
Many people say, hey this is good.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.510
It allows us to produce more robust foods.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.070
In fact, part of this recombinant DNA,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.380
inserting DNA into something else,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.840
it might make it more nutritious.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.290
It might provide for more vitamins.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.530
But other people would argue that,

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.450
hey we don't know exactly
what all the repercussions

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.280
of what we're doing will happen.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.530
We might think it's helpful,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.150
but when you're taking
DNA from one organism

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.550
and putting it into another,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.070
how does that affect the nutrition,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.370
or the long-lasting effects
of eating that over time?

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.750
So this is something
for you to think about.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.110
And we're starting to go,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.890
when we start asking these questions,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.520
into the field of bioethics.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.660
As we have more and more
control over the genome,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.140
and especially, as we'll
see, the human genome,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.610
there's questions that we have to ask

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.520
about is it good, or is it bad?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520
But going back to this
idea of genetic engineering

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.410
and recombinant DNA,

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.890
other things that you
could do is you could,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.800
let's say that we need to
produce insulin for diabetics.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.010
Well, maybe you can take a bacteria cell,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.650
and insert into the bacteria cell

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.380
the gene that helps produce for insulin.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.210
And then, all of a sudden,
that bacteria cell can become

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.950
an human-insulin-producing factory,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.500
so that we could have more
insulin for diabetics,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.790
that this insulin could then be harvested.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.770
That is a use of recombinant DNA.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.500
And so we really are going into

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.070
an interesting period in humanity.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.490
For many thousands of years
we were breeding things,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.740
but now we're learning
to manipulate things

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.260
at a very fine-grain level.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.070
And it makes us ask
all sorts of questions.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.740
There are likely to be some
very good things we can do.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.100
Produce new medicines.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.610
Produce more robust crops.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.320
But there are also questions about

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.580
what are the side effects?

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.820
And the bioethics get really
interesting when we start

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.900
thinking about modifying
the human genome itself.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.240
Because when you're modifying genetics,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.080
you're not just modifying one organism,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.200
you're modifying all of their offspring.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.080
You're modifying the genes
that exist in the gene pool.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.880
And so some very good arguments

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.700
for modifying the human genome are

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.810
correcting diseases, some things
that could be very serious.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.250
But over time, things might,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.024
people might say, hey I
wanna be a little bit taller,

00:06:17.024 --> 00:06:19.770
or I want a certain hair color,
or I want straighter teeth.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.603
Or they might say,

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:23.730
I want a child who has
this trait or that trait.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.860
So things get very, very interesting

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.553
the more we think about how
genetic engineering may be used.
