00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.850
The first optimizations we
do are easy to implement and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.850
make our code load faster.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.020
We first glue our CSS and JavaScript
files together through concatenation,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.330
then crunch them with a minifile.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.448
In previous lessons,
we applied a couple tasks to our CSS.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:17.073
But this time it's
mostly about JavaScript.

00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:20.438
I say mostly because these
topics still apply to CSS.

00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:22.970
It's simply that we're
already mostly covered.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.970
Sass does both concatenation and
minification for you.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.873
Manual concatenation isn't necessary,

00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:31.648
because you can simply include
a single Sass file in your HTML.

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:35.432
Then use the import directive in
your Sass to input other files

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:36.757
into your base file.

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:39.531
When the Sass compiler
processes the Sass into CSS,

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:43.450
it will automatically inline those
inputs and generate one big CSS file.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.020
A minification is just an optional way.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.330
Just modify the Sass pipe slightly and
add outputStyle: 'compressed' as config,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.610
which will produce
a nicely compressed file.
