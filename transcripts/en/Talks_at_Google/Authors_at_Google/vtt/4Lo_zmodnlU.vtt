SEEMA VASHI: Thank
you for coming.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.910
My name is Seema, and
I am really, really

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.940
excited to be hosting
this panel today.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.200
All of you know why you're here.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.066
But the lovely Lauren
Epshteyn has recently--

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.882
[CHEERING]

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:15.381
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:18.550
--recently published
her first novel--

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.190
historical fiction-- called
"A Northern Gentleman."

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.869
For the first 25, we have books
out there you guys can grab.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.910
But we just wanted to take
some time in this hour

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.300
to get to know more about
her experience writing

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.240
this book, her inspiration.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.150
We're actually going
to also have some time

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.590
to have her read a chapter and
have a little mini book club

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.920
conversation, as
I like to call it.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.080
There will be time at the end
to ask your own questions,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.740
so think about them.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.250
But let's go ahead
and bring Lauren up.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.820
Thank you.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.259
This is exciting.

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.675
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Thank you, Seema.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:58.850
Thank you for interviewing
me today and hosting.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.140
I asked Seema to
interview me in front

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.510
of so many of my
close Google friends

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.070
because she is fantastic
at doing exactly that.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.700
She's hosted many
panels at Google before,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.950
so thank you for your time
today, and thank all of you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.860
for coming.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.401
It means the world to me that
you would come, and some of you

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:16.036
are participating today.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:18.160
I know just about all of
you, but thank you so much

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.690
for your time.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.920
SEEMA VASHI: So
let's kick it off.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.910
We all know why we're
here for this book,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.875
and you wrote this book.

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:27.750
Can you talk a little
bit about what prompted

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.470
you to even go on this journey?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.200
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: So I've
always loved writing.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.580
I'm a big believer
in if you want

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.497
to figure out what
you're passionate about

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:38.580
or realize what you're
passionate about, look back

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.170
to what you had
fun doing as a kid.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.620
And for me, writing stories was
absolutely one of those things

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.530
that I loved doing as a kid.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.040
I remember when I
was 10 years old,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.780
we had a family reunion that
had a questionnaire that said,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.160
what's your life goal?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.710
Or what do you hope
you do someday?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.168
And at 10 years old I said, I
want to be a "New York Times"

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:56.002
best-selling author.

00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.459
I don't even know how I knew
what that was at 10 years old,

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.849
but that's what I wanted to do.

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.640
So I'm not sure that
"A Northern Gentleman"

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.620
is going to achieve
that goal for me,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.850
but when the story
came to me, I had

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.889
to at least give it a try-- try
writing fiction as an adult.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.460
SEEMA VASHI: And so
going about this,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.269
how did you know
how to write a book?

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.560
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Good question.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.074
So they say that readers
make the best writers.

00:02:18.074 --> 00:02:20.240
Although, I was thinking
about it this morning-- no,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.719
they say drinkers
make the best writers.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.510
But they say readers
make the best writers,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.704
and I have always been a
voracious reader, maybe not

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:31.120
as much as-- I know there's
actually a lot of Googlers who

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.540
read much more than I do,
and I'm inspired by you all.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.000
But hopefully, then, you
can relate to this idea.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.590
I personally have always loved
American historical fiction

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.810
perhaps the most.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.872
Some of my favorite
books are by Gore Vidal,

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.610
or there's one in
particular that I loved

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.040
by an author named Jack Finney.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.680
Does anybody know
"Time and Again"?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.460
It's a great book,
where a guy who's

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.310
living in New York in the
year 1970 time travels back,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.150
so there's a little
tiny bit of sci-fi

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.710
there, to New York in 1882.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.870
And as I was researching
for America in the 1890s,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.677
it was definitely
influential in understanding

00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:11.260
what types of words that people
used, what types of activities

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.710
did people do in the 1800s and
late 1800s, so I love that.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.370
I read a lot.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.980
I also read a book
on how to write.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.010
I read several.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.930
One in particular, if anyone is
interested in writing a fiction

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.100
book, was by a literary
agent and editor named

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.850
Sol Stein called
"On Writing," and I

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.540
found that one really helpful.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.540
The biggest takeaway
I had from that book

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.350
was that you need
to raise the stakes.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.710
People will only be
interested in what you're

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.750
writing if they feel like
there's something big at stake,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.020
whether it's someone's
life, or his classic example

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.790
is make it the
fate of the earth.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.040
Is there an asteroid coming?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.660
That wasn't as applicable
in a story like "A Northern

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.650
Gentleman," but I tried, when
possible, to raise the stakes.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.510
And then my favorite
book on writing

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.960
is actually one
by a screenwriter.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.770
Has anyone heard of the
book called "Save the Cat?"

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.560
Yeah, someone has.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.030
Have you read it?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.630
OK, so yeah, "Save
the Cat" is a book

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.000
on screenwriting, where
the "namesake rule," one

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.170
of his first rules of
writing, is that you have

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.690
to make the character likeable.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.110
So early on, have
the main character

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.570
do something small
but very likable,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.149
like saving a cat that's
stuck up in a tree.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.410
So I tried after
reading that to make

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.077
Drucker, my main character,
do small little things,

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:26.660
whether it was
standing up for himself

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.760
or saying something clever back
to someone, that would make you

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.040
like him and root for him.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.442
Rather than, actually, the very
initial version of Drucker, he

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:35.730
was a little pathetic.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.320
He hated his job, which he does.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.986
And if you read the
book, you'll know he

00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:40.480
hates his job in the beginning.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.600
But he was sort of
beaten down by it.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.064
And then reading "Save the Cat"
really made him more empowered.

00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:48.730
And then, finally,
if anyone else really

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.759
wants to write a book, the
thing I did when I started was I

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.300
took a class.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.980
It was a four-month class at
Media Bistro, a couple hundred

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.650
bucks, and you stay accountable
for bringing your homework

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.840
every week.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.220
And I did that for about
four months, and the takeaway

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.970
I had from that class--
it was fun to just

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.219
have others read your writing.

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.000
They gave me some good ideas.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.970
They reminded me
that when you're

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.370
writing historical
fiction in particular,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.750
the author knows things
that have actually

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.670
happened that the
characters don't, and so I

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.030
had a lot of fun with that.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.113
There's one point, and I
won't give too much away,

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.270
where Drucker, the
main character,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.110
suggests the idea of
something like a credit card.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.170
And the people around
him think he's nuts.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.870
You know, what?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.970
That sounds horrible.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.390
That will never work.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.509
Because if you think
about it, in the 1890s,

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.800
that probably would have
sounded like a really bad idea

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.290
to someone who just had
a local credit account

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.562
with the local merchant.

00:05:40.562 --> 00:05:42.520
So I had a lot of fun
with that, and that class

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.305
was really useful in that way.

00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:45.180
SEEMA VASHI: Awesome.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.750
So I think a lot of people
here, as well as myself, love

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.920
the idea of writing a book.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.846
And you have a full time job.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:55.970
When did you find the time?

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.710
When did you actually
get this done?

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.690
How long did it take?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.010
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I get
that question all the time.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.470
And I wish that I had
a really clean answer,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.912
like Tuesdays and Thursdays
from 6:00 to 9:00.

00:06:04.912 --> 00:06:06.870
Like for some of my NYU
friends, you could just

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.145
have an easy answer for that.

00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:10.270
It wasn't like that at all.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.650
For me, it was sporadic.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.660
And I say this
because if you have

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.489
a passion or a story
or an art project

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:18.030
or whatever it is that you think
you don't have the time for,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.810
I hope that me sitting
up here is proof

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.710
that you don't need a
whole lot of free time

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.870
in order to make some
forward progress.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.920
Sometimes I would challenge
myself to do 100 words a day,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.640
usually in May, because that
rhymed-- 100 words a day

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.317
in May.

00:06:30.317 --> 00:06:31.900
And then in June, I
wouldn't touch it.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.330
And some days 500 words
would flow easily,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.905
and other days getting to 99
would be a real challenge.

00:06:37.905 --> 00:06:39.655
And then, like I said,
I wouldn't touch it

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:40.999
for the next month.

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.040
And actually, I put the
book down for four years.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.110
I didn't touch it for
four years after writing

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.676
for an initial nine months.

00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:48.300
And when I picked it
back up, the story

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.264
just came right back to me.

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.430
It was there waiting for me.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.842
So that's why I knew I
had to keep going with it.

00:06:53.842 --> 00:06:55.800
Why I say, again, to all
of you in the audience

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.840
and you watching, you don't
need a whole lot of free time

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.270
just to make some progress
on a story or a project that

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.460
means something to you.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.910
SEEMA VASHI: So what
was that timeline, then?

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.310
So you said you worked
on it for nine months.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.143
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yep,
so, yep, I started it.

00:07:08.143 --> 00:07:11.130
I had moved to New
York summer 2007.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.330
One year later, I got this
idea while sitting on a train

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.252
back from DC.

00:07:15.252 --> 00:07:17.460
For any of you haven't read
the book yet, a lot of it

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.690
takes place on a train.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.430
Train travel's a big
part of the book.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.410
The idea came to
me first, actually;

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.804
I was playing
around with titles,

00:07:24.804 --> 00:07:26.470
and I thought of "a
northern gentleman."

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.640
That just sounded
interesting to me.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.720
And I thought, what
would that be about?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.303
Well, definitely a
guy from the South,

00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:32.660
and that's where I started.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.190
And then I signed up for this
Media Bistro writing class,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.700
took that for four months,
wrote for about the next five

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.022
after that, but then really put
it down and didn't touch it,

00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:44.230
didn't have the time, had
a lot of other distractions

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.230
in my life for the
next four years.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.490
And then when I graduated
from business school

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.980
in the spring of 2013 was
when I really picked it up.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.910
And, you know, I can't say that
I had the Tuesday and Thursday

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.690
nights, three hours
at a time, but that's

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.330
when I really started
making the time,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.600
even though it was sporadic.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.142
SEEMA VASHI: And was this like
an internal goal for yourself,

00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:02.516
or did you have
other people kind

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:03.699
of keeping you accountable?

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:04.740
I guess the class helped.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.800
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: The class
helped, but that was only

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.890
in the beginning.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.660
It was for me.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.420
I had this story, and
I wanted to tell it.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.980
And every time I came back to
it, it was still there for me,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.630
and it was exciting and fun.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.530
So it was really just for me
and holding it in my hand,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.090
and having control
over the story

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.197
and the process was a
really good experience.

00:08:21.197 --> 00:08:22.280
SEEMA VASHI: That's great.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.750
So everyone here knows
that Lauren's name

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.330
is Lauren, not Lane.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.840
So on the cover of the book you
see that she uses a pen name.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.770
It's Lane Everett.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.201
So could you explain why you
did that-- same initials?

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:35.950
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes,
this is the question

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.919
I get the second most
after, how did you ever

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.350
find the time to do that?

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.490
Yes, I used a pen name.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.940
I always wanted
to use a pen name.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.770
It sounds a little bit
shallow or on the surface,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.760
but I wanted something
unisex and All-American

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.843
on the cover of this book.

00:08:48.843 --> 00:08:51.585
To me, this was like
an American story,

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:53.710
and I wanted something that
could have been written

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.670
by any classic American name.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.820
So I wanted that.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.480
But also-- and I
hope you guys can all

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.620
relate to this,
many of you being

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.927
in sales and engineering-- but
I am in client meetings a lot.

00:09:05.927 --> 00:09:08.010
I didn't know who was going
to be saying something

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.426
about this book or another
book that I write in the future

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:13.084
and what they would be saying,
and I didn't want a client

00:09:13.084 --> 00:09:15.000
googling "who just gave
me that advice on what

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.585
to do with my mobile strategy"
and finding something untoward

00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:19.460
that someone would have
written about Drucker

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.810
or any other of my characters.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.469
So I wanted to keep
that nice and separate,

00:09:24.469 --> 00:09:25.510
really draw a line there.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.580
And I know that sounds
clean in principle.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.560
But I have to tell you, and
I think this is interesting,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.810
I've been, in the
last couple months,

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.080
talking to everyone I can
find with some connection

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.755
to the book marketing industry.

00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:37.130
And to a T, just about every
single one of them has said,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.060
no, you need to republish
using your own name.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.410
Why?

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.150
Because I know there are
many authors who historically

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.020
have used pen names.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.220
There's some famous ones.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.840
One of my favorite is
Ayn Rand, or Ayn Rand.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.640
Her name was Alisa
Rosenbaum or something.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.100
So many historical
authors did that.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.049
But these days,
apparently, and so I hear,

00:09:56.049 --> 00:09:57.340
it's not books that sell books.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.250
It's authors that sell books.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.160
And in this world
of social media,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.740
it's really hard to
fake an identity.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.350
And as I'm saying
these words, I'm

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.850
laughing to myself because I'm
like that's what Drucker did.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.559
That's why it's so fun to
live vicariously through him

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:14.100
because he lived in this time
when you could fake an identity

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.404
and just start over again.

00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:16.570
SEEMA VASHI: That's so cool.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.450
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Yeah, so we'll see.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.110
Right now, I'm keeping Lane
Everett, and I'm happy with it.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.380
And, in fact, we're
launching-- we're launching?

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.840
I'm launching the book
to the public November 15

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.590
with Lane Everett.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.090
If you pick up this
book now, you'll

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.300
see on the page it
says LE Everett inside.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.040
That makes it a
classic first edition

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.080
copy, because as
of November 15th,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.700
it'll actually say Lane Everett.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.320
I decided to go full
forward movement

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.180
with Lane Everett for now.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.560
SEEMA VASHI: And how did you
come up with Lane Everett?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.900
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I wish
I had a good story.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.316
That one, there
truly is no story.

00:10:44.316 --> 00:10:46.710
I just like it, and it has
LE like Lauren Epshteyn.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.132
SEEMA VASHI: Did you want Lane
to be like could be a man,

00:10:49.132 --> 00:10:49.840
could be a woman?

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.839
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes, I
wanted something unisex.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:55.170
And, again, to a T, the couple
of people who have said,

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.732
that is not unisex--
each one of them

00:10:56.732 --> 00:10:59.190
has a different version of what
Lane absolutely is to them.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.689
Some people said,
Lane's not unisex.

00:11:00.689 --> 00:11:02.330
That's just a man's name.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.740
Others have said, Lane-- I
know only know women Lanes.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.362
So I think that
makes it very unisex.

00:11:06.362 --> 00:11:07.070
SEEMA VASHI: Yes.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.450
And what does it mean to
be launching to the public?

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.325
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Aha!

00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:12.650
So you all received
notice of this book

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.980
while it was in the friends
and family marketing phase.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.112
And actually, the
beauty of that was

00:11:17.112 --> 00:11:18.570
that I caught a
few things I wanted

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.690
to change-- not plot
wise, not structurally,

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.780
just a couple of formatting
things that I wanted to change.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.900
And so, took it down
for three weeks.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.220
I'm launching to the public
November 15th with some AdWords

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.330
campaigns and some PR and
some more in-person events.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.870
SEEMA VASHI: Awesome,
that's great.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.952
Cool, so now I think
now would be-- I mean,

00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:41.910
people here know a little
bit of the background

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.210
of why you wrote the book.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.060
Why don't we hear from the book?

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.840
You want to read
a chapter from it?

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.756
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes, I
would love to do that.

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:50.699
So I'm going to read
you all Chapter 3,

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:52.240
because in this
chapter you're really

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.948
introduced to the main
character, Drucker

00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:55.660
May, and some of the
struggles that he's

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.227
going through with
his father, who

00:11:58.227 --> 00:11:59.810
is the president of
the bank and wants

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.226
Drucker to be president of the
bank, which Drucker doesn't

00:12:02.226 --> 00:12:03.060
want.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.580
Drucker's struggling
with his boredom at work.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.760
And this is the point where he
really comes to the realization

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.360
that if you're unhappy
with something,

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.730
it's not that hard to
just get up and leave,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.820
or to at least leave your
desk for a few minutes.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.480
And people always ask me, how
autobiographical is this book?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.900
And my answer is generally
that the autobiography

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.880
was very subtle.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.790
There was little tiny moments.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.400
He's going to get up from
his desk in this chapter.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.580
And that was inspired
by back in 2008,

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.050
back when I was questioning,
I was a year out of college

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.591
and wondering, oh,
my god, am I going

00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:38.400
to sit at a desk for the rest
of my life, all day every day?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.110
I would just take one lap
around 76th and 9th Avenue,

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.487
and that made a lot of
difference in the afternoon,

00:12:44.487 --> 00:12:46.070
just getting that
breath of fresh air.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.590
And so I tried to
instill little pieces

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.530
of those actions in Drucker.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.500
Anyway, so Chapter 3,
which I'm about to read,

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.958
I think it really introduces
what "A Northern Gentleman" is

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.397
really all about.

00:12:57.397 --> 00:12:58.980
Yes, it's historical
fiction, but it's

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.260
about figuring out what you
want to do with your life

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.870
and finding the
courage to do so.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.284
So let's go ahead.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.200
SEEMA VASHI: I need to
get the Kindle version.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.410
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I have
the Kindle version.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.125
Anyone already read
the Kindle version--

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.000
part of what was going
on with the re-release

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.920
is that Kindle formatted
it a little wrong.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.180
So you'll have noticed a
couple of strange typos

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.440
that Amazon inserted.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.720
But, no big deal; you should
have still gotten the idea.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.500
Chapter 3-- "Halfway
through the week

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.290
that he been given to think of
a way to save Atlanta Southern

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.180
National Bank from a
swift and ugly collapse,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.680
Drucker found
himself with nothing

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.190
to show for his efforts but
a page full of scribbles

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.910
and a pounding headache.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.580
In those moments when
he wasn't battling

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.000
the throbbing in his
temples, he did his best

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.705
not to yield to Hank's
menacing voice in his head.

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:46.830
"Frankly, I don't even see
why you bother pretending.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.890
That board meeting
makes no difference.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.490
Your father will convince them
to vote you in no matter what."

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.210
Every time Drucker
felt himself getting

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.610
close to coming up with some
sort of plan for the bank,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.400
those words would begin to ring
in his ears, distracting him.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.960
He heard them again as he
stood next to his desk,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.400
gazing out at the
sunny summer afternoon

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.700
on the other side of the
window, feeling guilty

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.670
that his efforts thus
far had been fruitless,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.280
but also wondering
if perhaps there

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.960
wasn't a part of him
that wanted to fail

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.860
at this task he had been given.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.980
After all, if he were to be
struck by a miraculous idea,

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.350
he could save face in
front of the board.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.440
But then what?

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.210
A good showing in that
meeting would only

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.310
add fuel to the fire of his
father's already heated desire

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.690
to install Drucker in his post.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.370
On the other hand,
if Drucker were

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.730
to show up at the board meeting
empty handed and unprepared,

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.200
he would certainly embarrass
both himself and his father.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.670
But might a mediocre performance
in front of the board actually

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.450
be to his advantage?

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.560
It would certainly
tarnish his image,

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.440
perhaps in just the right way.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.560
A disappointing show
at the board meeting

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.590
could heap a little extra
dirt on his already soiled

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.260
reputation, and it could be
just enough to prevent the board

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.170
from endorsing the president's
proposal of Drucker

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.000
as his successor.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.740
The thought intrigued him, but
Drucker couldn't bring himself

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.160
to give up entirely just yet.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.950
The family name was among
a small and dwindling list

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.370
of things that he and
his father shared.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.580
To sully his own name would
be to drag his father's down

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.000
in the dirt, too, and he
couldn't bring himself

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.880
to do that to his father.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.140
He couldn't deny
that a part of him

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.300
very much wanted to, though,
and the guilt of knowing it

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.620
gave Drucker a suffocating
itch in his lungs.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.760
He felt the desperate
need for fresh air,

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.530
and so, very quietly, to avoid
catching anyone's attention,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.980
he snuck out of the building.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.790
The July day was warm
and drier than usual,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.780
with a light breeze
that smelled alive

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.710
compared to the musty
air inside the bank.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.460
Drucker walked to
the base of the tree

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.280
that he had so often gazed
at through the window.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.470
He reached out and
touched the bark

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.060
and was surprised to find that
it was rough, that it was real.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.150
In his mind, the tree
had become a symbol

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.730
of all that was outside
the bank and therefore

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.230
off limits to him.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.650
He'd spent hours,
days even, staring out

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.390
the window at the tree, thinking
of how that thin pane of glass

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.110
made the tree seem so far away.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.260
Plucking a leaf from
a low hanging branch,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.010
Drucker considered
that it wasn't the fact

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.700
that the tree was real
that was so remarkable,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.690
but rather how easy
it had been to touch.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.930
All he had done was get up
from his desk, walk outside,

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.500
and there it was
waiting for him.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.210
Drucker lowered
himself to the ground,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.380
where he sat leaning
against the tree,

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.730
careful to shield himself
with its wide trunk

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.500
so that no one inside the
building could see him.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.860
It felt right to be outside
in the fresh air with his back

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.480
facing the bank.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.140
A lifetime, a life, could be
sucked away in that office,

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.269
and his would be if
he didn't walk away.

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:51.060
If he wasn't fired
after the board meeting,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.610
Drucker decided, he
would have to quit.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.820
But why stop there?

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.540
If you could leave
Atlanta Southern,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.860
he might as well leave
Atlanta altogether.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.416
He could go North,
perhaps to Boston.

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:04.270
He'd been 15 when
Lucy's mother had died.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.750
She'd moved back to Boston
to be with her sisters,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.589
and 15 was too old
for a governess,

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.930
his mother had
declared, and so Lucy

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.799
had been placed neither
in Drucker's home,

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.790
nor in his heart.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.470
For the first time
in quite a while,

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.349
Drucker felt a rush
of excitement course

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.609
through his veins.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.920
In Atlanta, everyone knew
him before they even met him.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.700
Whether he worked at Atlanta
Southern National Bank or not,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.359
he would be known
as his father's son.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.120
If he were to go
to Boston though,

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.040
there he could be anybody.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.000
He could be the son
of a banker as easily

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.950
as he could be the
son of a farmer,

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.850
if they had farmers in Boston.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.144
He'd have to check.

00:17:39.144 --> 00:17:40.560
Maybe he would say
that his father

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.090
had died on a whaling ship and
left Drucker and his mother

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.170
with nothing.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.420
Or maybe he would say that
he was a descendant of one

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.780
of those men who had
poured tea into the harbor

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.870
or signed the Constitution.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.770
Yes, Boston would be
the perfect place.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.820
He even had the
accent down perfectly

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.150
after years of spending
so much time with Lucy.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.380
As a child, he'd
taken special notice

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.720
of the way and words tripped
off her tongue a little faster,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.170
the way she hit
consonants a little harder

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.010
than the native-born
Southern ladies he knew.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.110
Often, during their
long afternoons

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.160
together, he would switch
into his Northern accent,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.380
changing the pace and
style of his speech

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.760
as if he were speaking
another language.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.120
At first, Lucy had laughed.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.880
But then she became like the
teacher she had once been,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.290
gently correcting him when
he lapsed for a moment.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.130
We say "get," not
"git," she'd say.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.710
Rhymes with "bet."

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.920
And Drucker would repeat
after her, quickly

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.340
picking up on the distinctly
Northern vernacular.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.520
The happy yelps of children
chasing one another

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.150
down Peachtree Street
snapped Drucker back

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.600
to the present moment.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.750
Two hours must have
passed, he thought,

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.570
as he pushed off the ground
and rose to his feet.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.720
He walked back toward the bank,
which looked different somehow

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.520
now that he was taking it in
with the eyes of a man who knew

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.590
he would soon be leaving it.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.790
As he paced slowly down the
hallway back to his office,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.310
he felt the sturdy clap of
the hand on his shoulder.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:07.210
Drucker turned to see his father
with Hank trailing behind him

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.842
like a faithful Labrador.

00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:11.145
"There you are," said
the bank's president.

00:19:11.145 --> 00:19:14.266
"I've been looking for you, but
you weren't in your office."

00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:17.070
"I stepped outside,"
said Drucker.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.930
"Oh?

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.740
asked the president, a bit
surprised, "and what were you

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.390
doing out there?" "I was
just doing some thinking,"

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.040
answered Drucker,
not untruthfully.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.100
The president brightened.
"That's my boy," he beamed.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.910
"My best business ideas always
congeal when I'm taking a walk.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.172
So you've come up
with a plan, then?"

00:19:36.172 --> 00:19:38.750
"Well, there are still
some details to attend to,"

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.610
said Drucker, thinking of
his recently hatched plan

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.360
to leave Atlanta. "Well, by all
means, attend to the details,"

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.230
roared the president
with excitement.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.940
He took a step
closer to Drucker,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.510
his nose twitching as he
examined his son's face.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.850
"By God, you're close, Drucker.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.990
I can sense it.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.360
I can always smell a good
idea, and--" he turned his head

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.650
and sniffed the air.
"It sure does smell

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.360
like you've got
something juicy cooking."

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.020
Drucker smiled meekly.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.860
"I do you think may
be on to something,"

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.910
he said-- again,
not untruthfully.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.550
The president, smiling heartily,
patted Drucker on the back.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.590
"You remind me of
myself, Drucker,"

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.630
he said happily,
eyeing Drucker's well

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.470
kept blond hair and manly jaw.
"Though more handsome than I

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.520
ever was, I must admit."

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.210
He cleared his throat and
averted his eyes from his son's

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.580
charming dimples. "At any
rate, if any one can get us out

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.890
of this, you can, Drucker."

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.370
Drucker tried to protest,
but the president was already

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.460
waddling proudly down the
hall, forgetting about Hank,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.170
who hung back with Drucker.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.190
"So what were you
really doing out there?"

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.490
asked Hank, nudging
Drucker in the ribs

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.830
as soon as the president
was out of earshot.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.790
"Thinking," repeated
Drucker earnestly.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.560
"About?"

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.122
Hank sneered.

00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:56.820
"Trees," said Drucker,
"I was thinking

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.710
about what happens to them
when they die." "Fascinating,"

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.680
scoffed Hank.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.680
"Not exactly the
stuff plans to save

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.320
a bank are made of though."

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.900
He raised his right eyebrow
high with skepticism.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.470
"Come to any groundbreaking
conclusions?"

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.275
"Yes," said Drucker,
"they become desks.""

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:20.944
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:22.439 --> 00:21:23.980
SEEMA VASHI: Thanks
for reading that.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.563
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Of
course, thank you.

00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:27.860
SEEMA VASHI: I have a
couple extra question.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.807
How many times have
you read the book?

00:21:30.807 --> 00:21:32.640
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: OK,
so in the editing phase

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.380
I probably the whole
thing four or five times.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.040
And since then,
probably three or so.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.519
SEEMA VASHI: And do you have
off like a favorite chapter?

00:21:42.519 --> 00:21:43.810
Was that one of your favorites?

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.726
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: That
was one of my favorites,

00:21:45.726 --> 00:21:49.080
in part because we start to see
evidence of one trait that's

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.510
true to Drucker that makes
the rest of the book so fun,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.750
and it's stated outright
in another chapter.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.680
Drucker refuses to
lie at any point,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.610
and that's part of what
makes it so fun to see

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.740
him change his identity over and
over again, because he does it

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.660
all without ever
telling a boldfaced lie,

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.010
at least on purpose, yes.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.190
SEEMA VASHI: So now let's get
two Googlers up here who've

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.570
read the book,
and we can kind of

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.715
facilitate a nice discussion,
a little mini book club.

00:22:13.715 --> 00:22:18.565
So that's Lindsay
Siano and Ariel Garber.

00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:19.815
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: There you go.

00:22:19.815 --> 00:22:20.481
Thank you, guys.

00:22:20.481 --> 00:22:24.040
Come on up here.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.456
SEEMA VASHI: So if you guys
want to quickly introduce

00:22:26.456 --> 00:22:27.831
yourselves, maybe
the team you're

00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:30.524
on, how much you love
Lauren's new book.

00:22:30.524 --> 00:22:32.190
LINDSAY SIANO: How
much time do we have?

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.010
I'm Lindsay Siano.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.820
I've worked with Lauren
since she started.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.195
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
A long time ago.

00:22:39.195 --> 00:22:40.310
LINDSAY SIANO: Yeah, we both
started around the same time

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.190
a long time ago.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.020
And now I'm an account
manager on the publishing

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.230
pod over in LCS.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.350
So I've been working with
a lot of different book

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.840
publishers and
different imprints,

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.760
and I'm an avid reader.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.010
And I was so excited
for Lauren that she

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.537
achieved this amazing goal.

00:22:55.537 --> 00:22:56.870
And I was so excited to read it.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.245
And I hope all of you read it
because it's a great story.

00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:01.480
ARIEL GARBER: And
I'm Ariel Garber.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.560
I've known Lauren for
about three years.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.404
Lauren is a huge
inspiration for me.

00:23:06.404 --> 00:23:07.820
I followed her to
business school.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.090
I followed her on the team.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.210
She's amazing.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.060
And for me, this
book was so exciting

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.268
because you read the book,
and you see Lauren's ideas

00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:16.749
flowing through it, and it's
such a great journey, so super

00:23:16.749 --> 00:23:17.565
excited to be here.

00:23:17.565 --> 00:23:18.690
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Thank you.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.500
SEEMA VASHI: Thanks to
both of you for joining.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.780
And just to kind of
kick off a discussion,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.100
you guys recently
finished the book.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.050
And before we get
inside the book,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.190
let's talk about the
cover for a second.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.650
So for those of you can
see a book in front of you,

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.090
there's kind of like a circular
frame, and you see this man.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.960
But you don't actually
see Drucker's face.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.070
We're assuming that is Drucker.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.620
So what did you
two think of that?

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.630
Did it bother you?

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.370
Did it make sense later
as to why that happened?

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.150
Let's start with Lindsay.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.370
LINDSAY SIANO: Sure,
so it didn't bother me.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.315
I'm pretty imaginative
when I read books.

00:23:53.315 --> 00:23:54.690
I like to think
of the character.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.354
And you gave some description,
but I also liked the sense

00:23:57.354 --> 00:23:59.270
that you don't really
know what he looks like,

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.840
and he keeps
reinventing himself,

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.990
so I thought it was
like a nice touch

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.450
that you don't really
know what he looks like.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.950
ARIEL GARBER: Yeah,
I agree, and you

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.366
see the character really evolve
throughout the whole book.

00:24:09.366 --> 00:24:12.100
So you get the sense that he's
very much a different sort

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.490
of looking person, both
physically and also emotionally

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.420
who he is and what he
stands for, by the end.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.580
So it's fun to kind of not
have all those details.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.020
You can really reinvent
your perception of him

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.030
as the book evolves.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.613
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I
don't know even now

00:24:23.613 --> 00:24:26.290
if I have a really clear
vision of his face.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.310
I certainly know
those traits about him

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.310
that I mentioned that
were even in this chapter.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.040
But that's just not part of
it for me is exactly what

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.710
his face looks like.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.070
SEEMA VASHI: And it's not as
important either, I guess.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.278
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yeah, I
think the reinvention aspect

00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:41.520
and that keeps changing
his identity is much more

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.930
integral to the story.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.679
SEEMA VASHI: Absolutely,
so another big-- oh,

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:46.470
there's a question.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.507
Should we take some now?

00:24:47.507 --> 00:24:48.340
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.669
Somebody pinged me that
they're on the hangout.

00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:52.210
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
There is no hangout.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.290
AUDIENCE: They're not on there?

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.873
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
There is no hang out.

00:24:54.873 --> 00:24:57.795
Sorry, that may have
accidentally been a--

00:24:57.795 --> 00:24:59.420
SEEMA VASHI: We're
recording it though.

00:25:01.214 --> 00:25:02.630
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Authors at Google

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.250
does not allow VC
hangout or live stream,

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.030
so we are pushing it to the
YouTube channel instead.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.787
AUDIENCE: Got it, thanks.

00:25:10.787 --> 00:25:12.870
LINDSAY SIANO: Actually,
the one thing I would say

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.354
is it's interesting when
you read the book, the women

00:25:15.354 --> 00:25:16.770
characters, the
female characters,

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.866
are described a lot, and the
male characters aren't as much.

00:25:20.866 --> 00:25:22.240
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Oh, that's true.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.520
No, that's a good point.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.880
That's actually--
the female characters

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.590
was a pretty big part
of this book for me.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.950
To me, things come in threes.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.315
He has three stops,
but for his place

00:25:33.315 --> 00:25:35.310
that he leaves and the
place that he ends up.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.900
And in each of these stops there
is a different type of woman.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.160
Although, technically,
that would make it four,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.050
because there's two
in the first stop.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.297
But I didn't want them to be
quote unquote, "stereotypes,"

00:25:44.297 --> 00:25:45.880
but I wanted them
to be representative

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.770
of certain types of women.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.830
Without giving
anything too much away,

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.840
the type of woman
who you just see

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.590
as a friend, the type of
woman who you really just have

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.570
a physical relationship
with, the type of woman who's

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.420
all those things, the type of
woman who maybe doesn't even

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.980
seem like a woman,
who is practically

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.740
not a woman in some
ways, you'll have

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.767
to read on to figure out some of
her traits and characteristics.

00:26:12.767 --> 00:26:14.350
But, yeah, that was
definitely-- and I

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.982
agree that there was
in some ways a lot

00:26:15.982 --> 00:26:17.690
more description of
the other characters'

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.540
physical description
than of Drucker.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.140
SEEMA VASHI: So another big
part of "The Northern Gentlemen"

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.540
that's in the title,
the sense of geography.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.160
There's this sense that you
know where it potentially

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.880
is coming from or going.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.810
But the description of Drucker
being this Northern gentleman--

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.620
he's from actually the South.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.070
There's tension between
the East and West.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.020
He's traveling.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.660
He's supposed to be
kind of traveling west,

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.780
but he means to go north.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.520
So what role did
geography play for you

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.527
two as readers as you were
reading through the book?

00:26:53.527 --> 00:26:55.360
LINDSAY SIANO: I thought
it was interesting.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.825
I think you really
captured a sense of this--

00:26:58.825 --> 00:27:00.950
he goes to these small
towns, where a lot of people

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.220
have never left,
and he's like kind

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.420
of this-- they're all a
little suspicious of him

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.572
because he's a traveller.

00:27:06.572 --> 00:27:08.350
And I thought that
that was really great,

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.130
because it's true.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.921
It's like, now we all
travel all the time.

00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:11.920
We don't think about it.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.660
But I really did feel
like the train was almost

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.146
like a character
in the book, and I

00:27:18.146 --> 00:27:19.520
don't want to say
his accomplice,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.650
because he wasn't going
the right direction.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.660
But it was interesting to me.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.180
I don't know if I'm
answering your question.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.840
I think it was funny he clung
to the Northern gentleman,

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.140
even though he went
other places and never--

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.101
he never changed that.

00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:44.225
ARIEL GARBER: It's funny--
since it's in the 1890s,

00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:47.464
you kind of forget how travel
was big deal back then,

00:27:47.464 --> 00:27:49.130
and for him, he's
really this innovator.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.796
So as he goes to these
different cities,

00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:52.610
it's the first time
anyone's met someone

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.802
who's kind of traveled
the landscape like he has,

00:27:54.802 --> 00:27:56.260
and he has this
wealth of knowledge

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.649
that he carries to every city.

00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:59.440
Which makes it really
exciting as a reader,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.940
because we're learning about
these cities for the first time

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.093
in the context of 1890.

00:28:03.093 --> 00:28:04.676
But he carries a
piece of these cities

00:28:04.676 --> 00:28:05.884
throughout the whole journey.

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:08.425
So you really get
kind of a sense

00:28:08.425 --> 00:28:11.785
of what the 1890s felt like
from an American West expansion

00:28:11.785 --> 00:28:12.690
perspective.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.773
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I love
those two interpretations.

00:28:14.773 --> 00:28:18.280
I would just add to it that
to me this westward moving

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.370
was such a big part
of American history.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.420
And I originally, in the first
weeks of having this idea,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.650
I wanted his arrival in
the West, so to speak,

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.460
to coincide with the
closing of the frontier,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.231
when they made this announcement
that there was no more America

00:28:32.231 --> 00:28:32.730
to discover.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.220
They had made it as
far west as possible.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.070
So I thought that
that was interesting.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.140
And there are a few parts
sort of tongue-in-cheek

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.410
at points where the phrase
"The Northern Gentleman"

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.620
comes up over and over again.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.440
At one point, someone
actually says to him,

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.510
you really are a true Northern
gentleman, and he's not.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.690
He's not a Northerner, and
sometimes he's not a gentleman.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.159
So the fact that this
person who knew him so well

00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:57.700
would make that
statement, I thought,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.900
was pretty indicative of-- yes?

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.520
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.848
They're both talking about
learning about these cities

00:29:06.848 --> 00:29:08.210
in the 1890s.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.870
How did you learn about cities?

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.942
Every time I watch a movie or
read something of a period,

00:29:12.942 --> 00:29:14.400
I'm like, how do
these people know?

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.900
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes, OK, so
I give all thanks to Google

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.450
the search engine for making
so many details available.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.190
I would Google things-- this
isn't so much about the city--

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.940
but as small as what did
coffee smell like in 1890?

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.904
And get multiple blog hits
answering that question.

00:29:33.904 --> 00:29:35.320
Turns out it was
nutty, and it was

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.390
something called Arbuckles
was the famous coffee in Texas

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.650
in the 1890s.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.480
So, yeah, there was
a lot of googling

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.360
that went on all the time.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.667
But in the first stop--
so Atlanta was real,

00:29:47.667 --> 00:29:50.250
and there were some real details
about Atlanta's Union Station

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.360
that were easily discoverable.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.320
I read a couple of
books, especially

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.650
about a real
character from Texas

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.420
who makes it into the book.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.170
Actually, I read maybe
three or four books

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.460
about different characters
that played into it.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.629
But a lot of, yeah, just
like real time googling

00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:07.670
that I don't know how
historical fiction could've

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.507
been written 15, 20
years ago before Google.

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:11.840
You would have had to hole
up in the Library of Congress

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.380
with your research
team and fact checkers.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.305
But it's different.

00:30:15.305 --> 00:30:15.760
AUDIENCE: That's
probably what happened.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.718
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Right.

00:30:16.718 --> 00:30:18.500
SEEMA VASHI: Or it
just wasn't accurate.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.580
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Right.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.660
Yes?

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.615
AUDIENCE: So this
is very timely,

00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:24.948
because my eight-year-old son
is studying the expedition

00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:27.180
of Lewis and Clark.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.160
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Ah, yes.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.535
We'll have to get him the
censored version of "A Northern

00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:32.035
Gentleman."

00:30:32.035 --> 00:30:32.960
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.585
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Select scenes cut out.

00:30:35.514 --> 00:30:36.930
AUDIENCE: But
actually my question

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.370
has nothing to do with that.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:42.060
My question is more about you
from a personal perspective.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.675
I'm very interested in, as a
mom, the power of possibility

00:30:46.675 --> 00:30:49.350
and teaching my kids that
they can do anything.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.307
So I'm curious to
know, at 10 years old,

00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:53.140
knowing that you wanted
to write a "New York

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.848
Times" bestseller,
how much influence was

00:30:54.848 --> 00:30:56.800
that from your parents.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.175
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Oh, I love that,

00:30:58.175 --> 00:30:59.633
and they're going
to love this when

00:30:59.633 --> 00:31:02.176
they watch it on YouTube once
I tell them what YouTube is.

00:31:02.176 --> 00:31:03.980
My mom was huge in that.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.575
She used to type out
my stories for me

00:31:05.575 --> 00:31:07.450
when I was 10 years old,
before I could type.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.190
Yeah, I have very
distinct memories

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.320
of sitting next to a computer
with her before I could type,

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.200
and dictating out loud, and
she would type them out.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.600
So that was big.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.160
And then there's a callout
in the acknowledgements

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.220
at the end where I call
out to both my parents.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.220
In the end, I really don't
want to ruin anything

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.070
for anyone who hasn't read
it, but there's this concept

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:31.375
that his father has
collected things for him

00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:32.620
in case he ever misses home.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.120
And my dad did that
similarly for me.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.714
I have not been
living in Minneapolis

00:31:36.714 --> 00:31:38.130
since I was 18
years old, and I've

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.290
gotten a lot of mailings,
like physical envelopes

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.540
in the mail with pictures
and things from home.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.902
So there's a lot of
support in that way, too.

00:31:46.902 --> 00:31:47.860
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.760
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Thanks for asking that.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.920
SEEMA VASHI: So moving from the
geography, let's move to names.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.785
So we all know just
from this discussion

00:31:57.785 --> 00:32:01.454
that Drucker is the main
character of the book.

00:32:01.454 --> 00:32:03.120
Were there any names
as you were reading

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.540
that you found particularly
noteworthy-- Drucker,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.439
in particular?

00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:08.480
We can maybe start there.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.787
Any things that come to mind?

00:32:11.787 --> 00:32:14.370
ARIEL GARBER: So you've really
got a sense that every name was

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.680
specific to the city.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.259
He's traveling
westward, and it felt

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:20.800
like it was part of the fabric
of the community, these names,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.830
which was, again,
really fun to listen to.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.425
But for me, I felt
like I was maybe

00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:26.050
supposed to know who
these people were,

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.190
so I was constantly googling,
like, is this a real person?

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.689
And half the time they were,
and half the time they weren't.

00:32:30.689 --> 00:32:32.730
So for me, it was
really kind of weaving

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.879
in what was actually
true and not, which was

00:32:34.879 --> 00:32:36.170
a fun part of reading the book.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.420
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: On
that note, I will just

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.000
say there's one name that
sometimes people say, OK,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.840
an overweight guy named Hogg.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.090
Come on, that's a
little on the nose.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.840
Truer than fiction, you can't
create some of these things.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.070
A real governor from the state
of Texas was a very overweight

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.642
man, whose name is
Jim Hogg-- H-O-G-G.

00:32:52.642 --> 00:32:54.850
And that's one of the people
who I read a book about.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:57.640
So that was not a made-up name.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.550
Three characters who
are real from the book--

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.750
Jim Hogg, who became
governor of Texas in 1890

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.390
and was attorney
general before that.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.160
And technically his
campaign manager

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.750
Horace, who goes
by first name only,

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.720
so I guess that makes it four.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.880
Jay Gould, who's a pretty
nefarious character

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.280
from American business
history, and a guy

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.710
named William A. Clark, who I
had read a book about, somewhat

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.450
randomly, who was a senator from
Montana who owned big copper

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.825
mines, and was a
long-time senator-- I

00:33:25.825 --> 00:33:27.450
mentioned that-- and
had a daughter who

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.639
lived to 105 in New York.

00:33:29.639 --> 00:33:31.930
And that was the one the book
was about-- his daughter.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.547
Anyway, names, any names that--

00:33:34.547 --> 00:33:36.130
LINDSAY SIANO: Well,
I thought Drucker

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.850
was such a Southern name,
because it felt like sometimes

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.900
in the South they named their
children after the mother's

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.220
maiden name as the first name.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.530
So I was thinking
that really fit.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.701
And just like Ariel was saying,
it really felt like every place

00:33:50.701 --> 00:33:52.950
that he went to, there were
sort of distinctive names.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.030
So I thought it
was really clever.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.000
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Yeah, thank you.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.710
I like that.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.310
One note about
Drucker May itself,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.400
if you are curious
about the name,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.820
Drucker I got the idea
for-- Peter Drucker

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.840
is this sort of well known
celebrated father of management

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.263
organization, for anyone
who's in business classes.

00:34:09.263 --> 00:34:11.429
And I like the name for
exactly the reason you said.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.160
It sounded like a
Southern name that

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.639
could have been passed down.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.090
And May, the month of
May, spring, optimism,

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.020
anything "may" do anything
he sets his mind to,

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.332
that was sort of
the inspirations.

00:34:24.332 --> 00:34:25.290
SEEMA VASHI: I love it.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.468
I'm from Texas, so
I know who Hogg is.

00:34:27.468 --> 00:34:28.634
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Oh, really?

00:34:28.634 --> 00:34:29.699
Oh, my, OK.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.072
SEEMA VASHI: Yeah, very
infamously overweight,

00:34:32.072 --> 00:34:33.780
and we made fun of
that his last name was

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.446
Hogg when we were learning about
Texas history in seventh grade.

00:34:36.446 --> 00:34:39.489
So I love that he
made it into the book.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:40.030
That's great.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.630
I think one last
question for you guys.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.022
Did you root for Drucker?

00:34:46.022 --> 00:34:48.139
Was he this rooted
for protagonist

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.590
that you kind of kept
throughout the book,

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.820
or did that change at all?

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.389
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Did he save the cat?

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.270
SEEMA VASHI: Yeah,
did he save the cat?

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.390
LINDSAY SIANO: I definitely
was rooting for him.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:01.520
I think, at first,
I was curious as

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.100
to sort of how he would--
someone who'd lived in one

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.500
place their whole
life, how is he

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.460
going to grasp moving to a
new place or finding a job

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.172
or whatever he wanted to do?

00:35:12.172 --> 00:35:14.380
I think I was rooting for
him more when things didn't

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.170
go the way he had planned,
because I was sort of like,

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.670
oh, you can figure it out.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.121
You can do it.

00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:21.710
So I don't know how
he saved the cat,

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:26.840
but he totally did
it for me, yeah.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.940
ARIEL GARBER: Yeah, I mean,
I think when you first

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.570
start the book, it's
all about self discovery

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.850
and finding yourself, and
you want him, as a reader,

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.824
to find himself
and find himself.

00:35:34.824 --> 00:35:36.740
There are things in the
book you watch him do,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.550
and you want to stop
him from doing it.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.258
You get a little angry
that he's doing it

00:35:40.258 --> 00:35:43.897
because you know he has
a better moral character.

00:35:43.897 --> 00:35:45.730
So there are instances
that are frustrating,

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.790
but I think net-net
you really feel

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.352
like you want him to ultimately
find what he's looking for.

00:35:50.352 --> 00:35:52.060
Pros and cons of
knowing the author, when

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.590
you get to things, it's like,
why did you make him do that?

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:59.160
LINDSAY SIANO: I think also
what was realistic about it.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.515
We all make huge mistakes.

00:36:00.515 --> 00:36:02.890
Sometimes we can come back
from them, sometimes we can't.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.270
So I thought that that
was great because it

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.877
wasn't like a seamless
kind of journey.

00:36:07.877 --> 00:36:10.460
SEEMA VASHI: Yeah, like overly
romantic or anything like that.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.420
LINDSAY SIANO: No, it was good.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.580
SEEMA VASHI: And
why did you choose

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.355
to make Drucker a male
protagonist in this story?

00:36:18.355 --> 00:36:19.980
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Totally fair question.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.600
I didn't see a way
that a female character

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.770
could have gone on this
particular journey in 1890.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.610
There would have been more
requirements about having

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:32.390
a chaperone, or questions
about why a single woman was

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.750
showing up new in town.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.500
So I always envisioned
Drucker as a male character.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.080
But that's-- I think I
mentioned this earlier with

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.080
the exploration of women--
this is definitely a book that

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.400
explores gender
in different ways.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.777
So that absolutely was on my
mind just in terms of a theme.

00:36:50.777 --> 00:36:53.360
SEEMA VASHI: No, that's great,
especially at that time period.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.470
There's probably a lot.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.595
Did you research that, too?

00:36:55.595 --> 00:36:57.970
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yeah, I read
a lot of historical fiction

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.480
that took place in
that time period.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.650
And then that paired
with frequent googling

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.192
of different specific
questions was really useful.

00:37:05.192 --> 00:37:07.650
There are also things that I
found through Google searches,

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.790
like train travel maps from
1890s and the progress.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.310
I just got a question last
week, could someone actually

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.270
have made that journey?

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.970
Did the train routes exist?

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.720
And I'm happy to share the link.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.120
I have a train route from 1890
that shows pretty much yes.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.230
So the second stop he makes in
Arkansas is a fictional town.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.832
So let's assume it's like in
the perfect place, then yes.

00:37:27.832 --> 00:37:29.540
And then he could have
gone on to Austin.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.460
And then for anyone
who's wondering,

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.359
was there a direct
train route from Texas

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:36.400
to where he goes to next?

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.500
I don't want to give
it away too much.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.860
Perhaps not
directly, but yet, we

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.347
don't say that he gets
off the train specifically

00:37:43.347 --> 00:37:43.930
where he does.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.870
So there's a little bit of
room for making up how he

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:49.656
got from one place to another.

00:37:49.656 --> 00:37:50.530
SEEMA VASHI: Love it.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.280
That's awesome.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.280
I'm sure in Kindle it's
fun, too, to actually

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.510
look these things up.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.240
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes, the
Kindle version's re-release

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.570
will be much more
fun than it is now.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.850
Actually, it's one of my
things I wanted to mention,

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.600
if the question about
publishing comes up,

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.216
is there's always going to be
quirks and kinks to work out,

00:38:08.216 --> 00:38:10.590
but hopefully, the Kindle
version will be back and better

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.554
than after in about two weeks.

00:38:12.554 --> 00:38:14.220
SEEMA VASHI: So those
were the questions

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.660
I had for the discussion.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.140
And I wanted to pause here,
and we can definitely still

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.260
take Q&amp;A with everyone up here.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.140
Does anyone have any
questions in mind?

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.192
Yes?

00:38:26.192 --> 00:38:28.025
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:28.025 --> 00:38:28.470
It's incredible.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.730
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Thanks, well,
I was in the building today

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.230
anyway.

00:38:33.957 --> 00:38:36.290
AUDIENCE: But you just mentioned
the publishing process.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.165
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes.

00:38:37.165 --> 00:38:39.410
AUDIENCE: It is something
that I am curious about.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.962
What was that process like for
you for this particular book?

00:38:41.962 --> 00:38:44.420
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes, what was
the publishing process like?

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.100
All right, so there's
a couple of things

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.830
I can say about the
publishing process.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.189
I've learned a lot about it
through going through it,

00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:52.230
but also asking everyone
I know, what do you know

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.940
about the publishing process?

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.440
And so if anyone is interested
in publishing their own book,

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.160
I can tell you the typical
traditional publishing

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.270
route, as it used
to be especially,

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.480
and can still be today, is
it starts with query letters

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.060
to agents.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.930
You write maybe 30 to 40
to 50 and get rejected

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.820
that amount of times minus one.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.530
And then that agent says
that they will represent you,

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.030
and then they query all the
publishing houses, and they get

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.439
rejected all but one time.

00:39:17.439 --> 00:39:19.230
And those are the two
parties that you then

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.070
need to split all of the
royalties with later on.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.155
Those parties can change
anything about your book

00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:24.780
that they want.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.863
They can change the title.

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.072
They can create the cover.

00:39:27.072 --> 00:39:28.530
They can tell you
to cut out parts.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:29.980
Actually, I know
Dave can probably

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.860
speak to this in some ways.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.860
I don't want to
sound too negative.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.318
But from what I've
understood, they

00:39:33.318 --> 00:39:36.940
can tell you what to change
about your book, right?

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.310
Dave's nodding quietly,
for the record.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:42.510
What's that?

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.035
AUDIENCE: It depends
on your contract.

00:39:43.035 --> 00:39:44.460
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: It
depends on the contract.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.680
AUDIENCE: It depends on how
hard you fight about it.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.610
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Exactly, exactly.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.780
I chose a different
route because I

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.170
wanted complete creative control
over the title, the cover,

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.290
and this particular story.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.759
In the future, I may be
totally willing to do

00:39:56.759 --> 00:39:57.550
a different option.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.630
But for this particular story,
it had been in the works

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.270
for so long.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.210
I was impatient to hold it.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.020
I self published through
my own publishing company,

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.290
which any of you can do.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:09.760
It takes about $100 to set up
your own publishing company.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.070
And then I published
this one through an arm

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.280
called CreateSpace,
an arm of Amazon.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.970
In the past, I had published a
nonfiction book through Barnes

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.750
and Noble's equivalent
self publishing arm

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.500
called iUniverse.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.310
And that process allows the
author complete control over

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.387
the creative decisions,
like cover, title, and text,

00:40:29.387 --> 00:40:30.970
but also over the
marketing decisions,

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.130
which sometimes happens
with real publishers,

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.645
sometimes doesn't.

00:40:34.645 --> 00:40:37.020
But that means that all the
marketing decisions from here

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.314
on out are going to be my
own and those of the people

00:40:40.314 --> 00:40:41.605
who I choose to bring in on it.

00:40:45.528 --> 00:40:46.460
Yes, Annette?

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.780
AUDIENCE: So how much time
is the publicity portion

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.419
and the publishing portion?

00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:54.460
I'm just thinking [INAUDIBLE]
I can write a book,

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.860
and then it's like this whole
business on the other side

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.360
that--

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.840
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Yes, I just read

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.440
in a book about how to market
your book, which I just bought,

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.680
that when you finish the
book and it's published,

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.930
you're 50% of the way through.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.450
Then you have a whole other half
of the process to market it.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.825
I have a Google
Doc going with all

00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:13.670
of the different ideas
people have given me,

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:14.670
and there's quite a few.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.500
It could take a long time
to do it all by myself.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.010
But you can also hire people,
outsource the work a little.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.002
But some of the
things that people

00:41:23.002 --> 00:41:27.160
told me are most important
are social media,

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.950
people have told me, are
incredibly important.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.030
My first move in this
friends and family phase

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:35.140
was to just write a personal
email to just about everyone

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.750
I knew.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.880
Knocked off about 100
with this Google invite.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.890
But other than that, I wrote 350
personal emails asking people

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.490
hey, what's going on with you?

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.410
I just wrote a book.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.060
SEEMA VASHI: Yes, Henry?

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.144
AUDIENCE: So from finishing
a first draft, what

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:55.310
was the timeline from there?

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.110
How many drafts?

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.190
How long did it
take to get to this?

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.398
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Interesting.

00:41:59.398 --> 00:42:01.540
OK, so my process of
writing, personally,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:07.660
is I edit constantly and
frequently as I'm writing.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.910
So there was never
a time where I just

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.450
had one full draft unedited.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.810
I had gone back and
really done so much of it

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.200
as I was going
chapter by chapter.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.020
But I finished a first
draft, so to speak,

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.340
in February of this year.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.470
And then I sent it off
to a professional editor,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.260
who I note in the
acknowledgements.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.580
I thought I had it
in pretty good shape.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.913
I'd read through it a few times.

00:42:29.913 --> 00:42:32.460
She caught over 4,000
little typos or changes

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.590
that she wanted make.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:37.830
She missed about seven,
but that's another story.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:42.280
And that took about-- she sent
those back to me mid-June.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.470
I did another full read through
and made a couple more changes,

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.540
and then sent it off
to the publisher,

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.030
the final publication,
in the beginning of July.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.640
So it really wasn't that long.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.680
But then again, I had
spent years, at least

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.290
the last two,
solidly both writing,

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.347
but really editing as I went.

00:42:59.347 --> 00:43:00.720
Yeah, good question.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.460
SEEMA VASHI: When did you know
it was time to stop editing?

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.293
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:43:05.293 --> 00:43:08.160
The story felt finished to me
in terms of creating the plot.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.880
And then I liked
the way it read,

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.439
and it felt like the story
I had set out to create.

00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:14.230
And that's probably
the most rewarding part

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.690
of this whole project is
what I can hold in my hand

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.680
now or read on Kindle now is
the story that I had envisioned,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.930
with far fewer details
in the beginning,

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:25.467
but that I had originally
set out to write.

00:43:25.467 --> 00:43:26.550
SEEMA VASHI: That's great.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.800
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Did you
have a question, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.841
AUDIENCE: Yes, first of all,
I'm totally floored by the fact

00:43:31.841 --> 00:43:32.590
that you did this.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.381
And then reading made
me even more excited.

00:43:34.381 --> 00:43:35.940
So thanks for sharing.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.330
I was wondering, in terms of
your tone and your writing

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.170
style, you made it sound
like it was so easy.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.170
It just flowed right out of you.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:48.080
I was wondering, did you kind
of perfect your writing style

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.597
as you were wrapping
up the book,

00:43:49.597 --> 00:43:51.430
or was it like that
from the very beginning?

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.030
If you write your
stories, will it

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.377
sort of have this similar feel?

00:43:54.377 --> 00:43:55.960
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I
love that question.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.793
My writing developed
so much over the years.

00:43:57.793 --> 00:44:00.950
I mentioned it was just under
seven years from the time

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.860
when it was published
from the time when I first

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.780
started writing.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.020
And it was funny going back
and rereading the things

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.920
I had written years ago.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.612
My writing style
had changed a lot.

00:44:10.612 --> 00:44:12.070
And when I'm talking
about editing,

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.790
most of what I was doing was
changing sentences, where never

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.820
use 10 words, when 5 will do.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.420
And when I started
writing, younger writer,

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.310
relatively close to being
just out of college,

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.440
I was much more florid
with the language

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.040
and used way too many words.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.304
And so I cut down a lot.

00:44:29.304 --> 00:44:30.970
That was the biggest
part of the editing

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.570
and the change in
my perspective.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.207
And I had read a lot more books
that influenced my writing

00:44:35.207 --> 00:44:36.040
style by that point.

00:44:36.687 --> 00:44:38.270
LINDSAY SIANO: The
writing is so good.

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.030
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Thank you.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.040
LINDSAY SIANO: Yeah,
that was actually

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.289
one thing I was so impressed
by was just the way

00:44:42.289 --> 00:44:43.080
that Lauren writes.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.204
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Thank you.

00:44:44.204 --> 00:44:47.060
I will say I am writing a second
completely unrelated book.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.130
Drucker is not in it.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:50.040
It's not historical
in the same way.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.626
It takes place in the second
half of the 20th century.

00:44:52.626 --> 00:44:54.000
I think the
writing-- personally,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.300
I think the writing style's
very different in there.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.830
I don't know why.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.840
This writing style felt very
authentic to this story,

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.240
and not as much to
a different one.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:04.800
Dave?

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.520
AUDIENCE: How did
you relentlessly

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.742
carve out the time for
the past seven years?

00:45:09.742 --> 00:45:10.795
Jobs are changing.

00:45:10.795 --> 00:45:12.170
Personal situations
are changing.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:16.409
Did you create this objective
requirement for yourself;

00:45:16.409 --> 00:45:18.950
you have to get a certain amount
done per week and per month?

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:19.880
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
I really didn't.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.296
At times, I had the challenge,
which you and I have talked

00:45:22.296 --> 00:45:23.740
about, with 100 words a day.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.110
At times, I stuck to that.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:25.960
And at other times.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.670
I truly didn't.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.520
And times I would have a weekend
trip with a big chunk of time

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.410
during travel, I could
bang out a few hours.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.660
And then I wouldn't have
time again for several weeks.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.960
It was sporadic.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.600
But I would say
there was two years,

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.824
from spring 2013 to
spring 2015, when,

00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:45.240
even if it wasn't my first
priority-- work was a priority.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.550
Family was a priority.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.030
Those two things came first.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.582
But after that, I made
general timelines for myself

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:53.040
that I would want
to finish a given

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.180
section of the five sections
in a certain amount of months.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.170
And then it was up
to me to figure out

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.290
how in that time period I was
going to allocate the time.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.120
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:03.840
AUDIENCE: Congratulations.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.090
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Thank you.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:08.040
AUDIENCE: And I'm going
to bring up the pen name.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.580
Looking at the graphic and
the image of the cover,

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:16.140
I perceive a parallel between
his anonymous anonymity

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.460
and your pen name.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.530
Is that intentional?

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.310
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
I love that idea.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:23.370
It really wasn't, but
that's a great idea.

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:23.870
I mean.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.770
I [INAUDIBLE] what
you're saying.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.170
SEEMA VASHI: You can use
that in a future interview.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.289
AUDIENCE: Did you identify
with his changing identities?

00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:32.830
I just feel like,
I don't know, maybe

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.320
even with this liberty with
the pen name with writing?

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.520
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I
absolutely love that.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.936
You know what I'll
say in response

00:46:37.936 --> 00:46:39.720
to that is that
wasn't, at least,

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.170
in the forefront of
my mind at the time.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:46.170
This concept of is it ever
too late to change your life?

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.000
That was on the
forefront of my mind.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.830
And if you're unhappy
with your job,

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.560
or you're unhappy
with your, let's

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.295
say, marriage or
way you're living,

00:46:53.295 --> 00:46:54.920
I bet there are people
in this room who

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.290
are on their second or
third Google office.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:47:00.550
Like, it's never too
late to just start again.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.280
And that concept was
definitely something

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.280
that I thought about a lot as he
goes from city to city changing

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.340
his identity.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.530
The pen name, I like that.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.140
I might say that in
the future. [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:16.030
But it really was a mixture of
the unisex All-American, paired

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.560
with the Google identity
versus-- so in a way, I guess,

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.740
having my work identity separate
from my writing identity.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.130
AUDIENCE: Do you think you
wrote things under this name

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:27.080
that you wouldn't
feel comfortable with?

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.590
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
No, I really don't.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:29.214
I really don't.

00:47:29.214 --> 00:47:33.220
There are a couple sex scenes
in here, just enough to get you

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.430
reading.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:39.839
But no, nothing that-- and,
as you saw on the posters,

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:42.380
have been saying Lauren Epshteyn
using pen name Lane Everett.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:48.127
AUDIENCE: Who's going
to direct the movie?

00:47:48.127 --> 00:47:49.960
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: I've
been asked who I think

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.850
would make good characters.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:51.391
I don't know.

00:47:51.391 --> 00:47:53.560
I think we might have even
been talking this that I

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.018
don't-- while I don't have an
exact picture of who would be

00:47:56.018 --> 00:47:59.040
Drucker, I just
love Leo DiCaprio.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:03.920
SEEMA VASHI: He also does a
ton of historical fiction.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.300
LINDSAY SIANO: Ryan Gosling.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.562
SEEMA VASHI: Is he
particularly good looking?

00:48:08.562 --> 00:48:10.020
Do you want him to
be good looking?

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.686
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes,
he's good looking.

00:48:11.686 --> 00:48:12.794
SEEMA VASHI: Charming?

00:48:12.794 --> 00:48:15.540
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yep,
all these things, so.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.806
Kristen?

00:48:17.806 --> 00:48:20.220
AUDIENCE: So Google Media
Sales is definitely a calling.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.680
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.110
AUDIENCE: Do you see yourself--

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:23.724
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
It's the Lord's work.

00:48:23.724 --> 00:48:23.821
[?

00:48:23.821 --> 00:48:24.698
AUDIENCE: --having
the passion point

00:48:24.698 --> 00:48:27.040
to maybe one day becoming
a full time writer?

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.623
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
It's been a long time

00:48:28.623 --> 00:48:30.867
since I wanted to be a
full time writer, probably

00:48:30.867 --> 00:48:32.825
around the time I wrote
that questionnaire when

00:48:32.825 --> 00:48:35.050
I was 10 years old.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:35.760
I don't know.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.815
That's not the goal.

00:48:36.815 --> 00:48:37.940
I'll just leave it at that.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.240
That's not the goal.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.580
As I just mentioned, I am
working on the second book

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.990
because I found it to
be such a fun hobby.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.240
But I also really enjoy
having it as a hobby

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.630
and not as the way that
the bills are paid.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.810
Because after three
months of sales,

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:55.800
the bills are not paid
off with this book.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.466
Yes, Abbie?

00:48:57.466 --> 00:48:59.340
AUDIENCE: Did you write
this chronologically?

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.830
LAUREN EPSHTEYN: Yes, I did.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:01.530
I did.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:05.580
Because I had written section
one-- there's five sections.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:08.160
I wrote section one and then
put it down for four years.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.820
That was pretty
much a clean break.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.340
So yes, I wrote it
all chronologically.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.260
But section one
was heavily edited,

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.600
and I would even say that
the plot wasn't changed,

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.860
but the writing style
was very much changed,

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.855
and I went back and
fixed that years later.

00:49:21.855 --> 00:49:23.730
LINDSAY SIANO: Can I
ask a followup question?

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:25.354
Did you know what
you wanted the ending

00:49:25.354 --> 00:49:26.830
to be before you got to the end?

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.330
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
That's interesting.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:30.370
The ending was one
of the few things

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.860
that I wasn't as clear on,
but when this idea came to me,

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.200
it came to me pretty much
all at once back in 2008,

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.360
when I started it-- this concept
of five sections, the places

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.365
that each one would be.

00:49:42.365 --> 00:49:44.490
And then generally the
concept, without telling you

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:49.150
how it ends, that it would
end in a fairly abrupt way

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:53.221
in the place where it does and
with the ultimate resolution

00:49:53.221 --> 00:49:53.720
it has.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.920
So, no, I had an idea that
that was going to happen,

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.640
but exactly how it
all came together,

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.990
I didn't know originally.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.740
Yes, Leah?

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.914
AUDIENCE: Hey, Lauren, I'm
so glad I could be here.

00:50:04.914 --> 00:50:06.830
So I just had a quick
question about the book.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.371
So the book takes
place in the 1890s.

00:50:08.371 --> 00:50:11.050
How did you think the readers
today would relate to it?

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.450
LAUREN EPSHTEYN:
Yes, you're so right.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:15.180
Yes, the book takes
place in the 1890s,

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.400
and it's historical fiction.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.220
But I think this
more than anything--

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.670
that Drucker is positioned
to ask a question-- somewhat

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.624
uniquely positioned
for his generation

00:50:23.624 --> 00:50:25.790
to ask the question that
we're all asking ourselves,

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:27.140
which is, what should
I do with my life,

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.000
and am I spending my
life the right way?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.720
And because Drucker had
the money and the position

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.910
he could ask himself that.

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:36.230
He had the luxury of
asking himself that.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.670
But I do think that the question
at the heart of this book

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.990
is what so many of us
today in our generation

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:42.700
what we spend so
much time asking.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.700
SEEMA VASHI: He's
the first Millennial?

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.116
