means made to order yeah right order

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420
means made to order yeah right order
 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.750
means made to order yeah right order
right yeah so essentially these parts

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760
right yeah so essentially these parts
 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.610
right yeah so essentially these parts
and components did not exist until you

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620
and components did not exist until you
 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.070
and components did not exist until you
came along to design these exactly new

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080
came along to design these exactly new
 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.230
came along to design these exactly new
devices for chambers and figured out how

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240
devices for chambers and figured out how
 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.910
devices for chambers and figured out how
to get them all to work together yeah

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920
to get them all to work together yeah
 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.640
to get them all to work together yeah
it's been you know they give it to go on

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650
it's been you know they give it to go on
 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.500
it's been you know they give it to go on
you get it off all the electrical I mean

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.510
you get it off all the electrical I mean
 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.810
you get it off all the electrical I mean
it's been a it's been a it's been fun

swimming pool so you don't have to have

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:06.990
swimming pool so you don't have to have
 

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.050
swimming pool so you don't have to have
any code or whatever these things aren't

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060
any code or whatever these things aren't
 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.840

cool writing is wins one pools have code

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:11.850
cool writing is wins one pools have code
 

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.390
cool writing is wins one pools have code
right yeah and because this isn't a pool

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400
right yeah and because this isn't a pool
 

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.920
right yeah and because this isn't a pool
doesn't mean it shouldn't have code that

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:15.930
doesn't mean it shouldn't have code that
 

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.240
doesn't mean it shouldn't have code that
just means it should have a set of codes

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.250
just means it should have a set of codes
 

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.090
just means it should have a set of codes
that are specifically designed for this

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.100
that are specifically designed for this
 

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.770
that are specifically designed for this

you see it so it's all that stuff there

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.330
you see it so it's all that stuff there

you see it so it's all that stuff there
then you read through this and this is

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.090
then you read through this and this is

the reality of the direction that the
 

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.530
the reality of the direction that the
industry is going in that the

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:33.540
industry is going in that the
 

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.480
industry is going in that the
authorities are aware and and then

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:35.490
authorities are aware and and then
 

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.490
authorities are aware and and then
they're not stupid they understand what

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.500
they're not stupid they understand what

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.329
all of it does it's certified it's it's
perfect as it is now but the rest of it

perfect as it is now but the rest of it
 

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:53.120
perfect as it is now but the rest of it
is like okay we could do that

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.130
is like okay we could do that
 

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.550
is like okay we could do that
but it wouldn't be you know what it is

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560
but it wouldn't be you know what it is
 

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.350
but it wouldn't be you know what it is
that we've taken so much time and effort

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360
that we've taken so much time and effort
 

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.980
that we've taken so much time and effort
to to get right now we know all the

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:00.990
to to get right now we know all the
 

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.650
to to get right now we know all the
other components the less expensive ones

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660
other components the less expensive ones
 

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.420
other components the less expensive ones
let's say right and we could do that

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:05.430
let's say right and we could do that
 

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.129
let's say right and we could do that
right but what I'm saying is the only

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139
right but what I'm saying is the only
 

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:09.019
right but what I'm saying is the only
reason why you need all those expensive

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:09.029
reason why you need all those expensive
 

00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:10.220
reason why you need all those expensive
components because you're dealing with

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:10.230
components because you're dealing with
 

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.590
components because you're dealing with
more than one human being right if it's

one we have now is 19 inches because the
 

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:55.780
one we have now is 19 inches because the
material required to build it they can't

material required to build it they can't
 

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:58.810
material required to build it they can't
get it any big now though there's 32

00:55:58.810 --> 00:55:58.820
get it any big now though there's 32
 

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.640
get it any big now though there's 32
inch screen material I can get it to

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:00.650
inch screen material I can get it to
 

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:03.910
inch screen material I can get it to
make the to make it 32 inches across but

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920
make the to make it 32 inches across but
 

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.580
make the to make it 32 inches across but
is their size that it's no longer good

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:06.590
is their size that it's no longer good
 

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:08.290
is their size that it's no longer good
because you have to know that blackboard

screen right it the the the image will
move around within the screen so you

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:16.130
move around within the screen so you
 

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.010
move around within the screen so you
have it all black we're working on

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:18.020
have it all black we're working on

and you're laying them back on your dome
 

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:27.370
and you're laying them back on your dome
and those tiles are underneath you so

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:27.380
and those tiles are underneath you so
 

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.950

it's a cymatic frequencies we've figured
out how to them to create the patterns

00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359
out how to them to create the patterns

is there's all the file but we're made
 

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.420
is there's all the file but we're made
out of frequencies like would even see

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:01.430
out of frequencies like would even see

of the previous one what if you did

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319
of the previous one what if you did
 

00:59:39.319 --> 00:59:41.200
of the previous one what if you did
better but if you created a cell that

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:41.210
better but if you created a cell that
 

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.800
better but if you created a cell that
was

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:41.810
was
 

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:44.230
was
better why wouldn't you if you already

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240
better why wouldn't you if you already
 

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.570
better why wouldn't you if you already
understood but happened to do that well

00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:46.580
understood but happened to do that well
 

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:48.490
understood but happened to do that well
this is going to be a tool we have this

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:48.500
this is going to be a tool we have this
 

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:50.230
this is going to be a tool we have this
the sensors now see I was talking about

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240
the sensors now see I was talking about
 

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.610
the sensors now see I was talking about
the brain thing the Germans are getting

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:51.620
the brain thing the Germans are getting
 

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.170
the brain thing the Germans are getting
me with a cap there what's the neuron

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:53.180
me with a cap there what's the neuron
 

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.000
me with a cap there what's the neuron
the brain thing with a cap that has the

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:55.010
the brain thing with a cap that has the
 

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.220
the brain thing with a cap that has the
electrodes on it like a swimming cap

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:57.230
electrodes on it like a swimming cap
 

00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:00.580
electrodes on it like a swimming cap
well it's not I don't cap no it's got

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:00.590
well it's not I don't cap no it's got
 

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.350
well it's not I don't cap no it's got
electrodes on it it's a cap that goes on

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:02.360
electrodes on it it's a cap that goes on
 

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.120
electrodes on it it's a cap that goes on
your head okay they haven't built it for

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:04.130
your head okay they haven't built it for
 

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.620
your head okay they haven't built it for
me yet but I've discussed it with them

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:05.630
me yet but I've discussed it with them
 

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:06.940
me yet but I've discussed it with them
and they understand that they can do it

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:06.950
and they understand that they can do it
 

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.500
and they understand that they can do it
based on some thing they've done in a

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:08.510
based on some thing they've done in a
 

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:11.500
based on some thing they've done in a
bathtub somewhere but the the sensors

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:11.510
bathtub somewhere but the the sensors
 

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.240
bathtub somewhere but the the sensors
then you see as they're connected to you

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:13.250
then you see as they're connected to you
 

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.370
then you see as they're connected to you
you input information see that's the

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:15.380
you input information see that's the
 

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.590
you input information see that's the
other things the sensory of of what's

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:17.600
other things the sensory of of what's
 

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.870
other things the sensory of of what's
going out and what's going into you and

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880
going out and what's going into you and
 

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.390
going out and what's going into you and
then monitoring what occurs based on

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400
then monitoring what occurs based on
 

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.030
then monitoring what occurs based on
this input this is what that thing is

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040
this input this is what that thing is
 

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.470
this input this is what that thing is
all about but you know I don't want to

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480
all about but you know I don't want to
 

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.640
all about but you know I don't want to
get too deep in there because it's kind

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:27.650
get too deep in there because it's kind
 

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.710
get too deep in there because it's kind
of like in the future right now and then

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720
of like in the future right now and then
 

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.230
of like in the future right now and then
so your idea is to combine sound with

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240
so your idea is to combine sound with
 

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.440
so your idea is to combine sound with
images to essentially tune your body to

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:35.450
images to essentially tune your body to
 

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:37.480
images to essentially tune your body to
a different frequency and that could

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:37.490
a different frequency and that could
 

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.390
a different frequency and that could
potentially change the way your body

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400
potentially change the way your body
 

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.940
potentially change the way your body
produces cells absolutely that's a whoa

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:44.950
produces cells absolutely that's a whoa
 

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:47.470
produces cells absolutely that's a whoa
interesting analogy of the situation but

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480
interesting analogy of the situation but
 

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.760
interesting analogy of the situation but
indeed there's a lot of evidence to you

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:51.770
indeed there's a lot of evidence to you
 

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.410
indeed there's a lot of evidence to you
know a lot of evidence about meditation

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:53.420
know a lot of evidence about meditation
 

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.420
know a lot of evidence about meditation
in the mind and the effect on the mind

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:55.430
in the mind and the effect on the mind
 

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:56.980
in the mind and the effect on the mind
the physical effect on the brain and

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:56.990
the physical effect on the brain and
 

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:59.440
the physical effect on the brain and
that what is meditation it's tuning into

01:00:59.440 --> 01:00:59.450
that what is meditation it's tuning into
 

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:01.840
that what is meditation it's tuning into
a certain type of frequency atherton

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:01.850
a certain type of frequency atherton
 

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.090
a certain type of frequency atherton
certain type of mindset turning into a

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:04.100
certain type of mindset turning into a
 

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.120
certain type of mindset turning into a
certain mentality tuning into a certain

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:07.130
certain mentality tuning into a certain
 

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.580
certain mentality tuning into a certain
energy that the mind is is focused on

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:09.590
energy that the mind is is focused on
 

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.710
energy that the mind is is focused on
and that that actually has a profound

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720
and that that actually has a profound
 

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.110
and that that actually has a profound
effect on the very brain itself that's

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:14.120
effect on the very brain itself that's
 

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.640
effect on the very brain itself that's
pretty interesting stuff a super

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:15.650
pretty interesting stuff a super
 

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:16.900
pretty interesting stuff a super
interesting this so that makes something

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:16.910
interesting this so that makes something
 

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:19.840
interesting this so that makes something
like what you're saying actually viable

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:19.850
like what you're saying actually viable
 

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:20.950
like what you're saying actually viable
oh yeah

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960
oh yeah
 

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.350
oh yeah
know that we have a group of people that

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:23.360
know that we have a group of people that
 

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.660
know that we have a group of people that
are willing to give us the money for

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:25.670
are willing to give us the money for
 

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:28.200
are willing to give us the money for
that you know that's we have the

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:28.210
that you know that's we have the
 

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:30.700
that you know that's we have the
resources now to complete that you know

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:30.710
resources now to complete that you know
 

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.250
resources now to complete that you know
in some sort of period of time once we

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:32.260
in some sort of period of time once we
 

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.450
in some sort of period of time once we
focus back to it we've been trying to

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:34.460
focus back to it we've been trying to
 

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.650
focus back to it we've been trying to
get this other stuff done so then we

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:35.660
get this other stuff done so then we
 

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.290
get this other stuff done so then we
could get back to this stuff but that

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:37.300
could get back to this stuff but that
 

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.670
could get back to this stuff but that
technology that we have built and

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680
technology that we have built and
 

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.610
technology that we have built and
patented as well is extraordinary and

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:42.620
patented as well is extraordinary and
 

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.170
patented as well is extraordinary and
that that takes this thing to another

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:44.180
that that takes this thing to another
 

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.940
that that takes this thing to another
level I mean this is what it is and

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:45.950
level I mean this is what it is and
 

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:47.170
level I mean this is what it is and
that's why it's so important as well

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:47.180
that's why it's so important as well
 

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.480
that's why it's so important as well
these vehicles that we're producing now
