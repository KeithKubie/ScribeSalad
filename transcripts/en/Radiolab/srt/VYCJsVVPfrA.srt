1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,470
You're listening to radiolab
from public radio, w.N y.

2
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:14,110
S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hello.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,580
Hello. Hello. Hello.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,450
Today I want to start the show by telling
you about a guy with a very, very,

5
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:22,930
very important man. Probably
one of the most important guys.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,560
And guide them. Yes. Okay.

7
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:31,110
Tell me the correct
pronunciation on a Leo Leo.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,620
Leo Can Hook in the way that you should
say is something like 11 Herc and here,

9
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,041
thankfully,

10
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,930
to help with our pronunciation and to
fill in the details is professor Matthew

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,410
Cobb. I'm the program director for
Zoology at the University of Manchester,

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,040
leaving hope,

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,210
and I've written a book about this called
generation the 17th century scientists

14
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:53,380
who unraveled the secrets of sex, life
and growth. Okay, so Lavan Hook. Yeah,

15
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:57,310
that's fine. Okay, so what did he
do? He was a draper. Draper. Yeah,

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,170
so he just so cloth. Oh, hey. He had
no scientific training whatsoever.

17
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,910
He was interested in microscopes.

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,850
Why would a draper be
interested in microscopes? Is
this hobby, is what he did.

19
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:11,030
He made these microscopes and he was
actually really good. That's right.

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,290
Although you have to keep in mind that
microscopes at that point in time talking

21
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,320
1670s here, it's not exactly
how we think of them now.

22
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,540
Back then they were just tiny
balls of glass and that's it.

23
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,780
And Science itself was
just a wee little baby.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,170
You gotta just really
put yourself back. Okay.

25
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:33,620
There was Lavan Hook doing really well
with these microscopes and pretty soon

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,220
scientists all over the place. We're
asking you to look at stuff, for example,

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,710
um, what's in blood or what's
in sweat or what's in semen.

28
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,710
Dentata this is where it
does get rather sorted. Okay.

29
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,190
So Chad, before you do, I would just,

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,410
this is a point where we should tell
our audience that some of the references

31
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,400
from here on in will be a bit
graphic. If you don't want to it,

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,880
we don't want to hear that stuff. Now
go out to the garden and you know,

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,960
check out the rats. All right.
Okay. Now getting back to the story,

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,070
it's 1667 just imagine and losing hope
has just received a letter from the Royal

35
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,771
Society of London.

36
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:14,300
This big group of scientists asking
him to take a look at a drop of humans.

37
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,080
Seems to see what's in that, and not
to be graphic, but one Autumn Day,

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,790
Autumn 1677 he is in his bedroom having
conjugal relations with his wife,

39
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:23,390
Cornelia.

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,660
He's got his microscope ready plus a
little vial and then as he put it within

41
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:29,390
six beats of the posts,
after he ejaculated,

42
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,520
he'd got the seaman and he put it
into this very thin cappelary tube,

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,700
rushed over to the window. His
wife's laying there thinking, well,

44
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,290
what the hell are you doing?
Not Again, come on. Well,

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,390
you I know for the microscopes
already, and then he looks into the,

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,650
into the semen and he can
clearly see that there's a thing,

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,290
there's something in there,
some kind of small structure,

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,610
[inaudible] focuses.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,820
He can see all these wriggling things.

50
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,463
He's just full,

51
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,540
absolutely full of these tiny eel like
things that he says are vast number of

52
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,600
living animal, cute animal
bodies were rounded,

53
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,790
furnished with a long thing tail.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,850
They moved with a snake like

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,740
motion of the tail as eels
do when swimming in water.

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,580
[inaudible]

57
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,010
so what was he thinking at this
point? Do we know? I don't know.

58
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,940
I putting myself in his place. I
think, wow. Because here's the thing.

59
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:37,630
At this point in time, people didn't
really understand where babies came from.

60
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,080
They knew it had something to do
with sex. But the notion of heredity,

61
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,310
we are still very fuzzy.
And how a baby developed

62
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,150
was a total mystery. What's life?

63
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,960
How would you know if
something's alive in those days?

64
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:56,190
One of the main things that
they associated with life
was movement, isn't it?

65
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,380
It stuff moved. It was alive.
So if movement is the key,

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,680
you can imagine what labor and hooked
must've been thinking staring at these

67
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:08,360
wriggling little beasts
in the vial because they
[inaudible] that's right here.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,320
Oh boy, did they move? These things are
trying to get somewhere that thrashing,

69
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,510
that desperate maybe in this
vile is the secret to life.

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,753
No

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,610
to the soul. This is what people
thought it didn't take long before.

72
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:26,840
Pretty fantastic idea began to circulate,
which is that not only is the sperm,

73
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:28,100
the vehicle of the soul,

74
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,240
but if you could somehow zoom all
the way down into its little head,

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,250
you would find in there a
little man, hello, hello.

76
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,710
This little chap or hunched
up, little tiny guy,

77
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,890
Tony human thinking was that one
day when the microscopes got better,

78
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,790
you'd actually be able to see that tiny
little human with your own eyes because

79
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,690
it had to be there because if the
sperm was the sole source of life,

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,500
then there must be something in there
that look pretty much like a human being.

81
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,780
One problem though. What if you were
one of these folks who believed yes,

82
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,880
but the sperm was the sole? Well
then you had to ask yourself,

83
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,500
what is the say about God?

84
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,560
Because it would mean he was creating
all these souls and then he was just

85
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:14,770
wasting them lave and
Herc did a calculation.

86
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,410
He worked out that there were more seaman,

87
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,130
more spermatozoa in an ejaculate of a cod.

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,490
He got a card and he opened it up and
saw how many sperm they must be in.

89
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,610
It's a jacket. And he said
there he was pretty much right.

90
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,710
There are more sperm in this ejaculate
than there are human beings alive on the

91
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,690
planet. And that's just in one cod.
What? That's true. Yeah. Holy Moly.

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,540
So you imagine all the men producing
all this stuff all the time.

93
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,370
Best an awful lot of souls if they're
all potentially human beings just dying.

94
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, oh, but one. How many
spare Mary in a human ejaculate,

95
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,060
but 180 million. Oh, see that's nothing
these days. Yeah, it's like Brooklyn.

96
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,710
You just there. All right. This is radio
lab from Genova, I, Robert Krulwich,

97
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:04,050
and our program today is about the
way 180 million is still alive.

98
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,060
It's not a lot.

99
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,230
It's something that you only have a couple
of eggs who has a cup of [inaudible],

100
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,370
has a couple of eggs.
She's got a finite number.

101
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,140
Where's the guy is making millions every
day. Oh wait. Oh, that's right. Anyhow,

102
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,490
our program today is about
sperm. Yup. Stick around

103
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:25,860
[inaudible].

104
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,170
Okay. In all seriousness,
before we get started for real,

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,290
just wanted to tell you that that this
program does actually contain strong

106
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,900
sexual material and nothing too graphic,

107
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:37,470
but this is your warning
stick around. It'll be okay.

108
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:40,590
For those of us whose we may, let's
get back to our basic question,

109
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,210
the why so many questions. Yes.

110
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Why is there such a startling asymmetry
between number of sexual sales produced

111
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:52,310
by a male and the very relatively few
eggs in the female? Well, of course,

112
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,850
this is the question I put the question
to. One, two, three, four, five, six,

113
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,850
seven, eight, nine, 10. There's a lot
of English people in this show today.

114
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,910
[inaudible] work at the University of
Sheffield in the Department of animal and

115
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:05,750
plant sciences and he is an
expert on sperm in birth.

116
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,043
[inaudible]

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,530
you choose this line of work.
Ever since I was a teenager,

118
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,150
I was obsessed by birds.

119
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,480
I was also obsessed by sex and I managed
to combine the two into an academic

120
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:21,370
career. Isn't that lucky?

121
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,320
In any case. He says this
question of waistline, earth,

122
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,740
did God make so many sperm? It
just didn't seem very sensitive.

123
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,640
Well, this question not
only troubled the church at

124
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,530
Flamingo Science Flomex does I think the
right words I mixed scientists for for

125
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:38,520
a very long time.

126
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:43,050
It really wasn't until about the 1970s
that finally the large numbers of sperm

127
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:46,830
that males transfer to females
finally began to make sense.

128
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,080
What happened in the 1970s well before
the 1970s bird scientist assumed that if

129
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,750
a female chose a spouse for the season,

130
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,140
she would stick to the spouse for
the season, she would be faithful.

131
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:00,630
But in the 70s when they
looked a little more closely,

132
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,660
they found there was
one more to this story.

133
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,560
Springtime in Somerset,

134
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,250
the female bushy tailed with the well
is always present in words like this.

135
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,320
Always searching for that
springtime joy of love, a love song.

136
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,390
He's skinny, beautiful as is he

137
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,763
any condoms

138
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,980
and then is the act of love consummated
rather quickly and now he's off to get

139
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:34,360
his new sweetheart. Juicy. Well,

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,480
she's [inaudible] for the time and she,

141
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,690
and actually she's hoping
off to to another Bronx. Um,

142
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,780
it seems to be another main

143
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,810
[inaudible] oil to this first part.

144
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,290
[inaudible]

145
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,160
hype prior to the 1970s, if

146
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,680
people saw females behaving promiscuously,

147
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,320
they assumed that there was
something wrong with them.

148
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,260
What is wrong with this
bird? You have another bed,

149
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,783
a lunch,

150
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,510
if you've got another hormone imbalances
or some kind of misunderstanding.

151
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:14,230
But then they discovered DNA
fingerprints, the DNA test,

152
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,000
which provided a completely
unequivocal test of paternity.

153
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,320
They'd go to a nest, say and look
at the five eggs in the nest,

154
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,380
test the DNA and discover that some
of those eggs came from different dads

155
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,980
indicating the female had
mated with more than one male.

156
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,690
What are these four man as a father?
But you don't know which one [inaudible]

157
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,920
DNA fingerprinting gave us the evidence
that in fact the majority of animals,

158
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,960
the females are promiscuous. Really?
I mean this is like chimp babies,

159
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,800
chickadee babies, chipmunk
babies. Almost ubiquitous.

160
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,990
Let's find out the truth.
You are not the father

161
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,800
at the moment. I'm only talking
about a non humans, right?

162
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,750
But what does this female promiscuity
thing have to do with the why so much

163
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:09,490
sperm connects that we think because once
people understood that that was going

164
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:13,840
on, well then the level of competition
between males gets actually much more

165
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,820
complicated. When you mean, well,

166
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,330
if I am chasing the lady now,

167
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,060
not only do I have to
worry about a competitor,

168
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:25,810
but I have to worry about all the people
I've never met who have been having sex

169
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:27,970
with my girl. There's a whole level of,

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,620
oh you mean like the sperm is a complete
room is competing with just the makers

171
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:35,080
of the sperm, but the sperm
itself is sperm itself.

172
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,100
So there's outdoor competition, but now
there's indoor competition. Exactly.

173
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:39,970
If you get my drift,

174
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,470
one very effective way of competing is
simply to produce more sperm than the

175
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:45,304
next guy.

176
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,120
[inaudible]

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,400
okay, look, we need to
step back a little bit.

178
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,130
If females are promiscuous,

179
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,970
natural selection is going to favor
the male that wins and fertilizers that

180
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:06,380
particular females eggs.
As a consequence of that,

181
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,650
males have evolved the most staggering
array of adaptations to minimize their

182
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:16,430
own chances of being cuckolded.
What does cuckolded mean?

183
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,760
Cuckolding means your wife is cheating
on you and you don't know it. Oh,

184
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,200
so what he's saying is that animals
will go to elaborate lengths to beat,

185
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:27,620
not cheated on. In fact,
let me give you three spec

186
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,520
illustrations as never before
heard on Albert program.

187
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,750
When wouldn't it again,

188
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,750
which includes most things with sperm
competition as this played by [inaudible],

189
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,420
the rogue beetle

190
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,140
[inaudible]. These beetles are
amazing. When the male B dog,

191
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:48,990
the male Rovio has sex
with a female. So is Tim.

192
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,020
They transfer this berm and basically a
package of sperm called spur motto for

193
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,630
once it's inside the female,
it starts to [inaudible]. Well,

194
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,500
expand like a balloon. Yes.
In swelling and expanding.

195
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,750
It pushes out or away any rivals.

196
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,300
Hey, hey, but the sperm is stuck in a
balloon. It's gotta get out. Oh yes.

197
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,020
Well, but the lady Rove Beetle has
the Lukens structure of structure,

198
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:24,021
like a two that will [inaudible] the
spray for releasing the male's sperm.

199
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,620
No kidding. Yeah, it was
kind of like science fiction.

200
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,380
But if you think the role of beetle
has got something going on, let's meet.

201
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,170
Um,

202
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,170
males have the most elaborate and
bizarre penis is covered with backwards

203
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,370
pointing spines, hundreds of backward
pointing spines, kind of like, uh,

204
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,610
you know, bristles on a pipe cleaner
and a very clever guy called Jeff wog.

205
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,090
He did a very clever experiment.

206
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,130
He allowed male drag and tries to mate
with females and separated them at

207
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:01,310
different stages during their
rather protracted copulation.

208
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,520
And what he found was halfway
through the copulation,

209
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:08,420
the male before he actually
does the act is actually moving

210
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,330
his penis from the female and it's
covered with sperm from the previous male.

211
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,020
It inseminated that female. Oh, so he's
brushing out the other guys. Exactly.

212
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,460
That's rather shocking. Yup.

213
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,840
Batter's still better still is
the duck the duck, the duck.

214
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,170
Most birds don't have
appears male birds. Ducks do.

215
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,530
That's it. No, it goes on
across different ducks species.

216
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,650
The penis size varies from
very small to about 14 inches.

217
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,560
I mean, absolutely astronomical
on relatively small duck.

218
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,300
And the thing about the duck is,

219
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,400
I don't quite know how to put this
ducks engage in forced extra pair

220
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,160
copulations. What he's really
saying is that the males are,

221
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,660
are they're raping the females. Oh wait.

222
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,630
Because the females have a strategy
of there. A couple of years ago,

223
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,610
we were dissecting a female duck and a
postdoc called Patty Brennan called me

224
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:10,840
into the, and she said, look at this.

225
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,440
I've just found this funny
structure in the female's vagina,

226
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,840
and what it was was a side-branch,
meaning instead of one, you know,

227
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,260
clear highway, right to the egg. This
one had a kind of off ramp off ramp.

228
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,850
I phoned a colleague in France who was a
duck expert and he said he'd never seen

229
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:30,580
such a thing but give him 10
minutes and he'll go and check.

230
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,450
So he obviously went off and dissected
his own duck. He phoned me back and said,

231
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,220
my God, you're right there.

232
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:40,780
It was an off ramp in the fringe dock by
which time we'd finished our dissection

233
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,560
and in fact,

234
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,380
when the British took a look at their
dock and the duck that we looked at,

235
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:46,720
there were two or three
separate side branches.

236
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,250
Patty then went on to do a comparative
study of a lot of different duck species.

237
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,790
And what we found was that in species
where the nail had an enormous fallows,

238
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,050
the female had the most complex
vagina we'd ever come across.

239
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,490
Some had two or three side
branches and a very long spiral,

240
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,090
like a cook screw or the end of the
vagina. And if you think about it,

241
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,380
what seems very likely here is that
the female has got these structures to

242
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:15,590
deflect the male. If she's being raped,

243
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,340
she might contract part of
her reproductive tract to
send the mail off down a

244
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:21,410
blind alley. If he avoids that,

245
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,030
she can just tighten up the spiral so
his sperm can't get to the right place.

246
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,400
So what you've got here is a kind of
warfare. The mail says, all right,

247
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm coming in there like it
or not. And then the female

248
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,590
is, well, you're getting
nowhere like it or not

249
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,030
go female ducks.

250
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,060
Remarkable case of females evolving
counter adaptations to keep males at arms

251
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:53,500
length. Well,

252
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,690
penis is length so to speak.

253
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,740
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

254
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,620
Aye. So this is maverick and buckles,

255
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,810
African group.

256
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,510
The British male science is section of
our protein who's coming easily to a

257
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:18,650
pause so we can meet an American and
a female. My name is Joanna Ellington.

258
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,730
Joanna Ellington, I'm a phd
in reproductive physiology.

259
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,330
We spoke with her at her
farm in Washington state.

260
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,360
So we have a 70 acres here and I was
a veterinarian before I did my phd.

261
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,360
You are an andrologist? Yes.

262
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,350
An andrologist is study
of male reproduction and
dro for man and allergy is

263
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:42,020
study of, yeah. Yeah. Are
the big, they're right there.

264
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,690
Pigs are over here sleeping.
They're going to be bred today.

265
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:49,070
We actually have semen flying in from the
basket and we're going to go down here

266
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:51,440
to the chicken coop. And while
she's walking into the chicken coop,

267
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,370
let me just say,

268
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,920
we finally come to a human sparing
expert to ask Jerry about us. Yeah.

269
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,420
And as, I mean, this competition thing,

270
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:03,380
does it work like that with
those ginger? No part. Well,

271
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:07,490
that's the real surprise to me. I mean,
we've all seen the sex education films.

272
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:08,510
You know when you're in fourth grade,

273
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,410
the woman's own defense
system attacks the sperm.

274
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,980
They are unwelcome cells from another
organism and they are potential enemies.

275
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:19,770
But

276
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,760
when Joanna gave me her version of
all this, it was not like that at all.

277
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,630
Let me, let me start from
the beginning. First,

278
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,690
this firm have to get through the cervix.

279
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,920
The woman's cervical mucus has a lot
of fibers in it that are crisscrossed,

280
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,490
so you think it'd be this big mesh
barrier they couldn't get through.

281
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,400
The barriers are numerous by
when women are [inaudible].

282
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,380
The hormones in her body make all
those fibers in the cervical mucus

283
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,850
lineup and they basically make a
little highway that the sperm can swim,

284
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,170
Zip, Zip, zip. Not only
is she welcoming the man,

285
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,330
he's making sure later
that they don't get along.

286
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,900
They're directed to the side that has
the egg on it all because there's some

287
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:04,960
tubes with eggs and
some twos without right.

288
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,970
One Fallopian Tube leads
to the waiting game.

289
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,830
The other to an empty tomb except for
the woman's body says over here, guys,

290
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,360
this site this night and most surprising
of all is that halfway through the

291
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:21,860
journey there's a a rest period n
it was called the Fallopian Tube.

292
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,430
The Fallopian Tube says, oh great,
we know that you guys are here.

293
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,380
We know that you're pretty fragile guys,

294
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,040
so we're going to change the type
of sugar proteins that we make.

295
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,320
We're going to make sugar proteins that
you're bathed in and you just hang out

296
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:41,790
here until an egg comes. Oh, so
we're now in the waiting room.

297
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,140
Yes, and we're being sugar.
Yes. This sounds nice.

298
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,540
It is nice. That was like
a little Roman moment.

299
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,690
Everybody's lying down and kind of
getting a towel wash or something.

300
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,660
They're very quiet at that point.
Metabolically, they're quiet.

301
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,700
The female is essentially coming in

302
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,720
the

303
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,490
[inaudible].

304
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,390
They can live in the
Fallopian tube for two, three,

305
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:16,030
four days, maybe even a
week. Oh Week. No kidding.

306
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,720
Until her egg is ready. That's when
she said, hey, we just odd related.

307
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,520
You need to let the guys go.

308
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,023
[inaudible]

309
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,510
are released and starts
swimming up the track.

310
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,070
They swim dense functions to meet the
egg in search of the aid and the rest of

311
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:36,000
it. Of course. You know

312
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:39,850
[inaudible]

313
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,650
never heard about the sugar room before.

314
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:44,290
I mean that seems like news you have
to in the Fallopian didn't. Yeah,

315
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,020
neither had I, this had been
discussed by scientists,

316
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,600
but there was no evidence
to prove that it was so,

317
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,270
uh, but Joanna as a good scientist,

318
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:58,100
she was the first to provide the evidence.
She said, after I had my last son,

319
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,820
I told my doctor, I said, my husband
and I are going to have intercourse.

320
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,990
You are going to do your
mind Tubal ligation and cut
out my tube and we're going

321
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:10,280
to get pictures of the sperm stored in
the Human Fallopian tube. So we did.

322
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,490
So you counted your husband's
guys? Yes. Yes. At the gate. Yeah.

323
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:20,000
There weren't very many. There were
just a few. How many were there?

324
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,420
He had about 20 in the Fallopian
tube that we looked at.

325
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,420
Oh man, that seems like a fragile
[inaudible] low number. Well it is,

326
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:31,700
but you have to remember
that you only need one.

327
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,700
Wow. That blows my mind. I
mean it's like 20 little. Yeah,

328
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,570
I'm sure lost at the gate.
The cool thing is that yes,

329
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,360
there is this level of competition still,

330
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,220
but underneath there is
this substrate of male

331
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,450
female cooperation.

332
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,570
It's much more inactive teamwork
than one would have supposed

333
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,600
Hazel sperm just arrived. But I'd let
you guys know. Oh, get pregnant. Yeah,

334
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,910
they're going to get pregnant.
Oh, she, that's her pet

335
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,620
boxer w what is it? It's
a white styrofoam cooler.

336
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,390
Go ahead and scratch
Hazel's back. Say Gee,

337
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,400
we'll end up putting probably about
a half a cat into Hazel. Yeah.

338
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,800
How long did it take Mr pig to
make a half a cup? Pigs, man.

339
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,340
A lot of spam. Rubber ces
now. Seven that, Ya know,

340
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,270
come on. Wait, we got to go gray. Sorry.

341
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,050
We're going to miss some
stuff about the pig Radiolab.

342
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,090
We'll continue in a moment.

343
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,550
Message one radio lab is funded in
part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation.

344
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,790
The corporation for public broadcasting
and the National Science Foundation.

345
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Radio lab is produced by W N Y C and
distributed by national public radio.

346
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,650
And this message.

347
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,210
Hi, I'm Abby Jacobson and you may know
me from my fifth TV show, broad city,

348
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,410
but before that I went to art school.
And why am I telling you that? Well,

349
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:02,190
it's because I have a
podcast baby about art.

350
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,410
It's called a piece of work. It's a
collab between me, w NYC studios and Moma.

351
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,740
I'll talk art with some of my
friends like Questlove, Tavi,

352
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:14,550
Gevinson and RuPaul and we'll consult
some experts and learn some incredible

353
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:15,384
things.

354
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,380
Listen to a piece of work with Abby
Jacobson wherever you get your podcasts.

355
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,210
Hello, I'm Jan [inaudible]. I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

356
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:30,150
Our topic today is berm
actually. That's right.

357
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,470
And what is a sperm if not one
teeny tiny little a dad. Oh,

358
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:37,140
it's much more than that. No,
it's the soul. If everything,

359
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,990
well we'll get it just to leave you in
the garage and turn to Kathleen Labounty

360
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:47,610
who a few years ago sat down to
try to draw a picture of her dad.

361
00:22:47,611 --> 00:22:51,270
And this is the picture that she
drew. I drew a picture of a sperm,

362
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,420
it isn't very impressive.

363
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,650
It was like a cartoon sperm
with blue eyes and brown hair

364
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,500
and a little bit of a mustache.

365
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,180
And then I had a really big question
mark behind the sperm and that was to

366
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,510
represent the fact that, I
don't know this man's identity.

367
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,850
This might sound like your typical
magic market paints a sperm donor story,

368
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,470
but it's really not. And here to tell
us about it is reporter Harry Daniels.

369
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,200
Should I, should I just kind of
take it from the top? Yeah. Okay.

370
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,290
Kathleen lives in Houston and when she
was eight her mom began telling her

371
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:36,220
rather repeatedly, Kathleen,
there's something special about you.

372
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,860
And I really wasn't that curious,

373
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:41,550
but she kept saying it so many times
that eventually I decided, okay,

374
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:45,620
what is it that makes me different? So
she took me upstairs, sat on my bed,

375
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,390
and she just said that the man who
raised you is not your biological father.

376
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,890
We had to go to the sperm bank and that
a very nice man gave us his berm so that

377
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,724
you could be born.

378
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,510
And then she said that I could still
consider my dad to be my father,

379
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,050
even though he wasn't my biological
father. Right afterwards,

380
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,430
I just ran downstairs and I threw my arms
around my dad's neck and he was on the

381
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:11,510
computer and I just told him that I left
him and he didn't know that I had just

382
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,550
been told that I wasn't
his biological daughter,

383
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,450
so she just took it in and it was
a source of joy for her initially.

384
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,930
It felt kind of magical.
It felt magical. Yeah,

385
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,950
it was just unique. It
didn't completely sink in.

386
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:26,784
At first

387
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,180
[inaudible]

388
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,010
things started to change as she got older.

389
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,380
She just became aware of all these things
that were different between me and my

390
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:42,230
family. Okay. So I've gotten the
picture out if me and my cousins,

391
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,290
so I'm feeling like FedEx,
I kind of don't blend in.

392
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,670
The obvious thing is my height.

393
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,360
I'm five two and all of my cousins
are between five 10 and six five.

394
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,800
Wow. Wow. That's like a foot taller.
Right. So that was one thing.

395
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,410
And then there were lots of other
things, like she had blue eyes,

396
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,770
whereas the rest of her family had
mainly Brown and she had these drawing

397
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,770
abilities. My mom, she can
barely draw stick figures.

398
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,590
She's a vegetarian and
the only one in my family.

399
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,640
And so I was kind of wondering if that
desired to take care of anything living

400
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:14,870
maybe came from him.

401
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,160
It just became more curious about
how this man contributed to who I am.

402
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,900
What did you know about him? The only
information that I got is that he,

403
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,880
he attended Baylor called to medicine.

404
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,420
Baylor is where Texas in
1981 when I was conceived,

405
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,960
but I don't know if he was a first year,
second, third or fourth year student.

406
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,420
And that's it. Correct. That
was us as brain much. Yeah.

407
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,010
So when she was a teenager,

408
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,930
she contacted the clinic trying to request
medical records and I was told that

409
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:46,410
they were destroyed years ago. I
felt like I had lost part of me.

410
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,420
So can she solve this in any way?
What is she going to do? Well,

411
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,900
one night when she was in college,
and this was a few years later,

412
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,110
her mom just happened to
be watching TV every year,

413
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,750
30,000 children are born in this country.

414
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,670
The mothers who had been artificially
inseminated with sperm from an anonymous

415
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:08,890
donor and she saw a special about
the generous sibling registry,

416
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,200
our base called the donor sibling
registry.com oh, it's a website.

417
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:18,350
So website we try to help donors and donor
offspring and half siblings find each

418
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:23,370
other. CBS News 60 minutes. So
after my mother saw this show,

419
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,570
I decided to register.

420
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:28,830
So she logged on pest clinic and
she put into the search engine,

421
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:30,910
Baylor College of Medicine [inaudible].

422
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,040
And there was actually a girl around
my age, young woman named Jessica,

423
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,790
which means they could be sisters.

424
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,850
Say she and I got in touch and
started to talk right away.

425
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,150
They noticed. They had a
lot of things in common.

426
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,880
We both had polycystic ovarian syndrome,

427
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,680
which is a genetic syndrome that you
would inherit and we are on the exact same

428
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:57,600
medication and the same dosage and that
seemed like more than a coincidence.

429
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,190
Kind of sparked our curiosity and so
they decided that they would meet up.

430
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,840
She came and spent a weekend with me.

431
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,710
By the time she left we had come up
with a list of a hundred similarities,

432
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,410
a hundred on our list. We have that.

433
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:14,400
We can't roll our tongues bed
born in 1982 but have curly hair.

434
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,310
We both had high cholesterol. Don't
have any sense of direction. This is,

435
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:20,780
this is what you do when you
want something to be true,

436
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,970
but had butterfly tattoos absolutely had
the same taste in music when you eat.

437
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,930
I think want to believe
we are very thoughtful.

438
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,350
All these things that would otherwise I
think maybe escape detects, have that.

439
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,920
Our handwriting was pretty similar. All
of a sudden become really important.

440
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,150
That just goes on and on.

441
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,260
So they decided to have a DNA test
and and the results come back.

442
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,990
They called her and then she called me.

443
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,070
I mean you can hear people's
disappointment and sadness.

444
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:50,960
So I knew before she said anything

445
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,613
[inaudible]

446
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,740
I think of it as a 0.001% probability
that we were sisters just like that this

447
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:03,720
possibility was gone. They
began to feel loss and grief.

448
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,010
Like I look in the mirror and I
see a stranger looking back at me.

449
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,270
Okay, so fast forward
now a couple of years,

450
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,500
she goes to a library, a
library, and the medical center,

451
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,550
she walks over to the stacks,
pulls out old Baylor yearbooks,

452
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,400
the old Baylor what your books.

453
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,020
She figured as long as he showed up to
get his picture taken on picture day,

454
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,390
he'd be in one of those books. Exactly.

455
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,350
So I take them off the shelf
and I photocopied every page,

456
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,460
your pegs say 19

457
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,470
791980818283 and 84 year old
letters and she took them home.

458
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,690
I was expecting just to flip through it
and not see any similarities with any of

459
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:52,320
the men and then get to
one picture and think, hey,

460
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:57,300
this is the man. But that's
definitely not what happened. Instead,

461
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,560
I realized that I looked like dozens
if not hundreds of the men. Let's see,

462
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,680
and I would think that I had
one man's news and this guy,

463
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,460
another man's eyes in prison, another
one, the other man's chin. Even this guy,

464
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,450
I mean, I think it's possible because
the rounded eyebrows and bigger eyes.

465
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,340
I just got overwhelmed so she
decided to enlist some help. Right?

466
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,580
So I had my mom and three of my closest
friends take sticky tabs and flip

467
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:28,020
through the photos of all of the men.
He has blue eyes. They might say, Molly,

468
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,220
you kind of look like this man,

469
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,770
or you kind of look like this
other man or smiles or similar,

470
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,160
and then they would mark the man who
they thought resembled me, the meadows.

471
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,390
She then decided she would draft
a letter, a letter. Dear doctor,

472
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,240
it is after match thought that I am
you. I was thinking, well, all right.

473
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:47,680
The men who were consistently picked
out, it was conceived May 4th,

474
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,070
1981 by an anonymous sperm donation
through a Baylor called to medicine

475
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:54,250
students. I tried to think,
okay, if I were a donor,

476
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,570
what would my concern speed.

477
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,080
I want to assure you that I am
emotionally stable and financially secure,

478
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,180
provide additional reassurance to donors.

479
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,380
I have been using a non legally binding
DNA test that cannot be used in court

480
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,330
and then I just explained in many ways,

481
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,230
okay I that even if I tried to give
an overview of who I am, I have large,

482
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,550
I'm these navy blue eyes.

483
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,030
I barely reached five to both my
mother and I have a positive blood.

484
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,170
I am attaching my photographs to see if
you recognize my face and then I just

485
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:22,630
said thank you for your
time. Sincerely Kathleen.

486
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,210
And so she actually sends
it out the letter. Yeah,

487
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,570
around 25 letters to the men
that looked most like her.

488
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,890
Another round of 50 my biggest fear
was that my letters would not be

489
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:33,880
acknowledged.

490
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,240
I had been told for so long that my
donor wouldn't want to know about me.

491
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:41,380
He wouldn't care that I exist and
I thought if I send out 25 letters,

492
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,520
maybe one would take the time to respond
to me. Did she get anything back?

493
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,600
She did what they say. Well, I mean
some of them more what you might expect.

494
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,800
Wow. Your letter was
unexpected. Dear Kathleen,

495
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:57,010
take me off your mailing list and
do you not ever contact me again?

496
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,220
I remember just before my shift started,

497
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:05,330
it was a 10:30 AM a rummage through
the mailbox and saw a letter that was

498
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:09,230
addressed to myself, Dr. Daniel
Zack. I live just outside Seattle.

499
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,970
And I remember, um,

500
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,160
practice emergency medicine
opening the letter and uh,

501
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,400
the first sentence or two I thought, oh,
oh see, here's one that's handwritten.

502
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,720
I was assured that it would be anonymous
and that there would be no way for

503
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:26,660
anyone to track me down
even if they wanted to.

504
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,340
That your motivations may be innocent.

505
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,840
Please consider the ramifications
for others by the knowledge you seek.

506
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,560
I felt that I would never be contacted.

507
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,890
Good. But then there were
others, like this guy,

508
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,090
I think I called her, um,
right away I'm Merryman Baker.

509
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm an orthopedic surgeon who's, uh,
lives in the Houston area. And I said,

510
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:53,700
well, I was a donor I think
25 years ago. And, uh,

511
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,980
I never thought this day would
come. What does that mean to he?

512
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,800
You know, I wrote this one
line down that he said, um,

513
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,380
he said that's how really
good things happen. You know,

514
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:08,750
usually the way really good things happen,
they come out of the blue. Uh, I'm,

515
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,210
I'm 51 now and I don't
have any kids, you know,

516
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:15,480
not having kids would be the last
thing I would have guessed, you know,

517
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,510
35 or 40 years ago from
my own perspective.

518
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,820
But I've always been very work oriented.

519
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,100
All of a sudden you kind
of look up and, you know,

520
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:25,980
a few years have passed by and
you don't have any kids yet.

521
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:29,880
So the prospect of, uh,
of having, you know,

522
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,910
a daughter out there somewhere
that I didn't know bad was,

523
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,450
was quite frankly a kind of a, a rush.

524
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,530
He called me and, um,

525
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,700
we just talked about our interests and
our personality and we started finding

526
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,540
similarities.

527
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,070
Her mother had a, requested a
blue eyed donor, which I am.

528
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,930
She has a positive blood, which
would be compatible with mine.

529
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,520
And it gets even more, uh,
Erie [inaudible] Oh gee,

530
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,550
my major in college and our cumulative
grade point average was identical.

531
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,340
She certainly could be my daughter on
many fronts because I spoke with my mother

532
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,233
at length.

533
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:17,070
She was extraordinarily excited that the
prospect of having a grandchild and she

534
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,200
prepared a place for her at a Christmas
dinner with her name on it. Wow.

535
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,690
Today they get the DNA test. Not
Exactly. They just kept waiting.

536
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,750
Probably subconsciously. I almost
didn't really want to know.

537
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,220
Right. You know, let's just not even
open up the results of the test.

538
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,490
Let's just assume that we're, it's
a match. We get along so well,

539
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:39,720
why does it matter? But at the same time,

540
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,850
we both knew that we
needed to know the truth.

541
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,100
In the end. They finally
went through with it. I mean,

542
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:47,220
it was kind of a running lottery
about, you know, what do you think?

543
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:48,690
And I was pretty, uh,

544
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,620
impressed at the fact that it was
probably going to be positive.

545
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:54,850
[inaudible]

546
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,920
the results come back from the lab and it

547
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,120
looks like yellow. It's basic information,

548
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,810
[inaudible] information about
this and that in terms of the DNA,

549
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,370
I have no idea what blue, green, gray,
pink. Then at the bottom it's, it's,

550
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,050
you know, kind of yes or no.

551
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,130
The probability equals 0%.

552
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,410
It was like 0% chance
that it was positive.

553
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,880
He wrote me and he said, I'm heartbroken.
I'm so sorry this was negative.

554
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:29,180
And um,

555
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,460
I think it took him about three or four
weeks before he felt up to speaking to

556
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:34,294
me again.

557
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,353
Yes.

558
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,950
Yeah. I mean, I've always thought
I'd be a good dad and you know, I,

559
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,580
I guess it was Kinda like,

560
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,710
it would've been kind of Nice to have
a child out there who's well adjusted,

561
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,530
a intelligent person. Yeah.

562
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,730
It's kind of all the things
you'd want your kid to be.

563
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,970
Yeah.

564
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,100
And that's what all I've made.
It's made me stop my search.

565
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,663
[inaudible]

566
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,740
[inaudible]

567
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,200
so did she stop then for the,
she does exactly the opposite.

568
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,460
I wrote every single male who went to
Baylor from 79 to 84 which is how many

569
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,600
males? 600 out of those 600,

570
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,830
250 responded. Wow. Half
of them greater back. Yeah.

571
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,910
That's so weird. Exactly.
That was exactly my reaction.

572
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,930
Weird are still, not only did they
respond, but they were very supportive.

573
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:32,490
Dear Miss Labounty,

574
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,940
you are clearly someone who thinks and
feels deeply that makes you special.

575
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,990
One guy sent me a card, you sound and
look like a remarkable young woman.

576
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:41,970
This one says, I would
claim you in a second.

577
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,760
I'm trying to read his handwriting.
Doctor's handwriting. Dear Kathleen,

578
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:48,700
I've waited 26 years to receive a
letter like this and this is man who's

579
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,960
actually a friend of mine now.
I've met him and I've met his wife.

580
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,330
This one's really sweet too.

581
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,570
Well, we'll wait about, what about that
guy at the beginning that I went, oh,

582
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,540
Dr Dan Zack. Yeah, him
even he came around.

583
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,450
As time has progressed since
I initially read the letter.

584
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,990
Now I'm almost sorry that
she's not my biologic daughter.

585
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,710
That would have been kind of
fun and have all those has,

586
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,120
has anyone else agree
to do a paternity test?

587
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,300
All told she's had 16 DNA tests

588
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,420
of the alternate negative. Every,
every test came back as negative,

589
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,960
but I still feel like I probably
have the answer in front of me.

590
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:25,310
I just don't know which
pages is [inaudible]

591
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,580
it just, it just real quick. So I
realize it's 12 now. Um, the, the song,

592
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:33,190
I don't know a few. I mean I was
just thinking about that too.

593
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,510
[inaudible] some of it.
Okay. I just need it.

594
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,840
Hello?

595
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,593
Um,

596
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,600
[inaudible]

597
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,200
well, whenever I've heard
somewhere out there,

598
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:48,120
ever since I was a kid it would remind
me of my biological father and that he's

599
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,030
out there when I was a kid.

600
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,670
Sometimes I'd look up at the
sky and I would think that I,

601
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,410
I literally know nothing about my father
except that we were both looking at the

602
00:36:58,411 --> 00:36:59,260
exact same size.

603
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,213
[inaudible]

604
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,340
yeah, that's as far as they got.
That's as far as you got. [inaudible]

605
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,190
I never learned the engine.
I'm still working on,

606
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,893
yeah,

607
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,360
that story from Ra Daniel Shapiro
and Lulu Miller, our producer,

608
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,060
time for a break. Radiolab
will continue in a moment.

609

00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,800
hello, I'm Janet. Boom, Rhonda. And
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

615
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:57,370
Our topic today is sperm
Yellow Wigley cell that uh,

616
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,280
along with male pattern baldness teams
should describe everything you need to

617
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:02,620
know about being a man. Speaking of which,

618
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,860
let's ask now one of the bigger questions
that you can ask in a show about

619
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:10,240
sperm, which is why are their
sperm, why are there men? What,

620
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,120
why are there men? This is a real
question of biological question,

621
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:16,450
which is completely baffling.
That is Steve Jones. Hello,

622
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,790
I'm professor of genetics at
University College London.

623
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,980
He wrote a book called the descent of Man,

624
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:25,981
where he speculates about how we men
got our start and why we've managed to

625
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:29,920
stick around so long. That's the
real question. Here's this theory.

626
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,460
Let's imagine ourselves in
the primordial soup. Okay.

627
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,510
3000 million years ago was actually
minestrone because it was lumpy, right?

628
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,700
And the lumps, the sounds,

629
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,410
and to reproduce these sounds,

630
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,320
what they have to do is gather up
their energy and all on their own.

631
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,490
It's split in half. [inaudible]
make copies of themselves,

632
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,900
which are more or less identical.

633
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,800
Most of the time the normal flow of events
is these cells are coming and coming

634
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:04,180
and coming. Every so often
there would be a copying error.

635
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,610
Hello, a mutation. These are
happening all the time. Hi, hello.

636
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,860
Most were harmless,

637
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,880
but not so much in the one
of these mutations cause
the cell that we saved it to

638
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,660
behave in a different way. This new cell,

639
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,600
how you do it through
the randomness of nature,

640
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:28,930
it had acquired a talent
instead of dividing on its own.

641
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,440
It figured out that it could save some
energy if it could swim up to another

642
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:36,760
cell. Hello Burrow. It's way in

643
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,260
and forced that second cell to divide.

644
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,650
By so doing, not only was
it avoiding a lot of work,

645
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,830
it was copying its own
genes at that that moment

646
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,980
males were born.

647
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:58,860
How do you, how are you [inaudible]

648
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,180
that's what you're saying is that guys
are essentially moochers like they left,

649
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,810
we got our start. According to this
theory, males began with selfishness.

650
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,260
These little cells began to mooch off
of other cells. Then they figured out,

651
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:15,440
you know, over time they could
much better if they got smaller,

652
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,240
small and faster and as mobile as they
possibly can because then they can fuse

653
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:23,270
with more and more of the other kinds
of sales and persuade them to divide.

654
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,370
So now, yeah,

655
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,030
if you want a definition that encompasses
all males everywhere from oak trees to

656
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:30,920
elephants to humans to fish,

657
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,150
there's only one real universal
definition of what it means to be male.

658
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,050
It's the sex that makes small sex sells
and often lots of them. That's it.

659
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,550
We make the small sex sells.

660
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,020
Not really is the mark of the male
having a tiny sexer meaning you,

661
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,420
me, Steve. Yeah. At the core of it,

662
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,770
our maleness is defined by these
little tiny swimming packets of genes,

663
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:56,610
what we now call sperm,
but we know we don't,

664
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,540
I don't understand if all
males are, are parasites. Yeah.

665
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,880
Yeah. But why would the female
cells allow us to do that?

666
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,230
Why don't they just say go away?

667
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,370
And that's a big question because there
are some species that have dispensed

668
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:13,580
with males altogether. Really? Yes.

669
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:16,460
The one that comes to mind is a
California Lizard, which is quite common.

670
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:17,810
It's called the whip tail lizard.

671
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:21,290
And they live in the Mojave desert and
they're all female as far as we can see

672
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,510
that I've not been no males
around for a long, long time.

673
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,130
It's kind of strange because they actually
caught each other and one female gets

674
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:29,780
on top of the other and
tries to mate with it.

675
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,280
So there's some kind of remnant of
male behavior, but that all female.

676
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,620
But how has it that, did they make little
lizards? They just produce adjuncts,

677
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:40,580
which develop into lizards. Oh,
they just don't bother with males.

678
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,510
So the baby is identical to the mommy.
So we're not gonna have a cloning here.

679
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,480
Yeah. You know, plenty of birds can do
that. I mean, chickens often lay eggs,

680
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,240
which develop and hadn't
been fertilized frogs.

681
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,850
He says there's some frogs that can
do it too. But here's the thing,

682
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,530
even though making babies without
men is green, as some scientists,

683
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:01,640
the most efficient way to do it, to
reproduce, it's still pretty rare.

684
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,900
There are very few land
vertebrates, which are all female.

685
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,570
Which brings us back
to your question, why?

686
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,790
Why do females not make
huge efforts to escape from?

687
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,440
Why are we here? Why have males
hung around this long? I mean,

688
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,120
we shouldn't be doing this program.

689
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:21,610
Somebody named Alice and someone named
Laura should be here. Hi, I'm Alice,

690
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:26,390
a boomer. I'm Laura Cro and this
is really not so fast. Ladies,

691
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,300
we're still here now. That's
for why we're still here.

692
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,830
There are tons of theories. Steve's
best guess is that, you know what?

693
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:38,480
We're not just parasites. We do offer the
ladies one thing in return. Like what?

694
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,960
Well Lulu, going back to the soupy
days at the beginning, just imagine,

695
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:48,670
says Steve, what if that's
super PC is changing?

696
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,520
Then the water's getting warmer
and the water is getting salty.

697
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,630
So let's say on one side
of the pond there's a cell
that mutates and suddenly it

698
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:58,210
can handle warm water. On the other side,

699
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:00,640
there's a cell that mutates and
suddenly it can handle salt.

700
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,150
If this is an all female world,
the warms would copy themselves.

701
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,740
Saltings would copy themselves in.

702
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Every new member of both of these tribes
would die for the waters both warm and

703
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,970
salty cause they couldn't combine
their talents. But if one of the ses,

704
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,780
salty sells as a male, how you doing?

705
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,990
Well that male can swim up to a warm,

706
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,180
he sailed do his mail and Bader thing and
then the next generation anti warm and

707
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,420
anti salt can get together.
So that's what males do.

708
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:34,680
They bring female lines together
and allow them to mix their genes.

709
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,670
And that may be,

710
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,240
that may be so important says to you that
the only time you can do without meals

711
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:44,160
is if your world is static. Wait,
what about the lizards? Yeah,

712
00:43:44,161 --> 00:43:47,730
well that's the interesting question
and I think the answer is maybe,

713
00:43:47,731 --> 00:43:50,370
and then we would kind of guesswork
here. They live out in the desert.

714
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,670
The desert doesn't change very
much. The enemy is always the same,

715
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:55,410
which is hate children's. Your food.

716
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,530
That enemy isn't something
like disease or parasites,

717
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:02,010
which are constantly evolving themselves
so they can afford to get one set of

718
00:44:02,011 --> 00:44:05,250
genes which are very effective,
clone themselves by not having sex,

719
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,540
whereas other creatures can't.

720
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,520
Does that mean you think that
if our world were like that,

721
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,100
that if we'd somehow perfected
it, that we wouldn't need men?

722
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:19,040
That's arguably true. Um,

723
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,590
and somebody does it on the doorbell now.

724
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,950
That's now still, hang on.

725
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,120
We got another bloody nuclear explosion
on the right sided Jesus Christ is

726
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:36,230
normally quite as the
grave in here. Okay, right?

727
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,120
[inaudible]

728
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,390
if we lived in a, in an unchanging
world, maybe we wouldn't need men,

729
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,690
but we don't live in a world that
doesn't change. Look at the AIDS virus.

730
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,930
Look at bird flu. They're out there.

731
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,410
They're waiting to get you and they're
going to get lots of us sooner or later

732
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,340
with a new epidemic, which
itself has changed genetically.

733
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,910
And you're going to need the males to
mix up the genes to make sure that the

734
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:06,720
whole species doesn't just
disappear. So that you know,

735
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:11,721
I think we males do for a brief moment
of quiet self-congratulation Robert,

736
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:15,900
I've never told you this, but you're a
really good guy and you are spectacular.

737
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,480
Thanks. Yeah.

738
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,320
The prospect of a world with a man seemed
remote until the invention of the deep

739
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:23,154
freeze

740
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,630
because he can freeze, burn and use it.

741
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,360
I do like blue eyes,

742
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:37,210
get that one mensa and it can be used
after that death and maybe I'm not ready

743
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,734
yet.

744
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,330
So the don't congratulate yourself that
you're always going to have a world with

745
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:44,310
men in it. You may just
have a world with freezers.

746
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,811
Steve Jones wrote the book.

747
00:45:55,811 --> 00:46:00,811
Why the descent of men moving right along
the idea of like a world without men

748
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,470
or a world where men have been replaced
by freezers. Men replaced by freezers.

749
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,410
It's sperm frozen in the speeding
freezer. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever.

750
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,200
That's frozen men. Yes.
Frozen little baby man.

751
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,110
I wanna I want to tell you a story that's
gonna wipe that smile right off your

752
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:17,980
face. Krulwich it's a, it comes
from one of our favorite reporters.

753
00:46:17,981 --> 00:46:21,700
NPRs Nell Greenfield boys.
Hello Radiolab. Hello.

754
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,040
So should I just introduce this person?
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, my name is

755
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,650
Alisha Naval Taylor. You shouldn't evil
Taylor and I live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

756
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,330
Basically. Um, I love animals. Back
in 1995, Alicia and her husband John,

757
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:40,370
were living in New York City. Uh,

758
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,730
Melson fested cheesy
little dump in park slope.

759
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,860
They were this young
couple in their thirties.

760
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,110
She was working at like a daycare center.

761
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:53,111
I did basically creative movement with
little kids under five and he was a super

762
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:58,100
in this big apartment building on the
upper east side and she and her husband

763
00:46:58,101 --> 00:47:02,780
both got some horrible flu and I can
remember laying in bed, both of n we were,

764
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,820
we flipped a quarter to see who would
go make the can of chicken noodle soup.

765
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:10,280
And I said, what would we
do if we had kids right now?

766
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,090
And I can remember laying there in
their bed and John Goes, we'd set,

767
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:19,670
we'd set that child up right there on
the floor and throw some toys down there

768
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:24,350
and we'd both lean over the
edge. I had never been so sick.

769
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,160
Did she have any idea what made them
sick? Nope. Just one of those things. And,

770
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,270
and you know she got, what
about him? He didn't get better.

771
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,020
He was throwing up cold cough.

772
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,360
Did you guys think it was
just like the flu? Yeah, we,

773
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:40,810
I mean we just thought he was getting
sicker and sicker and at some point he was

774
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:43,930
like having trouble kind of breathing.
And so Alicia was just like,

775
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:48,760
we're going to the emergency room. They
wheeled him into the emergency room.

776
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:53,740
First nurse we see, she says, oh my
God, John, why did you wait so long?

777
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,920
All of a sudden he's like in
the ICU. But it's funny though,

778
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,570
while John was in the hospital,

779
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,020
I snapped three photographs of
him was going to say to him,

780
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,300
see what you put me through, see what
they would see. Would you look like?

781
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,430
Cause I don't think he
would have ever believed,

782
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:10,960
okay,

783
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,750
how many tubes and how many
things were coming out of him.

784
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Couple of days later he had a cardiac
arrest and after that he's brain dead.

785
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,870
[inaudible]

786
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,630
and I went home that night. You know,
it's, I'm right across the street.

787
00:48:24,631 --> 00:48:29,040
I went home and I, I saw our
whole lives go right out the door.

788
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:31,590
I was, as I looked out
over that East River,

789
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,993
um,

790
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,190
I saw the kids. We weren't going to have

791
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,750
did that fear of, Oh my God,
I'm gonna lose everything.

792
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,580
And then she remembered something,

793
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,050
something that had happened about
six months before John and I had seen

794
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:48,860
something on the news hours

795
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,530
after Anthony Baez died in a
confrontation with police. He's widow,

796
00:48:52,531 --> 00:48:54,330
told her sister-in-law,
I want his [inaudible]

797
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:57,060
baby. This one day
before she went to work,

798
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,210
she had seen this report
about a man who had died,

799
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:04,890
a young man who had died and when
he was lying there in the morgue,

800
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,820
family members of his wife
actually said to the doctors,

801
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,460
is there any way that
you can save his sperm?

802
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,180
The family called in in New York hospital,

803
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,530
urologist Peter Schlegel
and Peter Schlegel and I'm
urologist and chief at New

804
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,860
York Presbyterian hospital who had
removed sperm from many men before,

805
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,160
but never a dead one. Had you
been to the morgue before? Nope.

806
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,010
It's probably not quite as clean as on TV.

807
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,250
And certainly working with
a dead body is different.

808
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,650
Schlegel says Mrs Baez would have an
excellent chance of conceiving with the

809
00:49:35,651 --> 00:49:39,610
sperm he retrieved if that's what she
decides to do. Warren Levinson, New York.

810
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:40,230
Yeah. And

811
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:44,730
I said to John, I go, wow, is that wild
or what? What do you think of that?

812
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,780
She said that John was
like in the bathroom. No,

813
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,840
I mean he was brushing
his teeth, you know,

814
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,890
in his usual rush to get off to work.
And she said to him like, if you died,

815
00:49:52,891 --> 00:49:56,940
would you be okay with me doing nice as
well? If it's really tragic, he goes,

816
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,810
go for it. Then later on she went to work.

817
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,960
Remember she works at like this daycare
kind of center [inaudible] and she

818
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:07,500
mentioned it to somebody at work and one
of the women who works there pointed to

819
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:09,930
a kid and said, you see that kid?

820
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:14,760
His father is the doctor who
removed the sperm. Wow. No kidding.

821
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,560
And so she's remembering all of
this. Six months later, I would,

822
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,560
oh, that little boy, his dad, you know,
her husband is brain dead at this point.

823
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:30,650
And what she decides to do is go to
work and find the name of that kid whose

824
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:34,790
father had taken the sperm. So you
pick up the phone and [inaudible]

825
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,720
got an appointment with him right away.

826
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,980
That Wednesday I went and saw Peter
Schlagel and they had Thursday John,

827
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,420
he died around six o'clock.

828
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,973
Sorry,

829
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,150
I'm really sorry.

830
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,710
Oh wait, we're best friends.

831
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,950
A team came in to his
room. She waited outside.

832
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,620
What do you actually need
to do a procedure like this?

833
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:19,080
Basically a vasectomy cat. They take
a needle, put it into the man's body.

834
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,440
One of the richest sources
of sperm would be the vast,

835
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:26,400
the tube that normally carries sperm
from the area around the testicles to the

836
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:27,600
ejaculate Teri regions.

837
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,800
They literally put the needle into
that too and suck the sperm out.

838
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:36,830
So you're left with a little one inch
tall conical tube that has tens of

839
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,590
millions or maybe even hundreds
of millions of sperm within it.

840
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,530
[inaudible],

841
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:48,440
you know, I can't help but
ask myself the question.

842
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,600
Well maybe I'll just ask you,
would you do this? Absolutely.

843
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,920
Really no question in my mind.
So I've been married eight years,

844
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,300
I don't have children.

845
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:02,920
I want to have children with my husband
and if he died I would absolutely do it.

846
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,580
And no ethicist at a hospital is going
to be able to tell me no because I got my

847
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,830
husband to put it in his will. Why?

848
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,190
So that there would be no question if he
died that I would have permission to do

849
00:52:12,191 --> 00:52:14,590
this. But why are you so
certain? Isn't that partying?

850
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,990
It's a little hesitant about
it. W what it really means.

851
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,200
What would it really mean? I
don't know that you're somehow,

852
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,220
I mean at the very least a kid without
a dad and also like the kid would have

853
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:28,360
your husband's eyes and his nose and his
ears and so he would be kinda like an

854
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:33,040
echo of him or reminder. There is
nothing that I would want more honestly.

855
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:36,910
I mean, you know, if my husband died,
there was nothing I would want more than,

856
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,530
than a child of his. But
you know, Peter Schlegel,

857
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,060
what Peter Schlegel told me

858
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,340
is that in most cases
women do not use the sport.

859
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:50,000
Women will not go forward and use
those farms. Really? They collect it,

860
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,950
time passes, maybe they meet someone else
and decide to move on with their life.

861
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,030
That's interesting. And what about
Leisha? Did she, uh, did she move on?

862
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,850
Well, no. If I,

863
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,260
if I was standing at 70 and
looking back at my life,

864
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,590
then I'd have to kick
myself. If I didn't do this,

865
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:14,640
it would have been out of fear that I
didn't because everybody kind of looks at

866
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:19,140
it like, God, that's so weird. That's
what are you going to tell this kid? Oh,

867
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:22,080
you came from somebody's dad.

868
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,720
How would you explain this to
your child and simply will the,

869
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,050
with the truth. I loved
your father. He died.

870
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:35,970
I saved us from post-mortem so that
I could bring you into the world.

871
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,170
You are indeed a part of him
and you are indeed a part of me.

872
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,110
After John Died, she moved back to
Wisconsin and she waited for awhile.

873
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,010
Her life was moving on. She had
relationships with other people,

874
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,130
but she didn't let go
of the idea. Finally,

875
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:55,820
six years after her husband died, she
decided that she was going to do it.

876
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,300
I think it really came down to me making
a decision about doing it on my own.

877
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:00,611
You know,

878
00:54:00,611 --> 00:54:04,180
she called and she made an appointment
at a fertility clinic back in New York.

879
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:09,190
I had gone out in September
like the day before the um,

880
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,900
planes flew into the
World Trade Center and

881
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,960
the city felt some Felicia,

882
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,310
it seemed like signs were
everywhere. Signs of fate. I guess.

883
00:54:21,311 --> 00:54:25,200
There was just such a big part in
the coincidences. Like what, what was

884
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:30,320
pretty amazing in that the in vitro
center was in the building or John and I

885
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:33,990
made love, I mean it was in that building,

886
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,261
you know,

887
00:54:34,261 --> 00:54:37,230
the doctor's office where she was getting
the fertility treatments were in her

888
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:41,390
old building. It was such a coincidence
that she'd even seen that news report.

889
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,070
The fact that it was the doctors,

890
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:47,640
little boy I was teaching
her cat died, you know,

891
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,790
while she was in New York and she sort
of had this idea that with this death,

892
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,110
this life comes, things were were dying,
but there was going to be new life.

893
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,973
I had all these

894
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,680
zag sudden the chances of
it working were really big.

895
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,410
I was for sure going to get pregnant,

896
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,430
you know, all of these
things just came together.

897
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:08,650
So that felt natural and right.

898
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:13,710
A fertility clinic technician thought
this frozen six year old sperm injected it

899
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:16,300
into the eggs and then they waited.

900
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,600
I mean had you like gotten
nursery stuff ready and stuff?

901
00:55:19,601 --> 00:55:22,120
Like were you at that point
level of certainty gone out

902
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,990
shocked and yeah, I,

903
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,780
I had it all picked out,

904
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,610
but none of the eggs fertilized, none.

905
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,910
None.

906
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,990
It was like another death. I mean it
was just, it was like another death.

907
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,230
She had told me

908
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:47,650
that she had John Cremated and that
she had sort of half of his ashes,

909
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,850
I'm still in her house and that she didn't
know really what she was going to do

910
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:54,610
with them, that she knew at some point
she had to scatter them or something,

911
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:57,850
but she hadn't really worked out a plan.
And you know, I pointed out that, well,

912
00:55:57,851 --> 00:55:59,950
she's got the sperm store too. Like,

913
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,980
do you think that that's something that
you want to somehow do something with or

914
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,610
will it be there forever

915
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,430
until there's a power outage
now? Just, I'm so cynical. Um,

916
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,430
it doesn't amount to anything.

917
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:24,040
It's, it's the, the thing
that's there that isn't,

918
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,650
it's like the chair. It's,

919
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:31,120
it's not who he is or was.

920
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:45,810
[inaudible]

921
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,130
no greenfield boys. Thanks to her.

922
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:51,120
