00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.840
 in this capsule we will see 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.840
 the iteration algorithm by policy 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.040
 so we saw previously that exists a 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.889
 first iteration algorithms by value 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.890
 to find the optimal plan of a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.869
 hearing process brand returns and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.810
 now we will see another 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 iteration algorithm by policy which 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 unlike iteration by value or 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.539
 at each iteration updates the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.670
 values ​​of the optimal plan we are trying to 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.050
 find interesting by their politics 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 at each iteration will change 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.460
 explicitly the politics we are in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.360
 city ​​train but the optimal policy 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 that we are looking for and so it's going to be a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.829
 algorithm that in the same way like 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.210
 value is very young will find the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.129
 optimal policy but whose 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.800
 unfolding will be different here's 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.890
 the algorithm so in this case also to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.010
 each iteration cpu vector of or a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.199
 table of value for a pole and the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.120
 implicit policy that have reached by 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.949
 esteemed as in valeo and regions 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.250
 who's going to change it's really a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.110
 worse politics or a plan we're going 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 update and we see improved 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.830
 from one iteration to another so what we 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.140
 will do what we will initialize a plan 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.990
 the plane pip rim arbitrarily 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 random way and there we will repeat 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 several steps until convergence 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.619
 enough until we do not succeed 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.619
 to improve our policy that premium 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.189
 by a new policy 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.750
 and when we actually do it is that good 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.759
 firstly we start by assigning 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.850
 pipart our current policy which 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.329
 premium is what we will do is that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.450
 for all states as a whole 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.930
 big s i'm going to calculate what is the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.020
 value of the plan worse by solving the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.899
 associated equations 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.700
 to the recursive definition of value 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.289
 of a plan so here we have the definition 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.640
 recursive the value of a plan so that's 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.759
 what we saw before the value 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.899
 of a plan c a state s this is the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.290
 reward in s 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.420
 the more the discount rate times the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.680
 future reward hope but that actually 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.830
 it's basically a system with 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.019
 number of states equation that contains 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.170
 number of states unknown so this is a 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.739
 linear system that can be solved 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.450
 with the day m so we solve these 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.150
 equations let there this gives us all 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.140
 values ​​vépy two aces for our 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.890
 policy which is then for all 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.510
 states in my state set I 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.040
 will see if he responds new actions 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.950
 that I could take that would 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.860
 better than the current action in pi 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.209
 is actually a way to finish 6th not 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.900
 better action is to see is this 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.180
 that for every small state is that 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.220
 the value associated with seurre that I esteem 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.780
 is here with my system of equations 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.819
 linear 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.010
 is not lower than the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.069
 value that I would get if I took 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.319
 another action 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.239
 and if I assumed that I already had a 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.239
 good estimate of my values ​​for 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.069
 other states and this bonus so more 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.720
 exactly what I'm going to do is 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.310
 that for every state is that I'm going to see 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.440
 what is the associated value that I 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.700
 just calculate and I'll see what that 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.560
 it's actually smaller than the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.569
 reward in s plus 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.650
 lotto of this tale once the reward 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.569
 future hope for another action that 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.480
 the action pi 2 s 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.310
 and if there is a better action 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.950
 according to this criterion there but worse of s 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.780
 Wife time is associated with this action 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.450
 otherwise i will keep then premium of s i 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.489
 I will keep it so that this 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.389
 either my action pi 2 s i'm not going 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.970
 switch 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.620
 the associated action and which I continued 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.430
 interests like that until no 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.340
 actions for any of the stoles do not 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.680
 so change mme hamon 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.930
 complete plan does not change and at this 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.989
 moment I'm coming out of my loop here and I 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.660
 return the policy then or the plan 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:19.400
 then let's see an example of a 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.449
 simulation of the execution of paris six 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.880
 regions have defined an initial plan that 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.720
 will be at eze and red at cécile axes 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.850
 of smell action to the state is this a gesture 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.669
 also the two-state action and the state is 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.540
 I associate the action with 4 so it's distri 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:43.850
 cipav the color of the sagging 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.320
 so that I'm going to update the little 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.530
 graphic according to the policy 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:55.280
 or current clan and logitech 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.789
 so I said who will become then 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.830
 premium 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.260
 and here I build my system 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.590
 of equations so the system of equations 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:08.570
 the value in s 0 what is it one 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:12.380
 compensates in 06 and 0 plus the factor d 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.080
 second time the future reward hope 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.750
 associated with the current action the action 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.680
 current zero co2 that makes me return 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.250
 on f zero so that will be increased by 1 of 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.580
 stay at 0 times the value 0 which the 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.280
 proven reserves variable 1 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.960
 the sausage action and where is simple to 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.849
 relations relations action associates co2 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.240
 and so we go where the equation booth v1 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.610
 was gala award to a 5-0 plus the 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.460
 second time factor with a priority 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:52.580
 of a I agree 13-0 that a value 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:55.400
 0 then for v2 action 6 to 4 which 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.950
 pass from 2 es2 to es7 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.349
 with a parity 1 so I like 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.650
 equation v2 is equal to 1 since that's 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:06.650
 the reward in s2 plus 0.5 times a 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.289
 weight revised and so it turns out that the 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.610
 solution to these systems of equations 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.030
 the acv 0 is equal to zero 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.830
 v is zero and v2 tigana if I 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.680
 replaces v0 per hour 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.590
 is zero then v2 is equal to one 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.510
 same thing here to do you can 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.720
 check but actually I have equality 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.830
 to the left and to the right 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.750
 so I solved the system of equations 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.300
 and when I do it later 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.640
 that I check for each of the states s 0 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.890
 s1 and s2 if open better actions 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.780
 so learn the current mans 1 0 I do 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.720
 the action to both I will see if 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.880
 action in europe in the best sense i 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.000
 was doing the action in two 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.830
 games here at 3 and promises a 15-2 I 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.940
 did the action at 4 currently know 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:59.810
 if at 5-5 6 would not be but so is this 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:02.970
 which here is the value associated with 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.010
 if I took action at 1 and that 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.880
 I used my values ​​my 0 v1 v2 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:12.990
 as the valuation of values 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:15.540
 so of the value of the plan so if I 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.730
 do at 1 from scratch I'm going to have 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.340
 a reward of zero since 0 the 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:24.240
 reward is zero plus the factor d 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:27.210
 second time this time 0.2 so if 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.630
 I'm doing to a young neighbor here I talked 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:36.210
 from 0.22 stayed at 11 00 points twice 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:38.370
 targeted rookie is equal to zero + 0.8 he 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.920
 did not have the idea to spend 2 m 01 s as well 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:45.030
 bedside the action at 1 times the value 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:47.550
 associated with saint who lv1 and v1 was 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.330
 hardly currently is estimated at 0 so 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:53.310
 I have zero here it gives a value of 0 0 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.230
 it's not bigger than the value that 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.270
 I had previously estimated for zero 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.120
 so I have no reason to change 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.190
 action against if I do it for 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.710
 the state is healthy 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:07.650
 so with the action at 3 instead of jaude 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:10.830
 2 I will have a reward of zero 

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:14.190
 plus the factor and second time one who 

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:16.890
 the probability if I make 3.2 me returns 

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:19.890
 at s2 it's proof it's a part 

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:23.700
 of an airlock think train 2 if I do 

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:29.230
 the action at 3 so once the value 

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:32.020
 currently esteem for s2 so there 

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.820
 v2 which is the value associated with s2 and that 

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.940
 currently it is estimated at 1 so I 

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:40.690
 one here so if I did zero plus zero 

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.970
 point 5 x 1 x 1 it gives me 0.5 ski 

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.340
 strictly larger than 0 which was 

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:49.930
 the currently estimated value for v1 

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:56.170
 it's worth to this or full where I 

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:58.720
 do 1 2 1 1 0 2 1 then in 4.1 s 2 so 

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.510
 I just found that the action at 3 would 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.260
 better than the action smells 1 and will be 

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:08.080
 so the action will change I will put 

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.490
 my plan for the state is healthy 

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.070
 for the field 

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:14.170
 now my new plan is going to take 

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.780
 as action at 3 and if I do 

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.280
 exactly the same but to love 

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.900
 in s2 that I look 

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.510
 would autsai not be a 

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:26.620
 best action i'm going to get a 

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:28.930
 1.5 reward estimate at s2 

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.750
 plus the second time factor the 

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.390
 future reward hope based on my 

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:37.830
 estimate of the values ​​of the rewards 

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:41.770
 future hope here crime worth future 

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:44.520
 so that gives me 1.5 which is fatter 

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:49.530
 that 1 which was the value currently 

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:53.560
 estimated for my current plan in the state 

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:56.020
 s2 is so again a s2 I 

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.550
 will have an earlier action at 5 

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.200
 since it seems to be a better 

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:03.790
 action 

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:05.350
 given these tests the here and I 

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:09.000
 go on like this so now the 

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:12.670
 policy is different in v1 state 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.230
 next this is your s2 since 

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.730
 now I'm doing the action at 3 so my 

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.470
 system of equations change it if 

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.230
 now I'm going 2.6 up to have 

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:22.930
 0 as it was the case before then 

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.210
 same thing here before I had one for 

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.730
 the equation associated with themselves 

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.410
 and at gb2 since in front of the action at 

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.770
 the one that is the action I take 

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:36.280
 now that at choice s 2 I stay s2 

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:38.209
 so I did two here and if I do 

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.709
 exactly the same test here 

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:41.149
 I could not improve the actions 

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:43.429
 in this case also the action that I can 

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:47.569
 improve his series s 0 I find he 

00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:50.809
 takes 1 will be better than the action 

00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:55.040
 current that was 2 so I'm going 

00:10:50.809 --> 00:11:00.110
 change to 0 but decision it's going to be 

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:02.059
 take action so my system 

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.009
 of equations changes again we see that 

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:05.720
 now to aim for the system 

00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:08.959
 of equations have changed since the action 

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:11.029
 in 0 changed to now we go where 0.2 

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:14.059
 times life zero because if i do 

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:19.009
 action to a chimpanzee 0.12 to stay at 

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:22.730
 0 then 0.8 times the value of the 

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:26.569
 neurons at s1 from scratch that's 

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:29.059
 0.86 I do the action and the subject redone 

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:31.819
 the test so if I compare now if 

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:33.649
 I took smell instead for s 0 to 2 

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:37.369
 instead for essen then at 4 at the 

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:39.559
 place for s2 I observe that it is paul 

00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:42.259
 cox is not the same but the action so 

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:44.600
 I do not change the action taken for his 

00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:47.240
 three stars so I converge I have 

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.470
 found my plan optima their brands 

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.600
 actually it's the same dish we 

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:54.879
 had found with a terrace you by 

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.879
 value in the chair capsule 

00:11:55.749 --> 00:12:00.079
 no i'm going to do a reminder about how 

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.069
 solve systems of equations 

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:05.509
 linear 

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:07.699
 so we have an example if the system 

00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:09.410
 of linear equations we had at the 

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:12.889
 last iteration of policemen their 

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:14.569
 region to solve it 

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:16.850
 what we do we do what we do 

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:18.559
 learned to swim come to know that one 

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.389
 can put all the constants to the left 

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:22.519
 then kept all the variables right 

00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:25.100
 when I did here private jets 0 then 

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:28.540
 I suck them very right what makes 

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:33.679
 that I'm going to see so if I 0.5 point 

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:36.920
 0.2 since in 0 point 1 - 1 then 

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:39.230
 minus 0.9 as the factor that 

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.499
 multiply the heroes and for v1 it's 

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:44.899
 just his drummer 0.5 point 0.8 so 

00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:46.370
 0.15 so I do the same thing with 

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:48.139
 this equation if ai this equation 

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.220
 here I take the variables are at 

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:51.220
 left the state to his right 

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.810
 and with this system of equations there it is 

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.760
 easy from equation 3 to deduce 

00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:05.200
 the value of v2 it's going to be just 

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:07.530
 minus 1 / - 0.5 so 2 from 

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:12.790
 equation 2 but as long as I know the 

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:18.010
 value of both I can replace here v2 

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:22.090
 bar its estimated value ie 2 so 

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:25.720
 I'm going to get that so jean see two 

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:27.910
 times 0.5 so one and so I'm going to have 

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.730
 punctured one that i can transfer silva 

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:37.930
 is zero point 5 x 2 so a game 

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:39.730
 well that some is equal to 1 and 

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:43.030
 finally the equation I replace here 

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:45.880
 by a jld rap place there is no d2 

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:49.020
 reminded those of perfumes 1 

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:53.650
 I can then deduce that v 0 galas 

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:57.400
 0.4 pepper and a 10 0 points 9 had a 

00:13:53.650 --> 00:14:00.670
 equal to 1 that's going me 4 out of 9 for 

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:03.850
 0 so that would be the procedure was getting done 

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:05.110
 in the hand would be a way to solve 

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.490
 but in what it's actually it's a 

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:11.920
 system of equations that was pretty 

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:15.339
 simple but obviously in practice we will 

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.750
 do that with computers so 

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:20.320
 often we do what we will do is 

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:23.170
 that we are going to do this writing of our 

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.710
 system of linear equations or to see 

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.720
 we will see here a vector and then 

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.110
 we will actually have our variables all to 

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.790
 right 

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.490
 now he's going to write it under a 

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:36.339
 matrix form or bva correspond 

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:40.960
 to the constants vectors here a level 

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:42.580
 correspondent - 0 0 i will have seen here 

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.740
 that your only it's really 

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.190
 vector of my values ​​for all 

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.990
 states of the zeros v1 v2 and finally I 

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:53.620
 matrix rebates that will match the 

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:56.080
 coefficient here on the variables of my 

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.940
 system of equations so in this water 

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:03.220
 if we would have the first row of 

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:03.760
 the supply - 0.9 0.4 which multiplied 1.0 

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.540
 which ... me 

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:10.280
 d2 as if I had zero x v10 here 

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.620
 second line as if I had zero x 

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:18.400
 had zero since 0 and not in 

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:22.330
 the equation too - hours here 0.5 here 

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.860
 Institute is raining in the rows 00 - 0.5 

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:28.090
 it is claimed that I write them under this 

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.020
 form there I will be able to actually call 

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.190
 bookstore that will allow me to 

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:36.860
 solve the system of equations 

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:39.310
 linear so for example we could 

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:43.000
 do it with a similar man in python 

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:45.290
 so I will create a matrix named straw 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.700
 because this congress the matrix so first 

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.460
 row here 

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.710
 second row third row that's me 

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.650
 would give the vector raymond matrix 

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:57.320
 of constants that would be 10 00 - 

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.690
 hours and then now to estimate v 

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.820
 that would just correspond to take my 

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:04.010
 vector of constants b then the multi 

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.020
 who on the left speak reverse of the 

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.930
 not matrix so I need to reverse 

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:12.770
 alas I can use the module line 

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:15.590
 algae in straw that have a method 

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.840
 an imf function that allows to invert 

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.970
 a sum matrix gives innovative 

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.310
 inverted and then of sum stays longer 

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:25.010
 than to ask the function equips for 

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:27.530
 multiply linverse by b what will me 

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:30.620
 give my life estimate so if I 

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:34.600
 prints them I do get 4 on 

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:37.130
 So that's because we 4 out of 9 1 and 2 

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.150
 as we had calculated by hand 

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.740
 previously 

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.080
 so that would be the business procedure 

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.250
 are wanted to solve a system 

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.080
 of linear equations but 

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:48.650
 automatically in this case also with 

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.530
 python and so that's it 

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:53.420
 the information we need to 

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.870
 execute the iteration algorithm by 

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.870
 policy
