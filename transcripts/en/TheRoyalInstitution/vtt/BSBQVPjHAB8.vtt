00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.290
 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.480
We, for a very long time, have
thought that if we had found

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.120
the secrets of DNA, we could
find the secret of life.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.090
We would be able to know exactly
everything about that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.700
human being, because all the
information should be encoded

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.265
in the genome.

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:30.780
It's the blueprint of life.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.800
Unfortunately, we still don't
know exactly how those four

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.520
letters' combinations
make everything that

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.700
we see around us.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.390
So DNA sequence, the genome,
is not the whole answer.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.610
And chromosome 11 has helped us
to understand that there is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.080
something else besides the
sequence of the bases on the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.260
DNA that is important for the
expression of these genes.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.090
Now if we think about what
happens when a child is born,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.840
then you have one of these
little arms that comes from

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.820
the mother and one of
these arms that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.200
comes from the father.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.300
They come together, and they
have in exactly the same

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.030
positions exactly
the same genes.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.620
We usually always have two
copies of the same gene.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.020
And for the most part, they
are always both working.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.420
But there are a few
exceptions.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.576
One of them is chromosome 11.

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:25.120
One needs to be on, and the
other needs to be off.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.470
And the mechanism that makes
this copy silent is what

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.710
interests me.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.520
It's called an epigenetic
mechanism.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.220
It's a way by which the sequence
of the DNA that is

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.420
there, although intact, not
changed, is just marked in a

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.540
special way with what we
call epigenetic marks.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.140
And those marks tell that
sequence not to be

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.820
read, not to be on.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.810
And that means that you can have
exactly the same DNA in

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.350
two cells, as we do, and the
same sequence being expressed

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.740
in one cell and not being
expressed in another cell,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100
making those two cells
different, although they have

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.440
exactly the same information,
exactly the same blueprint.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.260
What creates this opportunity
is what we call epigenetics.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.270
If you think about the DNA, all
the bases of the DNA, as

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.750
the letters in a book, if you
have just the letters, if you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.010
have no punctuation marks, no
spaces between the words, you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.820
really don't know how
to read that page.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.930
Without the emphasis, without
the pauses when you read a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.430
text, you still cannot get
the full meaning of

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.290
what's going on.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.380
So epigenetics gives a layer
of understanding, of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.850
interpretation, of the
underlying genetic code or

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.870
genome that we all have.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.530
In the case of chromosome 11,
it's quite obvious that it is

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.810
important to have the epigenetic
marks in the right

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.930
place at the right time, because
it gives you a very

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750
serious syndrome if you don't.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.750
So there are some examples that
seem to show that the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.260
environment can affect
epigenetic marks in a quite

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.610
enduring and long term way.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.990
One example is nutrition.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.680
So the abundance of food for a
period of time can have a big

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.900
influence in the expression
of certain genes.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.820
And that is usually controlled
by epigenetic marks.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.690
This can then stay as a
memory of that event.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.570
And they can be passed on to our
children, and probably to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.680
our children's children
as well.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.780
So chromosome 11 was and is a
very important tool still to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.450
study how these epigenetic
modifications can actually

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.250
control the expression
of genes.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.046
And the future will tell where
this will take us.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:04:06.896
