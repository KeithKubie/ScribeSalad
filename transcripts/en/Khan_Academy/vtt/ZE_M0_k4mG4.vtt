00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:01.817
- [Voiceover] All right, so
we've been talking about the

00:00:01.817 --> 00:00:04.889
later stages of the American Civil War,

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.089
and in the last videos,

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.696
we talked about the Battle of Gettysburg

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:12.187
and the Gettysburg
Address, which happened in

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:13.520
November of 1863

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:18.746
as Abraham Lincoln went to the site

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:21.989
of the Battle of Gettysburg
to dedicate the cemetery

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.246
that was being built there

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.546
to hold the battlefield dead,

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:28.213
which numbered in the thousands.

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:31.901
In the next few videos,

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:35.235
I'd like to take you
through the last stages

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.652
of the Civil War starting with late 1863.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.605
If you think back to the
very beginning of the war,

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:47.137
the North strategy was
called the Anaconda Plan.

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:51.304
The Anaconda is a kind of snake
that squeezes its victims,

00:00:52.342 --> 00:00:55.517
so the plan of the North was
gonna be to squeeze the South

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:57.929
by completely surrounding it

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.227
and then not allowing
anything to get in or out.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.527
So, the South would have no choice

00:01:02.527 --> 00:01:05.212
but to surrender as they
ran out of supplies.

00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:08.712
So, the Anaconda Plan is going fairly well

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.237
in this late period of the war.

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:14.451
So, now you recall that

00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:16.701
they were going to blockade

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:21.118
the Atlantic Ocean

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:23.701
so that the South couldn't ship

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:29.018
any of its cotton or receive
any supplies from Europe,

00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:30.484
so that's not happening,

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:33.634
and, to take control of
the Mississippi River,

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:35.744
which goes here, doo, doo, doo.

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:38.523
So, the other reason why
Abraham Lincoln was so happy

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:40.861
after the North won the
Battle of Gettysburg

00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:44.867
is because Ulysses S. Grant
had just taken Vicksburg,

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:47.356
which meant that the Union had control

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:48.189
of the Mississippi River,

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.522
so you can see that the plan

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:55.712
to surround the South
is going pretty well.

00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:59.879
This blockade extended all
the way down around Florida.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.257
The last real area here that
the Union needs to control

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:08.549
is this sort of middle region here.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.700
You know that these are the border states,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.237
so there's still slavery
allowed in places like

00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:17.992
Kentucky and Tennessee and Maryland,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.889
and another thing that's kind
of hard to see from this map

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.008
is that there are mountains here.

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.367
This is the Appalachian
Mountain Range, and so this is

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:30.595
gonna be a difficult area
to strategize through.

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:32.373
So, thanks to this mountain range,

00:02:32.373 --> 00:02:35.658
there are two real main theaters of war

00:02:35.658 --> 00:02:36.781
during the Civil War.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.193
There's the Eastern Theater of the war,

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.342
which is over here,

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:43.965
and that includes a
lot of the battles that

00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:48.461
are gonna take place in
the Shenandoah Valley area

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:52.268
of Virginia, and through Georgia, so

00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:57.025
kind of the tidewater
Piedmont region of the East

00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:59.820
is one of the main areas
where battle takes place

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.959
during this Civil War.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.173
But the other theater
is this Western Theater,

00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:07.422
and that includes the Mississippi River

00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:11.826
and these key border states
of Kentucky and Tennessee.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:15.284
When last we left off with
the Battle of Gettysburg,

00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:18.382
Robert E. Lee, who's the
commander of the Armies

00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:22.465
for the Confederacy had
made an attempt to invade

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.033
the North and got as far
as southern Pennsylvania

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:28.866
where the Union troops

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:32.551
led by General George Meade

00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:36.290
turned the Confederates away and so now,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.748
they're headed back to Virginia.

00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:42.027
There's gonna be some
really fierce fighting here

00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:43.838
in this northern part of Virginia

00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:46.505
known as the Wilderness Campaign

00:03:49.978 --> 00:03:52.311
as Lee retreats to Richmond.

00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:56.846
That's the Eastern Theater,

00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:59.849
and I'll draw the blue line
that's gonna be following them

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:00.932
here as well.

00:04:04.607 --> 00:04:06.997
Now in the Western Theater of the war,

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.330
Ulysses S. Grant

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.746
has just provided a
major victory by taking

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:18.520
Vicksburg, and now controlling
all of the Mississippi River.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.802
Abraham Lincoln has been
looking for a great general

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:24.477
to lead his armies,

00:04:24.477 --> 00:04:27.803
Now, Lee has been the commander
of the Confederate armies

00:04:27.803 --> 00:04:30.942
this entire time, but
the Union army has had

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:35.093
a multitude of commanders
from Winfield Scott

00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:39.056
to George McClellan,
but in Ulysses S. Grant,

00:04:39.056 --> 00:04:41.485
Lincoln finally finds his general.

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:46.192
So, after the victory at
the Siege of Vicksburg,

00:04:46.192 --> 00:04:48.525
Grant goes up into Tennessee

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:53.546
and finally captures Tennessee.

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:57.725
He takes Chattanooga and
firmly puts Tennessee

00:04:57.725 --> 00:04:59.495
in control of the Union.

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:02.610
So, look how well the Anaconda
strategy is going now.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.668
We've got Tennessee, we're almost there.

00:05:04.668 --> 00:05:07.830
After taking Chattanooga,
Lincoln makes Grant

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.194
the commander of all the Union armies.

00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:12.648
He is the General in Chief,

00:05:12.648 --> 00:05:14.090
and it's going to be Grant who

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.885
ultimately leads the Union to victory

00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:21.223
and when he meets up
with Lee, as he will do

00:05:21.223 --> 00:05:25.785
once he heads to Richmond
and then later Appomattox,

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:28.223
he's going to be the one
who really ends the war

00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:29.818
by forcing Lee's surrender.

00:05:29.818 --> 00:05:31.051
But we'll get to that.

00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:35.104
So that's 1863, the period at which Grant

00:05:35.104 --> 00:05:37.155
becomes Commander of the Armies,

00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:40.353
Lee is turned away from his
second invasion of the north

00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:42.130
and flees to Richmond,

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.463
and the stage is set for the final year,

00:05:46.362 --> 00:05:48.932
and little bit more of the war,

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.733
which we'll get to in the next video.
