outcome it seems to me so let's say

outcome it seems to me so let's say
 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.180
outcome it seems to me so let's say
someone tests out at an IQ of around 115

you might make one bang-up plumber and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
you might make one bang-up plumber and
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.929
you might make one bang-up plumber and
you can have a spectacularly successful

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
you can have a spectacularly successful
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730
you can have a spectacularly successful
career as a plumber and maybe as a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
manager of other plumbers and all of
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.539
manager of other plumbers and all of
that and you know and I mean I actually

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
that and you know and I mean I actually
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520
that and you know and I mean I actually
happen to be a real aficionado of the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
happen to be a real aficionado of the
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230
happen to be a real aficionado of the
trade so I certainly don't think of that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
trade so I certainly don't think of that
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.969
trade so I certainly don't think of that
as something that's a that's a low

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
as something that's a that's a low
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219
as something that's a that's a low
quality or low status occupation in the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
quality or low status occupation in the
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.039
quality or low status occupation in the
least but we would we would like to tell

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
least but we would we would like to tell
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.140
least but we would we would like to tell
people okay here's here's here's a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
people okay here's here's here's a
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330

here's an intellectual domain that's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
here's an intellectual domain that's
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399
here's an intellectual domain that's
probably too high for you to be

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
probably too high for you to be
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.560
probably too high for you to be
successful without working insane hours

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
successful without working insane hours
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.350
successful without working insane hours
to to to to close the gap because you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
to to to to close the gap because you
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.240
to to to to close the gap because you
can do that with insane work up to some

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
can do that with insane work up to some
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.700
can do that with insane work up to some
some limited degree but it seems to me

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
some limited degree but it seems to me
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530
some limited degree but it seems to me
that the logical thing to do at least in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
that the logical thing to do at least in
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.929
that the logical thing to do at least in
part is to give people a sense of what

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
part is to give people a sense of what
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.300
part is to give people a sense of what
their advantages and limitations are and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
their advantages and limitations are and
 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.300
their advantages and limitations are and
then say to them okay well given that

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
then say to them okay well given that
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.770
then say to them okay well given that
here is a place that you could go where

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
here is a place that you could go where
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.100
here is a place that you could go where
you could be optimally successful and so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
you could be optimally successful and so
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.929
you could be optimally successful and so
you know that's kind of my take from a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
you know that's kind of my take from a
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209
you know that's kind of my take from a
policy perspective let's say but like

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
policy perspective let's say but like
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.280
policy perspective let's say but like
what have you thought about you know the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
what have you thought about you know the
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.319
what have you thought about you know the
massive diversity and intellectual

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
massive diversity and intellectual
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789
massive diversity and intellectual
ability I mean what are the implications

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
ability I mean what are the implications
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.070
ability I mean what are the implications
from a policy perspective as far as

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
from a policy perspective as far as
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.309
from a policy perspective as far as
you're concerned why

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319
you're concerned why
 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.470
you're concerned why
occasional guidance is clearly one I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480
occasional guidance is clearly one I
 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.539
occasional guidance is clearly one I
actually did some consulting and some

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549
actually did some consulting and some
 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.479
actually did some consulting and some
research for a nonprofit group called

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489
research for a nonprofit group called
 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.110
research for a nonprofit group called
the Johnson O'Connor Foundation which is

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
the Johnson O'Connor Foundation which is
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.209
the Johnson O'Connor Foundation which is
vocational and testing they're not that

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219
vocational and testing they're not that
 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.399
vocational and testing they're not that
big on G but they have the only battery

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409
big on G but they have the only battery
 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.839
big on G but they have the only battery
of tests they bring someone in and do a

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849
of tests they bring someone in and do a
 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.660
of tests they bring someone in and do a
full day of cognitive tests and from

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
full day of cognitive tests and from
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.780
full day of cognitive tests and from
that they give some advice about what

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
that they give some advice about what
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.809
that they give some advice about what
kinds of professions match their

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819
kinds of professions match their
 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.750
kinds of professions match their
cognitive strengths and weaknesses and I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760
cognitive strengths and weaknesses and I
 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.509
cognitive strengths and weaknesses and I
actually did some brain imaging on their

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519
actually did some brain imaging on their
 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.250
actually did some brain imaging on their
tests and was very interesting stuff you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260
tests and was very interesting stuff you
 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.099
tests and was very interesting stuff you
think because it's hard to do the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109
think because it's hard to do the
 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.110
think because it's hard to do the
psychometrics properly with regards to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120
psychometrics properly with regards to
 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.259
psychometrics properly with regards to
vocational guidance because we don't

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269
vocational guidance because we don't
 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.819
vocational guidance because we don't
really know we don't have a good handle

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829
really know we don't have a good handle
 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.459
really know we don't have a good handle
on how to classify jobs into their

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469
on how to classify jobs into their
 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.409
on how to classify jobs into their
various subtypes like John Holland has

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419
various subtypes like John Holland has
 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.449
various subtypes like John Holland has
done some good work doing that but but

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459
done some good work doing that but but
 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.459
done some good work doing that but but
there's so many jobs and it's hard to

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469
there's so many jobs and it's hard to
 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.159
there's so many jobs and it's hard to
figure out what makes two jobs the same

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169
figure out what makes two jobs the same
 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.800
figure out what makes two jobs the same
or similar you know no I was at Hopkins

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810
or similar you know no I was at Hopkins
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.599
or similar you know no I was at Hopkins
when Holland was there and some of my

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609
when Holland was there and some of my
 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.640
when Holland was there and some of my
friends with graduate students worked

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
friends with graduate students worked
 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.129
friends with graduate students worked
for him and I learned all about that

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139
for him and I learned all about that
 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.929
for him and I learned all about that
vocational testing it's very powerful

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939
vocational testing it's very powerful
 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.589
vocational testing it's very powerful
and as you know it's that's more of his

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599
and as you know it's that's more of his
 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.009
and as you know it's that's more of his
scales that kind of morphed into more

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019
scales that kind of morphed into more
 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.849
scales that kind of morphed into more
personality like dementia yeah that's

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859
personality like dementia yeah that's
 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.559
personality like dementia yeah that's
exactly the Nexus that we want to play

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569
exactly the Nexus that we want to play
 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.809
exactly the Nexus that we want to play
out it's like okay because there is a

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819
out it's like okay because there is a
 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.490
out it's like okay because there is a
reason I know people have been mapping
