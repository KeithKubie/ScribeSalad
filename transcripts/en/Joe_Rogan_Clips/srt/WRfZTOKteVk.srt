1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,950
You believe in Ufos? Oh yeah. Oh my
God. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Let's see.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,160
I believe in,
there's other other life forms out there,

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:12,720
but I don't think they're coming here.
They might. Here's the thing. They might,

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,020
well, why not think it, but just
because here's, here's one thing.

5
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,130
I do believe most people are full of
shit when it comes to like most of their

6
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,740
stories,
like it's,

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,760
it's hard to find a person that could
just tell you what happened based on what

8
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:27,720
they really remember.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,990
People want to jazz things up and they
want to add salt and pepper. Yeah.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,300
They just sex with me that don't,

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,910
they don't necessarily tell you the truth.

12
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:43,830
They tell you what they think is going
to be an engaging story that kind of

13
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,510
represents the truth.
Maybe.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,660
Especially when it's a weird thing
like you saw something in the sky.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,310
What did you really see? How long did you
look at it for? How many seconds was it?

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,770
Well, I mean, here's the problem I have
with you for it. I believe there are,

17
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:01,950
you have photos, but I don't think they're
coming here. Why would you say that?

18
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:04,620
Because that means their tech, first
of all, if they're coming here,

19
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,920
that means their technology is far,
way more advanced than ours.

20
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,730
So why would they care if people saw them?
They would show up.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,060
If I was an alien and I
was that far ahead of us,

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,870
I would lay in that bitch right in the
middle of time square and be like, what?

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,840
We are here. But why would you
do that? But why wouldn't I?

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,860
Why am I competing in fields
where nobody can see us?

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,520
Are you aware of how we
treat uncontacted tribes?

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,850
Yes.
To a point to point,

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,670
but what I'm saying is if
you're that far advanced,

28
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,940
they know if they're coming here,
they know they're,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,680
they're way smarter than
us because they've traveled
here and we don't even know

30
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:47,550
other from far distances. We can't
even imagine. And they're here.

31
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:48,660
They don't have to hide.

32
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,650
It's just like they do it because they
have to hide or do you think maybe they

33
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:55,650
do it because we can't handle
it because we can't handle it?

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,860
Why would they care if we could handle
it or not? Because here's the problem.

35
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,230
Whenever any civilization has ever
encountered a civilization far superior to

36
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:10,680
them, the results have always been
catastrophic. Every single time.

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,070
Every time Europeans have
invaded North America,

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,100
every time the Spanish
visited the Mexicans,

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,140
every time that this has happened, it's
been a disaster. And this is human beings.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,470
If there was something that came
down here from another planet,

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,880
it was so unbelievably sophisticated that
it could travel through vast distances

42
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,220
in space and had insurmountable,

43
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,250
impossible technology that we would
look to it for all of our answers.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,270
It would become our new daddy.

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,400
It would completely disrupt
all of our governments.

46
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,900
It would disrupt all of our religions.

47
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:47,490
It would disrupt every single
belief system we have and
people would fall apart.

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,420
They wouldn't know what
to do. Psychologically, it
would be devastating. Look,

49
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,210
I'm not a psychologist,

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,350
but I know most people would not be
able to handle it. I understand that,

51
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,430
but why would they?
Because that's my whole point.

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,520
Because why would they care about
it would be affecting our culture.

53
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,580
They wouldn't care. But why wouldn't
they care? Well, why would they care?

54
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,630
We care about animals,
Bro.

55
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,910
There's a reason why we have
wildlife protection agencies.

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,670
We have that because we care about
animals and animals don't even know were a

57
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:17,110
thing. Okay? If you're a deer living
in the forest, you're two years old.

58
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,580
You might not have ever
even seen a person.

59
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,810
You don't even know what the fuck we are,

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,730
but we're trying to keep those deer alive.

61
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,610
We spend billions of dollars
every year protecting them.

62
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,980
We do that because we care about wildlife.

63
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,140
If we cared about a rare monkey that
we found in Indonesia, in the force,

64
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,951
I'm strange monkey.

65
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:37,060
We would do whatever we could to make
sure that monkeys populations thrive.

66
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,870
If there was a way to help them. I mean,
that's one of the reasons why zoos exist.

67
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,660
They take rare animals,
they try to breed them in captivity and,

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,780
but we're also sharing the same earth.
Would they?

69
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:51,070
Maybe they look at the universe that way
and maybe look at nuclear civilizations

70
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,870
like our civilization.
I mean,

71
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:57,871
our civilizations a very dangerous one
because we're a bunch of semi hairless

72
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:01,630
monkeys with nuclear weapons. I
mean, we're fucking nuts, bro. Yeah,

73
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,810
we're obsessed with sex. We
Jack off to our phones. We're,

74
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,480
we're taking pills to keep our
dick hard. We're all on speed, man.

75
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,630
We all have Ab. These are we're
at and we lie. We lie about shit.

76
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:16,150
We lie about things that people did to us.

77
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,490
We pretend people think did worse things.

78
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,570
We pretend that we didn't do things
to people. We lie about stealing.

79
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:27,300
We lie about money. We lie about all kinds
of things. I mean, people are so crazy.

80
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,240
You're thinking aliens are thinking
about all that before they come down.

81
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,990
Of course they would. Why
wouldn't I? Why wouldn't,

82
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,450
I guess I'm coming from a human point
of view where we don't give a shit about

83
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:40,390
anything is a thing that's not true.
We do give a shit about things.

84
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,160
That's why when you go
to the Galapagos Islands,

85
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,840
you're not allowed to take your shoes,

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,380
that you walked around Los Angeles and
walk around the Galapagos Island because

87
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:51,520
people have done that and they've gotten
seeds from their shoes stuck in the

88
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,140
sand over there in the ground over there,

89
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,360
and then new plants grow
that are invasive species.

90
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,840
They were worried about ecosystems that
we really, okay, that's fine. I Cubans,

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,430
that's where we're worried
about invasive species.
