00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Today we are going to continue
with chemical equilibrium.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.656
And, at the end of the lecture,
Professor Ceyer will be here to

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:39.310
talk about exam two.
We are going to start off where

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.058
we left off, and we were talking
about Le Châtelier's principle.

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:49.802
Le Châtelier had this great
idea that systems tend to

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:54.000
respond to stress in a
particular way.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.580
That if you apply a stress to a
system at equilibrium,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.333
it will respond to that stress
by trying to minimize the

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.358
stress.
The reaction will respond to

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:11.111
adjust for the stress that was
applied and minimize that

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:14.308
stress.
If you consider what stress is

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:18.802
applied to a reaction and then
how that stress can be

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:23.728
minimized, you can predict
whether the reaction will go in

00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:29.000
the forward direction or the
reverse direction.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.292
And so it tends to go in one of
those directions to minimize the

00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:39.585
stress until the stress has been
minimized, and then equilibrium

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:43.197
is reached again.
We talked last class about

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:48.154
adding and removing products or
reactants and how the system

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:51.430
would respond.
And today we are going to

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.967
consider changes in volume to a
gaseous system and also

00:01:55.967 --> 00:02:00.000
temperature and how systems
respond.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.789
And at the end we will talk
about the relevance of this to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.739
biological systems.
Again, here is Le Châtelier.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.445
We can use this to predict the
direction of the reaction,

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.974
the response to the stress that
is applied.

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:21.764
First let's consider what
happens if you have a mixture of

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:25.042
gases at equilibrium.
They are reacting.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:30.000
Again, in equilibrium,
it is a dynamic process.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.015
You have the reaction going in
the forward direction and the

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:36.738
reverse direction,
but the rates of those

00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:40.209
reactions are the same,
so there is no net change in

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.476
composition, but the reaction is
still happening.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:47.560
Now, if you have a system at
equilibrium, a gaseous system in

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.780
equilibrium and you change the
volume, it will consider how the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.000
reaction will shift to
compensate for this stress.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.952
So a decrease in volume of the
gaseous system will cause an

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:06.776
increase in total pressure.
How do we know that?

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:12.831
What equation tells us about
pressures and volumes of gases?

00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:17.655
Yeah, ideal gas law,
PV equals nRT.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:21.863
That is what we will be
considering today.

00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:27.815
Le Châtelier's principle would
predict that the system will

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:32.639
respond in such a way,
then, to reduce the total

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.088
pressure.
If you decrease the volume,

00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:41.651
increase the total pressure,
the system is going to respond,

00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.674
then, to reduce that total
pressure, to minimize that

00:03:45.674 --> 00:03:49.000
stress that was added into the
system.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.429
Let's look at an example.
Here we have two P two gas

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:06.196
going to P four gas,
so two molecules of P two going

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:09.186
to one of P four.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:13.766
And in the middle one here,
we have this system at

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:17.504
equilibrium.
And we are going to consider

00:04:17.504 --> 00:04:22.738
both what happens when we
decrease the volume and when we

00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:26.943
increase the volume.
First let's consider this

00:04:26.943 --> 00:04:31.857
decrease.
What happens is that a decrease

00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:36.005
in volume shifts the reaction
toward products.

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:40.061
Why is that true?
Well, it has to do with the

00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:45.592
stoichiometry of this equation.
For every two moles here that

00:04:45.592 --> 00:04:48.541
are consumed,
only one is formed.

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.952
A shift to the right,
toward products,

00:04:51.952 --> 00:04:57.114
is going to reduce the number
of molecules in the system,

00:04:57.114 --> 00:05:02.000
and therefore reduce the total
pressure.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.011
When you have a decrease in
volume, that initially causes

00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:10.308
the total pressure to increase.
And so the system responds in

00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:13.889
such a way to minimize that
stress and decrease the

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.044
pressure, which you can do by
shifting this reaction toward

00:05:18.044 --> 00:05:21.768
products or to the right.
This is what Le Châtelier's

00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:25.707
principle would allow you to
guess when you look at this

00:05:25.707 --> 00:05:29.908
particular reaction.
And you can also prove to

00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:34.793
yourself that this is correct by
considering Q and K and delta G.

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:38.152
Let's prove that this is what
would, in fact,

00:05:38.152 --> 00:05:40.671
happen.
We consider again Q and K.

00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:45.175
Remember that this is what is
important in both of these two

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:47.618
lectures.
We are talking about Q,

00:05:47.618 --> 00:05:51.129
the reaction quotient,
the ratio of products to

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.870
reactants under whatever
condition you are at that

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.361
particular moment in time.
Whereas, K is our equilibrium

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:05.165
constant, the ratio of products
to reactants at equilibrium.

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:09.643
Now, to make the math easy,
let's assume that the volume

00:06:09.643 --> 00:06:12.493
decrease happens by a factor of
two.

00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:17.134
You decrease the volume by two.
That is going to initially

00:06:17.134 --> 00:06:21.287
increase the pressure of both
gases of P two,

00:06:21.287 --> 00:06:23.811
the reactant,
and P four,

00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:27.312
the product,
by two, so the partial pressure

00:06:27.312 --> 00:06:32.530
is going to go up.
Now we can figure out by how

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.512
much with this decrease in
volume.

00:06:35.512 --> 00:06:39.849
Q, again, the reaction
quotient, is products over

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.000
reactants, so our product,
partial pressure of P four over

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.240
the partial pressure of P two
raised to the two.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.222
Again, you consider the

00:06:53.222 --> 00:06:58.283
stoichiometry when you are
writing your equation for Q or

00:06:58.283 --> 00:07:01.636
for K.
If we work this out,

00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:06.219
we find that by decreasing the
volume by a factor of two,

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.803
Q is now half what it was.
It is decreased by a factor of

00:07:10.803 --> 00:07:12.849
two.
Now Q is less than K.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.432
We were at equilibrium before,
but if stress was applied,

00:07:17.432 --> 00:07:21.687
the volume was decreased.
And now we have a situation

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:25.698
where Q is no longer equal to K,
Q is less than K.

00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:30.035
And so that is going to then
shift the reaction toward

00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:33.803
products.
It will be spontaneous in the

00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:36.165
forward direction.
You can just sort of

00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:39.834
rationalize what will happen,
and you will have questions on

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:43.316
homeworks and on exams saying,
if this stress is applied,

00:07:43.316 --> 00:07:46.051
predict how the reaction is
going to respond,

00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:49.844
you can work it out in terms of
thinking about Q and K or just

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:53.512
sort of rationalize how do you
minimize that stress that has

00:07:53.512 --> 00:07:58.831
been applied to the system.
And if you are asked how much

00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:04.787
happens, if numbers are given,
you can actually work this out,

00:08:04.787 --> 00:08:08.498
what Q is at that point and
what K was.

00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:13.771
Now, if we increase volume,
if we go in this direction,

00:08:13.771 --> 00:08:18.946
what is going to happen?
Well, the reverse will happen

00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:22.949
in this case.
We are going to shift toward

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:27.275
reactants.
For every one mole of product

00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:31.670
that goes in this direction,
in the reverse direction you

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.044
will form these two moles of P
two.

00:08:35.044 --> 00:08:39.753
A shift toward the reactants,
a shift to the left is going to

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:44.069
increase the total pressure.
If you increase the volume,

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:48.464
you are initially going to
decrease the partial pressure.

00:08:48.464 --> 00:08:53.251
And a shift in this direction
of the reaction will compensate,

00:08:53.251 --> 00:08:57.410
it will increase that partial
pressure until you reach

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.765
equilibrium again.
Because you are going in a

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:04.412
reverse direction from one to
two moles.

00:09:04.412 --> 00:09:07.127
Again, we could work this out
in Q and K.

00:09:07.127 --> 00:09:10.114
Actually, we will do this at a
later example.

00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:14.255
But, again, you can rationalize
or figure it out in terms of Q

00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:17.853
and K and what delta G would be,
positive or negative,

00:09:17.853 --> 00:09:21.791
which direction the reaction is
spontaneous, in the forward

00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:24.302
direction or in the reverse
direction.

00:09:24.302 --> 00:09:28.362
All right.
Let's make this a little bit

00:09:28.362 --> 00:09:32.918
more complicated now and
consider what happens when you

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:35.786
add an inert gas into that
mixture.

00:09:35.786 --> 00:09:40.004
Here we are adding an inert gas
into the container.

00:09:40.004 --> 00:09:43.801
And when we add it,
it is increasing the total

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:48.357
pressure of that container and
temperature is constant.

00:09:48.357 --> 00:09:52.153
Add an inert gas.
Increase the total pressure.

00:09:52.153 --> 00:09:55.444
What is going to happen to the
reaction?

00:09:55.444 --> 00:10:00.000
Will it shift to the left or
the right?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.263
What is going to happen?
The answer is in this case

00:10:05.263 --> 00:10:06.526
nothing.
Why?

00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:10.421
Why won't this affect the
equilibrium?

00:10:10.421 --> 00:10:16.947
Why aren't we affecting Q here?
The answer is that Q depends on

00:10:16.947 --> 00:10:21.473
the partial pressures of the
gases involved,

00:10:21.473 --> 00:10:25.473
and partial pressures are not
changing.

00:10:25.473 --> 00:10:32.333
The total pressure is changing.
But the partial pressures of

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:35.916
those gases are not changing.
At this point,

00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:41.000
let's review partial pressure,
and then I think this will make

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.333
a lot of sense.
The definition of partial

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:49.333
pressure is the pressure that
each gas would exert if it were

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:53.833
alone in the container.
Here we have some oxygen at one

00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:58.083
atmosphere, here we have
nitrogen at one atmosphere,

00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:04.000
and here we have a mixture of
the oxygen and the nitrogen.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.364
And now that we have added one
gas to the other,

00:11:07.364 --> 00:11:09.584
the pressure is two
atmospheres.

00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:13.736
We added one atmosphere of this
and one atmosphere of that,

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:16.099
and we have two atmospheres
total.

00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:19.535
But if you are asking about the
partial pressure,

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:22.757
say, of oxygen,
the partial pressure of oxygen

00:11:22.757 --> 00:11:26.766
is the same here as it is in the
mixture, because partial

00:11:26.766 --> 00:11:31.348
pressure is the pressure that is
due just to that particular gas,

00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:35.000
as if it were alone in a
container.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.547
Let's look at the equations for
partial pressure.

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:43.129
And, if you haven't had partial
pressure before in high school,

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:47.193
I said this is a review,
but this is actually everything

00:11:47.193 --> 00:11:51.110
you need to know about partial
pressure for this unit,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.471
so it doesn't really matter if
you haven't seen this before.

00:11:55.471 --> 00:11:59.979
If we have our familiar ideal
gas law, the partial pressure of

00:11:59.979 --> 00:12:04.635
A depends on just the number of
molecules of A in that container

00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:09.097
at a given volume.
The total pressure of a system

00:12:09.097 --> 00:12:12.382
will be the partial pressure of
A plus B plus C,

00:12:12.382 --> 00:12:15.389
depending on how much of a
mixture you have.

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:18.395
In this case,
we have a mixture of O two and

00:12:18.395 --> 00:12:21.820
N two,
so our total pressure is two.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.805
But our partial pressure of
each of these gases in here is

00:12:25.805 --> 00:12:30.000
still one, as it was before when
they were alone.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.090
How is this all relevant?
Well, it is relevant because Q

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.181
depends on the partial pressure,
not the total pressure.

00:12:38.181 --> 00:12:42.644
The question you have to ask
yourself in looking at all these

00:12:42.644 --> 00:12:45.991
problems is, is the partial
pressure changing,

00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:49.487
i.e., is Q changing?
Because only when Q changes

00:12:49.487 --> 00:12:53.876
will equilibrium be affected.
In the particular example that

00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:56.925
I gave you at the beginning
here, I asked,

00:12:56.925 --> 00:13:00.793
what happens if an inert gas is
added to a container,

00:13:00.793 --> 00:13:06.000
increasing the total pressure
at constant temperature?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.500
And so the answer was nothing,
because Q is not affected.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.750
The partial pressure for the
gases is still the same.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.312
The volume has not changed any.
You have not added more of

00:13:16.312 --> 00:13:19.125
these two gases.
You added an inert gas so the

00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:21.437
number of moles of these are the
same.

00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:24.750
The volume is the same,
so the partial pressure is the

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.812
same.
And if partial pressures are

00:13:26.812 --> 00:13:31.000
the same, then Q is unaffected,
so Q does not change.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.923
It doesn't matter.
There is no shift because Q is

00:13:34.923 --> 00:13:38.275
still equal to K.
We are still under these

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:41.463
conditions.
It seems like it is a stress

00:13:41.463 --> 00:13:46.204
applied, but it is not really a
real stress, so there is no

00:13:46.204 --> 00:13:49.228
change.
Let's look at another scenario

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:54.133
and consider what will happen.
Now, what happens if we add an

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:58.711
inert gas, but the total
pressure and the temperature are

00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:03.508
kept constant?
The total pressure is not

00:14:03.508 --> 00:14:07.322
allowed to change,
it is kept constant.

00:14:07.322 --> 00:14:11.838
For this to be true,
for you to add two things

00:14:11.838 --> 00:14:16.455
together and the total pressure
doesn't change,

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:21.673
what had to have happened?
Volume had to have changed

00:14:21.673 --> 00:14:25.387
here, otherwise this couldn't be
true.

00:14:25.387 --> 00:14:30.710
The volume had to change.
Because here we have your

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.200
constant temperature,
we have the gas constant here,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.006
number of moles.
If we have increased this

00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:40.222
number of moles,
and then the total pressure has

00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:42.549
to be affected by it.
If it didn't,

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:46.450
that means volume had to have
changed for that to be true.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.803
For the pressure to be
constant, the volume of the

00:14:49.803 --> 00:14:53.430
container must have increased.
And so you will notice,

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.057
in working a lot of these
problems, often it won't say

00:14:57.057 --> 00:15:01.769
anything about the volume.
It will tell you about the

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:06.126
pressure, and you have to figure
out whether that means there was

00:15:06.126 --> 00:15:09.258
a volume change,
because the volume changes are

00:15:09.258 --> 00:15:12.730
the ones that are relevant.
It is all sort of in the

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.248
wordings of these problems.
All right.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:19.265
The volume must have increased,
otherwise the pressure would

00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:22.124
have gone up.
Then this question really is,

00:15:22.124 --> 00:15:24.711
what happens when the volume
increases?

00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:29.000
And we know how to answer that
question already.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.857
For this particular reaction,
where you have these two P

00:15:32.857 --> 00:15:37.276
two's going to one P four,
an increase in volume

00:15:37.276 --> 00:15:40.572
means that you are going to
shift two reactants,

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:44.710
you are going to go from this
side that has one to this side

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.866
which has two.
That way, when you increase the

00:15:47.866 --> 00:15:51.022
volume, the partial pressure is
going to drop.

00:15:51.022 --> 00:15:54.669
You want to respond in a way to
minimize that stress,

00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:58.246
which means you want then an
increase in the partial

00:15:58.246 --> 00:16:02.524
pressure.
Again, we can think about this

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:06.394
in terms of Q and K.
Then we just work a little

00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:10.012
example on the board to
emphasize the point.

00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:14.639
We did the other example
earlier, but now let's consider

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:19.098
if your volume doubles.
And my picture doesn't make it

00:16:19.098 --> 00:16:23.725
look like it is doubling but
this makes the math easier.

00:16:23.725 --> 00:16:28.185
That means if the volume
doubles you are going to half

00:16:28.185 --> 00:16:32.055
the partial pressure,
initially, of both gases,

00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:36.971
of P two and P four.
And so now we consider Q

00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:41.898
because it is really all about
the relationship between Q and

00:16:41.898 --> 00:16:44.608
K.
Q is going to equal the partial

00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:49.454
pressure of the products over
reactants, and the reactant is

00:16:49.454 --> 00:16:54.053
partial pressure of P two.
Again, with the stoichiometry,

00:16:54.053 --> 00:16:57.584
that is squared.
If the volume

00:16:57.584 --> 00:17:02.429
doubles, initially the partial
pressure will be half for the

00:17:02.429 --> 00:17:06.125
products and also half for the
reactant P two,

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:11.919
and that is squared.
So, Q is twice what it was

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:15.401
before.
Now Q is greater than K.

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:20.679
And so you will have a delta G
that is positive,

00:17:20.679 --> 00:17:27.304
which means you are going to be
spontaneous in the direction

00:17:27.304 --> 00:17:32.192
toward reactants.
And you could sort of just

00:17:32.192 --> 00:17:37.253
reason that out by looking at
the number of moles on one side

00:17:37.253 --> 00:17:40.626
or the other.
Or, if you want to convince

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:45.855
yourself, you can look at Q and
K, because this is really where

00:17:45.855 --> 00:17:48.385
it comes from.
When Q equals K,

00:17:48.385 --> 00:17:52.349
you are at equilibrium.
If it is greater than K,

00:17:52.349 --> 00:17:54.373
then you shift.
Question?

00:17:54.373 --> 00:18:00.303
Yeah, just because it doubles.
There could be real numbers

00:18:00.303 --> 00:18:04.996
that you are looking at,
but this is just considering if

00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:09.518
you double this then you are
going to have a decrease.

00:18:09.518 --> 00:18:14.382
Yeah, it's a partial pressure.
The number of moles are not

00:18:14.382 --> 00:18:19.160
changing but the partial
pressure is changing because the

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.634
volume is changing.
All right.

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:23.000
Yeah?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.784
Well, at equilibrium Q is equal
to K.

00:18:34.784 --> 00:18:39.038
That Q and K are both products
over our reactants or the

00:18:39.038 --> 00:18:42.364
partial pressure of products
over reactants.

00:18:42.364 --> 00:18:46.464
When you make some change like
this, Q was equal to K,

00:18:46.464 --> 00:18:50.408
but now you have a change.
Either if you increase or

00:18:50.408 --> 00:18:55.127
decrease, then it changes the
relationship to your equilibrium

00:18:55.127 --> 00:19:00.000
so you are no longer in the
equilibrium conditions.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
At equilibrium Q equals K by
definition.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.866
You are always considering,
if you are talking about

00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:17.958
applying a stress to a system,
you are assuming that the

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.106
system was in equilibrium.
And then you apply a stress to

00:19:21.106 --> 00:19:24.085
that situation that is at
equilibrium and ask how does

00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:26.671
this system respond?
In all of these questions,

00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:29.707
you are under equilibrium
conditions and then you apply

00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:31.000
the stress.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.945
So that's volume.
And so the secret to these

00:19:42.945 --> 00:19:45.821
problems is asking,
is the partial pressure

00:19:45.821 --> 00:19:49.726
changing under those conditions
when you are talking about

00:19:49.726 --> 00:19:51.506
volume.
You had a system at

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:54.383
equilibrium.
Then you messed up your system

00:19:54.383 --> 00:19:58.493
at equilibrium by compressing
the container or increasing the

00:19:58.493 --> 00:20:01.796
container.
And whether you added an inert

00:20:01.796 --> 00:20:05.568
gas, it really always falls down
to those two possibilities that

00:20:05.568 --> 00:20:08.682
the volume was decreased or the
volume was increased.

00:20:08.682 --> 00:20:11.916
You have to look at the
question and read carefully and

00:20:11.916 --> 00:20:15.089
say what is happening to the
volume under these cases,

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:18.502
and then you can figure out
which direction it is going to

00:20:18.502 --> 00:20:19.580
go.
And, of course,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.754
that was all one example.
You have to look at what the

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:25.928
particular reaction is,
how many moles are on one side

00:20:25.928 --> 00:20:30.000
and how many are on the other,
to think about this.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.671
Le Châtelier also works for
temperature.

00:20:33.671 --> 00:20:37.437
In this case,
you are thinking about what

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:42.427
happens if you raise the
temperature of an equilibrium

00:20:42.427 --> 00:20:45.628
mixture.
The reaction mixture is at

00:20:45.628 --> 00:20:49.770
equilibrium, delta G equals
zero, Q equals K,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.972
and now you are changing
something.

00:20:52.972 --> 00:20:55.984
You are changing the
temperature.

00:20:55.984 --> 00:21:00.880
Raising the temperature by
adding heat will cause the

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:07.000
reaction to shift,
so that that heat is absorbed.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.714
This is the same idea.
Applying stress to the system,

00:21:10.714 --> 00:21:14.142
raising the temperature,
the reaction is going to

00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:18.071
respond so that the heat that
was added is now absorbed.

00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:20.357
You go back to where you
started.

00:21:20.357 --> 00:21:23.357
Le Châtelier works for
temperature as well,

00:21:23.357 --> 00:21:27.000
it is the same idea,
but here the stress is changing

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.729
the temperature of the system.
Adding heat or removing heat

00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:38.578
from the system and thinking
about how that reaction that was

00:21:38.578 --> 00:21:43.355
at equilibrium is going to
respond to this stress.

00:21:43.355 --> 00:21:47.547
Let's consider an exothermic
reaction first.

00:21:47.547 --> 00:21:51.836
An exothermic reaction,
if we are raising the

00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:57.295
temperature of an exothermic
reaction, you will favor the

00:21:57.295 --> 00:22:02.265
formation of the reactants.
Why is that true?

00:22:02.265 --> 00:22:06.433
Well, with an exothermic
reaction you are producing heat.

00:22:06.433 --> 00:22:10.601
And in the reverse direction
you would be absorbing heat.

00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:14.844
According to Le Châtelier's
principle, you want to respond

00:22:14.844 --> 00:22:18.417
to minimize the stress.
If you raise temperature,

00:22:18.417 --> 00:22:22.288
you want to shift in a
direction where that heat will

00:22:22.288 --> 00:22:24.000
be absorbed.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.123
So a shift, then,
in the endothermic direction.

00:22:41.123 --> 00:22:43.753
And so for an endothermic
reaction, it is just the reverse

00:22:43.753 --> 00:22:45.415
of this.
For an endothermic reaction,

00:22:45.415 --> 00:22:48.000
you are absorbing heat toward
products and producing heat

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.215
toward reactants.
If you raise the temperature of

00:22:50.215 --> 00:22:52.753
an endothermic reaction,
you will favor the formation of

00:22:52.753 --> 00:22:53.861
products.
Because, again,

00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:56.307
if you are adding heat,
you want to absorb the heat so

00:22:56.307 --> 00:23:00.000
it will shift the reaction in a
direction that absorbs the heat.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.572
Let's consider this a bit
further.

00:23:07.572 --> 00:23:11.002
In this case,
delta H is our predictive tool.

00:23:11.002 --> 00:23:14.510
If we know delta H,
we are going to be able to

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.720
predict the direction that the
reaction is going to go.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.397
Before, we were talking about
delta G as being our indicator.

00:23:23.397 --> 00:23:27.841
Here delta H is telling us
quite a bit about what is going

00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:30.881
to happen, i.e.,
whether the reaction is

00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:36.899
exothermic or endothermic.
Let's just do a quick example.

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:41.055
Here is a reaction,
delta H, negative 197.78

00:23:41.055 --> 00:23:45.405
kilojoules per mole.
Is that an endothermic or

00:23:45.405 --> 00:23:49.271
exothermic reaction?
Exothermic reaction.

00:23:49.271 --> 00:23:53.717
If heat is added,
if the temperature is raised,

00:23:53.717 --> 00:24:00.000
what direction will it go,
toward products or reactants?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.992
Reactants.
It will want to absorb that

00:24:03.992 --> 00:24:09.496
heat, so it goes in the
endothermic direction or the

00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:13.812
reverse direction.
That is pretty simple.

00:24:13.812 --> 00:24:18.237
Delta H allows us to make that
prediction.

00:24:18.237 --> 00:24:22.553
All right.
We need to think now about the

00:24:22.553 --> 00:24:30.000
relationship between temperature
and equilibrium constants.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.882
Equilibrium constant has been
constant up until this point,

00:24:33.882 --> 00:24:37.764
but now we see that temperature
will change the equilibrium

00:24:37.764 --> 00:24:39.973
constant.
The ratio of products to

00:24:39.973 --> 00:24:43.454
reactants that you have at
equilibrium will depend on

00:24:43.454 --> 00:24:47.202
whether it is an exothermic,
endothermic reaction and how

00:24:47.202 --> 00:24:50.616
much heat is in the system,
the temperature that the

00:24:50.616 --> 00:24:53.896
reaction is being run at.
You will get a different

00:24:53.896 --> 00:24:57.243
equilibrium constant,
a different ratio of products

00:24:57.243 --> 00:25:00.991
to reactants if you are at one
temperature versus another

00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:05.727
temperature.
And also, we will come back to

00:25:05.727 --> 00:25:10.636
this at the end of the course,
reaction rates depend on

00:25:10.636 --> 00:25:14.181
temperature.
How fast those reactions go

00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:17.909
depends on temperature as well.
All right.

00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:22.272
Now we want to figure out
exactly how equilibrium

00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:27.163
constants depend on temperature.
And to do that,

00:25:27.163 --> 00:25:31.896
we have to think about what we
know in terms of equations that

00:25:31.896 --> 00:25:36.318
have temperature in them and
have equilibrium constants in

00:25:36.318 --> 00:25:39.034
them.
We know that delta G nought is

00:25:39.034 --> 00:25:43.301
minus RT natural log of K. We

00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:48.189
also know that delta G nought is
equal to delta H nought minus T

00:25:48.189 --> 00:25:50.905
delta S.

00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:54.008
Now, if we want to take that

00:25:54.008 --> 00:25:58.275
information and combine it and
solve for the equilibrium

00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:03.561
constant in terms of delta H --
And we want to do that.

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:07.294
We want to solve for in terms
of delta H and in terms of

00:26:07.294 --> 00:26:10.755
temperature, because we want to
think about delta H,

00:26:10.755 --> 00:26:13.470
endothermic,
exothermic reactions and the

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.339
relationship between equilibrium
constant and temperature.

00:26:17.339 --> 00:26:21.208
If we just rearrange these
equations that you have already

00:26:21.208 --> 00:26:24.262
seen and should be reviewing now
for exam two,

00:26:24.262 --> 00:26:27.791
you can come up with this.
Now we want to think about

00:26:27.791 --> 00:26:32.000
which of these terms are
temperature dependent.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.162
I have already told you that
the equilibrium constant is

00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:39.720
temperature dependent.
Delta H here and delta S,

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.110
we could assume that they are
pretty much constant over any

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:48.651
temperature that we would be
looking at, any temperature that

00:26:48.651 --> 00:26:52.360
a reaction would be run.
These guys are not really

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.236
changing.
And so if they are not really

00:26:55.236 --> 00:26:59.550
changing, then we can see that
the equilibrium constant is

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:05.000
going to change with respect to
the change in temperature.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.144
As we change temperature,
K will vary here.

00:27:08.144 --> 00:27:12.187
And we can look at this for two
different temperatures.

00:27:12.187 --> 00:27:15.406
If you change the temperature
of the system,

00:27:15.406 --> 00:27:19.000
the first temperature and the
second temperature,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.893
T one and T two,
they will be different

00:27:22.893 --> 00:27:26.411
equilibrium constants at these
two temperatures,

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:30.229
different ratios of products,
two reactants at these

00:27:30.229 --> 00:27:35.343
different temperatures.
If we write out two equations

00:27:35.343 --> 00:27:40.272
then, one for K two with T two,
so the equation for the second

00:27:40.272 --> 00:27:45.282
temperature and the equation for
the first temperature at T one

00:27:45.282 --> 00:27:49.565
and the first equilibrium
constant for that particular

00:27:49.565 --> 00:27:52.878
temperature.
And then if we subtract these

00:27:52.878 --> 00:27:56.353
two equations,
so if we subtract the natural

00:27:56.353 --> 00:28:00.070
logs of the Ks,
we can express that in terms of

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:05.000
natural log of K two over 
K one.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.733
And if we subtract the second
part, we subtract this from

00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:12.333
this, the delta S over R terms
are going to cancel out,

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:15.400
they are the same,
delta S is not changing with

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.599
temperature here,
and so those two terms would be

00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:20.933
the same, they are going to go
away.

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:24.400
And now what is different are
these two temperatures.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.000
We can pull out the negative
delta H here.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.688
We can pull out the one over R.
And that leaves one over T two

00:28:33.688 --> 00:28:37.045
minus one over T one.

00:28:37.045 --> 00:28:42.080
And it has a name so you know
this must be an important

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.344
equation.
That is partly how you can

00:28:45.344 --> 00:28:48.607
tell.
It is the van't Hoff equation.

00:28:48.607 --> 00:28:53.363
It tells you how the
equilibrium constants are going

00:28:53.363 --> 00:28:59.057
to change with temperature.
Now let's look at how the

00:28:59.057 --> 00:29:04.077
numbers are going to work out if
we have a negative sign here,

00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:08.685
i.e., if it is an exothermic
reaction, or we are going to

00:29:08.685 --> 00:29:13.211
have a positive delta H,
so that would be an endothermic

00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:17.573
reaction, and whether you are
adding or removing heat.

00:29:17.573 --> 00:29:22.264
There will be a difference in
the ratios of K one to K two.

00:29:22.264 --> 00:29:25.638
Let's think about what comes

00:29:25.638 --> 00:29:30.000
out of this equation and
rationalize it.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.766
This looks a little
complicated, but it is actually

00:29:33.766 --> 00:29:36.703
pretty simple.
Here, all we are doing is

00:29:36.703 --> 00:29:39.340
saying, what if delta H is
negative?

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.784
If delta H is negative and we
have T two greater than T one,

00:29:43.784 --> 00:29:48.303
well, this negative sign here
is going to be negative all the

00:29:48.303 --> 00:29:51.166
way through here.
It is always present.

00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:54.254
That is part of the equation.
Delta H now,

00:29:54.254 --> 00:29:59.000
if it is negative,
you will have a negative here.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.609
And then we consider the
different between one over T two

00:30:02.609 --> 00:30:04.929
and one over T one.

00:30:04.929 --> 00:30:08.022
And, in this case,
if T two is greater than T one,

00:30:08.022 --> 00:30:11.954
that is a negative.
When you multiplied all those

00:30:11.954 --> 00:30:14.661
out together we would have a
negative here.

00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:16.916
That is just what is all done
there.

00:30:16.916 --> 00:30:19.688
Now let's rationalize that this
makes sense.

00:30:19.688 --> 00:30:22.781
This is just the same thing but
has a little more

00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:26.197
rationalization in it.
It puts things in words instead

00:30:26.197 --> 00:30:30.000
of using the greater and less
than thing.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.552
And these parts are not written
in your notes,

00:30:33.552 --> 00:30:37.657
but if you want to add the
words to it, that is fine,

00:30:37.657 --> 00:30:41.052
on the handout.
And you can just think about

00:30:41.052 --> 00:30:45.315
this on your own as well.
If delta H is less than zero,

00:30:45.315 --> 00:30:48.315
negative number,
you have an exothermic

00:30:48.315 --> 00:30:51.236
reaction.
What happens if you increase

00:30:51.236 --> 00:30:54.473
the temperature of an exothermic
reaction?

00:30:54.473 --> 00:31:00.000
Let me just put those back up
on the board for a minute.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.718
For an exothermic reaction,
we are talking about reactants

00:31:12.718 --> 00:31:19.218
going to products.
In an exothermic reaction heat

00:31:19.218 --> 00:31:26.802
is produced in the forward
direction and heat is absorbed

00:31:26.802 --> 00:31:32.981
in the reverse direction.
If we increase the temperature,

00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:36.943
it is going to want to go in a
direction to compensate for that

00:31:36.943 --> 00:31:39.883
to absorb the heat,
so it is going to go toward

00:31:39.883 --> 00:31:42.439
reactants.
And so you are going to have a

00:31:42.439 --> 00:31:46.466
K one that is greater than 
K two, which means at the

00:31:46.466 --> 00:31:50.172
new temperature you are going to
have less products or more

00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:52.793
reactants.
And we can rationalize why that

00:31:52.793 --> 00:31:55.285
would be true.
And, if you don't want to

00:31:55.285 --> 00:31:58.097
rationalize it,
you can always take the van't

00:31:58.097 --> 00:32:01.804
Hoff equation and figure it out
by looking at the different

00:32:01.804 --> 00:32:06.781
signs and what it would mean --
What is going to happen in

00:32:06.781 --> 00:32:10.550
terms of that ratio of K one to
K two when you have this

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.634
particular condition.
Now, if you decrease the

00:32:13.634 --> 00:32:17.335
temperature of an exothermic
reaction, then it wants to

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:19.596
compensate by producing more
heat.

00:32:19.596 --> 00:32:23.365
You decrease the temperature.
It wants to respond to the

00:32:23.365 --> 00:32:27.477
stress to minimize the stress.
The way to minimize the stress

00:32:27.477 --> 00:32:32.000
is produce more heat,
so you will make more products.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.015
Now for the endothermic
reaction, it is just the other

00:32:36.015 --> 00:32:37.000
way around.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.180
Reactants going to products.
Here, heat is absorbed.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:59.000
And in the reverse direction,
heat is produced.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.901
Now, if we have our endothermic
reaction and we increase

00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:06.448
temperature, we are going to
shift to our products,

00:33:06.448 --> 00:33:10.775
because we are going to want to
absorb that heat that was just

00:33:10.775 --> 00:33:14.322
added, minimize the stress.
And, for an endothermic

00:33:14.322 --> 00:33:17.585
reaction, if we decrease the
temperature, then,

00:33:17.585 --> 00:33:20.778
we are going to shift it to
produce more heat,

00:33:20.778 --> 00:33:24.537
i.e., toward reactants,
so we will have less products.

00:33:24.537 --> 00:33:30.000
And we would have K one that is
greater than K two.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.453
You can use the van't Hoff
equation to rationalize the

00:33:33.453 --> 00:33:36.712
prediction of change,
or, if you are given numbers,

00:33:36.712 --> 00:33:39.188
you can say the exact amount of
change.

00:33:39.188 --> 00:33:43.033
If you are given a K value at
one temperature and said if we

00:33:43.033 --> 00:33:45.770
change this temperature,
if we increase it,

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.094
this is what delta H is,
what is our new equilibrium

00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:51.375
constant?
You can use the van't Hoff

00:33:51.375 --> 00:33:55.285
equation to come up with direct
numbers, or you can use it to

00:33:55.285 --> 00:33:59.000
just rationalize the direction
of change.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.919
If you have less time on a
test, you can also just think

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:10.623
about what might be going on
here, and predict without

00:34:10.623 --> 00:34:16.973
working through the numbers.
Now, we are going to apply what

00:34:16.973 --> 00:34:23.000
we just learned to think about
how it can be used.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.077
You want to think about the
shifts that we talked about last

00:34:33.077 --> 00:34:38.154
class and the ones today have
options of adding and removing

00:34:38.154 --> 00:34:41.510
products or reactants,
changing volumes,

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:45.640
changing temperatures.
This is quite an important

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.427
reaction, and we talked about
this last time,

00:34:49.427 --> 00:34:53.471
nitrogen gas plus hydrogen gas
going to ammonia.

00:34:53.471 --> 00:34:58.825
It is an exothermic reaction.
If it is exothermic and you

00:34:58.825 --> 00:35:02.610
want to drive it toward ammonia,
which is what people do.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.328
They want to make ammonia and
want to what is called fix

00:35:06.328 --> 00:35:09.031
nitrogen.
Ammonia is used in fertilizers,

00:35:09.031 --> 00:35:12.817
lots of nitrogen in the air,
but you don't want it in the

00:35:12.817 --> 00:35:16.467
air, you want it in your soil
for growing better crops,

00:35:16.467 --> 00:35:18.562
so you want to do this
reaction.

00:35:18.562 --> 00:35:22.415
You want to maximize the yield.
Then it seems like the low

00:35:22.415 --> 00:35:26.200
temperature would be good.
It's an exothermic reaction so

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.000
low temperature would be good.
It would favor product.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.495
But there is a problem with
that, which is that low

00:35:34.495 --> 00:35:38.620
temperature also slows the rate.
And you usually want a good

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.718
rate.
You want to make a lot of

00:35:40.718 --> 00:35:44.213
products pretty quickly,
make some money off of it,

00:35:44.213 --> 00:35:48.129
so you have to balance here.
Sometimes the thermodynamics

00:35:48.129 --> 00:35:51.415
and the kinetics are working
against each other.

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:55.260
What would favor one doesn't
work so well for the other.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.525
They have to have a compromised
temperature, which is actually

00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:04.000
quite a high temperature of 500
degrees Celsius.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.857
There is a little bit of a
problem there.

00:36:06.857 --> 00:36:09.857
The temperature thing isn't
working for us.

00:36:09.857 --> 00:36:13.928
What are some other things that
they could do to drive the

00:36:13.928 --> 00:36:17.357
reaction toward products?
What else could you do?

00:36:17.357 --> 00:36:20.000
Okay.
What else could you do?

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.952
I am hearing a couple of
different things.

00:36:26.952 --> 00:36:29.000
I am looking for one other.
What about --

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.468
A couple things that you could
do that would work,

00:36:33.468 --> 00:36:36.386
I think I heard most of them
now.

00:36:36.386 --> 00:36:39.487
Remove products as they are
formed.

00:36:39.487 --> 00:36:44.685
If you remove this product that
would drive it toward more

00:36:44.685 --> 00:36:47.877
products.
And so one thing that they

00:36:47.877 --> 00:36:52.801
actually do is every once in a
while stop the reaction,

00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:58.000
cool it all down and liquefy
the ammonia gas.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.535
The liquid pours off and then
you remove this product and then

00:37:02.535 --> 00:37:06.105
you make more product.
If it reaches equilibrium,

00:37:06.105 --> 00:37:09.599
you pull off the product and
then it makes more.

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:13.764
And I also heard about this
compressing the volume of the

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:17.928
container because over here the
reactants, there are four

00:37:17.928 --> 00:37:22.241
molecules that are reacting to
form two, and so that should

00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:27.000
also shift in the correct
direction to make product.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.832
They actually do these at this
pretty high temperature,

00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:35.161
and they have to apply a really
high pressure to compress that

00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:36.935
volume.
This is expensive.

00:37:36.935 --> 00:37:39.845
And it requires a lot of
energy, actually,

00:37:39.845 --> 00:37:44.245
to do this reaction because of
the conditions that are required

00:37:44.245 --> 00:37:47.864
to maximize the yield.
Again, why this is important,

00:37:47.864 --> 00:37:51.129
there is a lot of nitrogen in
the air, however,

00:37:51.129 --> 00:37:54.677
it is really stable.
And you could probably tell me

00:37:54.677 --> 00:38:00.000
why it is so stable if you draw
a nice Lewis diagram of it.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.273
It is difficult to break these
apart, so that is why this is a

00:38:05.273 --> 00:38:08.990
hard problem.
Because you want to break this

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:13.918
bond to have usable nitrogen,
and it is challenging to do.

00:38:13.918 --> 00:38:17.549
The process,
which I just described to you,

00:38:17.549 --> 00:38:21.612
is one that was developed quite
a long time ago.

00:38:21.612 --> 00:38:26.193
This reaction is called the
Haber-Bosch process and is

00:38:26.193 --> 00:38:31.035
responsible for generating
1.6x10^10 kilograms of ammonia

00:38:31.035 --> 00:38:35.011
each year in the U.S.
for fertilizers and other

00:38:35.011 --> 00:38:38.979
things.
And it was developed by these

00:38:38.979 --> 00:38:42.323
two men right here.
Haber came up with the initial

00:38:42.323 --> 00:38:46.350
idea, and Bosch helped figure
out the appropriate conditions

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.172
to get the maximum yield.
All they are doing is basically

00:38:50.172 --> 00:38:54.267
using some of the principles
that you have already learned in

00:38:54.267 --> 00:38:57.133
this course.
And they both won Nobel Prizes

00:38:57.133 --> 00:39:02.124
for being part of this process.
This one initially and this one

00:39:02.124 --> 00:39:04.728
later on.
I will also mention that this

00:39:04.728 --> 00:39:09.114
is an interesting man if you are
interested in sort of history of

00:39:09.114 --> 00:39:11.238
science.
He is a German chemist,

00:39:11.238 --> 00:39:14.596
and during World War I he
switched his effort from

00:39:14.596 --> 00:39:18.708
fertilizers to coming up with
different kinds of poison gases

00:39:18.708 --> 00:39:22.340
that could be used in warfare.
But he was not rewarded

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.000
favorably for this later on
because he was also Jewish.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.666
In 1933, he had to flee
Germany, despite all that he had

00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:33.000
done for the war effort,
earlier on.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.800
He did not live too long a life
after that.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.533
But this was developed a long
time ago and is still used.

00:39:39.533 --> 00:39:43.533
Some scientists are actually
trying to figure out how to do a

00:39:43.533 --> 00:39:46.133
better job.
They figure any process that

00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:50.266
really started to be developed
in the 1800s and kind of refined

00:39:50.266 --> 00:39:52.800
in the 1900s,
maybe we could do better.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.533
Again, a lot of energy is
responsible, high temperatures,

00:39:56.533 --> 00:40:01.000
these extreme pressures for the
condensed volume.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.377
Maybe we could figure out a way
to do that same reaction without

00:40:05.377 --> 00:40:09.059
those extreme conditions that
require a lot of energy.

00:40:09.059 --> 00:40:12.811
And so a number of scientists
have looked to an enzyme,

00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:16.354
a protein found in bacteria
that does the exact same

00:40:16.354 --> 00:40:18.925
reaction as what is done
commercially,

00:40:18.925 --> 00:40:22.468
but it doesn't use any high
temperatures or any high

00:40:22.468 --> 00:40:24.970
pressures.
A number of scientists are

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:29.000
trying to figure out how this
protein works.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.005
How it is able to do this
reaction so efficiently.

00:40:33.005 --> 00:40:36.683
Here is a space filling picture
of the enzyme,

00:40:36.683 --> 00:40:41.425
and here are metallo-clusters
that do the actual chemistry.

00:40:41.425 --> 00:40:44.858
And so orange is iron and
yellow is sulfur.

00:40:44.858 --> 00:40:47.392
Blue is nitrogen.
Red is oxygen.

00:40:47.392 --> 00:40:50.662
Gray is carbon.
This purple color here is

00:40:50.662 --> 00:40:54.013
molybdenum.
These are metals that are used

00:40:54.013 --> 00:40:59.000
in biology to do particular
kinds of reactions.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.214
And this just shows a little
bit more about the cluster sort

00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:06.071
of in the heart of this protein
molecule.

00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:09.142
And all the chemistry happens
at the metals,

00:41:09.142 --> 00:41:12.000
but it is surrounded by a lot
of protein.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.500
That is one effort that a
number of scientists are

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.500
venturing on.
Often we find varied forms of

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.714
bacteria have proteins that do
reactions that we want to do,

00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:25.714
and they do it much better than
we do them.

00:41:25.714 --> 00:41:30.000
And so we want to understand
how that works.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.546
And this is one example.
It turns out,

00:41:32.546 --> 00:41:36.125
this is quite complicated,
and scientists still don't

00:41:36.125 --> 00:41:40.323
understand the exact details of
the reaction mechanism at that

00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:42.870
metal site.
Another attempt is just to

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.623
pretend that,
you know, to move away from

00:41:45.623 --> 00:41:48.170
nature.
And Dick Schrock's lab here at

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.748
MIT has been able to do this
reaction using a sort of

00:41:51.748 --> 00:41:55.259
designed catalyst that has
molybdenum in the center.

00:41:55.259 --> 00:41:59.319
You have probably heard the
name Dick Schrock because he won

00:41:59.319 --> 00:42:04.000
the Nobel Prize in chemistry
just a few weeks ago.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.920
He didn't win for this.
This is another one of his

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.840
contributions.
All right.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.280
Really quickly,
I want to give just one more

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.880
biological example.
And then we will hear more

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.400
about exam two.
Again, as I will emphasize in

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.840
this course.
All the things you learn can be

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.800
applied to biological systems as
well.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.836
The same basic principles.
Here we have hemoglobin.

00:42:31.836 --> 00:42:36.198
Hemoglobin is the protein in
your body that carries oxygen

00:42:36.198 --> 00:42:40.637
from the lungs to the cells.
And you can write the reaction

00:42:40.637 --> 00:42:45.000
for hemoglobin and oxygen the
way you can write any of the

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.285
reactions we have written.
Hemoglobin plus oxygen goes to

00:42:49.285 --> 00:42:52.653
oxyhemoglobin.
Here this is just oxygen bound

00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:56.403
to the hemoglobin.
Now let's consider what happens

00:42:56.403 --> 00:43:00.000
if you decide to climb a
mountain.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.508
The partial pressure of oxygen
is different at sea level;

00:43:05.508 --> 00:43:09.344
it's higher than it is in the
mountains.

00:43:09.344 --> 00:43:14.557
As you go up to higher
altitudes, the partial pressure

00:43:14.557 --> 00:43:19.967
of the oxygen decreases.
What does this mean in terms of

00:43:19.967 --> 00:43:24.590
this equilibrium?
Which direction would it shift

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:30.000
if the partial pressure of this
is decreased?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.781
Yeah, you are going to shift
toward reactants,

00:43:33.781 --> 00:43:37.310
which means you have less
oxygenated blood,

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:41.344
you have less oxygen bound.
And that is not good.

00:43:41.344 --> 00:43:46.386
It makes it much harder to get
energy to climb that mountain,

00:43:46.386 --> 00:43:50.672
so that is not good.
Usually, if you are going to go

00:43:50.672 --> 00:43:53.697
climb a mountain,
you have to adjust,

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:58.067
you have to acclimatize.
How many people are mountain

00:43:58.067 --> 00:44:00.673
climbers?
Anybody?

00:44:00.673 --> 00:44:04.294
A few people.
You usually have to get up and

00:44:04.294 --> 00:44:08.168
wait for a while before you can
start climbing.

00:44:08.168 --> 00:44:13.221
What actually happens is your
body is making more hemoglobin,

00:44:13.221 --> 00:44:16.421
so you have to wait for this to
happen.

00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:20.801
And, if it makes more
hemoglobin, what direction does

00:44:20.801 --> 00:44:23.243
it go?
Right, it shifts toward

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:26.612
products.
Then you are in better shape to

00:44:26.612 --> 00:44:30.738
climb your mountain.
Again, the same principles of

00:44:30.738 --> 00:44:34.004
shifting reaction applying to a
biological system.
