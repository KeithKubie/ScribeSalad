00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:01.659
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:02.659
Thank you for coming.

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.120
We are in the Google Los Angeles office today.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.150
This presentation is brought to you by the
Authors at Google team.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.100
To everyone in the room and watching on YouTube,
thank you so much for watching.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.769
It is my honor and privilege to introduce
to you food-blogger and very successful cookbook

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.300
author, Gabi Moskowitz.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.300
We--.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.450
I met Gabi in, I guess, in 2000 in Boston,
Massachusetts where we both went to school.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.980
And we both collaborated on some very inspired
fraternity party planning.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.969
[laughs] And since then, she's moved to San
Francisco where she was a kindergarten teacher

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:52.079
for a short time and fell into professional
cooking, professional catering and started

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.070
a blog called "The BrokeAss Gourmet."

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.210
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: BrokeAss Gourmet.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.449
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: You can find it at BrokeAss
Gourmet dot com.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.850
And since then she has published the "BrokeAss
Gourmet" cookbook.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.460
And she will be demonstrating a recipe for
us today.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.210
So, Gabi, here ya go.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.410
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Thanks Benji.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.510
I actually--.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.510
[applause]

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.510
Thank you.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.510
This is so fun.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.070
So as Benji said my name is Gabi.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.610
And I am a professional food blogger.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.840
And I just wrote my first book, "the brokeass
gourmet cookbook."

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.320
The deal with brokeass gourmet is that all
the recipes cost less than 20 bucks to make.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.150
And it's not just how to avoid starvation
dot com.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.020
It's really how to eat well.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.820
How to eat restaurant inspired gourmet food
without spending a lot of money.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.130
The genesis of the blog happened when I was
living in San Francisco in 2008.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.490
And in fall of 2008, the bottom fell out of
the economy.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.610
And I noticed this trend.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.730
I had all of these friends who had jobs at
places like Google or Facebook.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.560
And they were working crazy hours.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.270
They'd gotten these jobs right out of college.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.720
And they were fed as you guys are, breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.860
And snacks if they need.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.590
And in the process hadn't developed any sort
of domestic skills.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.400
So, when they lost their jobs and their incomes,
suddenly they found themselves eating a whole

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.170
lot of frozen burritos.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.640
And that just made me sad because I grew up
learning how to cook.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.590
My parents taught me how.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.710
It was a big part of my life.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.660
And then, when I was a teacher on a very meager
salary I had to really learn how to make ends

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.660
meet.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.960
But I grew up in Sonoma County.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.330
And so, eating well was always a really big
priority for me.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.850
So, BrokeAss Gourmet really came from a place
of wanting to teach my peers and everybody

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.510
else that eating well is not that hard to
do.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.630
And being able to afford great food is not
hard either.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.520
So, the book really focuses on that.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.250
It's sort of a primer for people who are new
to the kitchen.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.430
But it's also great for more experience cooks
who are trying to really streamline their

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.680
food.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.920
The backbone of the blog and the book is what
I call the 50 dollar pantry.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.510
It’s 50 dollars’ worth of things that
you need to have at all times.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.670
And you add a few fresh ingredients and then
you've got a real meal.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.690
So, sort of basics for setting up your pantry.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.459
I've also got how to set up a budget bar,
how to create a basic shopping list, that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.630
kind of stuff.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.709
And I think it's really great for people who
are just starting or, as I said, people who

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.720
are trying to streamline their cooking.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.670
So, today I'm going to be making one of my
favorite appetizers, Vietnamese spring rolls

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.730
with peanut sauce.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.590
I'm doing a vegetarian version.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.620
But this is one of those things that is so
cheap.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.950
Especially if you live near a good Asian specialty
grocery store.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.540
You could find everything involved so inexpensively.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.009
And it's one of those things that people take
a bite of and they're so impressed with you.

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.400
And that's the other piece of it.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.810
I really like getting credit for things that
weren't that hard to do.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.010
And this is a really good example of that.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.710
So, anyway, we're gonna get started.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.570
And the peanut sauce for the record is one
of the yummiest things you can make.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.620
I like to make a big thing of it in the beginning
of the week and just use it in lots of different

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620
ways.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.620
I'll pour it over noodles, vegetables.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.330
It's really good over grilled salmon.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.080
It's great as a dip with crudités.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.020
You know, cut up some carrots and celery,
bell peppers and just serve it like that.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.560
And the spring rolls are basically the perfect
accompaniment for it.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.650
So, I'm gonna get started.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.030
And they are a few ingredients here that you
can take or leave or swap out for something

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.030
different.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.070
So, for example, I love cilantro, but I know
not everyone does.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.370
So, if you don't love cilantro, you can either
skip it, you could use finely chopped scallions

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.810
or chives, or even a little flat leaf parsley.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.690
Give it a nice kick.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.580
But I'm gonna use it today.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.450
And the other thing that some people don't
love is the Sriracha.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.730
So, if you're not a spicy person, just skip
it.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.470
So, I'm starting with just some basic creamy
peanut butter.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.389
[clanking noise] The recipe is obviously in
the book so I'm not gonna talk about amounts.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.840
[clanking noise] Peanut butter is a pantry
ingredient.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.320
Something I include on the 50 dollar pantry
list because it is one of those things that

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.550
is relatively inexpensive, it's high protein,
and it can be used a whole bunch of different

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.550
ways.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.000
So, that's there.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.751
[clanking noise] This is coconut milk.

00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:15.910
Coconut milk comes in a can.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.910
It's not very expensive.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.740
[mixing noise] I highly recommend buying the
kinds that are imported from Thailand or Vietnam.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.230
But any kind will work.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.830
I don't like to use light coconut milk because
I find it to be too watery.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.600
But if that's your preference then it can
certainly be substituted.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.600
[dish clanging] And this is gonna give the
peanut sauce a really creamy consistency and

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.330
it's gonna blend with the peanut butter to
make a really nice base for the sauce.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.080
Then I've got some honey.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.080
And my--.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.600
I call for honey in this recipe but brown
sugar would also work.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.940
Even white sugar, agave nectar.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:05.330
If you're avoiding sugar then something like
Splenda would work or stevia.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.110
It's really important to balance flavors.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.169
So, we've got some sweet.

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.250
We've got, the peanut butter's a little bit
savory.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.210
We're gonna have some more savory things.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.460
This is some fresh lime juice.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.510
And limes are so cheap I really recommend
against buying the bottled kind.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.780
It's so much better to just get a fresh lime.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:32.150
And this is gonna add some of the tartness
to the sauce.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:39.090
And then, I would say, maybe 95 percent of
good savory food requires garlic.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.979
So of course we're gonna get that in there.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.320
I've also got some rice vinegar.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.639
If you were making this and you didn't have
rice vinegar, you could add an extra lime.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.840
You could add a little white vinegar.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.410
I would recommend against balsamic 'cause
it's a little too heavy in flavor.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.860
But any sort of white vinegar.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:03.270
I have made it it with champagne vinegar or
even white balsamic will work in a pinch.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:10.270
Alright, then I've got some soy sauce which
is another important pantry ingredient.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.900
Soy sauce helps take care of that umami flavor.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.130
And it just brings a lot of that depth of
flavor without costing a whole lot.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.130
[coughing]

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.370
I've also got some fresh ginger.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:36.139
A really important principle of BrokeAss cooking
is to use fresh, fresh things like herbs and

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:37.169
spice.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:44.330
Because a container of dry ginger first of
all, won't provide much of an impact of flavor.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.089
And it will cost a lot more than buying a
big chunk of fresh ginger.

00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:52.149
So, this, I think, is much more worth it.

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:55.790
We're gonna get that in.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.699
OK.

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:02.279
And then I got some Sriracha.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:04.850
You could also use something like Sambal.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.380
Any sort of Asian chili sauce.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.350
I've even done it before with Tabasco.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.600
You just want to get some fire in there.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.839
Even fresh jalapeños will work.

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:20.860
And it's really easy.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.860
Just put this on.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.610
And it's gonna be a little loud.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:41.930
[blender noise] Alright, and I'm gonna add
some fresh cilantro, now that we've got it

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.259
nice and smooth.

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:47.481
Because this is a Vitamix, I guess I could
have put it all in but my food processor at

00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:50.269
home is not quite as powerful.

00:09:50.269 --> 00:10:00.399
[blender noise] There we go.

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.420
Alright.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.589
So, just gonna grab one of these.

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:20.980
And when you serve it, I like to go like this.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.179
You eat with your eyes first, as I am sure
you know.

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:36.059
And when you're not spending a lot of money
on groceries it’s nice to go that extra

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:40.889
step to make the way your food looks a little
special.

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:44.920
So, we're gonna do that with a spiral today.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.709
And that is peanut sauce.

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:53.339
Set that there for now.

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.350
And now we're gonna make the spring rolls.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:02.779
And these are one of the most fun things to
do with a group.

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:06.420
Sometimes I like to have--.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.559
I'll have a spring roll and pot sticker party.

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:12.029
And I'll put out all the wrappers and fillings
and everyone can--.

00:11:12.029 --> 00:11:13.939
Everyone hangs out and rolls them together.

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:17.649
And that's a really cool way to get people
together.

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:22.239
To get them interacting with their food, you
can do the same thing with a sushi party.

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:29.199
So, the base of Vietnamese spring roll is
these things.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.949
And these can be found at most Whole Foods
stores.

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:36.050
I don't know the Los Angeles grocery store
scene very well.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.489
So I'm not sure if you can get this at something
like Ralph's but definitely Whole Foods.

00:11:40.489 --> 00:11:42.399
Any sort of--.

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:48.060
Definitely any Asian grocery supply store.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.410
And I would say probably most organic focused
health foods stores carry these.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.829
They're like a dollar ninety nine at most
for a package of 30 or 40.

00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:01.779
And they're basically just rice, really fine
ground rice, and water.

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:06.220
So, fillings I am going to be using today
are vegetarian.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:12.600
But the possibilities are limitless when it
comes to Vietnamese spring rolls.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.119
You could add--.

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:16.499
I've done it with grilled chicken and avocado
before.

00:12:16.499 --> 00:12:21.670
I do a really nice one with raw salmon and
mango and some fresh mint.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.170
That's really delicious.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:28.059
You can go more of a traditional route and
do grilled pork and shrimp.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:29.160
That's great.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.050
Avocado's always really good.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.529
Today I'm just going to be doing some really
basic vegetables and that helps keep it inexpensive.

00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:39.170
Makes a really nice lunch.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:44.009
So, it takes a little practice to figure out
how to do this.

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:47.490
But once you get it, it's really not that
hard.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:54.509
You wanna dip this disk of rice stuff into
lukewarm water.

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:57.749
You don't want it to be too hot or then it
will just fall apart in your hands.

00:12:57.749 --> 00:13:00.879
So, you can see it's already starting to become
more pliable.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:04.869
So I'm just gonna set it down on a clean dry
surface.

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:10.610
And on the bottom, I'm gonna put some fresh
mint leaves.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:17.189
And it creates sort of a stained glass look
by pressing them, placing them face down like

00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:19.449
this so that they're facing out.

00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:21.730
So go like that.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:27.910
And as you can see all these veggies that
I have, have been sliced thinly and they're

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.070
all about the same size.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.699
And that is really gonna help.

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:35.000
So, over here I've got some really thinly
sliced scallions.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.509
And the chef did an awesome job with this.

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:40.369
These are even thinner than I usually do them
at home.

00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:45.259
Usually you could just cut a scallion into--.

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:48.059
Like a chunk of scallion into three or four
slices and it works just fine.

00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:49.209
But this is beautiful.

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:52.929
So, rearrange it like that going in the same
order.

00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:55.629
And I'm just gonna pick up some of these carrot
matchsticks.

00:13:55.629 --> 00:14:00.519
And if you do not feel like cutting your own
carrot matchsticks, the pre-bagged kind that

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:08.420
you get at Trader Joe's or most grocery stores
in the prepared produce section, that will

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.420
work fine.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.850
A little bit more expensive but if you don't
feel like shredding a ton of carrots it might

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:14.850
be worth it.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.689
Then I've got some bell peppers that are gonna
go in the same direction.

00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:26.240
And some cucumber, a really nice substitution
for the cucumber is jicama.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:39.290
So, then, you just tuck in the edges and then
the trick here is to fold it up really tightly.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.009
[coughing]

00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:45.100
There's a spring roll.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.589
And this is the most fun part.

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:59.359
Slice it in half and you have this beautiful
little mosaic of vegetarian deliciousness.

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:09.459
So, I'm just gonna do a few of these and arrange
them on this platter just to give you an idea.

00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:13.550
And I think we actually have some to taste.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.119
Are those back there?

00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:17.160
Do we maybe wanna pass them around?

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.739
So, we've got some peanut sauce and some spring
rolls to taste.

00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:28.430
And I'm just gonna make a couple more.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:34.290
Another great filling if you are doing these
for a party, is to buy--.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:43.360
Places like Costco or other big bulk stores
sell actually really decent premade pulled

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.509
pork.

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:52.179
There's like a Niman Ranch pulled pork that's
pretty inexpensive considering the amount

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:53.199
you get.

00:15:53.199 --> 00:16:00.799
And that makes a nice filling for something
like this.

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:04.589
If you wanna go a little bit less traditional.

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:12.509
I'll just do one more and show you what it
looks like.

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:19.240
And the trick is really not to let this get
too wet 'cause then it gets really hard to

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.809
work with.

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:29.789
&gt;&gt;male #1: Got a super yummy peanut sauce.

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:30.789
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Oh really?

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:31.789
Good.

00:16:31.789 --> 00:16:32.789
I'm glad you like it.

00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:34.600
It's really like crack peanut sauce.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.529
It's so good.

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:44.619
&gt;&gt; male #2: It is like crack.

00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:55.199
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: [laughs] Alright, So, I
would just go like that and add some peanut

00:16:55.199 --> 00:17:03.649
sauce and maybe take a little fresh cilantro.

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:08.250
And then if you're feeling really--.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.790
Like you're into molecular gastronomy or something,
which I am totally not.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.820
But I have a lot of respect for it.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.360
Maybe do something fancy like that.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.520
And for just a few bucks you have a really
cool, easy appetizer.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520
[applause]

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.300
Thank you.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.640
&gt;&gt;male #3: Could you list a few of the other
things that are on your 50 dollar--.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.290
Things you should have in your pantry list.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.412
&gt;&gt;Gabi Moskowitz: Do I have the list?

00:17:34.412 --> 00:17:35.412
&gt;&gt; male #3: Yeah.

00:17:35.412 --> 00:17:37.190
Can you name a few of the other ones besides--.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.450
&gt;&gt;Gabi Moskowitz: Yeah.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.450
Sure.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.670
All-purpose flour, extra virgin olive oil.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:47.670
And in the book I actually talk about some
of the extra virgin olive oils that are a

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.430
good bargain out there.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:55.860
Because I really don't think, I really don't
think you should be buying crappy bleached

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.890
flour or bottom of the barrel olive oil.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.600
I think that you should be buying quality
things.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.730
But you don't have to spend a lot of money.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.360
So, I include some tips on that.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.270
Things like baking powder, baking soda, and
kosher salt, and black pepper.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.080
Things that you'd be really surprised a lot
of people don't think of.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.660
Those are some of the basics.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.220
Let's see, mayonnaise is another great one.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:27.290
Because a cool trick to do with mayonnaise
is to make a quick aioli with a variety of

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.290
things.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.910
Just toss it in a blender or even whisk it
together with some chopped garlic and a little

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.230
lemon juice and salt and pepper.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:38.660
Or my favorite is mayonnaise and Sriracha
together.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.030
Eat it with sweet potato fries and it's unbelievable.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.269
Those are some examples.

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:48.300
&gt;&gt; male #4: Where do you get the inspiration
for your recipes?

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.970
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: My inspiration?

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.000
So, I live in San Francisco in the Mission
District.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:02.760
I don't know if anyone knows that area but
it's turned into a culinary mecca slash ghetto.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.610
[laughs] It's awesome.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.610
I live right by Delores Park and 18th street.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.610
There's this--.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.370
There's just restaurant after restaurant.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.740
Full of inspiration.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:19.630
So, one of my favorite things to do is to
go during happy hour when a lot of times small

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.000
plates are offered at a reduced price.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.860
And taste things and get inspiration.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.760
I'll make notes.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.100
And I also read other blogs constantly and
cookbooks.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.690
I watch not that much food TV.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.830
I'm not really that into reality television.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:45.700
But I do love watching things like Iron Chef
sometimes you can get a lot of ideas there.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.640
But mostly from restaurants.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.290
&gt;&gt; male #5: What are your top five restaurants
in Los Angeles?

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.980
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: I don't know.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.190
[laughs] I don't know.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.190
I love--.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.560
There's this place, I think it's around here
called Gialina.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.370
An Italian spot.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.600
Gialina.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.910
That's great.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.770
I really don't know the L.A. restaurant scene.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.770
I could tell you--.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.550
&gt;&gt; male #5: What about San Francisco?

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.230
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: San Francisco, OK.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:19.140
Let's see, there was this wonderful Pakistani
restaurant that just closed called, Lahore

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.000
Karahi.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.150
But the guy who owned it is going to be opening
up another one.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:31.600
And it was this hole in the wall but for nine
or ten dollars a person you could eat incredibly

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.730
well.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:39.740
I live very close to a great restaurant called
Delfina on 18th street,

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.740
[coughing]

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.740
In San Francisco.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.850
And it is outrageous and it has amazing pizza.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:44.850
We're sort of--.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.200
There's a big pizza trend right now in San
Francisco.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.190
Everybody's trying to outdo each other with
wood burning pizza.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.640
Wood burning stove pizza.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:00.990
So, that's definitely up there.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:06.080
There's this sushi spot at 16th and Valencia
in San Francisco called, Sushi Yo-Yo.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:12.200
And it's another one of those magical gems
where you can get incredibly fresh fish, really

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.450
innovative rolls, and things like that for
not a lot of money.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.300
It doesn't look like much, but you go in and
it's great.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:27.640
One of my favorite gastro pubs is this place
called The Monk's Kettle.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.870
That's an awesome spot.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:40.620
And-- Oh and then there's this nameless dim-sum
place on Clemens Street.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.380
I don't know what it's called, but it's directly
across the street from Green Apple Books.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.270
&gt;&gt; male #6: First of all you've ruined peanut
sauce.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.490
It was the best kept secret.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.000
It's so easy to make and now everybody knows
about it.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Awesome.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.920
&gt;&gt; male #6: That was like my favorite go to.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.990
Now the secret's out.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:00.000
So, I love cooking and one thing that I just
can't master is making my own pizza dough.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Oh.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.320
&gt;&gt; male #6: Do you have a kitchen nemesis
that you just can't--.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.320
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: No.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.320
OK.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.310
Well first of all I have a second book coming
out and it's all about things to do with pizza

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.310
dough.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.881
You should check out my pizza dough recipe
because it's awesome.

00:22:11.881 --> 00:22:18.270
It really is, I get that it's tricky but I
have a really simple recipe.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.350
Check it out.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.390
So, that's the first thing.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.690
Do I have a kitchen nemesis?

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:27.180
I did and you can read about it in the book.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:33.770
It took me a really long time to get homemade
mayonnaise down.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:38.850
And so, I tell a story in the book, I don't
think I include this detail which I'm about

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:45.000
to share which is that, the most, well, not
the most recent time I made it.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.500
But I tell a particular story about a time
when, it was like a week after I had been

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.990
unceremoniously dumped, and I 'm standing
in my kitchen and I'm making, I'm trying to

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.020
make aioli for my blog.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.830
'Cause I'm trying to distract myself with
work and it's not working and it looks just

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.760
like it had every other time I made it.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:14.710
A useless pile of oil and eggs with a few
drops of vinegar.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:20.710
But the cool thing about when you have a kitchen
nemesis, which I have learned, is that you

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.580
can Google whatever it is you're trying to
make.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.180
Thanks for that by the way guys, I really
appreciate it.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.180
[laughter]

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.240
And there are forums.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.490
There are forums on everything.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.450
So, I bet if you search 'trouble with pizza
dough'.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:41.120
I bet you will find a whole group of supportive
people who you can talk about your troubles

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120
with pizza dough.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.970
But you can also get some suggestions.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:52.340
So, the thing I learned from looking up mayonnaise
is that if you add few--.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.910
If your mayonnaise breaks, which is what it's
called when it falls apart, it just looks

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.250
like eggs and oil.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.030
Doesn't look like anything else.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.070
You slowly add drop by drop a little bit of
water.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.630
And you whisk and whisk and whisk and it brings
it back to life.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.550
And it fixed it and I felt a lot better.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.510
And I bet there's a solution with pizza dough.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.440
While we're talking about pizza dough can
you tell me what goes wrong?

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:21.330
&gt;&gt;male #6: It usually just ends up bready
than pizza doughy.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.870
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: More bready than pizza
doughy?

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:23.870
&gt;&gt; male #6: Yeah.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.870
It's like it's too thick.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.870
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: OK.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.870
&gt;&gt; male #6: It's not like New York pizza.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.000
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Here's the deal.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.900
So, first of all you may be using a little
too much flour.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:38.170
The other thing is the difference between
a puffy piece of white dough, bread dough,

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.410
or bread.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.990
And then pizza dough is that there's more
gluten in pizza dough.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.630
I know where in a war on gluten or something
right now.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:50.220
But you need to probably knead it more or
leave it in your stand up mixer for longer

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.220
because--.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.651
&gt;&gt; male #6: I've tried everything.

00:24:52.651 --> 00:24:53.651
I've done it by hand.

00:24:53.651 --> 00:24:54.651
I've done it in the Kitchen Aide mixer.

00:24:54.651 --> 00:24:55.651
I brought a bread maker.

00:24:55.651 --> 00:24:56.651
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Oh.

00:24:56.651 --> 00:24:57.651
&gt;&gt; male #6: It's just I am not able to slay
this dragon.

00:24:57.651 --> 00:25:00.280
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Well, you should try my
recipe for sure.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.280
[laughter]

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.310
I mean, really, I read is the thing I hear
most from people that it works from them.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.340
So, that's one.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:13.080
But the other thing is that maybe, or even
if it's not my recipe, maybe try a few different

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.080
recipes.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.080
Where--.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.080
Which recipe are you using?

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.080
&gt;&gt; male #6: Again, all.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080
[laughs]

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.080
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: All?

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.080
&gt;&gt; male #6: Yeah I just go online and you
know.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.080
But.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.860
Unfortunately I'm trying to duplicate a New
York style pizza.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.860
Which is probably--

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.860
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: OK.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.860
&gt;&gt; male #6: I think that's pretty--.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.860
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Well here's another thing
to think about.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.250
You may not be rolling it out thinly enough
when you bake the pizza.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.250
Because they--.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:38.680
You ever watch them in pizza restaurants they
roll them out, it's like super thin.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.470
Because there's yeast in it, it puffs up a
little bit.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.169
So, that may be an issue.

00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:44.270
&gt;&gt; male #6: How long do you let yours rest?

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.270
Is it-- can you make it the same day?

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.270
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: What's that?

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.250
&gt;&gt; male #6: Do you really let it set overnight
or do you--.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.720
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Oh no, no, no.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.640
I only do a short rise.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:58.750
I'll do two short rises like two 25 to 30
minute short rises and that seems to work.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:07.140
It is kind of cool to, after you've made it,
put it in a oiled Ziploc bag and leave it

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.680
in the fridge.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.650
And what happens is the flavor develops over
time so that's really great.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:18.650
Another good trick to make it thin without
breaking it is to take a bowl like this and

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:24.850
flip it over and lightly flour it and put
your stretched out dough on top.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:29.701
Which will help it maintain its shape and
keep it thin without breaking it.

00:26:29.701 --> 00:26:33.680
'Cause it can be sort of hard to pull when
you pull by hand.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.100
&gt;&gt;male #6: Is there an 800 help line?

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.700
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: [laughs] it’s a 900 line
actually.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.700
[laughter]

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.960
&gt;&gt; male presenter: I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about your experience actually

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:50.710
starting your blog and working with your blog
and using social media to promote it.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.120
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Sure.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120
Sure.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.350
So, I did not plan to be a food blogger.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.990
It was not the game plan.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:04.350
I got a degree from Emerson College in Theater
Education.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:09.010
Got a job right out of college teaching kindergarten.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.010
And it was great.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.120
It was really fun.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.720
And after about three years, I got to a point
where I started to feel like maybe wasn't

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.950
what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.080
So, I started thinking about what it is I
did want to do.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.080
And I--.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.080
One of my favorite things to do in the classroom
had been cooking with the kids.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.100
Because it was a great way to teach reading.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.470
I'd have them read the recipes.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.880
Science, we’d talk about how yeast works,
how baking soda works.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.930
Things like that.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:45.790
And math because there's if we were doubling
the recipe they'd have to figure that out.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.790
And sharing.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.120
And also a greater understanding of where
food comes from and what goes into cooking

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.430
and buying food and things like that.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.950
So, and I did wanna continue teaching in some
way.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:04.770
So, I kind of started, it was a funny idea
that developed into an actual business.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.720
This catering business.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.940
I would cater parties and I would also do
a lot of teaching.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:14.880
I would teach people how to cook basic things.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.670
I would do cooking classes for kids.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.170
I would do cooking parties.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:23.280
And it was really fun and much more lucrative
than teaching.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.820
And it was great.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.600
And that was going OK.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:35.610
And then a friend of mine and I started talking
about this trend we were noticing where all

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.950
our friends were having a hard time managing
to feed themselves well.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.850
So, we--.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.890
I had been writing a BlogSpot blog and it
was called, “out of the pantry."

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:47.940
It's still up there.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.780
Gabi Moskowitz dot com.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:56.180
And it was like it a combination of personal
stories and recipes and drawing comparison

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.630
between cooking and personal stories and things
like that.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:08.080
And so I made the leap into blogging solely
about food.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:16.510
And to my utter shock and surprise, two weeks
after I launched, MSN Money ran a story about

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.510
us.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:26.480
And all of a sudden we went from a few hundred
hits to 30 thousand overnight for a week or

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480
so.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:33.240
And so I very quickly determined that I needed
to monetize this thing and I managed to get

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240
some ads.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.310
I work with SAY Media who are fantastic.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.300
And I also got syndicated.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:47.620
So, there are a variety of newspapers and
websites and magazines that run my content

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.010
regularly.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:55.380
And it took about a year, but I got to a point
where I could leave my day job and blog full

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.380
time.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:06.970
And in January of 2011, yeah 2011, a publishing
house, Egg and Dart, reached out to me and

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.370
offered me a book deal.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:16.440
So, I feel unbelievably fortunate to get to
do the thing I love the most for a living.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.250
And it's thrilling and tons of fun.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.250
And it's--.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.400
I can't wait to find out what's gonna happen
next.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.650
So, that's sort of the journey.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.310
&gt;&gt; male #7: Hi.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.900
So, my question is more about tools in the
kitchen.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.760
So, you've talked a lot about the ingredients
you put into your food but for somebody that's

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.920
a beginner cook, they probably need to know
how to have things like knives, cutting boards.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:42.710
Can you talk a little bit about what are some
basic things you should have in the kitchen?

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.240
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: The favorite things to
have in the kitchen?

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240
&gt;&gt; male #7: Like tools.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.270
&gt;&gt; male #8: Basics.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.390
&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Basics.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.390
OK.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:56.970
So, one of the things I recommend people have,
once you've got your basic stuff, your knife,

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.840
your cutting board, a few simple pots and
pans.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:06.260
I always tell people "go to Target or Bed
Bath and Beyond and get one of the kits."

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.140
There are these sets that come with--.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:14.000
Won't cost you that much particularly if you
remember, like I never do, to bring your Bed

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.760
Bath and Beyond coupon.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.580
[laughter]

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.640
That just comes with all the basics.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.610
Good cutting board, good knife.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.760
Salt and pepper shakers that kind of thing.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.360
An immersion blender.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.400
Particularly if you have a small kitchen,
and you don't have a lot of space to work

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.480
with and you don't have a lot of money to
spend, buy a small--.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.960
An immersion blender for 40 or 50 bucks.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.420
Again, slightly less if you remember the coupon.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.770
It's great for making soups directly in the
pot.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.940
Once you start making soups that way, you
will never bother to pour hot liquid into

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.420
a food processor or blender again.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.880
It's so much better.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.710
But the other thing is they typically come
with a few different attachments.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.540
So, mine came with a little chopper attachment.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.520
So, it's like one of those mini Cuisinarts.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:13.610
So, the attachment, the base of the immersion
blender fits on to the chopper attachment

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:17.140
and I can chop ginger, garlic, onions.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.140
Anything.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.390
It's great for making hummus or pesto.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.880
Any sort of paste-like dip.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.960
And that's really great.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.390
It also comes with a whisk attachment which
is excellent for making whipped cream.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:35.260
Or beating egg whites if you were going to
make a soufflé or something like that.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:40.010
Or even just if you're making say, omelets
for lots of people and your arm is getting

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.670
tired from whisking and whisking and whisking.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.040
That's a great tool to have.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:52.240
And it also comes with a cup that like about
this big and you can place the whole immersion

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240
blender into it.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.140
And that's really great for making smoothies
or margaritas or things like that.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:03.830
So, I would say that is just so much value
in that little tool that I highly recommend

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.140
that.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.500
You know it's always good to have two or three
good wooden spoons.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:15.210
Some rubber scrapers, a good pancake flipper
which you can use for just about anything.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.460
Tongs are great.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:26.530
A really nice tip for shopping for this kind
of stuff by the way, if you don't go to Target,

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:30.020
is to go to a restaurant supply store.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.720
Because even if you don't get the discount,
usually you have to have a business I.D. number

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.230
to get a full discount.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:44.070
But even if you don't get the discount, you’re
still gonna be able to find the products there

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:50.110
for a whole lot less money than if you were
buying them at Sur La Table or something like

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.110
that.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:56.860
&gt;&gt; male #9: If you've taught a lot of beginners,
you must have seen some of the same mistakes

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.860
over and over again.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.600
Can you help us avoid those pitfalls?

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.630
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: Sure, sure.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:09.950
Well a really important thing is, whenever
you're working with hot chilies, wash your

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:11.210
hands.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:17.069
Or if you're working with the veins, these
are red bell peppers, but you can even see

00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:20.869
here, all peppers have this white vein.

00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:23.070
Don't touch it with your hands if you can
avoid it.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:29.639
And definitely don't touch your girlfriend
with your hands after you touch it.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:33.169
So, that's really important.

00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:38.070
Really the number one thing, the number one
thing that gets people in trouble in the kitchen

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.339
is a lack of confidence.

00:34:39.339 --> 00:34:41.179
They get all bogged down.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:46.109
You don't see people in the kitchen just blazing
forward.

00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:48.200
Very rare to see that kind of thing.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.200
It's more--.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.259
It more tends to be that people feel like
they can't do something.

00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:55.819
So, they reread the recipe a hundred times.

00:34:55.819 --> 00:35:02.170
And while that's happening their sauce burns
or something like that.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:06.220
Or really it's OK, but people feel like it's
not.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:13.380
So, there are, like I was saying before, there
are solutions out there that are really readily

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.210
available for most common kitchen problems.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:22.400
But the number one solution is to know that
if you're working with--.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.869
This is not brain surgery.

00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:32.161
If you're working with fresh ingredients and
you're not trying to flambé everything, it's

00:35:32.161 --> 00:35:33.970
probably gonna turn out pretty well.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:37.549
And if it doesn't, you're the only one who
is gonna know.

00:35:37.549 --> 00:35:40.850
So, just accept the compliments when they
come.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:46.970
But yeah, I can't really think of anything
that's like a major no-no that people do all

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:47.970
the time.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:56.119
I've seen kinds of silly things like, I had
a roommate who refrigerated red wine because

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:58.410
she thought it goes bad.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:06.650
So, I had to explain it's fermented and it's
not gonna go bad.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:13.170
I guess a really common kitchen mistake is,
and it's really a financial mistake also,

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:18.079
is that people let their food particularly
in their vegetable bin go bad.

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:23.980
And if you, it happens a lot when people have
a CSA box and don't really go through and

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.470
use everything regularly.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.900
And that's just basically taking money and
putting it in the compost bin.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:36.569
So, I really advise people to only buy what
they're gonna use and really make a point

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:37.569
to use it.

00:36:37.569 --> 00:36:40.260
&gt;&gt; male #10: Yeah, do you have any favorite
radio food shows?

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.649
There's a whole bunch of good food shows on
the radio.

00:36:43.649 --> 00:36:44.649
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: On the radio?

00:36:44.649 --> 00:36:45.649
&gt;&gt;male #10: Yeah.

00:36:45.649 --> 00:36:49.849
&gt;&gt; Gabi Moskowitz: there's this great one
out of Sonoma County called," Dining Around

00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:52.059
with Gene Burns" I think his name is.

00:36:52.059 --> 00:36:55.519
And he's a really fun host.

00:36:55.519 --> 00:37:03.599
And he talks about, he talks to different
food specialists, he goes to different restaurants.

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:05.339
He's pretty cool.

00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:08.310
Yeah, I would probably say that's my favorite
one.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.010
I don't listen to a ton of radio.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:14.119
But you're right there are a lot of really
good ones out there.

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:18.859
Thank you.

00:37:18.859 --> 00:37:21.220
