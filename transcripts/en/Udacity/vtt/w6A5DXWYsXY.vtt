00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.570
The five key data standards are,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.630
the International Classification
of Diseases, ICD.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.530
Current Procedural Terminology, CPT.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.590
Logical Observation Identifiers Names
and Codes, LOINC.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.820
National Drug Code NDC.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.110
And Systematized Nomenclature for
Medicine, or SNOMED.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.430
ICD and CPT are very widely used because
they're required in most cases for

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.160
medical billing.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.130
CPT and NDC are pretty much US specific.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.110
ICD, LOINC, and SNOMED
are internationally used ontologies,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.470
capable of representing clinical
relationships among their elements.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.290
NDC and CPT are classifications,
although CPT increasingly

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.480
has sub-codes to provide more details
about a procedure for use in billing.
