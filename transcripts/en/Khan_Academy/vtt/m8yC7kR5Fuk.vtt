00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.260
Let's say that f of x is
equal to the natural log of x,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.240
and we want to figure out what
the slope of the tangent line

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.030
to the curve f is when x
is equal to the number e.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.550
So here, x is equal
to the number e.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.080
The point e comma
1 is on the curve.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.720
f of e is 1.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.680
The natural log of e is 1.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.240
And I've drawn the slope
of the tangent line,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.144
or I've drawn the tangent line.

00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:32.060
And we need to figure
out what the slope of it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.380
is, or at least come up
with an expression for it.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.421
And I'm going to come up
with an expression using

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.510
both the formal definition
and the alternate definition.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.940
That will allow us to
compare them a little bit.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.096
So let's think about first
the formal definition.

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:45.470
So the formal
definition wants us

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.000
to find an expression for the
derivative of our function

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.630
at any x.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.890
So let's say that this is some
arbitrary x right over here.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.170
This would be the
point x comma f of x.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.180
And let's say that this is--
let's call this x plus h.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.170
So this distance right
over here is going to be h.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.100
This right over
here is going to be

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.460
the point, x plus
h f of x plus h.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.990
Now, the whole underlying
idea of the formal definition

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.500
of limits is to find the
slope of the secant line

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.960
between these two
points, and then

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.320
take the limit as
h approaches 0.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.540
As h gets closer and
closer, this blue point

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.600
is going to get closer and
closer and closer to x.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.380
And this point is going to
approach it on the curve.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.240
And the secant line
is going to become

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.320
a better and better and
better approximation

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.640
of the tangent line at x.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.030
So let's actually do that.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.880
So what's the slope
of the secant line?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.550
Well, it's the change in
your vertical axis, which

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.270
is going to be f of x
plus h minus f of x--

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.040
over the change in
your horizontal axis.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.210
And that's x plus h minus x.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.570
And we see here the
difference is just h.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.889
Over h.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.530
And we're going to
take the limit of that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.570
as h approaches 0.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.250
So in the case when f of
x is the natural log of x,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.340
this will reduce to the
limit as h approaches 0.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.120
f of x plus h is
the natural log of x

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.200
plus h minus the natural log
of x, all of that over h.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.620
So this right over here,
for our particular f of x,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.410
this is equal to f prime of x.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.460
So if we wanted to evaluate
this when x is equal to e,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.180
then everywhere we
see an x we just

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.530
have to replace it with an e.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.900
This is essentially
expressing our derivative

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.659
as a function of x.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.450
It's kind of a
crazy-looking function of x.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.140
You have a limit
here and all of that.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.050
But every place you see an x,
like any function definition,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.460
you can replace
it now with an e.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.650
So we can-- let me just do that.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.500
Whoops.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.560
I lost my screen.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.520
Here we go.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:20.390
So we could write
f prime of e is

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.410
equal to the limit as h
approaches 0 of natural log--

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.910
let me do it in the
same color so we

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.520
can keep track of things--
natural log of e plus h--

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.040
I'll just leave
that blank for now--

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.960
minus the natural log of
e, all of that over h.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.380
So just like that.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.860
This right over here, if
we evaluate this limit--

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.710
if we're able to and
we actually can--

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.500
if we are able to
evaluate this limit,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.180
this would give us the slope
of the tangent line when

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.270
x equals e.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.760
This is doing the
formal definition.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.370
Now let's do the
alternate definition.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.720
The alternate
definition-- if you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.442
don't want to find a
general derivative expressed

00:04:08.442 --> 00:04:10.150
as a function of x
like this and you just

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.470
want to find the slope
at a particular point,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.430
the alternate definition kind of
just gets straight to the point

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.209
there.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.070
So what they say is
hey, look, let's imagine

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.240
some other x value here.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.280
So let's imagine
some other x value.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.210
This right over here is
the point x comma-- well,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.222
we could say f of x or we could
even say the natural log of x.

00:04:36.222 --> 00:04:38.805
What is the slope of the secant
line between those two points?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.510
Well, it's going to be
your change in y values.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.480
So it's going to be
natural log of x minus 1--

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.140
let me do that red color--
over your change in x values.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.468
That's x minus e.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.810
So that's the slope of the
secant line between those two

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.432
points.

00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:12.390
Well, what if you want
to get the tangent line?

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.490
Well, let's just take the
limit as x approaches e.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.280
As x gets closer and
closer and closer,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.750
these points are going to get
closer and closer and closer,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.833
and the secant line is
going to better approximate

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:22.870
the tangent line.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.530
So we're just going to take
the limit as x approaches e.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.780
So either one of this.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.860
This is using the formal
definition of a limit.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.530
Let me make it clear that that
h does not belong part of it.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.798
So we could either do it
using the formal definition

00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:44.408
or the alternate definition
of the derivative.
