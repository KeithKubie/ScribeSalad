cat parasite called Toxoplasma gondii I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
cat parasite called Toxoplasma gondii I
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.750

parasitic manipulation while just you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
parasitic manipulation while just you
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.520

know reading about scientific research

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
know reading about scientific research
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.660
know reading about scientific research
and I came across a study that showed

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
and I came across a study that showed
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.920
and I came across a study that showed
that rodents that are infected with this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
that rodents that are infected with this
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.090
that rodents that are infected with this
parasite they can pick up the the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100
parasite they can pick up the the
 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.650
parasite they can pick up the the
parasite from the ground

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
parasite from the ground
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290

cats defecate this parasite so so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
cats defecate this parasite so so
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.060
cats defecate this parasite so so
rodents as they're scavenging around can

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
rodents as they're scavenging around can
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310
rodents as they're scavenging around can
pick up the parasite and it then invades

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
pick up the parasite and it then invades
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.230
pick up the parasite and it then invades
their brain and it actually tinkers with

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
their brain and it actually tinkers with
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.490
their brain and it actually tinkers with
the animals neural circuits in such a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
the animals neural circuits in such a
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.450
the animals neural circuits in such a
fashion that it makes it attracted to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
fashion that it makes it attracted to
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.960
fashion that it makes it attracted to
the scent of cat urine and when I say

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
the scent of cat urine and when I say
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.780
the scent of cat urine and when I say
attracted I mean sexually attracted the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
attracted I mean sexually attracted the
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.069
attracted I mean sexually attracted the
rodents become aroused it sexually

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
rodents become aroused it sexually
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.800
rodents become aroused it sexually
aroused by the scent of cat urine and so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
aroused by the scent of cat urine and so
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.450
aroused by the scent of cat urine and so
they approach and they needless to say

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
they approach and they needless to say
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950
they approach and they needless to say
they're not long for this world they

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
they're not long for this world they
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.920
they're not long for this world they
soon end up in the belly of a cat and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
soon end up in the belly of a cat and
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.780
soon end up in the belly of a cat and
that's the only place where this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
that's the only place where this
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.950
that's the only place where this
parasite can sexually replicate they say

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
parasite can sexually replicate they say
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.399
parasite can sexually replicate they say
that's that's its little trick and it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
that's that's its little trick and it
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.679
that's that's its little trick and it
does many other things as well for

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
does many other things as well for
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.260
does many other things as well for
example the same parasite goes to the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
example the same parasite goes to the
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.050
example the same parasite goes to the
testicles and jacks up production of the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
testicles and jacks up production of the
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.830
testicles and jacks up production of the
sex hormone testosterone in females by

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
sex hormone testosterone in females by
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.969
sex hormone testosterone in females by
means nobody's figured out yet it can

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979
means nobody's figured out yet it can
 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.859
means nobody's figured out yet it can
increase the level of the sex hormone

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
increase the level of the sex hormone
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.130
increase the level of the sex hormone
progesterone and in both cases these

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
progesterone and in both cases these
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.309
progesterone and in both cases these
changes make the rodent

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
changes make the rodent
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.850
changes make the rodent
more emboldened and caused the rodent to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
more emboldened and caused the rodent to
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.059
more emboldened and caused the rodent to
sort of lower its its guard and to act

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069
sort of lower its its guard and to act
 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.190
sort of lower its its guard and to act
in foolish ways around cats so that's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
in foolish ways around cats so that's
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.340
in foolish ways around cats so that's
yet another examples of other tricks it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350
yet another examples of other tricks it
 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.550
yet another examples of other tricks it
has for you know getting back into the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
has for you know getting back into the
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.199
has for you know getting back into the
belly of a cat this parasite can also

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
belly of a cat this parasite can also
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.940
belly of a cat this parasite can also
infect us one of the ways we can get it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
infect us one of the ways we can get it
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.010
infect us one of the ways we can get it
is changing a cat's litter box and the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
is changing a cat's litter box and the
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.759
is changing a cat's litter box and the
current thinking in medicine is that the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769
current thinking in medicine is that the
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.690
current thinking in medicine is that the
parasite mainly poses a threat to a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
parasite mainly poses a threat to a
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.830
parasite mainly poses a threat to a
developing fetus and it can hurt harm a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840
developing fetus and it can hurt harm a
 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.030
developing fetus and it can hurt harm a
developing baby's nervous system or even

called cause blindness and it's also

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120
called cause blindness and it's also
 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.470
called cause blindness and it's also
well known to be a threat to people who

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480
well known to be a threat to people who
 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.350
well known to be a threat to people who
are immunocompromised so for example

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
are immunocompromised so for example
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.600
are immunocompromised so for example

for most healthy people it poses no
 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.979
for most healthy people it poses no
threat that once the parasite gets

and they have uncovered a lot of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880
and they have uncovered a lot of
 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.660
and they have uncovered a lot of
evidence that for a small percentage of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670
evidence that for a small percentage of
 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.470

have adverse consequences nobody yet has
 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.160
have adverse consequences nobody yet has
a handle on what percentage but about

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170
a handle on what percentage but about
 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.060
a handle on what percentage but about
20% of all Americans are infected with

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070
20% of all Americans are infected with
 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.300
20% of all Americans are infected with
the parasite so people's guess is that

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
the parasite so people's guess is that
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.860
the parasite so people's guess is that
we're only talking about a small

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870
we're only talking about a small
 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.640
we're only talking about a small
percentage people have these adverse

percentage people have these adverse
 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.270
percentage people have these adverse
responses but among other things it's a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
responses but among other things it's a
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.199
responses but among other things it's a
link to mental illness so people with

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209
link to mental illness so people with
 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.319
link to mental illness so people with
schizophrenia for example they are 2 to

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329
schizophrenia for example they are 2 to
 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.690
schizophrenia for example they are 2 to
3 times more likely to have antigens

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700
3 times more likely to have antigens
 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.290
3 times more likely to have antigens
