feature set it's really important to
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.000
feature set it's really important to
first validate your assumptions about

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
first validate your assumptions about
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.970
first validate your assumptions about
whether users actually need your app in

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
whether users actually need your app in
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.310

the first place
 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.869
the first place
it sounds kind of crazy but you really

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
it sounds kind of crazy but you really
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490
it sounds kind of crazy but you really
have to validate that assumption first

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
have to validate that assumption first
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.670
have to validate that assumption first
and set the goals correctly so build

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
and set the goals correctly so build
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.110
and set the goals correctly so build
applications that people actually want

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
applications that people actually want
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.759
applications that people actually want
to use and then delight them with an

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
to use and then delight them with an
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130
to use and then delight them with an
amazing user experience getting the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
amazing user experience getting the
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.300
amazing user experience getting the
details of that right is going to be a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
details of that right is going to be a
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210
details of that right is going to be a
different series but I think that we can

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
different series but I think that we can
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.070
different series but I think that we can
start here with some real basics about

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
start here with some real basics about
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510
start here with some real basics about
that you can use to make sure that this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
that you can use to make sure that this
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.550
that you can use to make sure that this
is true and the first thing to remember

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
is true and the first thing to remember
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.600
is true and the first thing to remember
is usability really is job 1 for every

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610
is usability really is job 1 for every
 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.850

are some of these things are gonna sound

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
are some of these things are gonna sound
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.520
are some of these things are gonna sound
super basic and you say well these are

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
super basic and you say well these are
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.859

applications for tablets it's a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370
applications for tablets it's a
 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.190
applications for tablets it's a
fundamental mistake yeah exactly I think

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200
fundamental mistake yeah exactly I think
 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.039
fundamental mistake yeah exactly I think
to your point if the difference in usage

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049
to your point if the difference in usage
 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.620
to your point if the difference in usage
between smartphones and tablets on the

their environment and so on so it's not

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660
their environment and so on so it's not
 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.479

tablet maybe you're at home the context
 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.580

is very different and so you can then

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590
is very different and so you can then
 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.199
is very different and so you can then
optimize things more for content

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209

the environment you're attending to lots
 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.409
the environment you're attending to lots
of different things this reduces the

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419
of different things this reduces the
 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.790
of different things this reduces the
amount of attention this reduces the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800
amount of attention this reduces the
 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.040

to whatever app they're using so this is
 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.279
to whatever app they're using so this is
really important to think about because

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289
really important to think about because
 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.839
really important to think about because
I know a lot of you have heard or

wireframes or anything that you're
 

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.500
wireframes or anything that you're
drawing on paper you essentially just

drawing on paper you essentially just
 

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.970

take pictures off them and then wire
 

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.590
take pictures off them and then wire
them together and then create a flow

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600
them together and then create a flow
 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.470

so it's a really really good way to test

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.470
so it's a really really good way to test
 

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.810
so it's a really really good way to test
out your design make sure that you've

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:57.820
out your design make sure that you've
 

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.880
out your design make sure that you've
gotten the some of these touch targets

00:08:59.880 --> 00:08:59.890
gotten the some of these touch targets
 

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.590
gotten the some of these touch targets
right before you actually do the

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600
right before you actually do the
 

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.180
right before you actually do the
expensive part of actually prototyping

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:03.190
expensive part of actually prototyping
 

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.060
