00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.610
 of good sleep but here they took a 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.830
 red and quickly the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.690
 groups so the belo red but by 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.250

 aires would be one per city of mexico 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.280
 We are here in Bogota and in Buenos Aires 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.280
 as you know red is a wine 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.680

 sao paulo ni of course continues in 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.500
 san pablo- we continue developing 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.700
 open source applications open for 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.960
 the regional SMEs are 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.210
 contributions of money but you and 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.650

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.340
 vote out there 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.070
 but it does not take advantage to do promotion 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.470
 how the spy camera is used too 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.090

 you can comment and you can choose where 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.750
 is where the camera can be is 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.700
 change to the day so good concentric 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.050
 we warm up engines we prepare for 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.580
 the technical challenge that already comes too 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.080
 we have virtual mentors and mentors 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.060
 throughout the day so 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.730
 we heat engines and come back with a lot 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.660
 more level or but bosch 2013 edition 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.660
 bogotá we already smell 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.539
 william lion of the angel business group 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.490
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.460
 because we are learning python as 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.770
 crazy and I think there's no in the group 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.030
 we are all simply very good at what 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.009
 what are we doing and joining forces 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.770
 here to finish fast 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.050
 guillermo gómez the group 7 we are 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.960
 40 percent but we have the surprise 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.330
 it changes every morning and we all have all 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.569
 contributed many important things in the 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.870
 group but I rescued our 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.669
 partner who has a lot of knowledge and 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.389
 it does not help contributed too much more 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.099
 thank you 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.690
 good afternoon no man is july 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:18.819
 César a Erazo I am part of the group 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:23.480
 recycle then we take an approximate 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:25.820
 75 percent of the project and then 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.350
 we consider our genius 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.389
 It has always been our own manager 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.060
 who was he 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.610
 who originated the idea good my name 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.060
 is Ricardo Chiriboga from the group of 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.180
 agronomy 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.310
 It seems to me that the one who has given the most 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.410
 size in the group has been between 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.840
 designer and the project because they have 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.880
 tried to guide us on the 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.500
 idea my friend 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.220
 Didier is taking care of the part 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.280
 of the front end and the staff in submitting it 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.930
 on average by 40 percent we 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.750
 lack to expose the services to en point 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.620
 so that front-end person with his 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.620
 ah 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.120
 well good we continue in this developers 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.220
 2013 to you who are there to you who are 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.170
 there of course because finally you 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.420
 we talk about 6 connected with us 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.030
 in this virtual audience with a lot 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.500
 adrenaline of development really what 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.000
 we are enjoying a lot of good 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.370
 let's talk a little yes because 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.830
 we talk about the spy camera and your 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.780
 successes I tell you if already people 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.860
 wants to see says I want to see the camera 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:46.110
 spy in gloves so the spy camera 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.730
 of the bus is for three others 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.200
 André to you who is requesting it 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.150
 is moving the spy camera since you 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.370
 we show going to the group wanted to 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.090
 with we have more messages and assembling picón 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.510
 also and from the camera that goes if the 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.880
 you see 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.210
 well there we see the camera to see if it goes 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.220
 for the team we have the spy camera to 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.350
 see if it moves if you move the camera goes 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.560
 being out there look how that camera is going 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.560
 spy 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.169
 tremendous how the good camera goes the 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.460
 camera follows of course traveling 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.169
 the groups were left as was 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:25.330
 asking we started our approach 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:28.030
 technical but puerto rico's message 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:31.300
 several because lopez following us from 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.020
 puerto rico says that camera so 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.940
 came out spy 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.639
 these days all puerto rico 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.520
 sticking the footprint by sticking the footprint 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.229
 in a new message that incorporates the 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.479
 developer vos of course of all 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:47.560
 Latin America connected there is wanted 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:48.820
 and what stamina looks how perfect is 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.139
 spy camera continues to travel and 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.810
 we are going to go 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:55.150
 technologically this technical approach 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.220
 of today very quickly we are going to 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.810
 introduce we do not have to converse a 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.880
 little google maps 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.410
 we are going to present prediction and foot and the 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.669
 idea is that you who are there connected 

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.979
 of course and each teams 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:08.380
 can use all the suites of 

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:10.000
 space that Google proposes on the day of 

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.599
 yesterday and in the first of our days 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.550
 here in bogota 

00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:14.380
 we were also presenting the console 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.550
 of display you know you have to be 

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.630
 connected that there are lots of 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.920
 options and by 

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.890
 the groups are also using 

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.830
 good one of today's ideas central 

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:26.080
 is to use prediction and skin 

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.720
 Prediction option is very interesting in 

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.970
 this case prediction is the solution that 

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.130
 proposes the representation of networks 

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.350
 neuronal between the good and in what 

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.940
 I can justly call to make use of 

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.770
 a neural network oriented to services and 

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.170
 we do not want to roughly name any 

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.490
 way if this service is very 

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.380
 interesting supports two models 

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.970
 mathematicians as we always do 

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.250
 of categorization and that's very 

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.850
 interesting because it allows 

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.200
 permanently in the solutions 

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.970
 computer or in solutions in 

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.430
 overall we have to categorize 

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.590
 things do it in an intelligent way 

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.330
 somehow it is that it is very 

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.400
 interesting to cross from levels in 

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.470
 the applications then why 

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.120
 we invite you to use prediction and for 

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.580
 that we're going to show you that you're there 

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.020
 connected how to do it if not only 

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.370
 is categorization but we also have 

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.020
 the possibility of regression 

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.780
 numerical another mathematical model very 

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.130
 interesting that is usually associated or 

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.620
 you can understand more when we speak 

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.510
 of temperatures when we load a year 

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.510
 two or whatever amount of time 

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.400
 period and based on that model of 

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.650
 numbers and that we have the numerical model 

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.270
 we can predict what temperatures 

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.290
 could happen tomorrow or 

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.759
 anyone 

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.740
 and on the basis of all that knowledge 

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:34.959
 we can make decisions 

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.269
 correct and that is one of the ideas of 

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:38.980
 predictions and pious and then I ask you 

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:40.959
 Your successes that accompany me here and 

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.449
 we are going to go then very 

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:44.949
 quickly if this scenario where 

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:46.660
 we can use or where we can see 

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:50.009
 while the camera is already making the camera 

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.009
 is the ceiling stopped 

00:09:50.670 --> 00:10:03.790
 an apple and in google colombia me 

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.170
 I feel hopefully murdered but clear 

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.759
 the camera the fia shows us the 

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.350
 messages that really is that happy 

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:11.110
 that I'm with that camera traveling like this 

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.790
 ok let's go to the console then cloud 

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.800
 punto.com I will use the console 

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.560
 new bar with sun there we have all 

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.850
 the spice one and foot and more expression and 

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.139
 foot and so we have to have in 

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.000
 account that we have to generate a 

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:23.949
 project as we did also at 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.170
 long of these two days inside is the 

00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:27.730
 active project the gateway you need 

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.620
 use in the project and in this case 

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.899
 It is very important because to start 

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.370
 use prediction in version 16 and 

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:35.830
 I need the name of the project the number 

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.170
 of project previously in the other 

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:40.150
 it could not be freely so much 

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.170
 more ordered and to version 1.6 of 

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.720
 prediction that is the one that we are going to use 

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.640
 now we have then the side page 

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.740
 we are going to have to authorize us 

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.090
 again we go back to the open model 

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.180
 authentication so we have to 

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:55.300
 authorize and based on that we will load 

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.400
 information and that information that box 

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.910
 of information goes with that little box we're going to 

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.590
 train a model that model is the one 

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.000
 we are going to make inquiries 

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.130
 to always use the example of 

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.460
 languages ​​and I'll show you how 

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:12.220
 integrate with python two models one 

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.440
 based on language detection and other 

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.300
 of course based on feelings 

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.920
 of the people we are going to make a book of 

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.510
 visits that is used for example in 

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.700
 hotels that can be used to 

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.860
 public services for example if the bus 

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.680
 success brings agents the agent then 

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.390
 delivered a feedback yes it's always good 

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.780
 well, then let's do 

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.910
 queries to see automatically from 

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.800
 smarter way based on what 

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.450
 write people let's say this is 

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.490
 written in English in French or in 

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.370
 Spanish 

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.380
 people from different countries 

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.990
 I am international installation and 

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.240
 then based on that after we passed 

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.490
 from that review we're going to ask a 

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.990
 model that is already distressed in google 

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.430
 following the prediction that is already 

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.970
 available so that any lights that 

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:59.400
 does not lie down if it is zero if for 

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.990
 consult the sentiment be google has 

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.760
 left in this great neural network 

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.430
 amount of information to detect if 

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.740
 I'm not giving good feedback a 

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.589
 positive feedback a neutral feedback 

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:13.290
 negative negative feedback to that I do not wear it 

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:14.640
 more be good I need to see 

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.730
 but here in Colombia they will be very 

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.050
 good then automatically 

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.700
 consulting the two models 

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.680
 first to the model that we are going to load 

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.300
 us to detect the language and 

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.790
 second the google funded model 

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.440
 let's determine automatically 

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.480
 in a much smarter way our 

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.060
 visit book and let's color yes 

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.220
 with red and green colors each 

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.510
 the comments that people make 

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.910
 it seems you need it seems spectacular 

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:41.400
 at the same time then in this first model 

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.200
 this first bit of development 

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:47.280
 let's do 

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.170
 let's try the model of the model 

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.000
 language detection this player to 

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.660
 our based on a text file of 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.170
 406 lines only 

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:59.740
 he came with me 

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:02.139
 Here we have how we make try the 

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:05.139
 skins in general is usually used the 

00:13:02.139 --> 00:13:06.880
 tail and foot explorer yes to not make a 

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:10.089
 full development I'm just going to 

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.490
 try with parameters from this console 

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:13.870
 and that way already detect to see if 

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.490
 I'm doing the model correctly 

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.889
 notice that I am showing you here 

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:20.829
 the ipi explorer gluttony I will recharge the 

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:23.580
 page both the services we are going to 

00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:25.770
 look for prediction I had around here 

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:30.270
 version 1.6 of prediction notice that 

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:32.790
 I have all the methods that I can 

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.500
 access I have the difference that has 

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.300
 what to keep in mind is that I can do 

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.280
 a prediction based on models 

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.380
 which are the costed model in 

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.690
 the one that is made available google and 

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.850
 google prediction so you consume them 

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.410
 is massive and the other models are the 

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.560
 that I can charge look I'm going to 

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:51.450
 list these models this will fail in 

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.700
 first moment if this is going to fail 

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.110
 because I need to authorize me how they see 

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.730
 up here but we're going to make it fail 

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.230
 so that you also understand that 

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.960
 it is very important that they ask me first 

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.910
 what project to which project do I have 

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.410
 to consult then let's go to 

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.790
 look for our console I told them that 

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.010
 We are working on the project theme 

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.930
 It must be an adverb note here 

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.340
 I have the project number once 

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.410
 have this project number I'm going to paste 

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.630
 here and I'll tell you list me all the 

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.130
 models that have effectively fail 

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.320
 because he's saying that I'm not 

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.100
 authorized to create ok then let's 

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.400
 authorize us 

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.530
 notice that I only need 

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.760
 handle the data as well as permission of the 

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.370
 four permissions that I can have 

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.810
 available I authorize I do the 

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.550
 execution and here is already showing me 

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.800
 that I have two models one of the model that 

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.350
 it's called mexico and mx we're going to create the 

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.300
 model of Bogota but of course this takes 

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.890
 a few seconds then quickly if I 

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.370
 I would like to consult this model 

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:47.410
 if we are not going to generate quickly with 

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.250
 insert the model yes we're going to 

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.740
 insert a new model 

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.020
 we are going through Bogota this project that I am going to 

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.610
 use is the project the same project 

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.270
 that I was telling you this to authorize me 

00:14:54.610 --> 00:15:00.690
 have the pgje and prediction enabled 

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.850
 here I will be united 

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.430
 and I will call bogotá well 

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:08.670
 and what I need only to load 

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:10.889
 a model that I need that is that 

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.500
 I need the data from where I'm going to 

00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:15.209
 estimate if with what joke of where I'm going to 

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.160
 I will take this information out of 

00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:19.050
 cloud storage continues so where 

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.000
 encounter klaus thorax notice that here 

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.230
 I have my project I have the option 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.300
 to go to cloud storage 

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.370
 here I am entering I have different 

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.380
 baquets because inside close toral the 

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.480
 information is stored in baquets and so 

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.639
 what important are we going to use in it 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.630
 bortolotti test and we go to this file 

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:37.319
 of text that is called languages ​​if 

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.639
 notice the information that I am 

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:41.009
 loading that is part of the example is a 

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.610
 recipe I'm telling you this is in 

00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:43.440
 Spanish 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:47.190
 this is in english this is in french 

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.550
 generic text if collected and relieved 

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:52.769
 of internet if only 406 lines per 

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.199
 so the prediction is very elementary 

00:15:52.769 --> 00:15:56.579
 of what we are still doing but 

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:58.800
 if this file were larger by 

00:15:56.579 --> 00:16:00.540
 course that information that we are going to 

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.220
 to be able to provide feedback at all times is 

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.889
 much more accurate let's test if 

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.949
 works 

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:08.920
 well then how do we do this 

00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:11.980
 we have to tell him what he was going 

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:15.850
 is that information 

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:19.320
 so it would be this tac sandwich file 

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.320
 tac tac tac tac in the basket 

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.059
 look 

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:25.079
 now if we did it right the genre 

00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:29.399
 of the students 

00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:32.579
 lan wide and txt s is the address of 

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:34.589
 where I have to carry the load of 

00:16:32.579 --> 00:16:35.910
 the information so that the 

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:37.920
 model notice that here is telling me 

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:40.739
 what is there but you are going to insert a model 

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.600
 then list more permission to do it 

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:44.730
 then there we already gave it was a 

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.980
 control yes so that this can be 

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.869
 execute this takes a few seconds is 

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.809
 after a few seconds it goes away it looks for the 

00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:53.819
 information to klaus thorax of that 

00:16:51.809 --> 00:16:55.679
 file and it starts loading the model 

00:16:53.819 --> 00:16:57.600
 once the model is loaded it 

00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:59.069
 start training the network and it takes about 

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.679
 seconds more between when we have the 

00:16:59.069 --> 00:17:03.059
 model ready to consult if that is 

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:05.010
 you have to have a little patience that 

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:06.569
 depends on connectivity and depends on 

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.579
 course the servers that are on 

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:10.319
 another side receiving and training this 

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:13.799
 model yes good here we already have the 

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:17.069
 resolution took 22 thousand milliseconds more 

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:18.670
 or less and here you are already training 

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.500
 reads with 200 ok 

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:23.530
 this way now let's check 

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.630
 read quickly I will list here the 

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.670
 models let's check some the 

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.590
 Mexico models for example without 

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.410
 problems while training this 

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.480
 it's true that we're going and we're going to 

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.370
 ask some little things these things 

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.450
 what are we going to ask? 

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:41.530
 do in python yes very simple but let's 

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.450
 take a few seconds or I'll show you 

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:46.030
 a complete application of the book of 

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:48.430
 visits or an example where we're going to 

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.200
 do from the application to the 

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:53.860
 prediction and skin for now only 

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.750
 we are in the explorer and good here 

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:59.700
 I have the models if they are ready 

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:01.990
 bogotá mexico and mx if we are going to consult 

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.549
 well let's tell the mx that is the one 

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.580
 We are going to use 

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:09.309
 we are going to say that we are going to predict 

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:11.950
 then number of projects name of the 

00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:15.269
 model that I want to consult and text of 

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.929
 input which you have to evaluate for 

00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:19.450
 determine if what I'm writing 

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:22.900
 is in English in French or Spanish 

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:25.330
 if we always do the same 

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.760
 we can write whatever they want this goes 

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.590
 to depend on the accuracy of this going to 

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.950
 depend of course on the amount of 

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:35.580
 lines that we have 

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.860
 for in the file not good there I gave it 

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.409
 consult that model notice that it came out 

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:43.860
 200 ok says the hello answer my 

00:18:40.409 --> 00:18:45.600
 name is very complex is in Spanish what 

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.370
 who is writing in Spanish why 

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.830
 because the score that he brings out as you 

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:54.000
 they see that good is 0 in English in 

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:55.470
 French and 1 in Spanish already determined that 

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 what I am writing is in spanish 

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.000
 we can repeat this now 

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.850
 with something in English 

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:06.889
 ok I could be wrong to also have 

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:10.789
 syntax errors of course this 

00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:13.850
 everything depends on the text file 

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:17.559
 because from there the 

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:17.559
 network training that is so so 

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.250
 the return was that it is written in 

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.380
 English well now we have the 

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.690
 resolution this in the explorer let's 

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.810
 start using that model from 

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:33.570
 python and make the guestbook but 

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.430
 that comes in minutes josecito or in 

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.760
 minute so stay and connected 

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:40.350
 attentive because now let's check 

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.660
 have an application we are going to do 

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.310
 queries also to the costed model 

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.460
 to determine the suffering of the 

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.460
 people 

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:55.920
 for how things are coming in the 

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:57.660
 social network is very slow very slow it seems 

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.460
 that people are waking up late in 

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.560
 Saturday and we are working from 

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:06.260
 early but our friends in the 

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:08.690
 Very slow social networks 

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.780
 designer developers 

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:14.190
 developers on the roof the camera 

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.720
 It is on the roof but good they asked there 

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.580
 I am in a group I would like to know 

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.720
 where is it I'm going to get off before 

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.490
 I'm going down here with the groups 

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.520
 talk because live voice over 

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.930
 Of course, your voice is live there 

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.760
 will determine where the camera is 

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.190
 you can do already we were talking and 

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.160
 let's see in what state is each 

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:34.680
 group and if they cheer up if voices are encouraged 

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.590
 milestone make another challenge challenge 

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.080
 let's go to football ajn today I have a routine 

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:43.230
 more sporting base so let's 

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.090
 see challenge nick say here in 

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.860
 how many push-ups let's say we can do 

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.840
 on the floor so we have many things 

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.330
 to play with you 

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.730
 Let's see if we wake up a little with that 

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:58.050
 intrinsic training not to do 

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:59.040
 exercise is evident exactly so we 

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.780
 we take a few seconds 

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.400
 we continue heating engines we continue 

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.560
 enjoying this alina drink 

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.560
 technology that we live here in bogotá and 

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:11.090
 we come back with much more voice developer 

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.090
 2013 Bogota edition we are back 

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.130
 the google technology that I like the most 

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:49.010
 it's android because it's basically based 

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:51.299
 focused and connected with all the others 

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.710
 google technologies like that pain link 

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:54.840
 like the game the plus as is google 

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:57.059
 maps and how to implement it in 

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.830
 Android is very easy thanks to all the 

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:01.440
 documentation that has google in the 

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:04.040
 The penya game platform is 

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.210
 great for space and 

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.880
 availability that it offers to 

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.710
 developers and then android let's say 

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.720
 which is one of the most 

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.610
 used around the world that my 

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.570
 favorite humor technology is google 

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.450
 streetview 

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.380
 I think it helps a lot when 

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.680
 people 

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:27.670
 are cited to a place 

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:32.340
 to arrive exactly but before 

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:34.380
 get to the place you can visit the city 

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.690
 as a technology augmented reality 

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.240
 favorite glue google maps allows you 

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.820
 easily identify together generate 

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.070
 roads and be able to couple the developments 

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.080
 that do not emit favorite wave of google 

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.779
 google maps and the descriptive part 

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.500
 because it allows me to see different places 

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:52.450
 of the world from your house 

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.620
 the canyon of colorado the non-application 

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.620
 the maximums appear 

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:22.930
 the group there the bussiness 

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.940
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.990
 because we are learning python to the 

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.190
 crazy and I think there's no in the group 

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.450
 we are all simply very good at what 

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.000
 what are we doing and joining forces 

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:36.070
 here to finish fast today I spoke with 

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.420
 Guillermo Gómez I am from the group of 7 are 

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.420
 40 percent but we have 

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.620
 well we're still in this nursery 

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.750
 probos 2013 bogota edition here we are 

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.530
 enjoying together with all the groups by 

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.500
 all this adrenaline course 

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:54.390
 technological all this this innovation to 

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.220
 favor of regional SMEs all 

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.110
 applications continue to be refined as 

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.480
 we were watching we were talking 

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:03.600
 with you there are connected of course 

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.770
 all Latin America if we see some 

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.020
 parts of the technological scenario 

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:09.360
 we were presenting prediction and 

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.890
 We ask quickly how to use the 

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.930
 pencil from the explorer console 

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.910
 We were also analyzing the approach 

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:17.610
 social so you can of course 

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.960
 chat with us live yes for 

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.340
 course live you can join the 

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.350
 community developers and of course 

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.270
 find all the news all the 

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:26.070
 events that are happening in this 

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.950
 book but voice 2003 Bogota edition in 

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:31.200
 liverpool bus dot with google.com well 

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.090
 that we remind you that you can join 

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.350
 you can visit the portal of course and 

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.330
 join the developer community

 as you saw let's say how it comes but in 

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:11.820
 this moment is still a decision 

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:13.430
 by taking all the equipment have good 

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.320

 follow me that we will see to see in what 

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:35.540
 state are the development groups 

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.120
 as they were during the night 

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.680
 because they have spent programming refining 

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.630
 each of the applications now I 

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.820
 I'm going to go to the end here to see the 

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:46.670
 company I come to this group look 

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.680
 already has its well prepared here said 

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.510
 well I came the rest of the 

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.100
 developers are still tuning 

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.820
 some of the points came with 

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:57.740
 here we are going to come to group number 

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:59.510
 404 we're going to ask him why I 

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.090
 they were saying look it seems to me that 

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.210
 there is one of the groups that you are sure 

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.440
 of something so we're going to ask 

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:10.610
 come come with me talk to me here 

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:11.140
 As Andrew sees it, the next winner of the 

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.480
 level 

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:17.510
 without a doubt want it is the winner 

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.480
 I take the opportunity to give like one 

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.370
 more in our group to be able to win and 

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.100
 we have put the entire file 

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.450
 last night we were finishing the program 

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.059
 what we lack what we want is 

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.340
 present something already 

00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:32.960
 that you can see something that works 

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.309
 how our apps tell you in 

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.889
 Android are the only ones that we are 

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:38.870
 developing that in an application for 

00:26:36.889 --> 00:26:40.580
 who can see it on the afternoon of 

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.289
 today what a barbarian it is to carry 

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.749
 flags that are the only thing that are 

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:49.070
 developing a native application 

00:26:43.749 --> 00:26:50.450
 Android, do not come, come, come, come 

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.070
 come for guaranteed to see we are going to 

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:56.080
 respond live because look, said 

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.080
 andrew nothing but we are the only one here 

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:01.880
 they turn into a green problem you 

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.880
 we answer better money 

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.929
 perfect and then it is not what are not the 

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.890
 unique 

00:27:09.929 --> 00:27:12.890
 so 

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:22.240
 you are sure there have been four win 

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:24.820
 it's very single group number since 

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.870
 happened from bbb we have the native application 

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:30.760
 android besides the web part 

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:33.260
 responsible they have a 

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.500
 multiplatform for 

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:38.750
 perfect that's the last day to 

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.100
 android and it was cut or almost cut the 

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.990
 transmission but it does not matter of barren 

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.330
 earthquake so I know that this one too 

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:46.840
 has the native and also leave the 

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.220
 Responsive clear for any user 

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.870
 have other technologies, let's say 

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.920
 can of course use the green 

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:55.920
 limit and 

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.920
 okay 

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.240
 I thought 

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:14.620
 the one so that it appears with me does not occur in 

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:16.180
 this album come here of course no no 

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.070
 of course come here to look at me 

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.990
 we have didier here we are populating the 

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.540
 developer booster like you if you 

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:24.640
 we are also evaluating so what 

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:27.280
 they are developing in java also or not 

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.930
 they are doing what is called useful and 

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.390
 what model of persistence are 

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:34.800
 using we are using this now 

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:37.800
 it's juice from the peña ok and what model 

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.800
 tight 

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:45.150
 let's be able to the second application in 

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.150
 alive 

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.420
 the idea is to use it we are here 

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.220
 taking note of what we have seen in 

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.690
 our our perfect ok transmission 

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.610
 then let's see how it works 

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.410
 we say that group number 4 is a 

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.690
 solid candidate to earn money 

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:03.670
 production of 13 is the winner said 

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.590
 well let's see what happens we leave it 

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.050
 there was of course we wish 

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.690
 sit quiet do not get mad at anyone 

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:14.080
 quiet and I remember a colleague 

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:16.660
 friend of the community of argentina you 

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.540

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.310
 I do not know but Pablo for us Pablo 

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.660
 moyano sends a greeting if he is by 

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.400
 there following it too and notice that 

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.020
 has the same style also of hairstyle 

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.240
 that is very interesting to have 

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.020
 I come here player but concentrated 

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:36.600
 this group if here 

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:38.610
 in that audience development as 

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.980
 comes super concentrated you too 

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:45.240
 has a native application us 

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:47.870
 We are developing a mobile web as 

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.660
 how to shout or in his shouting standing said no 

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:52.950
 we are supporting the partners or 

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.840
 who are supporting this is very good 

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:56.820
 are supporting the mario group in the 

00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:02.010
 group because we are talking about a 

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:04.800
 alliance 89 with 34 for example yes to see 

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:06.990
 how the application then we have come 

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.490
 working based on the comments of 

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.800
 yesterday we have already made some 

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:13.290
 improvements on the application ok 

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.930
 we are already solving part of 

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.640
 the repositories ok perfect so either 

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.860
 it comes good we already have the back end 

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.900
 working and moving forward development 

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.890
 technical okey very well to see if you have 

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.900

00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:31.769
 group number 8 true 

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:36.730
 accompanying if we could evaluate the 

00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:39.340
 dance and there we see if we review the code 

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:40.869
 not of course depending on the votes 

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.309
 of the dance comes the revision of 

00:33:40.869 --> 00:33:43.720
 codes I want to see the code I want 

00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:45.039
 see the persistence see how it is 

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.330
 let's invite the group lady 

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:50.470
 number 8 that is concentrated come by 

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:52.450
 here Alejandro chose him so that's how they are 

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.519
 They are already good and it seems to me that 

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:57.070
 knows how to dance well to me it seems that 

00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:58.869
 will be hard for the dancer Jason and 

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.879
 we have to choose because in seconds 

00:33:58.869 --> 00:34:03.249
 we're just going to have to dance a 

00:34:00.879 --> 00:34:04.990
 typical Colombian dance but that 

00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:09.290
 we could dance to search quickly 

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:11.600
 a vallenato a sauce rim merengue 

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.250
 imagine vallenato we have it more 

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.929
 difficult I need it so I start 

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.850
 look there to see how we do with the 

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:18.980

 good photos now surely with this 

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:56.290
 are going to come several opinions already 

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:56.290
 we have with whom clear with you 

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.270

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:21.170
 jenson we are no longer losing the 

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.420
 control 

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:27.710
 to see if the evaluation is good after 

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.710
 a pair of sandpaper dances 

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.520
 I promise you that if I promise you 

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.520
 but she chose 

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:44.200
 it is complicated good is a support choose 

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:46.990
 software of course if it does not go 

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.570
 to have another another the driver then the 

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:51.750
 next video 

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:54.280
 a support a support to see who 

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:57.520
 syndrome can evaluate the code I am 

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:59.619
 I'm not going to evaluate the code myself 

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:04.060
 imagine we can not terms and 

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:09.810
 conditions and of course of course yes that 

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:09.810
 let's evaluate the game 

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:20.800
 it ended here we chose the partner 

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:23.589
 central mate here perfect there's no 

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.539
 how come companion 

00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:27.549
 also concentrated so we're going to 

00:36:25.539 --> 00:36:30.309
 take a few seconds we will relax 

00:36:27.549 --> 00:36:31.749
 we are going to warm up engines we are going to 

00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:33.609
 look for the musical theme and the 

00:36:31.749 --> 00:36:36.930
 dance on this level but you 2013 

00:36:33.609 --> 00:36:36.930
 Bogota edition let's talk 

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:43.070
 and we have all contributed a lot 

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:46.700
 important in the group but I rescue 

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:48.500
 to our partner who has a lot 

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.180
 knowledge and no help contributed 

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.950
 too much much more thank you 

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.450
 good afternoon no name is july 

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:57.580
 I'm an arm member of the group 

00:36:53.450 --> 00:37:02.180
 recycle then we take an approximate 

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:04.580
 75 percent of the project and then 

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.110
 we consider our genius 

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:08.150
 It has always been our own manager 

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:11.820
 who was he 

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:14.370
 who originated the idea good my name 

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.820
 is Ricardo Chiriboga from the group of 

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.940
 agronomy 

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:21.070
 It seems to me that the one who has given the most 

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.930
 size in the group has been between 

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.520
 designer and the project manager because 

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:28.330
 they have tried to guide us 

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:31.210
 about the idea my friend didier is 

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:33.850
 commissioning the front end part and 

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.920
 the back at that time we already have it in 

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:37.360
 average by 40 percent 

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.130
 we need to expose the services to the 

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.700
 account for that person of fernando 

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.700
 alonso 

00:37:54.760 --> 00:38:00.020
 Hello my name is Guillermo León 

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:03.200
 business group 

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:05.180
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.150
 because we are learning python as 

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:10.460
 crazy and I think there's no in the group 

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.720
 we are all simply very good at 

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.270
 what are we doing and joining forces 

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.400
 here to finish fast only with 

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:18.950
 guillermo gómez I am from group 7 we are 

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.650
 40% but we have the certainty that I 

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:24.020
 they finish tomorrow and we all have all 

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:27.230
 contributed many important things in the 

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:30.530
 group but I rescued our 

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:32.360
 partner who has a lot of knowledge and 

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.230
 I have not contributed much much more 

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.790
 thank you 

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:38.270

 Cesar aso I am part of the recycled group 

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:45.160
 we carry an approximate 75 percent 

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:47.500
 of the project and therefore 

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.030
 we consider our genius 

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.060
 it has always been our project manager 

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:54.450
 who was he 

00:38:51.060 --> 00:39:00.840
 what who originated the idea good my 

00:38:54.450 --> 00:39:03.060

 to see the code we forget the dance 

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:12.330
 why are we going to go into that detail 

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:13.970

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:17.060

 let someone dance 

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:29.420
 and we have an enemy we cut the 

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.609
 microphone to francisco so he does not speak 

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.320
 more and we continue to enjoy of course 

00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:38.089

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:32.030
 of course then applause from 

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.800
 developer bush 2013 here in Bogota for 

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:37.600
 the number one couple as they danced 

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.600
 Andres and sonia to see that applause 

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:44.710
 and then it would be enough now I think that 

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.810
 has everything all the fans of mexico go 

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.490
 to start voting like this is tremendously 

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:50.020
 little for digital uses neither 

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:52.030
 we export digital uses too 

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.890
 but let's ask for the applause here in 

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.990
 The developer voice of the couple number 2 

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:58.690
 where omar and daniela have danced 

00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:01.470
 also applause for couple number 2 

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.470
 how much 

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:09.080
 help me little voice help me who to whom 

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:12.610
 we check and improve but if we do 

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.610
 one last test to see see 

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.370
 the microphone to francisco let's give it 

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.960
 a few seconds to the whole audience 

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:29.750
 virtual and argentina 

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.010
 Just let's give 1 second to all the 

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.240
 audience that votes and we're going to go to 

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.770
 check the code so that's where we are 

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.300
 let's take a few seconds let's see 

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:38.870
 how this vote continues we continue 

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.730
 having fun out there I do you for 

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:43.280
 of course we have the code 

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:44.990
 presence of a mentor here live 

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.610
 next to us we are going to talk about more 

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:49.010
 so concentrate and we continue 

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:50.750
 having fun what am I saying social fun 

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:52.790
 there is the spy camera look at the area 

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:54.530
 effect and the spy camera of course 

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:56.270
 that will be turning around here with 

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.710
 a lot of adrenaline at this level 

00:44:56.270 --> 00:45:00.280
 but when it offers me decision game 

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.280
 size olems 

00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:16.740
 the one that has given the most in the group 

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:18.359
 It has been between the designer and the project 

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:22.440
 manager because they have tried to guide us 

00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:24.660
 in us about the idea my friend deals 

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:29.220
 is taking care of the front part 

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:31.530
 end and the backend submit them at 40 per 

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.420
 we are missing is to put the services 

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.540
 at point so that that person's 

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.540
 fernando 

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:54.440
 Hello my name is Guillermo León 

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:57.650
 group there business 

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:59.630
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.480
 because we are learning python as 

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:03.109
 crazy and I think there are no people in the 

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.880
 group 

00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:06.140
 we are all simply very good at what 

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.180
 what are we doing and joining forces 

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.849
 here to finish fast 

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:13.460
 guillermo gómez I am from group 7 we are 

00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:16.450
 40% but we have the certainty of a camera 

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.710
 every morning and we all have all contributed 

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:22.780
 many important things in the group 

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:25.430
 but I rescue our companion that 

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.200
 he has a lot of knowledge and does not help 

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.680
 contributed too much much more many 

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.210
 Thank you 

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:31.790
 good afternoon no man is july 

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:36.079
 Cesar Arzo I am part of the group recycles 

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:39.550
 pge we take an approximate of 75 

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:41.920
 percent of the project and then 

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:43.480
 we consider our genius 

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.480
 It has always been our project manager 

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:49.230
 who was he 

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:52.800
 what originated the idea of ​​my name 

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:54.450
 chiriboga good we continue in this 2013 

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.770
 we are really having a great time as 

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.780
 you come the teams are also 

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:59.730
 they have fun they really are 

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:02.700
 going past barbarian here at this level or 

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:04.470
 2013 tests the promise was to develop 

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.910
 about prediction and skin and we already have 

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:09.260
 our mentor to talk about 

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:11.580
 google maps so we're going quickly to 

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:13.109
 converse the final part of this challenge 

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.280
 I'll tell you quickly and then what 

00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:16.650
 you will be able to find in the repository 

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.480
 of course discovered that we have the 

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.100
 money but it's so I can analyze 

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.090
 line line each of the parts of the 

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.980
 code 

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:24.810
 we talk about foresight and ask to remind them 

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.490
 also that this is a full play network 

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.869
 complete so that's a point 

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:29.609
 important we also have a focus 

00:47:27.869 --> 00:47:31.560
 quite flexible and is multiplatform 

00:47:29.609 --> 00:47:33.660
 so let's have those three 

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:36.630
 features to be able to make use of 

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:38.700
 this much smarter approach to 

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.690
 our applications also talk 

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.030
 as I am going to show you in the 

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:44.160
 development that we can train data if 

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:46.619
 the models are flexible that they want 

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.850
 have once the network with a set of 

00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:49.530
 data but then he could and 

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:51.690
 permanently feeding and 

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.670
 learn much more than what is 

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:55.650
 and make much more correct decisions 

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.270
 therefore that is an important point 

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:58.950
 that we have to highlight prediction and 

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:01.800
 I'm showing you also a 

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:03.900
 workflow system a flow let's say 

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.480
 where you can see how the 

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.940
 information supports or out as we were 

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.560
 watching and it's also totally 

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:13.109
 aligned to the predictive brand mode 

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:14.670
 land guys which is the default model 

00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:15.780
 one of the default models that 

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:18.990
 uses a lot in neural networks 

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.460
 about http and https let's say they are the 

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:22.589
 characteristic questions let's see the 

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.109
 code you cited to see ok 

00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:27.720
 we said that we were going to make a book a 

00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:29.010
 guest book and we will take the 

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.270
 prediction are we going to take the 

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:32.640
 people's feeling of a model 

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:35.940
 predicted cost and we will infer 

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.680
 the language with our model looks 

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.470
 I show you quick of the john code 

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:44.520
 payton this code will be how you can see 

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:46.050
 I have the reference to the file that is the 

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.520
 language haydee and I will use the model 

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.740
 that we were 

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.510
 using of course forgiveness that is 

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.670
 call mx I have to put the name 

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:56.760
 project and the pic and because that way 

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.320
 I'm going to authorize the ip and to be able 

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.820
 use prediction and then I have 

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.010
 some models like training the 

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:04.440
 model check the model predict the 

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:07.440
 language and return the feeling of 

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.600
 people basically that then the rest 

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.810
 is the construction of the guestbook 

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.640
 yes good of course the code is 

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:17.460
 commented so you can see it with those 

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.960
 four methods that I have quickly 

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.490
 I can generate the application that I'm going to 

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.610
 do I need to deploy this 

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:24.630
 application that I already have it here to see 

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:26.850
 look 

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:28.710
 let's edit I want to test my book 

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:29.820
 visits of course I will deploy in 

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:31.860
 version 3 I am going to show you 

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.750
 quickly we will use social 

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:36.690
 learning are called social 

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:38.130
 learning the application in zinc app 

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:41.550
 notice that here we have it 

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:43.830
 this is social and learning version 1 and 2 

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:45.540
 if as you can see we are going to see 

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.680
 that the 2 is not working in this 

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.630
 dam movement there is an error 

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.210
 and we are going to unfold on version 3 

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:54.880
 there we have it if we do not have good a 

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:56.530
 error so it's not working let's 

00:49:54.880 --> 00:50:00.190
 to deploy our application here in 

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.640
 version 3 and in this way if the 

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:07.200
 we have 

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:07.200
 we display live we see the console 

00:50:07.319 --> 00:50:12.339
 I'm a little hoarse I do not know if you saw that 

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:14.020
 what a barbarian if here the groups asked 

00:50:12.339 --> 00:50:16.540
 that dance the vuce also quoted so 

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:18.130
 the ones that are there the salt if you want that 

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.859
 the vuce cited dance we're also going to do 

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:22.540
 and how good are there votes to dance 

00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:24.579
 so that also to dance for 

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.589
 ccoo the slogan of paco is that dance 

00:50:24.579 --> 00:50:29.200
 to the next one alive so if I 

00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:31.119
 You want of course if you ask for it too 

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.220
 you have it so here you can do 

00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:34.660
 two or that you're there connected what 

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:37.059
 we are passing the problem of one to 

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:38.500
 another of course as it comes complicated 

00:50:37.059 --> 00:50:40.900
 in the morning 

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.050
 but look how the vuce cited sensible 

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:46.000
 The responsability 

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:47.440
 I'm sweating ok 

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.660
 notice that we already deployed the application 

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:52.660
 here we have it if you are watching the 

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:55.030
 console we will see in the online console 

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:57.069
 yes we already have version 3 I'm going to 

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.780
 give default to use 

00:50:57.069 --> 00:51:00.700
 that that version 3 

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:03.460
 we are going to use here as you see 

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:05.950
 social learning and here we have it social 

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.510
 read a little points pop sign the book 

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:10.000
 of visits and the first thing we have to 

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:11.050
 to do is to authenticate we were going to take 

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.790
 our our 

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.560
 our our account and that way 

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:17.320
 is going to realize who is going to go 

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.450
 placing good each of the messages 

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.520
 and for example we can put messages in 

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:23.650
 English or messages in Spanish or in 

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.390
 French because they are the three elements 

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:28.870
 that we have the hate you for 

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:30.700
 example if we are going to send you we signed him 

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:32.860
 the visiting book and what the 

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:34.030
 return is that what we are in what 

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.360
 what we are writing is in English 

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:39.400
 you can see and mark them in red 

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:41.900
 because he says that and it's a comment 

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:46.779
 Negative or exact negative 

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:50.589
 this hotel is very good 

00:51:46.779 --> 00:51:51.939
 we also have to determine what is 

00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:54.099
 as we have for example this hotel 

00:51:51.939 --> 00:51:56.829
 he's very good is saying he's in 

00:51:54.099 --> 00:51:59.019
 Spanish and that the comment is positive 

00:51:56.829 --> 00:52:02.259
 and so we can put a lot of 

00:51:59.019 --> 00:52:04.119
 comments and go using or using 

00:52:02.259 --> 00:52:06.969
 the prediction intelligence for 

00:52:04.119 --> 00:52:07.929
 determine the signature of each of the 

00:52:06.969 --> 00:52:10.029
 comments that we have 

00:52:07.929 --> 00:52:10.719
 tasted was quoted now that very good I 

00:52:10.029 --> 00:52:12.519
 will serve a lot 

00:52:10.719 --> 00:52:14.919
 yesterday the applications much more 

00:52:12.519 --> 00:52:17.199
 interesting ok let's go pay then 

00:52:14.919 --> 00:52:19.779
 we already have our mentor let's talk 

00:52:17.199 --> 00:52:22.419
 from google maps to see what it is about 

00:52:19.779 --> 00:52:23.739
 we present and quickly we continue with 

00:52:22.419 --> 00:52:24.999
 this technological adrenaline here in 

00:52:23.739 --> 00:52:27.039
 Bogota for how we go with our 

00:52:24.999 --> 00:52:28.959
 mentor yes thanks nick here to me 

00:52:27.039 --> 00:52:30.880
 left can very much like 

00:52:28.959 --> 00:52:33.039
 accompany us not very happy thanks for 

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.509
 the invitation forward then if 

00:52:33.039 --> 00:52:36.460
 you want to talk about some maps already 

00:52:34.509 --> 00:52:39.490
 we have your presentation 

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.530
 to the public because the truth is more like my 

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:44.650
 experience because I am a developer 

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:46.540
 about 8 years ago I left and 

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:48.280
 Well, I'm already involved with the subject of 

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:50.170
 google apps about a year ago 

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.720
 year then then I want is like 

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:55.570
 count as the ease that then that 

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:58.510
 have these apps for one to learn and 

00:52:55.570 --> 00:53:00.310
 adopt them then let's say that then today 

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:01.810
 I will speak as my experience with 

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:04.720
 google maps and what I identified is 

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:08.140
 what is a is a free service that 

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:10.300
 google offers and that lends an amount 

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:12.210
 of very striking functionalities for 

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.580
 the people we develop 

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:17.410
 location-based applications 

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:19.839
 so then the kindness that has 

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:21.369
 is that it is multiplatform from my point 

00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:24.220
 of sight is to say that I can 

00:53:21.369 --> 00:53:26.380
 develop something for the web and I do not have 

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:27.940
 than to throw back code because if it 

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.470
 you've gone back to making lines of 

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:31.089
 code to develop it for mobile if 

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:35.610
 I can not reuse this code too 

00:53:31.089 --> 00:53:37.540
 is multilanguage, that is, if I am php 

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:40.270
 payton 

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:42.930
 in javascript all that I can adopt 

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:45.670
 and integrates them very easily 

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:48.130
 for the pgje of maps with my 

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:51.230
 applications whether mobile or web is a 

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:54.500
 free service obviously 

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:56.450
 according to the rules by restrictions 

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.090
 that we put for example then it is 

00:53:56.450 --> 00:54:01.390
 free while it's free to 

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:03.850
 the end users 

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:05.850
 also because I have been able to use 

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:08.700
 Various functionalities of 

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:10.530
 of this as for example the latitude and 

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.420
 length that is the basic one that tells me 

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:14.700
 let's say the cardinal points where I 

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.890
 I find the other points of 

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.340
 georeferencing geocoding 

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:22.500
 reverse seems to me something supremely 

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:23.830
 striking because that's what makes me 

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.170
 esla 

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:28.210
 the name of the streets then let's say 

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:31.030
 In the case of Bogotá, he tells me I'm in the 

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:32.350
 race 50 with street 144 then 

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.180
 let's say for example the applications that 

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:37.270
 they are watching last taxi right now and 

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.620
 all that then that's something is very 

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:41.880
 useful because it already tells me the address 

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:44.580
 Exactly where I am 

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:47.730
 very good well thank you very much really 

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:49.560
 interesting little s the concepts from 

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:51.390
 from experience let's say that the 

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.770
 let's continue of course they are not going to 

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:54.960
 accompany throughout the day and that 

00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:56.760
 let's go talking about map six 

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.390
 landmark buses but I want to tell you something 

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.330
 quickly 

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:02.730
 iván rueda says that baile paco bueno there 

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:05.580
 seeing them as a fundamental point 

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:08.070
 also to see what is going to happen at 

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.260
 long of our following following 

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:12.270
 the next block there's more nick dance and 

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.950
 the code is revised to see what was the 

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:16.680
 winning couple so keep voting 

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:18.870
 of course so you have time to 

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.360
 keep voting you are time to 

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:24.120
 continue commenting for ccoo we are 

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.280
 really very good pass very code and 

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:29.370
 a lot of fun we have some comment 

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:31.470
 more yes of course people 

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:34.050
 thanking the comments on 

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:36.140
 maps api there that has solved many 

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:38.150
 problems to people 

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.590
 They want us to concentrate from 

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:41.330
 now only in the programming and the 

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:44.330
 no more dancing equipment 

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:46.850
 I'm sorry it's good that makes me happy 

00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:58.010
 honestly so he treats me very well 

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:59.900
 well I think that's very good 

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.920
 team number one jumps we're always 

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.170
 talking about dancing 

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.180
 the dance cooperates do not be happy 

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:07.850
 that the definition comes from the 

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.770
 four by 16:30 by 4:30 pm 

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:12.110
 now vote so we have a lot to 

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:14.270
 To travel of course for us is 

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:16.490
 a pleasure yes to talk with you we are going 

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:18.410
 to continue reviewing the story with the 

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:20.660
 groups we have the camera where is the 

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:23.300
 camera that I do not know there is left in there 

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:25.580
 so well we keep seeing to see what 

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.710
 occurs between groups and of course 

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.140
 conversing with you enjoying 

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:31.970
 this live social approach together 

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:33.950
 you of this technological adrenaline 

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:36.890
 of this innovation that shows colombia 

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:39.200
 so let's take a space and 

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:41.900
 we come back and in an hour 

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.400
 a little voice more or less yes yes already 

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:46.450
 we're going live at three o'clock 

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.450
 the afternoon of colombia 

00:56:49.210 --> 00:57:00.730
 it seems a lot to me it seems a lot but 

00:56:53.390 --> 00:57:00.730
 well then let's go back 

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.220
 turn to the other side at 12 o'clock 

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:12.589
 noon we're back with a lot more 

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:14.359
 technological scenarios traversing each 

00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:15.859
 one of the groups and much more 

00:57:14.359 --> 00:57:19.450
 Much more 

00:57:15.859 --> 00:57:19.450
 2013 developers 

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:29.100
 But not me 

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:31.230
 It seems to me that the one who has given the most 

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:33.090
 size in the group has been between 

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:36.680
 designer and the project manager because 

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:36.680
 they have tried to guide us
