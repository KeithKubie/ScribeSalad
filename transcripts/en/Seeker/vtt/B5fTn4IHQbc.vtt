00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.760
Bacteria can get pretty small, with sizes
ranging typically from .2 to 10 microns.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.220
But can organisms get even smaller?

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.220
Answering that question isn’t just a fun
trivia fact, but could help us in our search

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.440
for extraterrestrial life.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.780
Viruses can get even smaller than bacteria,
with a single virus getting as small as just

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.960
20 nanometers, or ten times smaller than even
the most itty bitty bacterium.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.480
Technically though we don’t really count
viruses as being alive.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.480
They don’t eat or have a metabolism, but
even if they did they still can’t replicate

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.560
on their own.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.810
They need to hijack a host like a bacterium
in order to make copies of themselves, so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.449
without a host a virus can’t multiply.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.589
To really be alive an organism has to fit
all the microscopic machinery that allows

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.429
it to eat and self-replicate inside itself.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.809
And since these machines are on a molecular
scale, they’re limited by fundamental laws

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:50.809
of the universe.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.250
They can only get as small as molecules and
atoms will let them.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.660
So with that in mind scientists have calculated
that the absolute minimum size a free-living

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.119
organism can be is theoretically around 200
nanometers in diameter.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.710
So far that prediction seems to be holding
up, as the smallest living microbes we’ve

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.530
found are about that size..

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.030
And this lower size limit doesn’t just apply
to Earth microbes, it’s universal for all

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.170
carbon based life.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.100
But for some, they’re hoping that limit
is off.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.200
In 1996 researchers proposed nanoscopic structures
in a Martian meteorite might be the remains

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.490
of tiny life forms they dubbed nanobacteria.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.850
These supposed nanobacteria fossils were a
tenth the size of what we think is possible,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.610
too small to fit a single ribosome, a structure
cells need to make proteins so the claim was

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.320
met with a lot of skepticism and was never
proven.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.980
So sorry to dash your hopes about aliens but
it looks like 200 nanometers is about as small

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.180
as life can get.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.260
But that doesn’t mean we should stop looking.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.730
Here help me look.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.690
Even microorganisms have a story to tell.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.110
But they can’t make a website.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.110
You can.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.500
When you buy a domain name from Domain.com,
you’re taking the first steps in creating

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.710
an identity and vision for your brand.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.130
No domain extension will help tell your story
like a .COM or .NET domain name.

Worried about super bacteria?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.019
Check out this video on how scientists are
using their own defenses against them.

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.730
The smallest microbe we’ve found looks packed
to the brim with DNA and scientists think

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.200
it has to be parasitic to survive, so I wouldn’t
get your hopes up that independent life will

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
be smaller.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.409
That’s all for now, thanks for watching
