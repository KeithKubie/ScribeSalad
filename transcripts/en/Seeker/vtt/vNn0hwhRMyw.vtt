00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.040
Of all the planets in the universe that we
know of, the Earth is the only one with WiFi.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.330
Also breathable oxygen.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.019
So count your blessings.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.389
Hey there denizens of the internet, Jules
here for DNews.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.080
Unless you’re somehow watching this on a
bootleg flea market DNews DVD, you are in

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.539
the top 40%, congratulations!

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.990
I’m talking, of course, about people who
have internet access around the world.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.619
But unlike you lucky internet pioneers, there
are another 4.3 billion people on the planet,

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.010
who either have no way of accessing the web,
or can’t afford to.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.420
In fact, while Europe has a connection rate
of about 75%, in Africa, that number is closer

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.420
to just 20%.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.010
So, a few technology companies have tried
to bridge that gap.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.630
First up was Google, which began testing its
program in 2013.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.890
Google’s suggestion?

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.730
LTE equipped balloons.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.240
If sending WiFi capable balloons into the
sky sounds like the ravings of a lunatic,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.900
well, you’re not the only one.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.510
Which is why Google dubbed the project “Loon.”

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.310
Well that and it’s the last four letters
of “balloon.”

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.200
And a Loon is a kind of bird.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.710
Sometimes those Googlers are a little too
clever.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.230
Obviously there are some inherent challenges
to using balloons.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.230
Early tests had helium leaks which brought
the balloon back down to Earth after just

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.230
a day or two.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.900
Current R&amp;D is focused on keeping balloons
up for a hundred days or more, and its going

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.300
pretty well.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.440
Another problem is that balloons are not known
for being easy to control, that string they’re

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.150
attached to doesn’t really take directions.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.620
So Google’s plan to control the balloons
is to take advantage of the stratified winds

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.330
at different altitudes by raising and lowering
the Loon as high as 20km.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.440
With a network of hundreds of balloons all
being monitored by a command center Google

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.350
thinks they can create uninterrupted wireless
coverage.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.710
Plus, the balloons are solar powered.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.860
And if you’re worried about losing internet
at night when you’re trying to netflix and

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.640
chill, don’t worry, the solar panels charge
up a battery to keep the chilling happening

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640
all night.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.570
Not to be outdone, Facebook is trying to deliver
all your favorite cat videos by drone.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.580
The drone, named Aquila, which is latin for
Eagle because everything’s got to be a bird

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.909
reference, is a giant flying solar powered
wing.

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:13.849
The Aquila will use an infrared laser that
pulses on and off billions of times a second

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.489
to transmit data instead of sending it over
radio frequencies the way WiFi does.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.819
It’s kind of like a fiber optic cable but
without the cable.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.890
Basically facebook will literally beam memes.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.659
And if you’re into beans, it’ll beam bean
memes.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:29.950
But there’s a problem.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.989
Wings only work when air is flowing over them,
so, the drones need to keep moving.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.529
And since they’re solar powered, it would
be inefficient to store energy for the motors

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.019
to use at night.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.079
Facebook tackles both these problems by having
the drone gain altitude during the day and

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.989
gently drift down at night.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.299
Using this technique, an Aquila can stay in
the air for 90 days.

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.889
Its altitude will vary between 18 and 27 km,
at least 6 km higher than commercial aircraft.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:03.950
Facebook’s Aquila will transmit a limited
internet service called “free basics”,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.459
which provides forecasts, job searches, and
news for free.

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.390
But, obviously, nothing is really “free”.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.040
Free basics has been accused of violating
net neutrality because it limits access to

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.239
Facebook’s competitors.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.860
India actually banned the “free basics”
app on those grounds in February this year.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.239
Even the balloons have strings attached, hmm.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.499
Google controls almost 2 thirds of the search
engine market, and an influx of new users

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.199
means an influx of new revenue.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:34.239
There is still a long way to go before the
world really has global free internet, but

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.749
as long as there’s money to be made, these
projects will likely keep happening.

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:42.349
On the other hand, if you’re sick and tired
of the internet (I get it), check out this

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.280
video by Laura Ling, who visited a town that
bans cell phones and WiFi, just like its the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280
90s.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:04:16.470
So is having free internet worth the price
tag of playing into facebook’s or google’s

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.179
master plan?
