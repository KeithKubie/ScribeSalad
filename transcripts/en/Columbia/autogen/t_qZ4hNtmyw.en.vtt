looked at a lot of tools that would

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:29.510
looked at a lot of tools that would
 

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.850
looked at a lot of tools that would
automate transcription and none of them

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:33.860

websites sort of maintenance is a pain
 

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.890
websites sort of maintenance is a pain
if a website makes one change to how

they display their documents it might

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:03.650
they display their documents it might
 

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.659
they display their documents it might
break my scrapers and so we've set up a

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:07.669
break my scrapers and so we've set up a
 

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:10.240
break my scrapers and so we've set up a
intense monitoring system we Mike and I

get an email every afternoon letting us
 

00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:15.299
get an email every afternoon letting us
know sort of you know which scrapers

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:15.309
know sort of you know which scrapers

made noise today like something might be

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960
made noise today like something might be
 

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.430
made noise today like something might be
wrong and then we can go investigate and

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440
wrong and then we can go investigate and
 

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.140
wrong and then we can go investigate and
we've tried to be smart even about that

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.150
we've tried to be smart even about that
 

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.320
we've tried to be smart even about that
by learning things like judges like to

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:26.330
by learning things like judges like to
 

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.090
by learning things like judges like to
take a break just like faculty members

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:28.100
take a break just like faculty members
 

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.169
take a break just like faculty members
and sometimes there's a three-month

00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:29.179
and sometimes there's a three-month
 

00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:31.240
and sometimes there's a three-month
period where no opinions are coming out

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.250
period where no opinions are coming out
 

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.919
period where no opinions are coming out
and that's not because anything's broken

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:32.929
and that's not because anything's broken
 

00:22:32.929 --> 00:22:34.840
and that's not because anything's broken
but it's because they're you know out of

session and so we've tried to do things

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760
session and so we've tried to do things
 

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.090
session and so we've tried to do things
like have that status report email show

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:40.100
like have that status report email show
 

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.100
like have that status report email show
us what's an average number of documents

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.110
us what's an average number of documents
 

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.710
us what's an average number of documents
out of this court per week or per 10

out of this court per week or per 10
 

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.899
out of this court per week or per 10
days or per month and how many have we

days or per month and how many have we
 

00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:48.820
days or per month and how many have we
gotten recently and it's only when you

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:48.830
gotten recently and it's only when you
 

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.890
gotten recently and it's only when you
start to see something that looks

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:50.900
start to see something that looks
 

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.560
start to see something that looks
outside the norm that you really have to

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:53.570
outside the norm that you really have to
 

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.890
outside the norm that you really have to
worry but then another thing we've found

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:56.900
worry but then another thing we've found
 

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.799
worry but then another thing we've found
in doing this work is that especially at

00:22:59.799 --> 00:22:59.809
in doing this work is that especially at
 

00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:02.020
in doing this work is that especially at
the state court level they're

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:02.030
the state court level they're
 

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.240
the state court level they're
increasingly jumping right past

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.250

to start collecting that it's a lot it's
 

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.770
to start collecting that it's a lot it's
even more fun to watch the judges and

API because when you launch an API it's

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760
API because when you launch an API it's
 

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.640
API because when you launch an API it's
like you're taking the brain of your

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:23.650
like you're taking the brain of your
 

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.980

website and and opening it up to the

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:25.990
website and and opening it up to the
 

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.299

like API is one two three go okay so

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160
like API is one two three go okay so
 

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.160
like API is one two three go okay so
what I think I heard you say is we've

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:56.170
what I think I heard you say is we've
 

00:42:56.170 --> 00:43:01.950
what I think I heard you say is we've
been burned by api's before that so what

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960
been burned by api's before that so what
 

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.870
been burned by api's before that so what
goes wrong with API is there they're not

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880
goes wrong with API is there they're not
 

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.849
goes wrong with API is there they're not
powerful enough they don't let you poke

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:05.859
powerful enough they don't let you poke
 

00:43:05.859 --> 00:43:07.730
powerful enough they don't let you poke

building the site oh really care about
 

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:13.829
building the site oh really care about
them and so they stop working the way

00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839
them and so they stop working the way
 

00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:16.049
them and so they stop working the way
you expected they're frustrating to use

00:43:16.049 --> 00:43:16.059
you expected they're frustrating to use
 

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:17.670
you expected they're frustrating to use
because the people who built them don't

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680
because the people who built them don't
 

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.140
because the people who built them don't
have to use them as themselves and so

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.150
have to use them as themselves and so
 

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.819
have to use them as themselves and so
they don't do what you wish they would

00:43:20.819 --> 00:43:20.829
they don't do what you wish they would
 

00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:23.609
they don't do what you wish they would
do a lot of problems that stop them from

enough because it does what we needed to
do it's going to be simple enough

00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:29.609
do it's going to be simple enough
 

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:30.890
do it's going to be simple enough
because we would hate it if it wasn't

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900
because we would hate it if it wasn't
 

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.269
because we would hate it if it wasn't
simple and it's going to keep working

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:32.279
simple and it's going to keep working
 

00:44:32.279 --> 00:44:34.190
simple and it's going to keep working
because if it stops working then our

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200
because if it stops working then our
 

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.599
because if it stops working then our
users will tell us right away that it

users will tell us right away that it
 

00:44:35.609 --> 00:44:36.589
users will tell us right away that it
stopped working because they can no

00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599
stopped working because they can no
 

00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:39.109
stopped working because they can no
longer put stuff in folders so we're

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119
longer put stuff in folders so we're
 

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:41.960
longer put stuff in folders so we're
really excited about this API and I want

the plane as we fly it in particular I
think that the reverse question would be

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400
think that the reverse question would be
 

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.359
think that the reverse question would be
why do we still have the legal decisions

00:50:12.359 --> 00:50:12.369
why do we still have the legal decisions

to a private locks network and so I

00:50:27.089 --> 00:50:27.099
to a private locks network and so I
 

00:50:27.099 --> 00:50:28.589
to a private locks network and so I
think the answer to that governance

00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599
think the answer to that governance
 

00:50:28.599 --> 00:50:30.750
think the answer to that governance
question will be around how that private

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760

about the momentum that we have in our

about the momentum that we have in our
plane and where we're headed I think

00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559
plane and where we're headed I think
 

00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:51.840

that's the best I can do right now

of just informing the development of
your resources but also in terms of

your resources but also in terms of
 

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.630
your resources but also in terms of
promoting them among researchers and not

promoting them among researchers and not
 

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.180
promoting them among researchers and not
just in LA but other fields that often

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:12.190
just in LA but other fields that often
 

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.580
just in LA but other fields that often
draw upon law and legal resources and

kind of hard right you really do need to

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920
kind of hard right you really do need to
 

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.720
kind of hard right you really do need to
be in touch with your users and try and

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:27.730
be in touch with your users and try and
 

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:29.640
be in touch with your users and try and
get the feedback wherever you can and i

get the feedback wherever you can and i
 

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.170
get the feedback wherever you can and i
think you know we have probably haven't

done the best we can for that we've done

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:34.030
done the best we can for that we've done
 

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:36.240
done the best we can for that we've done
pretty well i think on the api side we

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:36.250
pretty well i think on the api side we
 

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:37.850
pretty well i think on the api side we
get a lot of feedback on that and

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:37.860
get a lot of feedback on that and
 

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.220
get a lot of feedback on that and
because people you know these it guys

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:40.230
because people you know these it guys
 

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.120
because people you know these it guys
like we're saying they're pretty awesome

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:42.130
like we're saying they're pretty awesome
 

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.940
like we're saying they're pretty awesome
and people really care and there are

people who you know our developers are
 

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.630
people who you know our developers are
kind of on the same so I think there can

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640
kind of on the same so I think there can
 

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.830
kind of on the same so I think there can
be sort of an impedance mismatch

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:49.840
be sort of an impedance mismatch
 

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.470
be sort of an impedance mismatch
sometimes between like developers and

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480
sometimes between like developers and
 

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.590
sometimes between like developers and
lawyers and your audience and getting

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:55.600
lawyers and your audience and getting
 

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.370
lawyers and your audience and getting
fast that can be kind of challenging i

00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.380
fast that can be kind of challenging i
 

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.480

very important part of the process

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140
very important part of the process
 

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:43.460
