00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.990
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good
evening and welcome.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.950 position:56%
Tonight's lecture by Haden Herrera,
Listening to Stone: The Art and Life

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.900 position:56%
of Isamu Noguchi, is the kickoff
event for our exciting Martha Graham

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.980
at the Library Festival,
a 10-day celebration

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.550
of dance, music and design.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.350
And I know that many of you
are already planning to come

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.030
to quite a few of our
upcoming events.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.740 position:56%
We are very, very pleased to be able

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.280
to mount three historic works
commissioned by the library

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.340 position:56%
from Martha Graham, including the
ballet Appalachian Spring with music

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.560
by Aaron Copeland, which has
become an icon of American culture.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.570
Also Cave of the Heart with Samuel
Barber's music, and Dark Meadow

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.170
with a score by Carlos Chavez.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.360
And this week we'll be sharing with
our audiences a beautiful video

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.210
of a brand-ew Library of
Congress dance commission

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.900
from Swedish choreographer
Pontus Lindberg,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.320
set to music by Irving Fine.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.890
So check out our website
next week for a preview.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.600
Tonight we are very, very delighted
to have Hayden Herrera here

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.970 position:56%
to offer us a scholar's introduction
to the eloquent and poetic work

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.210
of Isamu Noguchi, who
created sets for all three

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140
of the Martha Graham
ballets in the festival.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.060
The profound connection
between Graham and Noguchi,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.150
one of the most influential artists
of the 20th century, is in fact one

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.120
of the program threads
for the festival,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.370
as you'll see in the
program booklet you have.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.170
Miss Herrera has received
critical acclaim for her biography

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.870
of Noguchi, who commented that
dancers brought his sets to life.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.740
"Then the air becomes charged
with meaning and emotion,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.090
and form plays its integral part

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.600
in a reenactment of
a ritual," he wrote.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.710
"Theater is a ceremonial,
the performance is a rite.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.350
Sculpture in daily life
should or could be like this.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.870
They move, and the world moves."

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.130
Miss Herrera has also been
admired for her biographies

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.200
of two other great
modernist figures,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.510
Frida Kahlo and Arshile Gorky.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.950
After her talk,she'll be
signing copies of her book

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.400
and it will also be available

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.740
in the Library sale shop
during our festival.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.950
So we hope you'll join us
this week for more events.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.510
And now please join me in
welcoming Hayden Herrera.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.280
:

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.340
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Good evening.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.710
I'm very happy to be
participating in the festival.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.220
Martha Graham, she was
somebody that Noguchi adored.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.520
They had many [inaudible].

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.980
Apparently once she
actually slapped him.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.100
But he could be irritating.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.630
In any case, I'm very glad to be
here at the Library of Congress.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.890
And to put the first
-- that's actually --

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.490
let's go back for a second.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.310
Isamu Noguchi -- this
is a photograph.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.610
There he is.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.920
Isamu Noguchi, this is from
1946, was charming, articulate

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.080
and passionate about art.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.750
But there was, I think,
at his center something

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.900
that was very closed,
that was secretive.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.200
He was a man that did
not want to be known,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.390
and his sculpture likewise
is difficult to know.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.080
His reticence can be
felt in his sculptures

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.030
and especially those
carved in stone.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.770 position:56%
On the left is Integral, 1959, and
on the right is Childhood from 1970.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.350
Is that making a noise?

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.640
Maybe if I get back,
would that be better?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.260
Okay. The sculptures in
stone are self-contained,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.790
mysterious and still.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.430
Their energy moves inward, not
outward towards the viewer.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.770
It is an energy that does not
propel movement or gesture,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.840
but rather it creates
a kind of resonance.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.510
What Noguchi thought
of as a kind of hum.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.820
It was as if the atoms in mineral
were calling out to each other.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.250
People who knew Noguchi remark
on his intensely private nature.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.210
He himself spoke often of
being lonely and feeling

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.450
as if he belonged nowhere.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.550
His unhappy childhood
was certainly one source

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.700
of his emotional disconnect.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.670
On the left is Yone Noguchi,
the father of Noguchi,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.940
and his mother Leonie Gilmour,
American, on the right.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.320 position:56%
His American mother and his Japanese
father, both writers, never married.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.140 position:56%
And a few months before Noguchi was
born, his father went back to Japan.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.460
He basically sort of
abandoned his son and his wife,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.350
except that he wrote her a little
note saying, "You are my wife,"

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.470
but that was the extent
of them being married.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.020
When Noguchi was two, he
and his mother lived briefly

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.200
with his father in Tokyo.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.050
After that, Noguchi
saw his father rarely.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.750
"All I remember of my
earliest time," he said,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.650
"Is being a child with his mother.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.760
That was the total of my existence
all the time I was in Japan."

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.030
Because his mother had to learn
a living by teaching English,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.740
Nogouchi spent much
of his day alone.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.660
A couple of photographs
of Noguchi in Japan.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.980
I guess this must be -- the one

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.290
on the left must be
soon after he got there.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.870
And then he looks around
eight in his Samurai costume.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.560
And then this is his
passport photograph from 1918.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.460
So he was 14 there.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.990
Noguchi learned to be
extraordinarily independent

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.230
and his refusal to need anybody
increased when, at the age of 13 --

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.630
I guess he was 13 there then, yeah.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.260
Because he was born in November --

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.540
13, he travelled by
himself from Japan

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.350
to a boarding school in Indiana.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.510
And he did not see his
mother for five years.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.970 position:56%
When she and his half-sister
finally arrived in New York in 1922,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.230
Noguchi chose to live with them.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.970
But the mÃ©nage did not last long.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.400
In his autobiography,
Noguchi recalled

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.170
that he really resented the fact

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.450
that his mother had
sent him to America.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.280
He had felt deserted.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.790
He said, "My extreme
attachment never returned.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.860
And now the more motherly she
became, the more I resented her."

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.340
For all his resistance
to his mother's meddling,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.610 position:56%
Noguchi took her advice -- well,
reluctantly took her advice in 1924.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.330
And enrolled in the
Leonardo da Vinci Art School

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.880
on the Lower East Side.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.530
It was actually 10th street and
Tompkins Square in New York.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.320 position:56%
After only three months of study, he
became a skilled academic sculptor

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.420
and he held his first exhibition.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:49.320
So the guy was incredibly
skilled and talented.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.640
This is one of his
academic sculptures.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.020
It's called Undine,
and it's from 1926.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.150
In the year that he sculpted
Undine, Noguchi became dissatisfied

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.240
with his academic work and he began

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.240
to frequent galleries
showing modern art.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.540
He was particularly impressed

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.890
by a Brancusi show at
the Broomer Gallery.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.580
He said he was transfixed
by Noguchi's vision.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.270
In 1927, on the basis of
sculptures like Undine,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.060
he won a Guggenheim fellowship
and travelled to Paris,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.570
and for five months he served
as Brancusi's assistant.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.530
From Brancusi he learned to
have a reverence for materials

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.180
and also a deep respect for
the tools that he used to carve

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.320
and to polish sculptures.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.210 position:56%
He also loved Brancusi's simplicity.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.590
He said, "What Brancusi does
with a bird or the Japanese do

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.600
with a garden is to take
the essence of nature

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.340
and distill it just as a poet does.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.170
And that's what I'm interested
in: the poetic translation.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:04.950
To get to the kernel, to touch
most poignantly the key forms."

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.090
He didn't do any work while he
was an apprentice to Brancusi,

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.510
but the following year he had
his own studio, and you see him

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.450
in it in this photograph.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.120
It's 1928.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.210
And he began making his
first abstract sculptures.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.010
And these works were, of course,
heavily influenced by Brancusi.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.180
It was a bit of a struggle for
him to free himself from Brancusi.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.610
But he never actually did.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.090
And he ended up wanting
to be, sort of --

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:45.070
for Brancusi to be
part of his being.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:49.870
I'm just going to show
you a series of works

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:55.590
that show Brancusi's
continuing influence.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.410
This is Peking Duck.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.020
It was done in China in 1930.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.450
And this is a model
for what was going

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:11.440
to be then a little garden area in
the Lever House Plaza in New York.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.790
It's 1951.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.980
And this is a ceramic
called Man from 1952.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:26.570
And this is an exhibition from 1959
at the Stable Gallery in New York.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.290 position:56%
"To prepare for this show," he said,
"I worked with a fury in a cloud

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.590
of dust and chips and complete
immersion, oblivious to everything

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.070
but my own confrontation
with marble."

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:44.570
He recalled that for him,
the Stable show, this one,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.000
was really his homage to
Brancusi as he put it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.850
And here are three birds that were
done in preparation for this show

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.260
in a fury, although they
don't look very furious.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.620
They look extremely serene.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.490
They're all from 1958.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.620
And just a couple more
Brancusi-oid sculptures.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.170
Small Torso from 1958-62.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.110
And 20 years later,
the Detroit Pylon --

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.650
it's part of a great
park in Detroit.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.960
Maybe some of you have seen it.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.610
It's really inspired by
many of Brancusi's --

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:35.970 position:56%
their names are so similar --
Brancusi's towering sort of columns.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.670
This photograph was
taken in the '70's.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.950
The sculpture that he's sitting
near is called Another Land

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.260
and it's from 1968.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.190
As a child of mixed
parentage, Noguchi was subject

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.960
to prejudice both in
Japan and in the US.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.670
He always felt different
from other people.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.090
He always was a foreigner,
and he was always torn

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.570
by this conflict of east and west.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:13.740
In his autobiography he wrote,
"With my double nationality

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.210
and my double upbringing,
where was my home?

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.960
Where my affections?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.200 position:56%
Where my identity: Japan or America?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.160
Either or both?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.460
Or the world?"

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.750
Noguchi sought to resolve
this quandary through art.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.270
His father, he explained in
his Guggenheim application,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:41.620
was "An interpreter of the east
to the west through poetry.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.820
I wish to do the same
with sculpture."

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.760
More completely than any
other artist I think,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:55.090
Noguchi merged aspects of both his
mother's and his father's cultures,

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.690
creating a language which
was incredibly varied.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.660
And he did all kinds
of different things,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.600
but also it was very much his own.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.400
The east/west conflict and his
feeling of not belonging made

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.390
for a person for whom
intimate friendships were rare.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.700
With people, he could
be wary and untrusting.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.140
His most abiding attachment
was not to human beings,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.180
but to making sculpture,
particularly making sculptures

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.330
of stone for which he
shared a Japanese reverence.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.700 position:56%
I mean, it sounds as though he's
very standoffish, which he could be,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.210
but in fact the man was very
incredibly sophisticated

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:45.300
and charming and you know, would
have been a good dinner companion.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.570
But there was a limit to how much
you could know about Noguchi.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.150
To him stone was, "Our
fundament, the direct link

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.470
to the heart of the matter.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.840
It was the earth itself."

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.770 position:56%
For Noguchi, stone transcended time,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.900
and time's passage was a
constant worry for Noguchi.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:13.810
He wrote, "To counter the
passing, I would seek the enduring.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.180
From the depth of time-consuming
hardness," meaning stone,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.770
"I would find the lasting
and essential."

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:26.030
So carving stone was a way of
finding something that wasn't going

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.440
to disappear into the ether.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.980
This is a photograph of
Noguchi carving the disc

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.860
for the Beinecke Rare Book and
Manuscript Library at Yale.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.340
It's taken around 1963.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.770
Creating shapes and spaces out
of stone was an impassioned act.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:51.340
Sensuous, spiritual
and sometimes violent.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.540
He said, "I cut.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.360
I go to the jugular.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.870
I attack the stone with violence.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.310
Is this to tame it
or to awaken myself?"

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.850
And here he is not
looking very violent,

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.970
but I suspect he is
posing for a photograph.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.710 position:56%
Yep. In order to make a living after
he returned to New York from Paris,

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.120
where he worked with Brancusi,
he had to come back to New York

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.480 position:56%
because he was running out of money.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.660
And he came back and had no money.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.990 position:56%
So he had to put aside
abstraction in favor of portraiture.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.930
And here you see two portraits.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.880
The one on the left is of
Bernice Abbot, a photographer.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:42.930
And his great, great friend
Buckminster Fuller is on the right.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.280
They're both from 1929.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.140
His portraits are incredibly
varied too.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:55.930
He was incredibly successful as
a sculptor of heads and busts.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.330
And by 1930, he had saved enough
money to travel to China and Japan.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:07.070
And in Japan, he produced a group
of splendid sculptures out of clay.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.510
Some of them, like this one
which is called The Queen, 1931.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.110
It's in the Whitney
Museum, were influenced

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.750
by ancient Japanese grave
sculptures called Haniwa,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.670
which he greatly admired.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:28.070 position:56%
And he was back in New York in 1931,
and he participated in the struggles

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.140
of vanguard artists during
the Depression years.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.900
He knew everybody who ended
up in the New York school.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.050
Gorky was a great, great
friend, Arshile Gorky.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.310
Besides portraiture, he also
designed several monuments,

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:48.210
public sculptures that
had a social purpose.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.250
Here's one of them.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.620
These were deemed either
too visionary

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.160
or too modernistic to be built.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.250
This was just a sketch for one.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.950
It's called Monument to the Plow.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.830
It's 1933.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.350
It's prophetic of the earth works
that many American sculptors made

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.760
in the late 1960's and '70's.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.150 position:56%
It was to have been an earth pyramid
close to a mile long at each base.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.090
And he planned to have
one side plowed,

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:21.220
one planted and one left fallow.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.560
Another 1933 public sculpture

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.530
that also didn't get
made is Play Mountain.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.980
It was the first of Noguchi's many
unrealized playground proposals.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.630
He was very, very interested
in playgrounds

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.500
and had a childish side himself.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.390
Play Mountain was, he
said, "The kernel out of

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.960
which have grown all my ideas
relating sculpture to the earth."

00:17:52.960 --> 00:18:01.090
In 1942 -- Noguchi, as you see
during the Depression had shared

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.440
artists' poverty and also
their left wing politics.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.210
In 1942, Noguchi's social
conscience prompted him

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:16.350
to voluntarily enter an internment
camp for West Coast people

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.500
of Japanese origin, including
many that were American citizens.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.490
And the one he went to
was at Poston, Arizona.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.550
This is a photograph of it.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.720
He believed that he could
improve the lives of the internees

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.240
by creating a park and
a recreation center.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.430
His time there was
miserable and lonely and none

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.340
of his projects were built.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:42.380 position:56%
He was stuck in Poston for six
months, and he felt like a prisoner.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.480
He wrote to his friend, the
surrealist artist Man Ray.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.470 position:56%
He said, "This is the weirdest, most
unreal situation, like in a dream.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.510
I wish I were out here.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.040
Time has stopped and
nothing of any consequence,

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.310
nothing is of any value."

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.430
Well, he finally did escape.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:10.220 position:56%
Apparently, he was allowed to leave
temporarily, but he never went back.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.400
And he went to New York and took
a studio in McDougall Alley,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.020
and that's the studio
as you see here.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.520
After returning to New York,
he vowed to stop making art

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.350
that served social values.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.630
He said, "I decided
simply to be an artist."

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.230
He rented the studio.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:35.640
It's near Washington Square, and
it became like an oasis for him.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.150
He was very happy there.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.450
He loved it.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.280
And here he produced several
sculptures which have to do

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.300 position:56%
with his feeling about World War II.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.330
One of them is I am a Foxhole,

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.710
which later was called
The World is a Foxhole.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.950
It was made very soon after
he was released from Poston.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:01.320
Of this sculpture, Noguchi wrote,
"The war weighed heavily on my mind

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.540
after my escape from that reality,"
meaning Poston, "to the safety

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.840
and remoteness of New York."

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.020
The peace, he explained,
alludes to "the thoughts

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.860
of a soldier in a foxhole.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:22.500
A red rag atop a pole, a
signal of hope and despair."

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.300
Perhaps the most despairing

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:31.280
of Noguchi's wartime sculptures
is Monument to Heroes from 1943.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:39.380
Protruding from these holes in a
black cardboard cylinder are pieces

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.630
of wood, somewhat carved
pieces of wood.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:49.970
And actually I think there are
several human bones there as well.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.780
He said that the bones stood
for the remains of aviators

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.740
who did not return, or in his
words, "The bones of the unknown.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.590
The residue of bravery
blown by the winds."

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:11.050
In his McDougall Alley
studio in the mid-'40's,

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.150
Noguchi carved what are
perhaps his most-loved works.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.830
The surrealist inspired abstract
figures carved out of thin slabs

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.740
of stone or wood and
then constructed

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.120
out of notched, interlocking parts.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.250
He loved their fragility.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.620
The feeling that they could
collapse and fall at any moment,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.430
like blossoms from a cherry tree.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:39.480
Of Kouros, this sculpture
here, you're seeing him

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.850
and the sculpture there at a
1946 exhibition at the Museum

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.190
of Modern Art of many --
it was a group exhibition.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.290
14 Americans, it was called.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:58.910
Of Kouros, 1945, the largest of the
interlocking sculptures, he said,

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:05.750
"The structure of Kouros defies
gravity, defies time in a sense.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.050
It's like life.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.940
You can lose it at any moment."

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.480
Kouros and many of the other
sculptures were inspired

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.010 position:56%
by archaic Greek Appolonian figures.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.940 position:56%
They were called Kouros, and there's
a marvelous one in the Museum

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.630
of Modern Art that he admired.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:29.590
Noguchi's Kouros is magisterial
I think, and even heroic.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:35.590
In a letter, Noguchi wrote that
it expressed, "An affirmation."

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:40.380
It was much less negative
than the wartime sculptures.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.680
"An affirmation.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.730
I wanted something purposeful.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:47.000
Bigger than our individual selves.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.890
Classical and idealistic.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.940
Representative of something
that doesn't pass

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.040
with the passage of time."

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.690
Just another of these
interlocking sculptures.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.300
Some of them convey, I
think -- and this one does.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.660
It's called Remembrance from 1944.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.730
A mood of melancholy.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:14.450
Noguchi said, "There are many
sides of me I want to express.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.040
The loneliness, the sadness,
and then something about me

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.380
which you might call
precise and dry,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.570
which I want to express as well.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.200
I wouldn't want to express
only my serious side.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.370
I am also playful sometimes.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.260
And then again, completely
introspective."

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.030
This sculpture is carved
out of mahogany in 1944,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.320
and I think it does, like some
of Arshile Gorky's drawings

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.790
from the '30's, convey a
feeling of loss and longing.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:53.380
Likewise, the aluminum Hanging
Man on the left from 1945,

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.880 position:56%
and the balsa wood Kronos from 1947,

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.100
on the right envisage the
human figure as despairing.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.910
Noguchi described the sprout shapes
inside the arch form in Kronos,

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.830
the one on the right,
as falling tears.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.420
He also saw these shapes as
the limbs of Kronos' sons

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.390
who are being devoured
by their father.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.200
In a rare avow of an
autobiographical connection

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.750
to his subject matter, Noguchi
said that Kronos alluded

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.980
to his own father's hostility
towards him, and his own ambition

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.940
to surpass his father's fame.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.380
This is Sculpture to
be Seen from Mars.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.720
It's 1947.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.530
He did it the same year
that he carved Kronos.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:53.390
He actually just formed a model
for this sculpture out of sand,

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.870
and that's all that
exists, is the photograph

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.980
of this model made of sand.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.080
The war and the bombings
of Hiroshima

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.670
and Nagasaki had left Noguchi with
a keen awareness of transience

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.170 position:56%
and a deep fear of atomic cataclysm.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.870 position:56%
He talks about that atomic cataclysm
all the time in his letters.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.560
This sculpture, as I said,
recorded only in a photograph,

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.080
was to have been a
10-mile long earth work.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.370
A face staring upward with a
mile-high pyramid for a nose.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:32.220
Noguchi said the face was a
memorial for extinct mankind.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.000
It would be proof to Martians

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.030
that human beings had
once inhabited the earth.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:42.070
When Noguchi returned to Japan in
the early '50's, he was received,

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.520
he said, like the pigeon
coming from Noah's ark.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.400
He was swamped by people,
especially artists, wanting to know

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.130
about the latest thing that
was happening in Western art.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:56.400
Because Japan had been so
cut off during the war.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:04.820
While in Japan, Noguchi made
models for two Hiroshima memorials,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.210
neither of which was built.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.160
On the left is Bell Tower
for Hiroshima, 1950.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.140
It was intended to be a 70-foot
tower, and it was supposed

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.120
to be placed in the
Hiroshima Peace Park.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.300
On the right, Memorial for the
Dead, 1952, was also planned

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.270
for the Peace Park, and it
would have been a massive black

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.760
granite arch.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.260
And Noguchi saw the part -- this
would be the level of the earth.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.540
I don't -- anyway, where
you see that sort of grid.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.840
That's the level of the earth.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.280
And then underneath was to
be the place which he saw

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.210
as the womb of generations.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.190 position:56%
You can almost see this is two legs.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.940
And also he called it

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.970
"a cave beneath the earth,
to which we all return."

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.780
Years later, Noguchi used
the same arch shape --

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.020
I showed you earlier
the Pylon in Detroit.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.880
And this is in the same
sort of park space.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.530
It's his Horace E. Dodge fountain.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:20.360
He took from 1972-1979
to complete it.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.830
But both of them have this.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.380
He loved an arch shape.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.360
The idea of, as he said,
there was the Memorial

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.900
for Hiroshima he thought of
as having a womb underneath.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.110
This one is a little bit the same

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.580
and can be seen as
an image of birth.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.080
Now Noguchi did get married once.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.540
He was married for five years

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.520
to a Japanese film star
called Yoshiko Yamaguchi.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.960
He tried to become, during this
time Japanese, to belong to a place

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.850
and to resolve his
conflict of East and West.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:08.550
In 1952, he and Yamaguchi lived
in a traditional Japanese house.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:12.830
That's this house they're
sitting in the veranda.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:17.010
Overlooking rice paddies
in Kita Kamakura.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.650
They dressed in kimonos, ate
Japanese food seated on the floor,

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.320 position:56%
bathed in a Japanese tub, et cetera.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.330
It was, Noguchi said, one of
the happiest years of his life.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.700
And during it he produced many
wonderfully spontaneous clay

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.290
sculptures, such as the one on
the left which is called Marriage.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.700
And the one on the right
is Even the Centipede.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.480
There were a lot of centipedes in
the house, and he got used to them.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.170
The one on the right is in New
York's Museum of Modern Art.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:52.110
But life in Kita Kamakura
was not always idyllic.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:57.170
One day when Yamaguchi returned
from a day of filming --

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.790 position:56%
she was a very successful actress --

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:03.490
in Tokyo, she had exchanged
the Japanese sandals.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:04.910
Let me just go back.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.480
See those sandals on
the ground there?

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.970
Anyway, she had exchanged
the Japanese sandals

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:17.210
that Noguchi insisted she wear
and that made her feet bleed.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.980
And she put on a pair
of pink plastic sandals.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.200
Footwear that represented to
Noguchi the distasteful post-war

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.600
Americanization of Japan.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.780
Noguchi threw his wife's pink
sandals into a rice paddy.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.930
For Yamaguchi, this
was the last straw.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.080
At least her brother-in-law
said it was the last straw.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.280
I think there were
probably many last straws.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.100
Yamaguchi found it very
difficult to be molded into one

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.580
of her husband's artworks.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:52.300
And to be really a prop
in the drama of his search

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.500
for his Japanese identity.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.500
After Yamaguchi left him,
Noguchi took refuge in work.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.860
"My solace has always
been sculpture," he said.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:09.130
And he produced in Japan a series
of metal sculptures, either iron

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:14.740
or bronze, that were inspired
by ancient Japanese iron pots

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.930
and also the wonderful
Japanese bronze bells.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:25.290
Endless Coupling, the
one on the left, 1956,

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.040
and the one on the right
is called The Self.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.560
The Endless Coupling I think is,
for all its Brancusian majesty,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.150
an amazingly non-intimate
view of sexual intercourse.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:44.310
In The Self on the right, an iron
loop is held almost shut by six,

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.690
what you could call either
sprouts or fingers or shapes,

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.760
so that The Self can be
seen as hugging itself

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.970
and perhaps holding itself together
in a period of emotional loss.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.790
That's an interpretation.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.090
It may not be that way.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:13.320
Back in 1945, Noguchi
had carved a similar

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.300
but much more sensuous sculpture
which you see on the left.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.160
It's called Noodle.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.460
But both sculptures are very
similar in having a kind of loop

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:28.050
with these kind of sprout
shapes in the middle.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.560
It's -- always with Noguchi --

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.080
you could see it as him
guarding his inner life,

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.980
these kind of enclosed shapes.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:45.660
But always -- many of Noguchi's
sculptures are full of allusions

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.970
to fertility, emergence and growth.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.340
Another one.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.210
Now we're comparing Noodle
to Humpty-Dumpty, 1946.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.640
The one on the left
is just a year later.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.940
It's the same thing.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.790
An arch with a lot of organic

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.220
or biomorphic shapes
poking out of the middle.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:13.160
Humpty-Dumpty is like a dour
version of his bumptious Noodle

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.810
with its protruding sprout
forms contained in an arch,

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.300
favorite Noguchi shape, the arch.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.850 position:56%
It had, Noguchi told a friend, to do
with "Things that happen at night.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.550
Somber things."

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:31.920
Sculptures like these with loops or
arches enclosing biomorphic shapes,

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.330
again I think bring
to mind Noguchi's need

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.210
to keep the world at bay.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.760
In a number of Noguchi's
sculptures from the 1940's,

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:48.230
energy seems to pull inward rather
than thrusting outward into space.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:54.720
This one is Leda from
1942, highly sensuous.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.330
And then Lunar Infant from 1944.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.290
There's a light inside.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:05.720
And then The Ring from 1945-48.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.330
Everything is sort of going inward
rather than bursting outward.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:15.470
And likewise in Mio, which you
see on the left, and The Gift --

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.670
Mio on the left took him
a long time to figure

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.120
out what to do with that stone.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:27.390
It took from 1957-1966, so nine
years, the one on the left.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.250
And then the one on the
right is called The Gift.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.550
It's from '64.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:35.460
In both of them, energy moves
inward creating a strong sensation

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.890
of compression, rather
than expansion.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:46.670
In Shotoshima on the left, '78',
1978, two arms embrace a cluster

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:52.740
of granite eggs, suggesting once
again Noguchi's defendant self.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.260
Again, it's just an interpretation.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:02.710
Similarly, in Spirit of the Lima
Bean, 1980-81, on the right,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.130
egg-like boulders seem
to huddle for comfort.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.260
They seem to pull inward.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.310
Now there are some
sculptures that don't do that.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:18.690
From 1959, come a group of balsa
wood sculptures, such as The Cry

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.040
on the left, and Solitude
on the right.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.010
Which with their long pendulous
elements convey a downhearted state

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.440
of mind.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.510
The Cry's oval head, which
actually reminds me of Brancusi,

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.950
is cut with a hollow form from
which the Cry must shoot forth.

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:44.560
And the attached length of
wood, very precarious looking --

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.420
I don't know, it's either
projection of the Cry,

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.190 position:56%
or maybe I'm being much too literal.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.750 position:56%
Or maybe an arm flailing in despair.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:58.630
But anyway, it does -- you
can see it as part of an image

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.010
of a loud and desperate cry.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.540
This one is called Mortality.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.050
It's a 1959.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:16.510
He did it in balsa wood, but
then in '62 he went to Italy

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.080 position:56%
and had many of them cast in bronze.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.540
So this looks like bronze to me.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:27.050
The pendent elements in Mortality
capture the down-pulling sensation

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.930
of depression.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:34.320
Of this sculpture, Noguchi wrote,
"The mortal remains of skin

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.980
and bones, the tears of things.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:42.830
Our pendulous and precarious
existence is shaped by gravity."

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:47.810
Now some more sanguine sculptures.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:52.830
Origin on the left, '68, and
Childhood on the right, 1970.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.990
In the late '60's and the early
'70's, Noguchi carved a group

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:01.460
of stone sculptures that
are partially pitted

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.080
to give life, vitality and light.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.660
In both Origin and Childhood,
energy seems compressed,

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.910
but at the same time it also seems
to be expanding, pushing outward

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.750
as if something were being born.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:24.850
The pitted sculptures are a paen
to emergence and growth, to nature.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.440
Subjects that Noguchi
valued more highly

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.720
than the expression
of personal emotion.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:36.670
He said in his Guggenheim
application, "It is my desire

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.160
to view nature through
nature's eyes."

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:45.120
And he wasn't that interested in
dealing with human subject matter.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.760
Noguchi wanted to be
inside of nature,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.430
but his sculptures do
not always invite us in.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.570
Like nature itself,
they do not confide.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.620
Their voice is quiet, meditative.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.390
They do not come out
and grab your feelings.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.780
You have to move slowly
towards them.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.130
Noguchi's immensely varied art
includes not only individual

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:13.580
sculptural objects but also dance
and theater sets, playgrounds,

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.080
plazas, fountains, furniture.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.100
All of which he thought
of as sculpture.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.680
And here we finally
get to Martha Graham.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.220
On the left is Cave of the Heart.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.260
On the right is -- that's Martha
Graham in Cave of the Heart.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.240 position:56%
And then Mary O'Donnell in Herodiod.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.640
Herodiod was 1944.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.140
Cave of the Heart, 1946.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.590
Apparently they got along very
well, but there were tense moments.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.620
Martha Gram would call up
Noguchi and say, "I need a dress,"

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.600
or "I need something to sit on."

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.010
And he -- this was sometimes at
midnight, and he would go over,

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.310
and they'd talk about it.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.880
Then he'd come back with something

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.860
and usually she liked
what he had done.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.290
But if she didn't, she said,
"No, let me think about it."

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.830
Then he knew it was a disaster, and
he was furious, and he'd go home

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.320
and make something
completely different.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.250
So there were some tense moments.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.240
But they adored each other.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.400
He designed some 20 dance sets
over the years for Martha Graham.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.690
And working with the stage made
him realize that what he wanted

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.730
to do was to create
a sculpture of space.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.020
Just to not ignore the furniture.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:34.030 position:56%
This is the famous coffee table
that is still made by Herman Miller.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:40.760
It's from 1947, so
it's that same moment

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.470
that the interlocking
sculptures like Kouros.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:50.970
Starting in the 1950's, Noguchi had
a business designing mulberry paper

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:54.740
and bamboo lanterns
that he called Akari.

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:59.140
Which he insisted were art objects.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.800
He shared the Japanese belief that
there was no division between art

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.330
and craft, or even between
art and commercial design.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:10.810
But his involvement with design
made many observers see him more

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.150
as a designer and not as an artist.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.420
He was worried about that aspect.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.450
As the years passed, Noguchi
took on more and more commissions

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.500
for large-scale public works.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.910
Especially gardens, like the
so-called Jardin Japonais.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:33.080
It's in Paris for the
UNESCO building.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.620
He did it between 1955 and '58.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.690
Making gardens was part of
his wanting to create works

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.540
that could be part
of people's lives.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.860
He wanted them to have a use.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:51.600
The UNESCO garden, he realized
it wasn't maybe his best garden,

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.050
but it was very important to him
because he confirmed his desire

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:04.220
to create what he called, "Total
sculpture space experience."

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:11.040 position:56%
And also he kept talking about his
gardens as a place for people to go.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:16.150 position:56%
The project was important to Noguchi
also because he said it led him,

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:21.380
"Deeper into Japan and
into working with stone."

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.000
The quietude that we
have seen in some

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.360
of Noguchi's stone
sculptures is present in some

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.600
of his public projects as well.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.050
This is the Supreme Court
Fountains, 1970, in Tokyo.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:42.860 position:56%
There are six dark granite fountains
in the Supreme Court building, 1970.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:47.910
They were inspired by Japanese
Socupai, or these are hollowed

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:54.770
out stone basins that are used for
purification in temple precincts.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:58.750
Noguchi wanted these fountains
in the Supreme Court to prompt

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.430
in lawmakers a greater
sense of justice.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:07.080
With their slow-moving water and
their mirror-like top surfaces,

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.830
the fountains imbue
the space around them

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.320
with an almost sacramental
atmosphere.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:20.330
Probably his most successful
garden is California Scenario.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:23.050
He did it between '80 and '82.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.700
It's in Costa Mesa California.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.650
It's actually a very small space.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:32.720
The perfectly calibrated
succession of forms and the stream

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.440
of water emerging from a pyramid

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.580
and winding along a sandstone
terrace create a space that is

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:46.140
at once serene and lonely,
vibrant and utterly quiet.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.060
Here's another one of
the public sculptures.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.010
The water flowing past
a single basal rock

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:57.880
in Noguchi's Domon Ken Museum
Garden, and that's in Sakata

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.940
in Japan, 1984, gives a
similar feeling of being

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.900
at once transient and eternal.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.510
Noguchi said that the water -- he
doesn't usually explain anything,

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.370
but he did say the water
symbolized the passage of time,

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.640
and the rock standing
firm in the current stood

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.520
for his friend the
photographer Domon Ken

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.110
for whom the museum was
-- it was his museum.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:29.940 position:56%
Noguchi not only spoke of loneliness
and homelessness and conflict

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.020
of East and West, et cetera, he
did talk about these things a lot.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.930
His feeling of not belonging.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:40.380
But he was also haunted
by emptiness.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.300
For him, emptiness was not
always a negative thing.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.960
He embraced Zen ideas about
nothingness and the void.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.120
In 1950, in Japan he
created these two sculptures

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.890
on the theme of emptiness.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:59.280
The one on the left is called Mu,

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.940
which actually means
emptiness or the void.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.980
And the one on the
right in clay is Mimu.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.190
The one on the left was
eventually carved --

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.940
this is a model in plaster.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.570
And there's Noguchi
working on the model.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:18.690
It was eventually carved in stone
and is at Keio University in Tokyo.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:23.970
Anyway, he placed the one on
the left, Mu, outdoors so that

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:29.870
at a certain moment, the circle's
void would hold the setting sun.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:35.300
He also said that the one on
the left was like a mirror

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.340
that reflects but retains nothing.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:45.030
In the following decade,
these are both 1969,

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:49.540
Noguchi made many sculptures such
as The Sun at Noon on the left

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:55.360
and Black Sun on the right, that
are rings surrounding empty space.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:01.330 position:56%
Then in the 1970's he made a series
of what were called void sculptures.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:08.180
This one is Energy Void, as
Noguchi admiring his own work.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:13.960
The largest of them is The Black
Granite Energy Void, 1972-73.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:19.380 position:56%
It is a grand frame for nothingness,
and a void that invites us to pass

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.610 position:56%
through it like a portal to nowhere.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:26.090
Noguchi said, "I have carried
the concept of the void

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.880
like a weight on my shoulders.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.790
I could not seem to
avoid its humanoid grip.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:37.140
It is like some inevitable
question I cannot answer."

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:43.070
A couple more things
having to do with void.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:46.300
The Mermaid's Grave
on the left, 1982.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.210
Ends on the right, 1985.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.880
These are two other sculptures
that deal with the idea of void,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.050
but this time it is a hidden void.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:45:00.810
In both, an invisible volume
of dark space enclosed by walls

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.440
of stone alludes to mortality.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.460
Of the one on the right, Ends,
he wrote that the cube was,

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.000
"The realization of death and
that man is here only temporarily

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.950
and must establish
his mark in the cube."

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:23.490 position:56%
In the last two decades of his life,
Noguchi carved Domon-like sculptures

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.160
out of basalt and granite
that seem halfway

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.690
between being rocks
and being sculptures.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.150
This is age on the left, '81,

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:38.940
and Breakthrough Capestrano,
1983, on the right.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.960
To a friend he explained,
"When I face natural stones,

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.880
they start talking to me.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.110
Once I hear their voices, I
give them just a bit of a hand.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:54.800
Recently I don't have to
carve or polish them much."

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.290
Standing like ancient
markers of time's passage,

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:02.380
the late sculptures have a
primitive mystery and power.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:07.050
Age on the left, it seems like
the back of a human being,

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:12.430
might allude to time's slow
ravaging of the human body.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:17.950
This morning I saw a very
beautiful Noguchi basalt sculpture

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.170
at the National Gallery
in the East Wing.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.130
It's one of his best.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:27.160
It's called Stone of
Spiritual Understanding.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.500
He could be a little, not pompous,

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:37.290
but he could be a little
heavy in his titles at times.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.400
These are both in the
Noguchi Museum.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:45.520
Concerned with his legacy, Noguchi
opened his own museum in 1985.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.960 position:56%
The first sculptures that you see
when you visit the Noguchi Museum --

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.840
it's in Long Island City --

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.470
are these on the left,
these anthropomorphic.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:59.640
Totemic presences that seem
to watch and listen just

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.230
as Noguchi observed
and listened to them.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:10.070
"A museum is," Noguchi said,
"a repository against time.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.980
There is a semblance of eternity."

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:19.860
He wanted his museum to define his
role as a crossing where inward

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.600
and outward meet, East and West.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.230
Beloved to New Yorkers, the Isamu
Noguchi Garden Museum is an oasis

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.940
of beauty and serenity.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:39.420 position:56%
In the last two decades of his life,
Noguchi spent half his time in Japan

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.300
at a studio on the island
of Shikoku and the rest

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.710
of the time in the United States.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:49.760
But he did most of
his carving in Japan.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.920
You see him working -- this
is a very late photograph.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.670
He had a kind of outdoor
studio, a circle

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.160
or wall of stone went around it.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.460
Still does.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.910
It's now part of the
Noguchi Museum in Shikoku,

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.400
a nice place to go, actually.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.390
He said at this point in his
life, "I find myself a wanderer

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.260
in a world rapidly growing smaller.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.430
Artist, American citizen,
world citizen,

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.370
belonging anywhere but nowhere."

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:26.140
Noguchi's antidote for his feelings
of disconnection was to sculpt.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:32.000
Carving stone tied him to the earth
and wrestling with such hard rocks

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.690
as basalt and granite must have
counteracted what he called that

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:41.260
"resonant void within
us and without."

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.620
Carving was, he said, "a
dialogue between himself

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.810
and the primary matter
of the universe."

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:54.410
Noguchi finally found intimacy,
I think, by listening to stone.

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:58.210
This is his grave on a
hill behind his house

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.160
in Shikoku where this studio is.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.100
Noguchi's grave is a huge
pinkish granite boulder set on top

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.330
of a hill behind his house.

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.110
When he found this rock in Okayama,

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.710
he had it set up in
his outdoor studio.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:16.290
And he asked his assistant,
"Would it be okay for me

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.350
to be inside this stone?"

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:22.410
His assistant told Noguchi that he
was too young for such thoughts.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:26.470
But three years before he
died, Noguchi drew a line

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:31.190
around the stone's girth,
indicating where it should be cut.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:36.040
After Noguchi's death in 1988,
his assistant cut the stone

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.240
where he could still just
make out the faded line.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.310
He hollowed out a cavity
for Noguchi's ashes,

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:46.550
and he put the two
halves back together.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:51.140 position:56%
Like so many of Noguchi's -- oh, I
want to show you the color actually.

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.010
Like so many of Noguchi's
sculptures, this stone, this grave,

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.580
is silent still and secretive.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:03.280
Although the egg shape is a
death marker here, it gives voice

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.010
to Noguchi's reverence
for emerging life.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:08.810
Thank you.

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:18.630
[ Applause ]

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.930
Questions?

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:23.510
Yes? You. Yeah.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.810
Oh good, yes.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:32.350
&gt;&gt; I guess this is
a simple question,

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.550
but there may be a
number of answers.

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:37.460
He switched from marble
to a harder stone.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.900
Apparently it took place sometime.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.650
I don't know what year
you might pick as sort

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.310
of the dividing line between those.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:48.230
Or even if I'm right in
thinking that he did marble all

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:53.310
through the early part of the
20th century and then, you know,

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:55.000
later on used harder stone.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.900
Does he talk about that at all?

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.650
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: I think he liked
the struggle with the harder stone.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.600
That feeling of timelessness.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:11.360
Remember he talks about enduring
because it's this hard stone.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.430
But actually, just before
he died he was in Italy

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:19.560
in the fall carving away marble.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.010
So it wasn't something
he completely gave up.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:26.960
&gt;&gt; Maybe it was a nostalgic
thing for him.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.700
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Maybe
he was going back to it.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:34.020
Or maybe he was going back
to Brancusi or something.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:39.410
But you know, when I first saw
the basalt sculptures, I thought,

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:41.340
"You know, how can you
get away with that?

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.380
It's hardly carved at
all, some of them."

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.870
I've come to love them,
but it took a while.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:50.700
They are not very intimate
and they're not --

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.340
I don't know, they're very bold
and somewhat totemic to me.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:58.230
A little bit like Noguchi,
a little standoffish.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.730
Any other questions?

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:01.030
You, yes.

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.710
&gt;&gt; I had a quick question.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.720
I've got a louder voice.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.200
&gt;&gt; One second, sir.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.770
&gt;&gt; When he was in the -- they
call them containment camps.

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.070
Is that what that was?

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:18.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Internment camps.

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:19.670
&gt;&gt; Internment camps.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.970
When he was in the camp,
I notice when you come

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:24.890 position:56%
out with his next sculptures that he
did, he moved into the wire phase.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:30.550
Did he pick that up maybe
out of the internment camps?

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:31.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: I don't think so.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.630
Because he did do some
sculpture in the internment camp

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:36.630
and he'd find sort of driftwood.

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:41.000
He'd go out in the desert and
find driftwood or bits of wood.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.910
He did apparently in front of his
room in one of those awful houses,

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:51.280
there was a kind of a wooden
carving that he had made there.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.710
But I think the wires
had to do with sort

00:52:55.710 --> 00:53:01.040
of not wanting something sensuous
and material and having to do

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.790
with love and life and emergence,

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:05.940
but something really
somewhat despairing.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.330
I would think that is what it was.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:10.690
Other questions?

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:18.090
&gt;&gt; You had mentioned -- hi,
thank you for your presentation.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:20.610
I'm over here.

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.700
Could you speak a little bit more

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.620
about his relationship
with Martha Graham?

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.560
When they met, what attracted
them, things like that.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.190
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Well,
his sister, his half-sister,

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:36.270
was a Martha Graham dancer.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:41.240
But also his mother to make
money helped sew costumes

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.090
for Martha Graham.

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:48.380
And at one point Martha Graham and
Noguchi lived in the same building

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.890
or part of the same building.

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:54.540
A building in New York that
supposedly was one building,

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.790
but it may have been two
buildings put together.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:58.090
I don't know.

00:53:58.090 --> 00:53:59.390 position:56%
But anyway, it could have been that.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:03.810
And he used to just go and
watch her dancers practicing.

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:06.880
He loved watching them practice.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.490
They became fond of each other,

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:13.760
and then she asked him
to, you know, make a set.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:18.370
And it was her first
set that wasn't --

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:23.200 position:56%
I think she hadn't used sets before
and I think she didn't like the idea

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.420
of the sort of ballet type
sets that have all these flats.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:33.780
And so the first one was called
Frontier and it was extraordinary.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.580
It was just two ropes and a fence.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.960
Maybe you've seen a photograph of
Martha Graham, a famous photograph

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:46.460
of her in front of this
fence, lifting her leg

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:49.380
so that actually the diagonal
of her leg is the same

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.360
as the diagonal of the ropes.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:57.260
It was having to do for him a
sort of plunging the audience

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:03.230
into the space, plunging
everything together.

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:05.680
The dancers and the audience.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.070
This thing brought the whole thing

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:10.090
into one space in a
very dynamic way.

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.640
I must say I've only
seen it in photographs.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.600
So I'm not sure how it worked.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.720
But I think it did.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:21.300
And their friendship as
I said could be thorny.

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.350
They really loved each other.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:25.990
Martha Graham said it
was never romantic.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:30.100
She was very clear about that,
and I think that's probably right.

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.910
She was probably eight or
ten years older than him.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:36.120
But there was enormous respect.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.930
And actually she's
quoted in one of his --

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.440
I think it's the New
York Times obituary.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:47.010
She said beautiful things about
how important his work was for her.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:50.670
He enabled her to invent
and choreograph.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:53.190
It was a sort of a mix.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:58.150
She helped him create a sculpture
of space and he helped her

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:03.300
with invention I guess is
what she would have said.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.700
Any other questions?

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.710
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that both
his parents were writers

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:13.190
and that Noguchi himself
acknowledged early in his career

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:16.040
that he felt that he was in
competition with his father.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:20.430
I was wondering whether or
not Noguchi spoke about this

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:23.240
or whether you found any
of his parents' writings,

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.930
and whether you see a connection
between the themes that they dealt

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:28.020
with and the themes
that he dealt with.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.430
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Well he was
so hostile towards his father,

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:37.190
but when he lived later
-- actually in 1930 --

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:41.570
when he was in Japan in 1931,
first in China, then Japan,

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.390
he started reading a lot
of his father's books

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:47.560
on Japanese art and
Japanese culture.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:53.640
And I think they had -- his father
talks about not being aggressive

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.480
and pushy but just
being sort of passive.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.420
I think some of that actually
rubbed off on Noguchi.

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:05.880
He read a lot about Zen.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.810
He ended up really
respecting his father.

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:13.260
And as he said, trying to be
-- wanted to be as famous.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:18.250
I think they did have
a reconciliation

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:19.960
through letters after the war.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.910
Noguchi sent care packages
to his father

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:26.130
and his stepmother and
their many children.

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:30.240
And then he got to know all
these half-brothers later.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.330
And it was all very good.

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:38.860
Yeah, it was friendly.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.160
Okay.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:43.630
&gt;&gt; I wondered if he had other
creative collaborations.

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:45.940
You had mentioned Man
Ray as a good friend,

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.430
and there perhaps were others
within his circle of friends.

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:54.770
So beyond Martha Graham, were
there artists inspiring him

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:56.070
to move into other directions?

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:57.380
Was he inspiring others?

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.850
Did you get a sense of what
that circle of friendship

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:02.430
with visual artists was about?

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:05.140
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Are we
talking about performance art?

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:08.850
&gt;&gt; No, the visual arts, like
Man Ray and some of the others.

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:11.810
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Well I think
Gorky had a huge influence on him

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.760 position:56%
in terms of those biomorphic shapes.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:21.130 position:56%
Gorky and Noguchi in the '30's would
go to museums together and Gorky was

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.710
by far the most articulate.

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:27.520
Not that Noguchi wasn't articulate,
but they were the same age,

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.470
although in fact Gorky
lied about his birth

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.500 position:56%
so he was probably four years older.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:37.860 position:56%
But anyway, Gorky would just
expound about different works of art

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.280
in the Metropolitan Museum,

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.340
and Noguchi just said he
learned a huge amount from him.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.700
And I think some of those
shapes are very, very similar.

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.800
I can't think -- you
know, David Smith.

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.100
He knew David Smith.

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.080
I mean, he knew everybody,
but David Smith kept saying,

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:57.810
"Why don't you use metal
and make metal sculptures?"

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:01.770
And he did briefly and
they weren't his best work.

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:05.630
But Noguchi said he didn't
want to go around taking pieces

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:08.920
of used metal and welding
them together.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.670
He just liked carving.

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:17.470
And others that influenced him, he
liked Gaudier Brzeska, a sculptor,

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.640
but that wasn't a contemporary.

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:25.740
And he basically loved
Brancusi and Gorky.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.700
Any other questions?

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the sets that
the Graham Company currently uses --

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.520
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: I'm sorry.

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.820
What?

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.400
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the
sets designed by him

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:46.720
that the Graham Company currently
uses are preserved originals,

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.200
or are they reproductions,
do you know?

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.990
And the headpieces and the props?

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:57.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: There was a lot
of conflict over who owned the sets,

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.200
and I don't know the
whole story of that,

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.260
but I know it was a big problem.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.860
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: But I believe

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.160
that what would be used now
would certainly not be the

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.570
original pieces.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:12.490
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:13.790
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Yes.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:18.110
&gt;&gt; Is this working?

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:26.000
If he liked carving and basalt
and granite so much and yet worked

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.420
so closely with Martha Graham
who made dances but happened once

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.470
and then they're gone,
they evaporate

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:36.770
because another performance
is a different performance,

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:41.390
did he ever address that dichotomy
and whether it attracted him

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:45.140
in the sense of giving a relief,

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:49.660
an opposition to what he devoted
his life so much to doing?

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.960
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Right,

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.690
because he's making an object
and she's making an act.

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:56.180
&gt;&gt; Well he was working with
stone and you said how he talked

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.410
about that was the
fundamental thing.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:00.710
It would never go away.

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:03.440
But dance is totally ephemeral.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.410
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: It is ephemeral.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:09.990
I mean, I guess it's written
down in whatever it's called,

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:12.550
the language in which
you write dance.

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:13.850
But it's never the same.

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:15.150
You're right.

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.450
It's different dancers doing it.

01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:19.430
He didn't talk about
it to my knowledge, no.

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:21.900
It's an interesting point though.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.290
But of course he liked
everything that was fleeting,

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:27.500
even though he kept
making these solid stones.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:36.180
And you know, the idea of the
petals falling, that's his thing.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.350
He likes things that are transient.

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:41.620
But the fact is the passage
of time drove him nuts.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:48.200
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you very much for
the very interesting presentation.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.870
I wanted to hear a little
bit more about his legacy

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:52.800
and his devotion to his legacy.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.830
He seemed preoccupied with
that, setting up his own museum,

01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:00.460
wanting to be remembered as an
artist that worked in things

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.280
that weren't going to fade
with the passage of time.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.550
And so if you could
maybe comment on how

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:09.480
that occupied his life
and his space.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.080
And then also what you think
his reaction would be to being

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.380
so well-known for some of his
furniture, specifically the table,

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:19.730
when that wasn't his kind of
life's mission of being a sculptor.

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:23.840
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Well, along
that last point, he gave a lecture.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.950
I can't remember, maybe
it was Chicago.

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:33.560
And he was very defensive about
furniture and light and the Akari.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:39.160
But he said he told the audience
that he actually made more money

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.270
out of his art than he did
out of his design objects.

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:46.260
So he was being quite defensive.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.700
What was the first part
of your question again?

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.000
&gt;&gt; His legacy.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.980
He was very preoccupied with
what his legacy was going to be.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.190
Most artists don't build
their own museum whilst alive.

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:00.490
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: Right.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:01.790
Well, you know, if he couldn't
bear the passage of time,

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:03.840
he wanted to have everything
in one place.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.030
Actually, he tried to get the
Met, I think, and the Whitney

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.560
and different museums
to take his work.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.810
But he knew that they would
just put it in the basement.

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:15.980
They couldn't show it all at
once, and that also he said some

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.920
of his sculptures were really
too heavy for any museum floor.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.030
That seems a little odd,
but maybe that's true.

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:28.720
So the idea of putting his work
in another museum didn't work.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.740
And I think he was wanted -- he
was a very controlling person.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:38.100 position:56%
And he wanted to control exactly how
everything was placed in the museum.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:42.920
He wanted to sort of -- the whole
sequence from where you begin

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.660
with these totemic ones, to the
late basalt and granite ones.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:53.960
And then you go up to Akari and
it's a very beautiful sequence.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.330
He raised money for -- I mean, he
was very serious about that museum.

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:03.230
He raised money and he
made multiples in order

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.420 position:56%
to make money to support the museum.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.390
So he gave everything
in a way to the museum.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.130
Any more? Yeah?

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:17.880
&gt;&gt; I would be very interested

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.360
in knowing why he went
to the internment camp.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: I can't hear you.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.220
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:31.060
I was wondering why he went
to the internment camp.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.610
He wasn't forced to go in there.

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:38.450
And my understanding is
that many Japanese artists

01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:44.780
in New York were prohibited
from going more

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.110
than a few miles from
where they lived.

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:50.640
So I'm just curious about it.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.940
&gt;&gt; Hayden Herrera: He was
in California at the moment

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.180
of Pearl Harbor, and he was driving

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:01.370
to get some onyx or
some kind of stone.

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:03.150
And he turned his car around

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:06.940
and realized everything was
going to change for him.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:13.890
And he went back and tried to help
Japanese Americans to organize

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:19.770
so they would be able to
tell the American people

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:24.210
that the Japanese Americans
were on the American side.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:29.050
That they were not fascists, and
they were not against America.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:33.140 position:56%
They were willing to work for peace.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:37.820
So he worked with Japanese
Americans on that.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.300
But then I think he had
to get out of California.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.420
And he felt a little
guilty about that.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:49.180
And he went to Washington,
and he found out --

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.450 position:56%
I forgot the name of the man who was
in charge of the Indian territory

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:58.000
where the internment camp post was.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.100
But this guy suggested he go there

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.770
and help create these
happier situations.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:06.670
So Noguchi felt it was part

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:10.030
of his social conscience
coming out of the '30's.

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.820
But he felt that he could help.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:16.680
He said at one point,
"I'm no longer Noguchi.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.850
I am a Japanese American.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.180
I'm a Nisai."

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:25.920 position:56%
You know? So he felt like a
different identity all of the sudden

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.420
because people were
being really horrible

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.570
about the Japanese at that point.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:36.300
So anyway, he felt
compelled to help in some way.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.340
Any more questions?

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.140
&gt;&gt; Anne McClean: I think this
might be a good time to move

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.450
to having the book signing.

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:44.560
I just wanted to say
thank you so much.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.080
It was a wonderful lecture.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.510
Thank you so much for coming.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.080
