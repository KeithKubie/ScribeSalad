00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.760
We've grown used to belittling things

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.520
that don't happen to be important to us right now

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.500
With the powerful term: "First World Problems."

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.420
So when your partner is moaning that their job's a bit boring,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.920
It's tempting to say that: "This is a first world problem."

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.320
Just as they might have told you that 'You had a first world problem',

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.060
when you complain that the shopping mall looks a bit ugly or that you don't like your in-laws..

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.200
This kind of tough-minded response is understandable, but a bit counter-productive.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.820
Just because an issue isn't connected to life or death doesn't mean it doesn't cause genuine pain.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.980
Or isn't worth thinking about. A problem can be important without being life-threatening

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.940
Moreover, we should be excited by trying to solve the most advanced problems out there:

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.080
The problems of rich countries are, for the most part, both complicated and serious.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.360
They're the ones that everyone's going to face in about 300 years time.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.920
The issues that people have in Switzerland and Norway, Australia and the Netherlands: These're the problems that all humanity will have...

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.580
... in about 2250.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.820
First world problems aren't an unneccesary oddity. They're a form of time travel

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.460
They're a glimpse into what we'll one day all have to worry about.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.920
There are currently 25 countries on this planet could qualify as 'first world'.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.900
You probably live in one of them.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.100
In these rich countries, people don't starve; life expectancy is high; child mortality is low.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.880
But there are a lots of other problems. Not sob stories of the well-to-do begging sympathy because the wine isn't properly chilled

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.740
There are central issues of philosophy and politics.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.060
Because everyday, we're fighting to get richer, and so we need to understand the problems that come with

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.640
or undermine that struggle...

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.400
You think people in the rich world felt they had enough material things.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.660
The average Australian is more blessed in material terms than the Kings of Medieval Europe ever were.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.820
But something very odd and troubling about human nature has come to light.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.000
It seems we don't decide whether we have enough by asking ourselves what we need

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.900
Or comparing our material possessions with those that our parents or grandparents had.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.440
and we certainly don't think of people in the poorest country in the world: the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:13.500
We ask whether we have enough by looking at other people around us, in the immediate vicinity, and especially people we see on TV.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.180
Our happiness is comparative and relative by nature.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.360
This sets up a devilish problem because, driven by advertising, there's always more that we could have

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.800
and that some other people around us already do. That's an enormous part why rich coutries are not as happy as they're supposed to be.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.280
In 1975, economist Richard Easterlin identified the average level of happiness in the US as 2.2 on a famous happiness scale that he devised.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.180
At that point, per capita GDP was $22,000.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.440
Now GDP per capita in the US is $54,000.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.560
But extraordinarily, happiness level is exactly the same: 2.2.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.040
It's a deeply shocking result, like going to the gym everyday for years and discovering that you're no happier with your body than when you started!

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.280
Wealth does matter to happiness but only up to a point.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:12.640
Research suggests that every dollar you earn up to $20,000 per head makes you happier but thereafter, you need a lot of other things to make you content.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.880
Rich countries are rich because their economies are enormously productive.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.100
Economists and manufacturers love productivity.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.200
But it's also responsible for one of the oddest, the most pervasive causes of modern unhappiness

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.660
what we now call "being stressed".

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.700
The United States, the world's most productive economy is also by far and away the most stressed place you could live in.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.700
We buy our weallth with a very high price indeed.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.820
We work hard partly because we're afraid. Thanks to Recessions, the rise of service jobs and rising global competition

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.400
The typical job tenure in the 20 richest countries is now only 15 months. No wonder we're stressed.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.720
Everething in rich countries becomes cheaper year by year.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.160
Except for one thing which matters far more than TVs or mobile phones:

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.420
Your House.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:10.160
House inflation averaged out across the capital cities of the rich countries, has been running at an annual rate of 20% per annum for the last two decades.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.180
This has had an enormous impact on everything. But one thing in particular: commuting times.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.580
Commuting is globally the least liked part of the working day but we're doing ever more of it.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.580
because when a place is rich, the distances between work and affordable homes increases painfully and exponentially.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.180
In Ireland, you might spend 26 minutes a day commuting. In South Korea, it's a full 55 minutes.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:43.240
Insane commuting times is a small incidental but deeply telling symptom of a wealthy but very unhappy society.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.460
Partly as the result of stress and commuting, we are collectively exhausted. One fifth of people in Japan suffer from insomnia.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.500
In the UK, 51% of the population believe they don't get enough sleep.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.440
Tiredness brings other issues: We get too tired to cook. In the UK, the huge pre-made meal industry is growing at 6% a year,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.320
which means that by 2037, every single meal consumed in the British Isles will, by current trends, have been made in a factory.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:20.940
We're too tired to read: On average, Americans spend 7 minutes a day reading for pleasure, 89% say they'd like that to be more if they weren't so tired.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.660
And we're too tired to exercise: 21 and a half minutes a day is the recommended amount of exercice to keep ones self in shape

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.620
but that's beyond the reach fore more than 80% of everyone in the top richest 20 countries.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:40.780
It doesn't help that we drink: In the UK the average man would drink 1,100 pines of beer a year. Alcohol is the leading relaxant.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.960
We watch online porn: 42% of all download's are pornographic. 10% of adults admitted Internet porn addiction.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.840
However, these statistics don't capture the most significant aspect to the problem: 78% of users of porn say that they're very

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.780
or highly dissapointed of the quality of their real relationships.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.460
Relationships are crucial to happiness. But what's been discovered is a disastrous alignment of wealth creation and relationship troubles.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:16.180
Divorce rates are very high in rich countries: 53% in the USA; 55% in France, 60% in Luxembourg

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:25.600
and there's a huge hinterland of the unhappy undivorced. In the US, of the people who stay together,  70% have seriously thought of leaving

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.720
...but fear separation would be even worse.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.100
And not necessarily wrong, 1/3 of people in the US say that they're very, or desperately lonely.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.460
In France, 4 million people admit to having no real friends.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.100
Loneliness is a side effect of wealth creation.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:50.160
In poor countries, you can't easily survive on your own. As countries get richer, people move for work, the economic unit ceases to be family, the workplace takes over.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.120
Then the workplace lets you down.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:00.700
The rich world is far better at tearing up natural habitats and turning them into enormous, soulless, frighteningly ugly cities.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:07.200
At the moment, 3.5 billion people live in urban areas. It will be 6 billion in 2050.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.660
There will be nearly as much urban constructions in the next 50 years

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.300
as there has been in the whole of human history up to now.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.900
The quality of the environment is among the top three concerns of people in the rich countries.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:26.320
We're so good at complaining about our lack of income, we have, as yet, found no convincing, collective way of articulating how much beauty matters to us.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.800
And how sad the omnipresent ugliness has made us.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.140
The things that make us unhappy in rich countries give us a poignant picture of unmet needs

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.880
for relationships, meaning, beauty and sense of purpose

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.420
There's an enormous task ahead of us. The solutions are not primarily financial,

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.980
They're about psychology and ideas

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.180
At present, we measure a lot of things: GDP, inflation and unemployment

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.460
These are all attempts to get what we really want to know: Are our lives getting better?

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.300
But for all our expertise, we don't have indices around the quality of our relationships,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:09.500
national stress level, the incidents of envy, the amount of hugs people give each other, the number of random acts of kindness.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:15.140
But this is what we need to be announced on some daily news, to focus on collective efforts

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:21.240
We need indicators that measure our psychological, rather than merely financial well-being.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:28.300
News industries make their money from frightening and exciting news. The news constantly make us imagine a world more violent,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.900
more filled with disasters, more politically unstable than it really is,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.700
and at the same time, more inhabited by talented, beautiful, smart and sexy people than it is.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.800
This provides a staggeringly poor starting point for grasping our own needs

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.600
We're likely to feel ourselves craving greater and greater degrees of protection and security

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.400
and in need of much more money, excitement and stimulation.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.340
Better media will provide us with a more realistic starting point,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.300
and so lessen the anxieties, which we look to money to sooth.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.160
Traditionally, religion has had the function of giving authority and glamour to non-material values

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.720
if money and power were represented by a lion,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.460
and Christianity once saw itself as worshipping the meek and gentle lamb,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.100
Christianity told the Mighty, the Barons, the Generals, the Warlords to be kind,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.920
It taught them to recognize the importance of spiritual values that otherwise would have had no currency

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.640
and through magnificent works of art,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.040
it preached the final superiority of the spiritual to the material

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.980
Today we can't rely on organized religions to do this.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.500
though they continue to make the attempts, but the need remains.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.800
A good society needs to have people who celebrate money,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.400
but also, just as many people ready to celebrate non-material things,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.700
like kindness, forgiveness and the importance of going on country walks.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.180
We require a new system of education to promote psychological wisdom

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.980
If we work backwards from life, it's clear that schools fail all but a tiny portion of their students.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:03.780
Trouble around work and relationships remains very widespread indeed. We need to learn not just Maths and History

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.320
but also, far more importantly,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.700
how to live and die well.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.340
The kinds of cities we live in has vast implications for the quality of our lives,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.300
but at present, our collective aspirations are undeveloped.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:21.320
We need to construct tight, compact cities, with the elegance of Edinburg, San Francisco, Heidelberg

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.860
and somehow cap house prices to a level affordable by an average citizen.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.660
This is only the beginning of the list

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.320
What is clear is is that trying to make societies ever richer isn't the answer

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.560
given the standard living in the rich countries, it isn't the lack of money that's the real problem,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.540
it is, broadly speaking, a lack of wisdom

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.160
and that's a challenge for all of us now.
