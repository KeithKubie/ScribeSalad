00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:02.861
- [Voiceover] Which x-values
make the ordered pair,

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:06.704
x comma negative two, a
solution of the system of

00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:09.815
inequalities represented
by the graph below?

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:11.719
So let's look at this.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.876
So we're constraining
ourselves to all of the points

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:16.792
of the form x comma negative two

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.545
which is another way of
saying we're going to

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:22.550
constrain ourselves to
y equaling negative two.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.290
If we constrain ourselves
to y equaling negative two,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.958
what has to be true of x
in order for this point

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.705
to be a solution to this
system of inequalities?

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:35.261
And so I encourage you to pause the video;

00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:40.140
look at this graph here, and
then pick one of the choices.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.230
All right, now let's
work through it together.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.401
So let's just be very clear
of what's going on here.

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.887
Let me pick some points.

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:50.414
So this point right over
here, this is a solution to

00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:52.945
neither of the inequalities in our system.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:55.453
You can think of this as the green system

00:00:55.453 --> 00:00:57.124
and this as the blue system.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:58.646
In order to be a solution
set, you have to be in

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.401
the shaded area for that system.

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:02.964
So this point right over
here, it's in the solution set

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:07.236
for neither of the
inequalities of the system.

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:09.091
This point right over here,

00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.039
it would still not be in
the solution set for either

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.131
because it's on a dashed green line.

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.395
If this was a solid green
line, then it would be part of

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:22.063
the green solution set, but
since it's a dashed green line,

00:01:22.063 --> 00:01:25.268
the line itself is not
part of the solution set.

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:27.328
Now this point right over here,

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:32.675
this point satisfies the green inequality,

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.301
it's part of its solution set,

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:36.636
but it does not satisfy
the blue inequality

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:40.431
so it's not in the solution
set for the system.

00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:45.414
Now this point here, this
actually would satisfy both,

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:47.095
and the reason why it satisfies both,

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:51.367
it clearly is in the shaded
area for the green inequality

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:54.781
but it sits on the line
for the blue inequality,

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.428
but that's okay because we're
including the line itself

00:01:57.428 --> 00:01:58.499
in the solution set;

00:01:59.574 --> 00:02:01.404
it's a solid blue line.

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:03.633
So this would be in the solution set for

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:05.278
the system of inequalities;

00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:06.774
this would be in the solution set for

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.701
the system of inequalities,
all of these points,

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.195
because they're in the solution
set of the blue inequality

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:14.029
that we're seeing visually,
and in the green one.

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.885
We assume that the green
one just keeps going down.

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:18.209
And this is actually
what we're seeing here

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.217
is actually the overlap.

00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:22.771
Now that we have a better
understanding of things,

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.920
let's actually tackle the questions.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.206
We're constraining ourselves
to y equals negative two.

00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:29.597
So actually, let me draw
a line here that shows all

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:32.708
of the points where y is
equal to negative two.

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:35.135
So that shows, at least on our graph

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:38.130
where y is equal to negative two.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.054
So given y equals negative
two, what has to be true of x

00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:47.007
in order to satisfy the
system of inequalities here?

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:49.948
Well, we're going to have to
deal with all of the x-values

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:52.658
including and to the right of this point.

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:57.979
I can say including because
the blue inequality,

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:00.888
you can also be equal to the line;

00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:02.896
you can actually be on the line.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.996
So being on the line is part
of the solution set for both

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:09.328
or anything to the right.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.166
So all of this

00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:17.618
is part of the solution set.

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:19.880
And so, if we constrain
y equals negative two,

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:24.247
we see that x has to be greater than

00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:27.755
or equal to negative three.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.940
And we see that

00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:33.433
that is this choice,

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:34.880
this choice right over there,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.481
x is greater than or
equal to negative three.

00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:41.136
Now let's do another one and
instead of constraining y,

00:03:41.136 --> 00:03:44.195
we're now going to constrain x.

00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:48.594
Which y-values make the
ordered pair, four comma y,

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:51.403
a solution of the system
of inequalities represented

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:53.110
by the graph below?

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.336
And once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:58.482
and see if you can work
through it on your own.

00:03:58.482 --> 00:03:59.727
All right now, let's
work through it together.

00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:03.420
In this scenario, we are constraining x.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.293
We're saying that x has
to be equal to four.

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:07.529
So x equaling four,

00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:13.601
that's all of the points on this line

00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.749
right over here.

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.002
So, we are constraining
ourselves to the points

00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:20.300
that sit on this line,
but we want to be part

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.088
of the solution set.

00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:25.420
So we want to be on this line

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.312
that constrains us to x equals four,

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:30.087
but we want to be in the
overlap of the solution sets

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:33.041
of the two inequalities in
order to satisfy the system.

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:34.433
So, let's see.

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:38.598
We want to be in this
area right over here,

00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:41.279
that's the overlap of the solutions sets

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.525
of the two inequalities.

00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:46.930
And so, if we constrain
ourselves to x equaling four,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.787
y has to be greater than
because we're not including

00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:54.259
the green line itself; it's dashed.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.439
So y has to be greater than negative one,

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.770
or we can say negative
one has to be less than y,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.242
and then y can go all the way

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.528
up to and including three.

00:05:08.528 --> 00:05:11.036
Up to and including three
because this blue line

00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:12.278
is actually filled in.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.948
So anything that's on the
blue line is still going

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.233
to be on the solution set
of the blue inequality.

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.497
And this point that I'm
showing right here is clearly

00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:23.736
sitting in the overlap
for both inequalities,

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:28.554
and so y has to be less
than or equal to three.

00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:31.290
So if x is equal to four, y has to be

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.560
greater than negative one and less than

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.961
or equal to negative three...

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.260
And less than or equal
to three, I should say.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.724
So let's see which of these choices:

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:42.914
negative one is less than y is
less than or equal to three.

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:45.303
That's, once again, our first choice.
