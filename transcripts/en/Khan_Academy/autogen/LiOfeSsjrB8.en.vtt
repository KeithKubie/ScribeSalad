00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.230
 In the last video I learned about myosin and more specifically 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.370
 myosin II - it has two myosin heads, 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.460
 and their tails are intertwined 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.040
 with each other. We have learned how myosin II can use the ATP molecule, 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.550
 to attract an actin thread 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.385
 or to move on. 

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.930
 At first it is attached. 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.080
 It then binds the ATP molecule. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.370
 This makes him separate. 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.650
 The ATP molecule is then hydrolyzed in ADP and a phosphate group. 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.795
 When this happens, energy is released. 

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:35.620
 The energy level is rising. 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.910
 This stretches the protein as a spring 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.070
 and myosin II attaches another groove to the actin thread, 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 after which the phosphate group leaves and then the conformational change 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.760
 in protein is sufficient. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.660
 Generated pressure force on 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.480
 the actin thread to move 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.240
 myosin and the one to which it is attached, 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.610
 left and right. 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.010
 In the next videos, we'll talk about what 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.460
 is myosin. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.130
 Surely your heads are born 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.800
 a few questions. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.630
 Myosin makes a great effort to attract the thread. 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.870
 There is tension that pulls in the opposite direction. 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.870
 The muscles are so. There should be 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.760
 weight or other resistance. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.200
 What happens when the thread is released? 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.990
 In the first step, when the ATP molecule joins and that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.440
 here is released, the active thread is not simple 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.370
 to shrink back, 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.180
 especially if there is tension 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.520
 in the opposite direction? 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.150
 The answer is simple: This is not the only protein myosin, 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.140
 which acts on the actin. 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.380
 There are others along the chain. 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.740
 There may be one. 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 Like here. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.150
 They work at their own pace at different times. 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.550
 They are many when one of them 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.840
 is granted, another may apply 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.980
 force or be active. 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.750
 Therefore, if suddenly a myosin 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.240
 free the actin thread, it will not be 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.210
 shrink back. 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.600
 The other question you might ask is: 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.990
 How do I turn it off and on? 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.590
 We command our muscles, 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.490
 so what turns the myosin system on and off, 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.690
 who moves on the actin? 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.460
 To understand this, there are two more proteins, 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.900
 which act. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.880
 Tropomyosin and troponin. 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.760
 I'll make a rough painting on 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910
 the actin thread. 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.190
 This is an actin thread with its 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.790
 grooves. 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.040
 Its structure is spiral. 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.080
 The grooves are also spiral, 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.010
 but this is not important now. 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.550
 In the previous video, we painted proteins 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.490
 myosin. 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.860
 They may resemble your feet or heads, which 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.490
 are constantly attached to the thread. Then based on where they are 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.700
 in the ATP cycle, are constantly shrinking 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.650
 or tightening as a spring and moving forward by pushing. 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.650
 We have on the thread 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.160
 protein tropomyosin. 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.030
 It wraps around the acta. 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.270
 This is the actin. 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.760
 This is one of the two chapters of myosin II. 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.990
 And this is tropomyosin. 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.972
 It is wrapped around the acta. 

00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:55.260
 The drawing is very rough, but you can imagine 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.000
 how it wraps and passes behind it and then in the front, 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 then back again and so on. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.040
 The important thing about it is the following. 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.210
 In fact, I'm going back. 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.860
 It is wrapped around the actin and is attached to it 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.260
 with another protein called the troponin. 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.860
 For example, it is attached to a troponin 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.270
 Here, here, this is not very accurate, 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.610
 and here. 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.860
 I will write it. 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.540
 The Troponin crashes 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.790
 like nails in acta. 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.050
 It determines where tropomyosin is located. 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.040
 When the muscle is at rest, it turns out 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.970
 tropomyosin blocks myosin. 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.690
 I have read a lot on the subject, 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.490
 that this is still being investigated. 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.690
 It is not yet clear. 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.850
 Tropomyosin blocks myosin 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.880
 to attach to its usual places 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.630
 by the acta so that it can not move along the thread 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.090
 or when the myosin is attached to the actin, 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.840
 tropomyosin does not allow him to move 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.280
 and sliding on the actin. 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.500
 We can conclude that tropomyosin 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:42.940
 block myosin head - here it is, 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:55.770
 so that it can not move through the acta like 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.740
 physically blocks the binding site, or if it is already connected, 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.480
 prevents her from moving along the thread. 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.310
 In any case, she blocks her and she can 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.240
 to release only if the proteins troponin change 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.570
 its conformation, i. its shape. 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.330
 This can only happen if we have 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.380
 high concentration of calcium ions. 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.300
 If we have a sufficient concentration 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.350
 of calcium ions, they 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.750
 will connect to the troponin and will change 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.970
 its conformation enough to move 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.350
 the configuration of tropomyosin. 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.260
 I will write it. 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.130
 Usually, tropomyosin blocks, but when we have it 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:52.070
 high concentration of calcium ions they bind 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:59.840
 with the troponin and altering 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.850
 his conformation, and so he displaces the tropomyosin. 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.690
 Following the shift of tropomyosin, 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.360
 high calcium concentration and trompone binding, 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.770
 as we talked in the last clip, 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.860
 myosin heads may begin to move 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.180
 by acta or pushing it 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.210
 to the right. 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:38.300
 But if the concentration of calcium falls, 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.620
 calcium ions will be released from the troponin. 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.380
 Always have enough calcium ions attached. 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.620
 If the concentration drops dramatically, these ions 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:52.210
 will begin to separate. Then the Troponin will be 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.460
 regain the standard conformation. 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:05.530
 Thus, tropomyosin will again block myosin. 

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.770
 I can not say the explanations here 

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.780
 were simple. 

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.820
 It was discovered only 50-60 years ago 

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.210
 and all this is monitored 

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.840
 proven by experiments to understand, 

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.560
 but the very idea is simple. 

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.490
 Without calcium, tropomyosin blocked 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.549
 the ability of the myosin to attach there where necessary, 

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.559
 or to move on the actin, i. to push it. 

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.049
 But if the concentration of calcium is high enough, 

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.610
 he will connect to the troponin, 

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.970
 thus "nailing" the tropomyosin, wrapped around the actin, 

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.630
 and when the trompamine changes its conformation 

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:57.470
 with calcium ions, he shifts the tropomyosin, 

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.590
 to allow the myosin to move. 

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.430
 That's how we build a way 

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.830
 to cut our muscles and 

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.570
 to control these redundancies. 

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.540
 If there is a high concentration of calcium in the cell, 

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.050
 the muscle will be shortened. 

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.060
 If the concentration drops again, 

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.700
 he will immediately relax. 

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.990
 The myosin will be blocked and the muscle will relax again.
