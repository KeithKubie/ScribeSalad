00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.480
Action movies are known for placing the hero
in nail biting life or death situations where

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.950
there’s danger at every turn.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.681
Sometimes the sequences are so risky, the
filmmakers will enlist the help of a stunt

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.430
double so their lead stays safe.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.930
But then there are the real daredevils in
Hollywood who prefer to do as much as possible

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.140
themselves to ensure maximum authenticity.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.520
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Actors Who Refuse
to Use Stunt Doubles.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.600
Harrison Ford

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.760
A veteran of several action movies, Ford is
never afraid to get his hands dirty.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.110
Throughout filming of the Indiana Jones series,
the actor enjoyed the physical nature of the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.540
character and trained hard so he could do
his own stunts.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.129
He liked it so much, stuntman Vic Armstrong
told Ford that if he kept it up, Armstrong

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.650
would be out of a job.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.949
Ford hasn’t backed away from stunt work
in his older years.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
According to J.J. Abrams, Ford was one of
the most active members of the Force Awakens

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.019
cast, even after breaking his leg.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.260
Tom Cruise

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.700
One of the leading action stars of this generation,
Tom Cruise ups the ante every time he makes

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.700
a film.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.920
His feats in the Mission: Impossible franchise
are perhaps his most famous.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.369
During the now iconic Burj Khalifa scene in
Ghost Protocol, Cruise is the one scaling

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.369
the skyscraper.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.420
For its sequel, the actor actually hung on
to a real plane taking off, giving his fans

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.900
a treat they’ll never forget.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.719
With the M:I films now better than ever, there’s
no telling what Cruise will do next or how

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.719
far he’ll go.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.229
The one thing we do know is that it’ll always
be the real deal.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.609
Keanu Reeves

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.240
Rising to fame in the 1990s, Reeves has put
together an impressive action movie résumé.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.819
Starting with Speed in 1994, the actor has
been keen to do his own stunts.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.970
He reportedly did 90 percent of the stunts
for Speed, and performed many of the fight

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.770
scenes and wirework in the Matrix trilogy.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.350
Later on in his career, Reeves wowed moviegoers
with the jaw-dropping sequences in John Wick,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.939
cementing his status as one of the go-to leads
for the genre.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.700
Moviegoers can’t wait for John Wick’s
sequel, and Reeves’ dedication to his craft

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.170
is a big reason why.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.170
Angelina Jolie

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.700
Jolie’s trainer Simon Crane claims that
the actress does 99 percent of her own stunts

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.079
over the course of her career, which includes
several forays into action flicks.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.280
Her most impressive credit is the thriller
Salt, in which Jolie did not use a stunt double

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.280
at all.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.480
When viewers see the character diving through
doors or walking on a narrow ledge, it’s

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480
actually Jolie.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.170
She also performed stunts while filming Disney’s
Maleficent, where one action sequence required

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.910
her to be suspended in the air before getting
flung into the air.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.630
Jolie’s still going strong after all these
years, so hopefully she keeps it up.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.630
Daniel Craig

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.940
Playing James Bond is no easy task, and Daniel
Craig was more than up for the challenge.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.860
The actor established himself as one of the
toughest and roughest 007s yet.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.330
Feeling that it was important to do his own
stunts, Craig made sure he was in top physical

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.380
condition so he was fit to do the work himself.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.720
He does leave some of the more massive and
dangerous stunts for the professionals, but

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.170
Craig has done as much as he can, giving a
personal stamp on his take on the spy.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.250
After four of these films, it’s no wonder
he sounds like he’s ready to move on.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250
He needs a vacation.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.250
Matt Damon

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.870
An unlikely action star, Matt Damon helped
redefine the genre in the 2000s with the acclaimed

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.120
Bourne trilogy, and he played the part to
perfection.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.020
In the films, Damon was up for doing some
of the driving himself, taking part in the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.300
series’ exciting car chases.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.230
He also did a few scenes underwater, which
made him particularly nervous.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.930
Outside of his big franchise, Damon has also
handled stunts in films like Saving Private

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.450
Ryan and Courage Under Fire.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.380
With a new Bourne film just around the corner,
who knows what Damon will do next?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.380
Jason Statham

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.350
Making his career out of starring in action
films, Jason Statham enjoys the adrenaline

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.040
rush from doing his own stunts.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.011
His filmography is chock full of great examples,
making it difficult to choose just one as

00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:34.011
his biggest highlight.

00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:37.730
Statham has proven himself as a master of
stunt driving, but he feels as if he’s dug

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.730
himself into a hole.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.820
He’s so great and doing stunts, his fans
expect something bigger and greater each time

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.220
out, forcing Statham to test his limits and
defy death on numerous occasions.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.120
But it’s something he loves and he keeps
on delivering, so we’re not complaining.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.380
Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.650
Partially because filmmakers could rarely
find a stunt double that matched the action

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.210
legend’s unique build, Arnold did many of
his own stunts in his films.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.820
It’s no surprise that the actor was up for
the task, since he was always in peak physical

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.060
condition as a bodybuilder.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.624
His ability as a stuntman was what launched
him into Hollywood in the first place, and

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.050
Schwarzenegger has never looked back.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.650
He refused to use a stunt double during The
Last Stand because he wanted everything to

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.260
feel as real as possible.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.580
Even as an aging icon, he’s still got it.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.770
Sylvester Stallone

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.719
Sly broke out as a dramatic actor in Rocky,
but made a name for himself as an action star

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.060
as his career progressed.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.789
Stallone showed supreme dedication in his
films, and was always willing to sacrifice

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:32.789
his body.

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.870
During Rocky IV, he was sent to intensive
care after being punched by Dolph Lundgren

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.289
and broke his neck while filming the first
Expendables movie.

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.621
As great as it was to see him return to his
roots in Creed, we hope Stallone’s action

00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:42.879
days aren’t past him yet.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.569
There’s something to admire in his ability
to take the hits and keep pushing forward.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.520
Cameron Diaz

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.129
Not the first name that comes to mind when
thinking of dangerous stunts, Diaz has showcased

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.789
her mettle in more ways than one.

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.520
Acting opposite Tom Cruise in Knight and Day,
Diaz performed many of the action sequences

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.449
herself, including the stunt driving.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.830
She suffered a few cuts and bruises along
the way, but it helped sell her character

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.960
and make the scenes seem real.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.780
And besides, Knight and Day wasn’t her first
go-around with the genre; Diaz starred in

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.310
two Charlie’s Angels films to cut her teeth
as an action star in the making.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.300
Those are our picks for Hollywood stars that
refuse to get a stunt double.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.659
