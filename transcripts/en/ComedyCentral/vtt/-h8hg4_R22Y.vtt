00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.149
- This is how television works,
bitches.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:16.716
- Ready?
<i> - Which camera?</i>

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.385

Today we're gonna talk about

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.291
Bass Reeves.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:28.261
- [laughs]

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.698
<i> - Bass Reeves is born
 as a slave.</i>

<i> Bass Reeves...</i>

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:45.311
<i> punches his owner
 in the face.</i>

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:48.448
<i> And Bass Reaves
 thinks to himself,</i>

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.186
<i> Oh, [bleep], you guys,
 I just coldcocked my boss.</i>

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.055
<i> Listen, let's be honest,
 my owner.</i>

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.724
<i> This is probably not
 gonna be good for me.</i>

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:01.527
<i> So, Bass Reeves hightails it</i>

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.330
<i> to the Indian Territories
 of Oklahoma.</i>

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:07.400
So, Bass Reeves
winds up living among

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.035
the Seminole Nation,

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:12.438
learning the language of all
of these indigenous peoples.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:15.408

- Um...
[both laugh]

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.057
- I may be aimed down at the
ground for the whole of this,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.093
but don't worry about that.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.630
<i> In 1875 the U.S. is changing.</i>

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:40.800

<i> U.S. Marshal James Fagan knew
 that this was dangerous work.</i>

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.374
<i> He needed the guy that</i>

 in that area.</i>

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.379
<i> - [laughs]
 - So, Fagan goes to Reeves.</i>

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:58.651
<i>Hey, I have 75,000 square miles
 to cover</i>

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:01.287
<i> to bring bad guys to justice.</i>

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.222
<i> And Bass Reeves said,</i>

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.391
<i> Listen, I'm ambidextrous,</i>

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.628
<i> I can shoot a gun
 with both hands.</i>

<i> The only thing I can say

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:24.777
I'm gonna tape a--take a nap.
[bleep] you.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.014
<i> - ♪ There he goes

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.016
- Derek?
- Mm-hmm?

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:30.516
- Take my hand.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.120 align:start size:59% position:41%
- Good night, then.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:35.121
- Night.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:35.488
So...

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:41.594
<i> So, Bass Reeves is working
 as a U.S. Marshal,</i>

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.129
<i> picking up bad guys.</i>

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:46.866
So, one of the bad guy things
that he does is,

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.036
he dresses himself up
as an old beggar

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.707
at the homestead of
a couple of bad guys' mother.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.111
<i> He says,
 I'm just a poor old beggar.</i>

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:01.714
<i> I just need a place to stay
 for the night.</i>

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:05.918
<i> So she gives Bass Reeves
 a place to spend the night.</i>

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.454
<i> As soon as the two outlaws
 fell asleep,</i>

00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:12.491
<i> Bass Reeves
 pulled down his shawl,</i>

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:14.260
<i> grabs his six shooter.</i>

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:16.529
He says,
The Bass w--hold on.

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:19.432
<i> I'm gonna corner
 their dumb asses</i>

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.099
<i> while they're sleeping.</i>

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:22.702
I'll sleep you--

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.505
<i> I will sleep clack you
 into my handcuffs, bitches!</i>

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:28.474
<i> And I'm gonna grag you...</i>

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:31.844
I'm gonna grag you--hold on.

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:34.513
<i> I'm gonna drag your asses
 in jail</i>

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:36.816
<i> where I gathered up
 all the criminals.</i>

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.485
<i> - That's pretty badass.</i>
- Listen, mother[bleep],

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:41.487
I'll tell you this whole story,
hold on.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.191
This is how big a badass
Bass Reeves is.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:48.828
<i> The Brunter Brothers,
 another group of outlaws,</i>

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.263
<i> ambushed him at gunpoint.</i>

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:53.633
<i> Bass Reeves kept his cool,</i>

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.636
<i> turned to the first
 Brunter Brother and said,</i>

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.172
<i> I'm sorry, do you know what
 the date is today?</i>

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.475
<i> And as that brother was
 trying to figure out</i>

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:07.013
<i> Bass Reeves shoots
 the first two brothers.</i>

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:09.782
And then coldcocked
the other brother

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.752
and carried them back
to the court at Fort Lewis.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.720
