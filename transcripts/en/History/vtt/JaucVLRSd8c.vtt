00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.294
[music playing]

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:12.303
NARRATOR: Sanliurfa,
Turkey, June, 2017.

00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:14.848
Author and researcher
Andrew Collins

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.768
travels to the Sanliurfa
Archeology and Mosaic Museum,

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.938
just 10 miles from
Gobekli Tepe, to meet

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.190
with curator Taha Ozyavuz.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.109
- Taha, I presume.
- Welcome.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.652
Nice to meet you.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.612
NARRATOR: He is there to
get an up close look at one

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.823
of the most mysterious
stone structures

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:35.076
on Earth at the ancient site.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.078
I think this is what
we've come to see, here.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:11.946
Right.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.264
And the fact that we have
three different figures

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:41.142
here, each of different sizes--

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.310
what do you think
that represents?

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.412
Why do you think that it
was damaged or destroyed

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:02.997
in this way in antiquity?

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:15.051
So somebody came along and
deliberately destroyed it.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.643
NARRATOR: If the stone
column found at Gobekli Tepe

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:27.230
represents a genetic
lineage, just why

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.693
were two of the figures
deliberately defaced?

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:35.572
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that perhaps it

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:39.117
was an attempt to obscure
the truth about humankind's

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.285
other-worldly origins.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.749
DAVID WILCOCK: What's curious
about this totem pole is

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.169
that there is essentially
a larger being,

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.589
perhaps an
extraterrestrial, that

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.384
has its hands around this other
being that isn't exactly human,

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.928
but has human-like
characteristics.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.932
Could be a primitive human.

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.810
This figure appears
to be giving birth.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.771
And the baby that is emerging
from this mother's womb

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.108
is clearly a human
baby with a human face.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:16.362
This suggests, possibly, that a
breeding experiment took place,

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.406
leading to the development
of modern humans

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:21.534
as we now know them.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.244
WILLIAM HENRY: The
interesting thing about this

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.873
is that totem poles are like
the repository for information.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.124
It's an encyclopedia.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.709
It's like a time capsule.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.046
And so if we have a genealogical
record in this pillar

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.424
at Gobekli Tepe, and we follow
the ultimate extension of it,

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.676
and we realize that what
they're possibly telling

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:42.722
us is their ancestors
were non-human.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.432
DAVID CHILDRESS: So
you have to wonder.

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.852
The whole idea was to
preserve information

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.980
from our
extraterrestrial past so

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.943
that future generations
would ultimately decode

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.236
the information that's there.

00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:01.407
Information, possibly, about
our extraterrestrial creators.
