00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.520
Here we've graphed
the function y

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.910
is equal to the
square root of x.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.910
And we're going to create
a solid of revolution,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.890
but we're not going to
do it by rotating this

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.990
around the x or the y-axis.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.830
Instead, we're
going to rotate it

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.920
around another somewhat
arbitrary line.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.650
And in this case,
I will rotate it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.140
around the line y is equal to 1.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.250
So let's say that
this right over here

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.330
is the line y equals 1.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.915
So this is what we're going to
rotate it around, y equals 1.

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:31.540
So the first thing we want to do
is visualize what we're doing.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.350
And we actually care
about the interval.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.600
So let's say that the
interval is between this point

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.570
right over here where
the two points intersect.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.830
And let's say between
that and x is equal to 4.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.810
So let's say that this right
over here, so this is x

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.870
equals 4.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.830
So it's going to be
just right over here.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.400
So this is the interval
that we're rotating,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.358
and we're going to rotate
it around y equals 1,

00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:55.442
not around the x-axis.

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:56.900
So what would our
figure look like?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.500
Well, we're going to
rotate it around like this.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.220
Going to rotate it around
something like this.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.892
And so your figure
is going to look,

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:10.600
I guess you could call
it, it will almost

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.280
look like a cone
head, if you view it

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.520
on the side, or
something like a bullet,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.040
but not quite looking
like a bullet.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.730
But it would be a shape that
looks something like that.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.340
So hopefully, we
can visualize this.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.480
We've done this
several times already,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.130
attempting to
visualize these shapes.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.380
But let's think about how
we could actually figure out

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.450
the volume of this
solid of revolution.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.660
Well, let's just think
about it disk by disk.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.095
So construct a disk
right over here.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.500
And we've done this many,
many, many times already

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.029
where we essentially want the
volume of each of these disks.

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.320
And then we're going to take
this for each of these x's

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.861
in our interval,
and then we're going

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:50.910
to take the sum of the
volumes of all the disks

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.956
to find the volume.

00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:53.330
We're going to
stack them all up,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.040
or I guess put them next
to each other in this case,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.710
and find the volume
of our entire figure.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.060
So to figure out the
volume of each disk,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.280
we just have to figure
out the area of its face.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.622
And I'll do that in purple.

00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:08.580
We just have to figure
out the area of the face

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.020
and multiply it by the depth.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.620
So what's the area of this face?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.250
Well, it's going to be pi times
the radius of the face squared.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.150
Now, what's the radius
of the face here?

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.360
Well, it's not just
square root of x.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.620
Square root of x would
tell us the distance

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.960
between the x-axis
and our function.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.870
It's now square
root of x minus 1.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.200
This length right over here.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.040
The square root of x minus 1
for any given x in our interval.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.450
So it's going to be equal
to square root of-- let

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.660
me do that same orange
color just to make it clear

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.965
where I'm getting it from.

00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:52.780
It's going to be equal to
square root of x minus 1.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.460
It's essentially
our function minus

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.790
what we are rotating around.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.690
That gives us the radius.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.790
And so this will give us the
area of each of our faces.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.300
And then we just multiply
that times the depth.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.259
The depth, of course, is dx.

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.550
We've done that multiple times.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.470
So times dx.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.930
This is the thing that we want
to sum up over our interval.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.660
And our interval-- let's see,
this point right over here

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.460
where the square root
of x is equal to 1,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.330
that's just going
to be x equals 1.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.710
This is just x
equals 1 over here.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.240
And we said that
we would do this

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.172
all the way until x equals 4.

00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:36.880
This was kind of our
end of our interval.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.920
So this is until x is equal
to-- let me be careful.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.520
This is the x-axis
right over here.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.710
All the way until x equals 4.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.950
So we get confused.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.620
This is the x-axis.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.780
So we're going from x
equals 1 to x equals 4.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.130
And we're essentially
taking this area, one way

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.500
to think about it, between
our square root of x and 1,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.257
and we're rotating it around 1.

00:04:00.257 --> 00:04:02.340
So we're using these little
disks right over here.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.980
So the interval between 1 and 4.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.560
And so this is going to give
us the volume of our solid

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.250
of revolution.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.430
And so now we just
have to evaluate

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.320
this definite integral.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.590
So let's give a shot at it.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.279
So this is going to be equal
to the integral from 1 to 4.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.450
And we can factor out--
or we could put the pi

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.920
outside the integral sign.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.030
And then we can expand this out.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.126
So square root of x squared.

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.950
Now, what we're going to do
is expand this binomial so

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.680
the square root of x minus
1 times the square root of x

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.950
minus 1.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.870
Square root of x times
square root of x is x.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.570
Square root of x times negative
1 is negative square root of x.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.040
Negative 1 times
square root of x

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.930
is another negative
square root of x.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.080
And then negative
1 times negative 1

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.480
is equal to positive 1.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.440
So this part right
over here will

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.960
simplify to x minus
2 square roots of x.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.430
This is minus 2
square roots of x.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.410
And then you have plus 1.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.800
And then all of that times dx.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.660
So this is going to
be equal to-- let's

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.920
put our pi out there--
the antiderivative

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.440
of this business.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.800
So that the antiderivative
of x is x squared over 2.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.186
The antiderivative-- so minus
2 times the antiderivative

00:05:29.186 --> 00:05:32.040
of square root of x.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.830
Well, square root of x is
just x to the 1/2 power,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.670
so we increment the power by 1.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:43.160
So it's going to be x to
the 3/2 power times 2/3.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.340
So times 2/3.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:52.380
Or we could say it's going
to be times 2/3x to the 3/2.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.720
Let me make it clear.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.160
This negative 2 right
here is this negative 2.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.130
And this expression
right over here

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.367
is the antiderivative
of square root of x.

00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:05.450
And you could verify this.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.520
If you take the derivative
of this, 3/2 times 2/3 is 1.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.690
Decrement the 3/2,
you get x to the 1/2.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.930
Now let's take the
antiderivative of 1.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.000
Well, that's just
going to be equal to x.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.422
And we're going to
evaluate this from 1 to 4.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.630
So we're in the home stretch.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.720
So this is going to
be equal to pi times--

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.630
well, first let's do it at 4.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.170
So you have 4 squared--
I'll write it all out.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.600
4 squared over 2 minus-- what's
4 to the 3-- well, let me

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.650
do this part first.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.920
So minus 4/3.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.710
I know it's 4 to the 3/2,
so 4 to the 1/2 is 2,

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.290
and then you raise that to
the third power, you get 8.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.730
So times 8 plus 4.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.830
And then you subtract out all
of this stuff evaluated at 1.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.450
So 1 squared over 2, so that's
just going to be minus 1/2.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.570
And then we're
subtracting this now.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.050
Actually, I don't want
to skip too many steps.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.615
So it's going to be this.

00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:10.299
This is when we
evaluate it at 4.

00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:11.840
And then we're going
to subtract when

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.270
we evaluate this
whole thing at 1.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.130
So when we evaluate
it at 1-- let

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.540
me do this in this green color.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.140
That's not the green color
I thought I was going to do.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.960
So when you evaluate
it at 1, you

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.750
get 1 squared over
2, which is 1/2.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.040
And then you get 1 to
the 3/2, which is just 1.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.470
So this becomes minus 4/3.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.926
And then you have plus 1.

00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:43.050
And so let's simplify this.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.360
And I'll do it all in
the same color now.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.870
This is going to be
equal to pi times-- well,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:55.460
4 squared over 2, that is
16/2, which is equal to 8.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.300
And then you have 4 times
8, which is 32, over 3.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.860
So minus 32/3, plus 4.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.900
And then you have
minus 1/2-- we're just

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:13.396
distributing the negative-- plus
4/3, and then you have minus 1.

00:08:13.396 --> 00:08:15.520
And now we just have to
add up a bunch of fractions

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.670
to simplify this thing.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.990
So what do we get?

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.410
This is going to be equal
to pi times-- let's see,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.340
our least common
multiple looks like 6.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.905
We're going to put everything
over a denominator of 6.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.243
And so 8 is the
same thing as 48/6.

00:08:33.243 --> 00:08:39.740
32/3 is the same thing
as 64/6, so minus 64/6.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.640
4 is the same thing as 24/6.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.790
1/2 is the same thing as
3/6, so this is negative 3/6,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.010
the same thing as negative 1/2.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.680
4/3 is the same thing as 8/6.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.040
And then negative 1 is the
same thing as negative 6/6.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.350
A little bit of arithmetic
here and let's see what we get.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:10.790
So if we take 48 and we subtract
64 from 48, we get negative 16.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.660
Is that right?

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.220
Yes, we get negative 16.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.100
And then if we add
24 to negative 16,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.940
you get positive 8.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.950
Positive 8 minus 3 is 5.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.350
5 plus 8 is 13.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.370
13 minus 6 is 7.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.930
So this whole numerator
simplifies to 7.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.094
So we get 7 pi over
6 as our volume.

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:35.760
And let me just verify
I did that right.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.030
So this is going
to be negative 16.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.300
We get to positive 8, positive
8 plus positive 8 is 16.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.820
16 minus 9 is--
yes, it is indeed 7.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.530
So we get 7 pi over
6, and we're done.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.280
We figured out our volume
of this little sideways

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.070
cone-looking thing.
