00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.650
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: It is my huge
honor to introduce Andrea Beaty,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.450
the bestselling author
of Rosie Revere Engineer,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.400
Iggy Peck Architect, Attack
of the Fluffy Bunnies,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Hide and Sheep, Artist Ted.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.210
Andrea has received
numerous literary awards,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
The Friends of American Writers
Award, the Parents Choice Silver

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.730
and Gold Medals, National
Association

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.440 position:56%
of Parenting Publications gold
medals, and the Prairie State Award.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.280 position:56%
But I think the greatest recognition
is the number of children

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.430
who are right here waiting
for me to get off the stage.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.280
Andrea's latest book is Ada Twist
Scientist, a story of a child

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.300
who uses science to
understand her world.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.580
Andrea will be signing
books at 2:30,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.150
so bring your books or buy more.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.930
It is my huge pleasure to
introduce Andrea Beaty.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.230
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Thank you.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.280
Thank you so much.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.920
Oh my gosh.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.150
Thank you and welcome to
the National Book Festival.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.740
Can I tell you, this is my favorite
festival of all the festivals.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.070
And I've been to a few now.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.510
Hooray, let's give them a
massive amount of applause.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.380
[ Applause ]

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.490
Okay. We have things to talk about.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.390
So, a couple of years
ago I was here.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.730
Oh yay it works, yay.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.050
I was here, and I got to share with
you my brand new book at the time,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.170
and it was Rosie Revere Engineer.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.020
And the reception for
that book was so great.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.320
And kids loved it so much.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.940
And I just had so much fun with it

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.590
that we decided to
write another one.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.240
So today I'm extremely thrilled,
which is redundant but amazing,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.660
to share with you some things

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.390
about Ada Twist Scientist,
which is our next book.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.490
And it's out now, and I will be
signing it later as Carlos said.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.400
So, but I want to talk
to you a little bit

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.170
about where these books came from.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.400
A long time ago when my
son was about your age,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.980
he loved to build things.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.240
So he builds with blocks and
Legos and all the usual things.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.140 position:56%
But he also would go to the pantry
and he would pull out the soup cans,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.270
and he would make towers from them.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.510
And I thought that was so cool.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.240 position:56%
And that inspired me to write about
a kid who wanted to be an architect.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.570
A kid who wanted to build things.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.200
And so I wrote, I'm not
sure where his app is.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.500
There we go.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.110
So I wrote Iggy Peck
Architect about a little kid

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.530
who loved to build things.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.480
And Iggy loved building so much,
he would build from anything.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.070
So he even built one time, he
built a tower in just an hour

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.880
with nothing but diapers and glue.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.970
And that was cool until
his mother realized

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.430
that those diapers weren't clean.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.970
Ooh, good gracious
Ignatius she exclaimed.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.720
That's disgusting and nasty.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.710
It stinks.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.520
But Iggy was gone.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.870
He was out on the lawn using dirt
clods to build the great Sphinx.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.490
Iggy just was absorbed in his work.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.790
He didn't care.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.090
He was busy.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.900
And so Iggy made all kinds of
wonderful, wonderful things.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.390
And one day his class
went on a picnic.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.260
And they crossed this small
trestle to a small island,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.540
nestled in the heart
of a burbling stream.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.500
But they no sooner passed
than the footbridge collapsed,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.860
and Miss Lila Greer
started to scream.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.380
Oh no. And the teacher faints
right there on the island.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.040
And it's up to Iggy and his
friends to make a bridge.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.860
And so Iggy made a
wonderful, wonderful bridge.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.340
And he used all kinds of things.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.860
He used fruit rollups
and strings and all kinds

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.610
of things you shouldn't even
mention, like the underwear there

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.910
at the top of the bridge.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.260
Don't bring that up.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.300
Don't mention it.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.530
So after we wrote Iggy we thought,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.540
wouldn't it be fun
to have another book.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.220
Because when I wrote Iggy, I sent
just the words to the publisher.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.710
And she found David Roberts, this
amazing illustrator in England.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.530
And he brought back this
beautiful, beautiful class of kids.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.030
And I looked at those kids
and I thought, oh my gosh,

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.710
that's some interesting kids.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.010
But you know what?

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.310
I look at you guys.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.820 position:56%
I look at all you kids out here, and
I think you are interesting kids.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.630
You're smart, and you're
funny, and you're creative.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.140
And you're clever.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.800
And you can do amazing things.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.060
So I thought, I should
write some more books

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.060
to explore the cool
things that kids can do.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.700
But how could I start?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.930
Where could I even begin
with so many cool kids?

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.650
So, I did research.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.080
I have a science background, so
I used it and I did research.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.720
And I went through the book, and
I looked at all the pictures.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.420
And I noticed that every
kid shows up four times.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.130
And so, I noticed this girl.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.390
I noticed this girl with her
hair swooping over her eyes.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.530
And I saw that you never,
ever see both of her eyes.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.830
She's always hiding.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.380
And she's sitting there kind of
shy and trying not to be seen.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.060
And I thought, huh,
what's your story?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.500
Because this is what I know.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.850
I know that shy kids may
not be talking all the time,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.770
but they're always watching.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.170
And they're always listening.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.870
And they're always thinking.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.560
And when they're ready,
oh when they are ready,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.840
a shy kid will tell you the
most interesting creative

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.700
and cool things.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.770
So I wanted to see
what she would do.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.170
And this became Rosie
Revere Engineer.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.340
And so Rosie has had
some adventures.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.900
Rosie loves to build things.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.690
So Rosie when she was young,
she made a hotdog dispenser

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.920
for her family, for
her uncles and aunts.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.080
And helium pants.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.740
I would like to have
some helium pants.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.680 position:56%
I'm counting on you young engineers
to please make me some helium pants.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.450
I don't think it's too much to ask.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.760
Is it? It's not.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.890
Rosie also helped her Uncle
Fred, who's a zookeeper.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.490
And Uncle Fred has a snake problem.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.850
He can't keep the snakes
off his head.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.720
He can't keep the snakes
out of his shirt,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.790
and he can't even keep
them in the cage.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.390
He needed some help.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.850
So Rosie made him the cheese hat.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.580
And it works with cheddar
cheese spray

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.880
which everyone knows
keeps the pythons away.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.520
And that's true.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.180
Because in nature you will
never see cheese spray

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.090
and pythons in the same place.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.420
I'm telling you.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.060
That's very bad science,
but it's still true.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.940
It is bad science.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.870
So Rosie made the cheese
hat, but her uncle laughed.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.910
And he laughed because he loved it.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.970
But she thought he
was laughing at her.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.100 position:56%
And so she just said she would never
show anybody her inventions again.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.110
Until one day, great-great
Aunt Rose came along.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.030 position:56%
And great-great Aunt Rose had worked
a long time ago building airplanes

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.380
to help out the country.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.540
And she'd done so many cool things.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.990
But she said you know, the only
thing left on my list is to fly,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.050
but I don't think I'll get to.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.120
I don't think I'll ever get to fly
because it's an old lady's dream.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.530
Well guess what, Rosie
got to thinking.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.840
And she thought and she
thought and she thought.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.490
And she came up with
the helio-cheese copter.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.930
And she got in it,
strapped into her cockpit.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.740
She flipped on the switch.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.490
The helio-cheese copter
sputtered and twitched.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.530
It floated a moment and
twirled round and round.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:51.200
It froze for a heartbeat
and crashed to the ground.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.850
And then Rosie heard
laughter and turned

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.510
around to see the old woman
laughing and slapping her knee.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.430
She laughed until she wheezed
and her eyes filled with tears.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.710
All to the horror of Rosie
Revere who thought, oh no,

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:11.460
never not ever again will I try to
build something to sputter or spin

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.160
or build with a lever,
a switch or a gear.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.960
And never will I be
a great engineer.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.710
And so Rosie thought she would
never be a great engineer,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.040
but she does end up learning.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.950
She learns from her aunt
that it's okay to fail.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.140
You just have to keep trying.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.820
And so that book ended.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.600
And I thought, I'd like try again.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.370
I'd like to make another story.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.540
So what did I do?

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.320
I did some research, didn't I?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.630
And I went back and I looked
at all the kids in the class.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.930
And I looked at them all.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.500
And I went through two books now,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.200
and I looked to see what
all of the kids would do.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.080
And I came to this
picture from Iggy Peck.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.800
And if you notice in this picture,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.720
everyone's busy helping
Iggy make the bridge,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.330
except the one girl who's licking
all the lollipops in the basket

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.320
and throwing those on the ground.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.180
I'm not sure what her story
is, but I will find out.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.670
And then I noticed over there
there's a little girl in the red

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.750
and white dress, the little
African-American girl.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.420
And she's sitting here,
and she's doing this.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.200
What do you think she's doing?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.230
What is she doing?

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.650
She's thinking.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:25.950
She's thinking.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.240
And I thought okay,
that kid is curious.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.490
That girl is a scientist.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.040
And so I wrote Ada Twist Scientist.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.040
And I'm going to tell a little bit
about the story, and then I'm going

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.420
to tell you some really cool
secrets about the books.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.530
Because that's one of
my favorite things here.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.660
So Ada Twist is this kid,
and she is so curious.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.980
And from the time she is born, she
doesn't talk for a long, long time.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.840
But boy when she gets
out of her crib, boom,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.940
she tears through the
house exploring everything.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.810
She wants to know what
everything is about.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.720
She's thinking all the
time, what's going on?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.020
What's new?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.320
How does this work?

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.620
What is that?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.150 position:56%
And when she turns three she climbs
up the top of the grandfather clock,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.870
and her parents yell stop,
as all good parents would.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.660
And Ada's chin quivered,
but she didn't cry.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.370
She looked at her folks,
and she simply said, why?

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.810
Why does it tick, and
why does it tock?

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.090
And why don't we call it
a granddaughter clock?

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.890
Why are there pointy
things stuck to a rose?

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.750
Why are there hairs up
inside of your nose?

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.520
These are good questions.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.480
They needed answers.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.680
And from that moment on, Ada Twist
was out to find out everything,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.290
and she never stopped
asking questions.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.480
She asked questions about animals.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.550
She asked questions about planets.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.490
She even got to school, and the
experiments went crazy wild.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.030
Here she is doing an experiment
with Miss Greer and the class.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.200
Do you think Miss Greer likes that?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.450
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: I don't think
Miss Greer is really happy here.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.750
What about the kids?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.050
Are they having fun?

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.920
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Sometimes
science is really messy.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.980
And sometimes that's
my favorite part.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.770
And one day she's standing
outside and all of a sudden zowie.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.030
She smells something so stinky,
she doesn't even know what it is.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.860 position:56%
She's like whoa, what is that smell?

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.760
And she decides that she has to go
on a quest to find out what smells.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.260
And she starts doing experiments.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.210
And she does an experiment
with the cat.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.510
She's like oh.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.570
Well first off she starts
with her dad's soup.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.750
Her cabbage soup, his cabbage soup.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.100
And she starts adding curdled
milk and stinky onions.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.400
And all kinds of things.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.030
Yes, ooh, not a good thing to do.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.330
But it wasn't the right smell.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.830
So she takes the cat, and she
says I think it's the perfume.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.030
And so she puts perfume on the cat.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.610
That's not cool.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.750
Oh, she gets in such trouble,
and her parents say, enough.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.200
Enough Ada Marie.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.880
Go sit in the thinking chair and
think about what you've done.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.720
And so she does.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.430
And so Ada sat and she sat
and she sat, and she thought

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.050
about science and stew and the cat.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.350
And how her experiments
made such a big mess.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.710
Does it have to be so?

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.720
Is that part of success?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.490
Are messes a problem.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.860
And while she was thinking,
what was the source

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.780
of that terrible stinking?

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.540
Ada Marie did what scientists
do, she asked a small question.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.920
And then she asked two.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.120
And each of those led her
to three questions more.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.880
And some of those questions
resulted in four.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.690
And so she digs in, and
she starts scribbling

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.960
on the wall all of her ideas.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.270 position:56%
And when her parents come back,
they have some things to figure out.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.290
Now, that's all I'm going
to tell you about the book,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.980
and you have to read it to
figure out what's so smelly.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.280
Isn't that terrible?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.080
Don't you hate it when
people do that?

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.380
Something stinks.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.140
I won't tell you what it is.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.570
I want to share, take a few
minutes to share some of the things

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.010
that I really love
about these books.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.800
So this is a picture
of me over to the left.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.520
And I'm in front of a doughnut shop

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.710
in Chicago that's called
We Can Doughnuts.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.380
And I'm there posing
like Rosie Revere.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.840
But the gentleman over to
the right is David Roberts.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.260
And David lives in London.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.370
And we've only been
able to meet one time.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.790
But David gave me the greatest gift
probably anyone's ever given me

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.090
in life.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.270 position:56%
And I've had some, well maybe not
the best, but one of the best gifts.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.710
He created that bunch of kids.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.800
And he created this
world which is so rich.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.930
But David is a smart,
tricky, clever guy,

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:55.110
and he hides things
in the illustrations.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.180
So he created these kids, and in
all the illustrations you'll notice

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.330
connections with all the
different books, excuse me,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.310 position:56%
including Happy Birthday Madame
Chapeau, which we also did together.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:12.580
So here you'll say Rosie Revere
is there and so is Iggy Peck.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.350
And Rosie has a hotdog.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.020
Oh, Ada Twist has the hotdog,
and she's smelling that.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.990 position:56%
That's the hotdog from Rosie Revere.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.320
At the end of, in Iggy
Peck, Iggy has a pencil.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.320
At the end of Rosie Revere,
she also has a pencil.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.490
At the end of this book
now, Ada has a pencil.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.670
So he finds ways to tuck
into these illustrations sort

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:43.950
of the progress the kids are making
and just important little details.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.090
So I'm going to just
point out a few.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:51.590
So Ada Marie Twist is named after
two very, very famous women.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.910 position:56%
Ada Lovelace, who was the first
computer programmer, and Marie Curie

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.540
who was the first woman to win
a Nobel Prize, the first person

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.620
to win two prizes in different
topics, and a crazy awesome lady.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.040
In the blocks on the floor,
the blocks spell Lovelace.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.740
And you can see Ada is
reaching up to the mobile.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:19.810 position:56%
She's reaching for the stars before
she conks out on top of the dresser.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.290
So Ada is driven by curiosity,

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.610
but she's very smart
and she's very logical.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.870
And she's always trying
to figure things out.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.630
So here in the book as she's doing
any kind of experiment or looking

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.550
at something, you guys, you kids
have to look at that and try

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.660
to figure out what she's
learning, what she's thinking.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.550
So if you look at that
picture, she's trying to figure

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.430
out how many legs the
animals have, her toys have.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.280
So the bird has two.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.420
The dog has four.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.410
The squid has eight.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.780
And the elephant has five.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.330
Is that the correct number?

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.510
It's not, but it's logical.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.680
So those kinds of things
are in the book.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.240
So parents I hope, spend some
time and just really dive in,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.180
and you'll just be so impressed.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.480
I know I was.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.740
Oh and also, his blocks
say Ada as well.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.930 position:56%
David never leaves anything to risk.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.670
All of the gowns by the way, he
studied fashion illustration,

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.490 position:56%
which is why all of the adults in
these books are so cool and styling.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:26.170
And they're all based on his own
designs, inspired by other people.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.930
So here's Ada, and she's outside

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.000
when she smells the
stinky, stinky smell.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.220
And she looks over there, and if
you can see in the background,

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.790
there's the sphinx that Iggy Peck
created and the cheese copter.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.790
And so there's clues in these books
that these kids are neighbors.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.160
And it's fun to watch with
kids, like you guys find them.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.610
They're very cool.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.030
Okay, this is my favorite
picture I think in the whole book.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.130
So Ada's family kind of
figures out, you know what,

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.580
she is going to be this
kid who is curious,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.890
and she's going to do this stuff.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.680
We're the ones who
have to figure out how

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.700
to help her be her awesome self.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.920
And so they get her this
wonderful paper roll

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.890
where she does experiments.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.430
And you can see on the
paper, she's trying to figure

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.110
out which came first,
the chicken or the egg.

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.350
It's a very good question,
one that people debate.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.420
And the other thing she's
drawing is a double-decker bus.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.160
And she's figured out if
the man drives the bottom,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.330
the driver on the bottom, who
is driving the top of the bus?

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.630
I don't know.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.870
But my favorite part
in this is the books.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.610
So we all of us involved
in the books, which was me

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.270
and Susan Van Metre our editor,

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.160
and Chad Beckerman our art
director, and David Roberts.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.060
We all wanted to include some
of the important influences

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.960
and scientific discoveries
and people

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.800
that we think are really important.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.830
So there are titles there like
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.610
There's also some funny ones.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.470
Cosmos is there because I was
a big, big fan of Carl Sagan.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.620
I think, you know, he
changed my world pretty much.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.080
And I hope you guys watch
the new Cosmos show,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.910
which is absolutely brilliant.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:14.000
But my favorite here is the How's
it Going Cat by Schrodinger.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.300
That's a good one.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.830
And there's a lot of
funny, funny, funny ones.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:22.630
And, I'm going to tell you guys
a secret, okay, if you can see

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.020
up at the top of the
paper, there's a box.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.430
In that box is a cat.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.480
And the cat that's looking out.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.480
That's Iggy Peck's cat.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.220
So there are secrets
hidden in the book.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.780
So when you get home,
you can look at it.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.160
Okay. I think we only
have a few minutes.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.670
I know I'm going to spend like
the next 30 years figuring

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.240
out the things here.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.230
When you look at the
initials in there, AB is me,

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.840
DR is David Roberts,
SVN is our editor,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.960
Susan Van Metre, CB
is Chad Beckerman.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.010
So there's goofy stuff, and there's
also some actual really great

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.020
science in here as well.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.170
Okay, and I think, oh I have
this last thing to tell you.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.350
Two things, one in the
spring we have a fantastic,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.300
fantastic project book coming out.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.190
I just finished the
working it, writing it.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.490
David's finished the art.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.790
It's going to be so much fun.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.480
So you engineers can
make cool, cool things,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.290
just to help you with your ideas.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.910
There'll be one for Iggy too.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:27.670 position:56%
And, on Tuesday, this is the coolest
thing in the world, an astronaut,

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.330
Astronaut Kate Rubins is going
to read Rosie Revere Engineer

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.570
in the International Space Station.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.870
Isn't that cool?

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.170
I know. That's what I said.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.470
What? I know.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.790
It's too cool.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.240
And somewhere in a few months.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.650 position:56%
It's not going to be televised live,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.190
but somewhere in the next few
months, they will download

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:49.880 position:56%
that video, and it will be online at
a site called Storytimefromspace.org

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.430
for all of you guys
to watch and to read.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.730
Now, thank you.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.060
I know we have a few questions.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.920
I'd love to do a few questions
before we run out of time.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.020
So there's a process for that.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.000
Oh there's a microphone here.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.300
Okay.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.790
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.090
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Hi.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.450
&gt;&gt; So I have a daughter, Lila,
and I have a daughter, Ada.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.750
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Lila and Ada.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.390
&gt;&gt; And I have a son,
Sam, and he wants to know

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:14.880
when you're going to
put a Sam in a book.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.690
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Oh, you're not
going to change your name to Iggy?

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.990
You wouldn't go for that?

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.290
No.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.590
&gt;&gt; He's six.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.890
It's a little late.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: It's a little late.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.490
That boat's sailed for you.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:26.790
Well that is a great question.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.090
And now I have to think about that.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.390
I'm going to put on
my thinking face.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.690
Hmmm. Hi.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:36.710
&gt;&gt; Hi. What was your
favorite book so far?

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.800
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Oh, which
of these is my favorite.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.150
Wow, I don't think I can tell you.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:48.890 position:56%
You know what, maybe Rosie because I
love great, great Aunt Rose so much.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.240
And frankly, I look a little
bit like her, don't I?

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.350
Yeah. Can I tell you, I
dressed up like great,

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:59.590
great Aunt Rose last Halloween,
and I didn't have to buy anything.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.250
I did make a can with some
silver like rivets but, yeah.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:08.690
So it may be her because I included
great, great Aunt Rose in this book

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.330
as a way to say think you to the
Rosie the Riveters and the men

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.700
who fought in World War II.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.970
My aunt is a Rosie the Riveter,
and we have an unpayable debt

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.800
to those marvelous people.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.540
So that's probably
that for that reason.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.840
Yes.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; When did you start writing books?

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.180
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: When did
I start writing books?

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.690
You know what, I was 30 years
old when I figured it out.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.040
&gt;&gt; That is so cool.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.070
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: That is so
old, yes, that's not as cool.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.370
Oh there's more.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.670
There's people over here.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.970
Hello people over here.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.490
&gt;&gt; What inspired.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.410
&gt;&gt; How did you make them?

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.770
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: How
did I make those books?

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:51.460
You know what, I wrote the stories,
and then people helped me make them

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.060
because it takes a lot
of people to make a book.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.830
So there's David and the
editors and so many people.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.130
Yes.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.950
&gt;&gt; What inspired you
to write the books?

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.420
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: What inspired me?

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.920
You know, they really did
start from asking questions.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.920
So I saw my son building these
things, and I thought what if.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.270
And these were as kids, these
are the most powerful words.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.180
Whatever you want to do,
ask yourself, what if.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.840
What if there was a kid who
wanted to be an architect.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.760
What if we wanted to
put a man on the moon?

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.260
What if we wanted to cure cancer?

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.560
What if, what if, what if.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.170
We can do anything when
we decide to do it.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.980
But those questions
really inspired me.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.480
Yeah. Should we do back and forth?

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.860
Yes.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.040
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to write?

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.340
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: What inspired me

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.090
to write really ideas
come from everywhere.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.640
They come from books I read

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.530
and people I meet and
all kinds of things.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.830
Yes.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.900
&gt;&gt; Where did you get the books?

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.440
I mean, where do you put the
books so we can get them?

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.740
Because [inaudible].

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.040
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: That's
a great question.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.340
So where are the books if
you'd like to get them?

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.050
There is Politics and
Pros over, where is it,

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.350 position:56%
I don't know where it is physically.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.650
Physically over there.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:09.100
And I will be signing the books
at 2:30 I believe, 2:30 to 3:30,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.870
so I would love to sign for you.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.760
So I hope you'll come by.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.060
Thank you.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.360
&gt;&gt; Bye.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.660
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Bye.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.250
Thank you, and I did not pay
him to do that or anything.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.200
Yes.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.560
&gt;&gt; So my name is Ada.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.470
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Well
Ada, I'm glad to meet you.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.040
&gt;&gt; And I'm glad that
there's a book named Ada.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.340
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: I'm
glad there is too,

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.970
and I didn't even know
you then either.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.270
Very cool.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.570
It's a good name.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.870
You should read about Ada Lovelace.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.790
And there's another great
book with the name Ada.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.810
It's called Ada's Ideas,
and it's about Ada Lovelace.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.110
It just came out.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.410
It's brilliant.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.710
&gt;&gt; And I, oh sorry.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.010
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: That's okay.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.310
Yes.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.690
&gt;&gt; How long did it take
you to write one book?

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.840
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Okay, how long
does it take to write one book.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.720
I have no answer for that.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.090
So because, when I wrote
Dr. Ted, I wrote that book

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.310
in an hour, and it was done.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.090
When I wrote Hide and
Sheep, it took me ten years.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.920 position:56%
And it's shorter than the other one.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:13.150
It took me about five months
to write Ada Twist Scientist

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.890
because it took me a long
time to figure out her name,

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.310
who I was going to name her after.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.910
Because there are so many,
so many amazing scientists

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.670
and so many amazing
women scientists.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.480 position:56%
And I wanted to name her after them.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.970
But I also had to make the
names work with rhyming.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.270
So it's very difficult.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.070
If a name is too long,

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.830 position:56%
like a scientist named Nebuchdnezzar
Lolakaubooblahs [phonetic] is never

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.310
going to get in a book.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.250
There's not enough letters.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.510
So, it varies.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.320
I never know when I start.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.620
Yes.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.290
&gt;&gt; How did you become a writer?

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.480
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: How
did I become a write.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.860
You know what, I studied biology

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.420
and computer science
when I was in college.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.230
And I love science, and I love
math, and I love literature,

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.790
and I love all kinds of things.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.770
So I just follow things that
are really interesting to me.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.090
And when I got out
of college I worked

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.960
in the computer industry
for a while.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.890
And then when I had kids, I
was staying home with them,

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.960
and I started reading picture books

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.900
that I hadn't really read
picture books since I was a kid.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.790
And they were so much better
than when I was a kid.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.780
I had a few good ones,
but I'm telling you now,

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.810
the quality of picture
books for kids is insane.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.210
And I started getting ideas.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:32.310
And once I got ideas, that
was it, started writing.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.610
Hi.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.730
&gt;&gt; What did you use to make
the pictures of the book?

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.670
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: What did
I use to make the pictures?

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.030
You know, David Roberts,
who lives in London,

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.330
I'm not sure if I did that.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.120
David Roberts, who lives in
London makes the pictures.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.800
And I think he uses ink pens and
paper, a special kind of paper.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.590
And he uses watercolor.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.560
And when he does the art,
he does it actually to size,

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.990
so he doesn't make it bigger
or smaller or change it.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.260
He makes it exactly
the size you see.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.530
And sometimes those illustrations
are very, very intricate,

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.060
and there's so many details.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.480
So it's pretty remarkable.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.280
Yes.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.380
[ Inaudible ]

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.680
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.980
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Hi.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.280
&gt;&gt; Say hello.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.580
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.880
&gt;&gt; Hi, how are you?

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.180
&gt;&gt; How do you make the words rhyme?

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.460
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Oh, how
do I make the words rhyme?

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.550
Sometimes with great
difficulty I will say.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.370
You know what, I used some special
tools when I do rhyming books.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.520
So what I do is I have a very
special dictionary called The

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.150
Flip Dictionary.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:39.440
So it helps me find whenever
I have like a bridge.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.170
I knew that I wanted Iggy Peck to
cross over some sort of bridge,

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.760
but the word bridge wasn't
rhyming with anything.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.700
So I thought ah, a trestle is a
kind of bridge, so I could look

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.100
up all the things related

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.650
with structures you could
build in The Flip Dictionary.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.040
And I said trestle, a
small island nestled

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.730
in the heart of a burbling stream.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.320
And I have a rhyming dictionary

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.250
which helps me find
words that sound alike.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.500
And sometimes I have to
jumble my sentences up

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.630
and rework the whole
thing to make it work.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.750
And sometimes, it just doesn't.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.050
Yes.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.470
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to
make The Hidden Secrets?

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.750
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Oh, what inspired
me to make The Hidden Secrets?

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.290
Well that's the marvelous
thing is I didn't.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.490
So I get to enjoy them
the same way you do.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.350
So David Roberts works
from the words in the book.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.780
And I never put details, I
never say can you do this?

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.290
Can you make Ada's dress
red and white polka-dotted?

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.630
Can you make Rosie have bangs?

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.240
I never do any of those things.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.380
But David creates all those things.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.130
The only time I've ever suggested
anything for the books is I asked

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.540
if the Sphinx could
be in the background.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.840
And David did that.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.290
And it showed that we had,
that they were neighbors.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.780
I think we have time for
maybe one more question.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.770
Yes. Hi.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:28:00.170
&gt;&gt; Do you think the backgrounds

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:05.210
and the secret stuff
is really cool to have?

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.510
&gt;&gt; Andrea Beaty: Do I?

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.810
Yes, I do.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.110
I do. I think it's so cool.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.410
And I'll tell you why
I think it's cool.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.420
I think it's cool because it's fun.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.380
Because I know that
when I was your age,

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.860
I loved to read books like that.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.800
Like Go Dog Go is my favorite book.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.500
And I have spent I'm sure
actual months of my life looking

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.440
at the picture of the
picnic at the end

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.750
of that book saying,
ooh, what would I do.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.230
Would I go on the swing,
or maybe I'd have the cake

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.800
or be shot out of the cannon?

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.750
And I know how much
that was important to me

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.420
to be pulled into the books.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.940
But also because I think,
and I think this is one

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.280
of the reasons the books
connect with kids so much is

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.210
that I think David showed the
ultimate sign of respect to kids,

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.770
because he knows you guys
can find secret things.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.350
That you're smart and cool
and you pay attention in a way

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:54.120
that adults never even
see these kind of details.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.420
So I think that's why.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.780
And I love that he did that.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.140
I think that I have to go, ah.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.440
But I love your questions.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.390
Thank you all so much.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.690
Thank you.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.860
And I'll be signing at
2:30 at where they do that.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.590
Thank you, and have
a great festival.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.500
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
