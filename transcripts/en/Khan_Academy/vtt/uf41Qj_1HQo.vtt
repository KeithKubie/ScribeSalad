00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.820
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.810
Today we're learning more
about the Seventh Amendment

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.550
to the U.S. Constitution.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.980
The Seventh Amendment
guarantees the right to juries

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.790
in civil cases,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.250
when the value in controversy
is greater than $20.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040
To learn more about the Seventh Amendment,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.440
I talked with two experts.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.090
Renee Lerner is the
Donald Philip Rothschild

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.040
Research Professor of Law

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.980
at George Washington
University Law School.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.830
She specializes in U.S.
and English legal history,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.050
and she's written
extensively about the history

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.170
of American juries.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.290
Suja Thomas is the Peer and
Sarah Pederson Professor of Law

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.490
at the Illinois College of Law.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.990
Her research interests
include jury provisions

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.330
in The Bill of Rights,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.765
civil procedure, and employment law.

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:52.980
Professor Thomas, can
you tell us a little bit

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.691
about why the Framers were
so interested in protecting

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.187
this right in particular?

00:00:58.187 --> 00:01:00.430
- [Professor Thomas]
Historically there were juries

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.430
in England, and a lot of
our Constitution is based on

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.430
what occurred in England,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.120
because of course that
was our historical origin,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.240
and so colonists were
really familiar with juries.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.710
They knew that the jury
restrained government

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.395
and preserved liberty,

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:24.253
and they also knew what
could happen without juries.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.650
Because of this history,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.080
juries were really important to Americans

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.683
and they put it in the
Declaration of Independence.

00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:37.890
- [Professor Lerner] And
the Framers in general

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.830
were very enthusiastic about juries.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.070
One of the reasons was that
juries had been important

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.620
in helping to nullify British laws

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.120
that the American colonists didn't like.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.680
An example of these laws
is the customs taxes.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.500
These were taxes on shipping
and were very unpopular,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.520
especially in New England.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.230
What would happen is merchants,
the Boston merchants,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.290
were supposed to pay a customs tax

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.840
on merchandise that they
imported into Boston

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.130
and also, in certain cases, exported.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.260
What would happen is
these Boston merchants

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.973
would try to import goods
and not pay the tax.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.900
Sometimes they would get
caught by customs inspectors.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.720
If a customs inspector
caught one of these merchants

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.550
trying to smuggle in goods,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.550
the customs collector would
seize the ship and the cargo

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.840
and hold it essentially for ransom.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.350
The customs inspector
would then bring an action,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.350
a lawsuit, against the ship and the cargo

00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:52.830
in a court called the Court of Admiralty,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.520
which was a type of court
that sat without a jury.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.090
The judge in the Court of Admiralty would

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.090
ordinarily require the
merchant to pay a large fine

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:10.370
in order to get back
his ship and his cargo.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.050
What the Boston merchants started to do,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.300
they were deeply unhappy
about these fines,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.300
they would bring an action in
a court that sat with a jury.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.290
It was an action for trespass
against the customs inspector.

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:28.580
- [Professor Thomas] They
knew that juries could be

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.580
really useful because, for
example, there was concerns about

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.370
protecting litigants from bad laws,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.580
also concerns about
actions by the executive,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.140
and they were also concerned about

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.430
corrupt and biased judges,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.110
so for all of these reasons
there was a real value

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.790
put on civil juries.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.410
- [Kim] Just for our general information,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.890
how exactly is a civil trial different

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.563
from a criminal trial?

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:00.000
- [Professor Thomas] In a civil trial,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.980
someone is suing and wants damages

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.122
for something that went wrong.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.720
So if, for example, you're
in an employment situation

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.020
and you allege your employer
discriminated against you,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020
you can bring a civil case
and you can try to get damages

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.670
or money for the wrong that
was committed against you.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.930
In that type of case,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.390
people who are trying to prove the case

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.340
have to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.610
that this is what happened to you,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.160
that discrimination occurred.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.610
Then in the criminal
context, on the other hand,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.660
someone is accused of doing a crime

00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:44.560
and sometimes there's a
grand jury that decides

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.420
whether that case should
proceed against you,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.170
and then a criminal jury
decides whether or not

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.860
you committed that crime
and they have to decide by

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.280
beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.810
So the standard is different.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.050
For criminal cases it's
beyond a reasonable doubt

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.740
versus in a civil case by a
preponderance of the evidence.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.610
So it's a higher standard
to prove someone is guilty

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.580
of a crime than in a civil
case to actually win.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.640
You see this in the O.J. Simpson case,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.640
where he's not convicted
but they actually sued him

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.460
in a civil case and they actually won,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.100
and there were different standards.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.880
- [Kim] You kind of see throughout

00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:25.410
the fourth through eight amendments,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.163
which deal with the
protection of the accused,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.062
quite an emphasis on juries.

00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:37.548
Why were the Framers so keen on juries?

00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:40.930
- [Professor Lerner] In the
Revolutionary Era in particular,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.470
when tensions between
the American colonies

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.840
and Britain were very high,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.630
juries were one way
that Americans could get

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.880
popular representation in government.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.440
They were not allowed to elect

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.183
members of the British Parliament.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.210
They did elect members of
the colonial legislatures,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.040
but increasingly the British
government was taking power

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.113
from the colonial legislatures.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.210
So, this was a way that
without an elected legislature

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.820
the colonists could get representation.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.850
John Adams wrote a very
interesting passage

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.480
in his diary in 1771.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.590
He wrote that juries were like

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.440
popularly elected legislatures.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.633
That they served that function
in the American colonies.

00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:41.810
- [Professor Thomas] There
were some concerns about

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.450
protection for debtors,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.920
that was a big issue at the time,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.920
and there were arguments that
juries could really protect

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.910
litigants from bad laws
that the legislature passed,

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.270
from actions by the executive,

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.033
and from potentially
corrupt and biased judges.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.200
It wasn't the case that
the Framers believed

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.500
that the jury was actually perfect,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.150
but they thought that the jury
was the best decision maker.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.510
- [Kim] It seems that
the Seventh Amendment

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.350
has a very specific origin

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.770
in the history of the Revolutionary War

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.860
and in some things that were
very dear to the founders.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.160
What are some of the ways
that it has grown and changed

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.153
in the years since then?

00:07:31.153 --> 00:07:35.520
- [Professor Lerner] There is,
as you see in the amendment,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.350
a $20 amount and controversy requirement

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.363
is what we call it,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.580
and that remains in force today

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.470
even though there has been
considerable inflation,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.070
but still we've stuck with the $20 limit.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.750
The difficulty is today
that very, very few cases

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.750
go to juries, and that is
true of the federal courts

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.197
and also the state courts.

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:06.028
- [Professor Thomas] Yeah,
that's one of the astounding

00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:07.470
things that many people don't know about.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.210
That less than 1% of civil cases,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.540
and we have the federal courts
as well as the state courts,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.660
but in both of those venues,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.770
federal courts and state courts,

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.770
less than 1% of civil
cases are tried by juries.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.930
- [Kim] Wow, so what happened there?

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.810
How did we get from a point
where the majority of the cases

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.482
went before a jury to less than 1%?

00:08:30.482 --> 00:08:32.040
- [Professor Lerner] One
thing that's affected

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.240
how many cases go to a jury

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.600
is that judges now have more power

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.430
to resolve disputes at an early stage.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.150
Parties can file a motion
to dismiss the case,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.150
if they argue that the other
side did not have a claim

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.900
that would hold up under law.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.937
Judges can dismiss a case if
they find that that's correct.

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.010
- [Professor Thomas] Around
the 1930 period of time,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.450
you actually see a number of decisions

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.500
against jury authority

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.390
where the Supreme Court actually had ruled

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.941
in favor of jury authority
on the exact same issue.

00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:11.700
So, something's going
on in this time frame,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.728
around the 1930 period of time.

00:09:13.728 --> 00:09:16.950
It's not exactly easy to
figure out what that is,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.980
but some of the things that I've seen

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.140
in some of the public
documents that are out there,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.520
you actually see comments

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.030
including by a former
Supreme Court Justice

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.943
saying that judges are
actually better than juries.

00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:35.317
A New York State judge
stated around this time,

00:09:35.317 --> 00:09:38.339
"Yes, a judge should be
preferred to a jury."

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:42.720
That's certainly part of
what's going on in the story,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.150
and then part of what
was going on in the story

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.250
may be to do with the
juries getting more diverse

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.520
around this period of time,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.520
and maybe there's an
effort by other certain

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.910
parts of society to
not want diverse juries

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.870
to decide their cases.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.940
These are just a couple of different ideas

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.940
that I think are contributors

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.583
to why juries decide few cases today.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.250
- [Kim] Interesting,
and so by this diversity

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.900
do you mean like diversity of
people from different classes

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.000
or different genders or different races?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.987
What kind of diversity is
entering in that time period?

00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:21.793
- [Professor Thomas] Particularly
we're talking about ...

00:10:21.793 --> 00:10:25.610
We'd be talking about
sex and race, yeah, yeah,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.410
but I think class is definitely
part of that today as well.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.650
Then another example that
is something that I've spent

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.230
a good amount of time in
my career talking about

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.780
is something called summary judgment.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.040
Summary judgment is a procedure

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.500
where a judge can decide what
a reasonable jury could find,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.020
and if the judge decides a reasonable jury

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.160
could not find for the
person who brought the case,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.870
the judge can dismiss the case.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.110
If someone brings a case for
employment discrimination

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:00.290
and there's discovery and that
is documents being exchanged

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.660
between the parties and depositions
or questions being asked

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.180
between different witnesses,

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.180
and so then an employer can
say, "Okay, you accused us

00:11:10.187 --> 00:11:11.437
"of employment discrimination,

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:13.577
"but we think you don't
have enough evidence,

00:11:13.577 --> 00:11:16.967
"and Judge, we think
that no reasonable jury

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.267
"could find for this employee.

00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:21.037
"You should order summary judgment for us

00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:23.500
"and throw this case out of court."

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.750
What has actually happened
is in over 70% of the cases

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.500
where a employer makes a
motion for summary judgment

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.820
in an employment discrimination case,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.820
that case will be dismissed
in whole or in part.

00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:44.197
- [Professor Lerner] So,
judges can in certain cases

00:11:44.197 --> 00:11:46.760
end the case before it gets to a jury,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.720
but by far the most common
way that a dispute ends

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.280
is by settlement between the parties.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.560
What has encouraged settlement

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.110
is that it's much more
expensive to bring a case

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.470
and go to jury verdict today

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.280
than it was back at the
time of the founding.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.950
One of the reasons it's
so much more expensive

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.950
is that we now have a system
of what we call discovery.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.610
That is the parties can ask
for information from each other

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.380
before the trial.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.280
They can formally question witnesses,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.320
they can ask for documents,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.090
they can require questions to be answered.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.700
All of that goes on before the trial,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.320
and that's expensive to do
and they want to save money.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.990
They want to save money that's involved in

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.750
this pretrial discovery,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.640
and they want to save money at the trial,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.990
and so they go ahead and they settle.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.180
The reason it's so important
for the parties to save money

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:54.130
is that in our system each
side in a dispute, in a case,

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.680
has to pay its own legal
fees, even if they win,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.455
and so the parties have an
incentive to settle the case.

00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:06.930
That way they save expenses

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.880
and also they get a predictable result.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.020
Many parties are afraid
of going before a jury

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.800
because they don't know
what the result will be.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.990
For all these reasons, settlement
has become very important.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.683
Much more so than it was at
the time of the founding.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.730
- [Kim] So, we've learned
that the Seventh Amendment's

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.470
protections for jury trials in civil cases

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.690
derives from the context
of the Revolutionary War,

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.260
when colonists felt that juries
were perhaps the only way

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
they could have a voice in the law.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.630
Despite this protection,
fewer than 1% of civil cases

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.000
go to trial today,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.380
since trials have become
prohibitively expensive

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.590
and their outcomes are unpredictable.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.800
