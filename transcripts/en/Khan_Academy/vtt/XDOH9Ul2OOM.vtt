00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.990
So we're told that ray OL
is perpendicular to ray ON.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.640
So OL is perpendicular to ON.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.020
So we know that this right
over here is a right angle,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.600
or it's a 90-degree angle.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.190
Then they tell us that
the measure of angle LOM

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.060
is equal to 2x plus 46.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.360
So LOM-- so this angle
right over here--

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.937
is equal to 2x plus 46.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.000
Then they tell us that
the measure of angle MON

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.480
is equal to 3x minus 6.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.440
So this angle right
over here is 3x minus 6.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.730
And so they ask
us find angle MON.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.339
So we need to find this
angle right over here.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.380
And we'd be able to find
it if we knew what x is.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.505
If we knew what x is, then
it's going to be 3 times

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.720
that minus 6.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.330
Now, the one thing
that we know is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.020
that if we add up
these two angles,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.710
these are adjacent angles.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.880
And their outside rays
form a right angle.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.130
So these two angles are going
to add up to 90 degrees.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.820
And I guess we can assume here
that we're dealing in degrees.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.990
So let's say that 2x
plus 46 plus 3x minus 6

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.410
is going to add
up to 90 degrees.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.610
These two angles
are complementary.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.830
So it's going to add
up to 90 degrees,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.164
or it's going to add up to 90.

00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:24.580
And now, we just
have to simplify.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.460
We have 2 x's.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.690
We have another 3 x's.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.720
So you add those two, and
you're going to get 5 x's.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.419
And then you have 46.

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:33.710
And you're going to subtract 6.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.700
So it's going to be
plus 40 is equal to 90.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.550
Subtract 40 from both sides.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.450
So let's do that.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.060
Subtract 40 from both sides.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
And on the left-hand side,
you're just left with a 5x.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.220
And on the right-hand side,
you're left with a 50.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.950
Now, just divide
both sides by 5.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.630
And we are left with
x is equal to 10.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.240
Now, our answer is not 10.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.280
We've just figured
out what x is.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.470
What they ask us for is what's
the measure of angle MON?

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.770
Well, we already know that
the measure of angle MON

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:23.300
is equal to 3x minus 6, which
is equal to 3 times 10 minus 6--

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.430
I want to do that minus 6
in that green color-- which

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.550
is equal to 24 degrees.
