00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:12.619
An estimated 20 million cases of blindness
worldwide are caused by cataracts,

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:19.215
a curable condition affecting the lens
that focuses images onto the eye's retina.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:23.678
A cataract occurs when proteins 
in the lens lose their normal arrangement,

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:27.983
clumping together in a way that causes
discoloration or clouding,

00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:30.458
and eventually blocks most vision.

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:32.637
Cataracts can be caused by eye injury,

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:34.085
certain medications,

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:35.720
ultraviolet radiation,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.944
diabetes,

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:38.004
smoking,

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.033
or some genetic disorders.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.668
But the most common cause is aging.

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:47.707
In the United States, more than 50%
of people over the age of 80 develop them.

00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:52.617
Cataracts were treated 
over 2,500 years ago in India,

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:55.899
though similar procedures 
may have existed even earlier

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.539
in Ancient Egypt and Babylon.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.717
The most common procedure,
called couching,

00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:03.893
involved pressing 
a sharp instrument into the eye

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:08.137
to loosen and push 
the clouded lens out of the way.

00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:11.439
Although this could increase 
the amount of light entering the eye,

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.584
the lack of a lens would leave 
the patient's vision out of focus.

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:19.825
Despite its low success rate,
and high risk of infection or injury,

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:23.266
couching is still performed 
in some parts of the world.

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:27.380
Later procedures would also focus
on removing the cloudy lens,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.066
for example, by making an opening
in the cornea to pull out the lens

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.383
along with the membrane capsule 
surrounding it.

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:39.590
While the invention of eyeglasses
allowed for some restoration of focus,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.802
they had to be extremely thick to help.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:46.179
Furthermore, such techniques
still caused complications,

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:47.810
like damaging the retina,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.050
or leaving the eye 
with uncomfortable stitches.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.332
But in the 20th century, 
something unexpected happened.

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:59.273
Eye surgeon Sir Harold Ridley was treating
World War II casualties

00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:03.847
when he noticed that acrylic plastic from
a shattered aircraft cockpit

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:09.272
had become lodged in a pilot's eyes
without triggering an adverse reaction.

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:15.277
This led him to propose surgically
implanting artificial lenses into the eye

00:02:15.277 --> 00:02:17.392
to replace cataracts.

00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:19.134
And despite initial resistance,

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:22.865
the method became standard practice
by the 1980s.

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:24.788
Since Ridley's discovery,

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:28.869
the intraocular lens 
has undergone several improvements.

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.249
Modern lenses can fit 
into the membrane capsule

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.462
that the cataract is extracted from,

00:02:34.462 --> 00:02:37.742
leaving more of 
the eye's natural anatomy intact.

00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:40.816
And the ability to fine-tune 
the lens curvature

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:43.938
allows the surgery to restore 
a patient's normal vision

00:02:43.938 --> 00:02:46.245
without the need for glasses.

00:02:46.245 --> 00:02:49.592
Of course, surgical techniques 
have also progressed.

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:53.282
Microscopic procedures use 
small instruments or lasers

00:02:53.282 --> 00:02:58.426
to make precise incisions of one 
or two millimeters in the cornea,

00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:03.047
while an ultrasound probe breaks up
and removes the cataracted lens

00:03:03.047 --> 00:03:05.623
with minimal trauma to the eye.

00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:10.475
Low-tech versions of this operation have
made the surgery quick and inexpensive,

00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:13.973
helping it spread 
across the developing world.

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:16.886
Places like Aravind Eye Hospital in India

00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:20.839
have pioneered high-volume, 
low-cost cataract surgery

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.145
for as little as six dollars.

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:25.754
Why then, with all these advances,

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:29.067
are there still so many 
blind people in the world?

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:31.668
The main issue is access to health care,

00:03:31.668 --> 00:03:34.549
with poor infrastructure 
and a shortage of doctors

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.673
being a major barrier in many regions.

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:39.823
But this is not the only problem.

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:42.456
In many rural areas with poor education,

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:46.955
blindness is often accepted 
as an inevitable part of aging,

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:49.907
for which someone 
might not think to seek treatment.

00:03:49.907 --> 00:03:52.192
This is why information is crucial.

00:03:52.192 --> 00:03:56.721
Increased community awareness programs
and the spread of mobile phones

00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:58.261
mean that many of those

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:01.854
who might have remained blind for
the rest of their lives due to cataracts

00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:03.562
are now reachable.

00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:06.290
And for them, 
a brighter future is in sight.
