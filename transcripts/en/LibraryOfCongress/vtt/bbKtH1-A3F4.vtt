00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.320
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Today,
we're pleased to speak

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.910
with Senator Barbara Mikulski of
Maryland, the longest-serving woman

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.130
in congressional history.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.960
When Senator Mikulski
retires in January of 2017,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.570
he will have served 40 years
in the United States Congress.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.160
Senator Mikulski, on behalf
of the Library of Congress,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.060
we are privileged to
speak with you today

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.750
about your distinguished career.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.870
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski:
Well, I'm excited about being here

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.880
and sharing some views and insights
about what it's like to serve.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.820
For me, it was 10 years in the
House, 30 years in the Senate,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.140
but it's not how long you
serve, it's how well you serve.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.370
You know, for every one of
those elections, Maryland,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.580
or the third congressional
district, gave me their vote

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.530
and gave me a vote of confidence.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.040
So it's about working here, being
here, with no issue to small

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.080
to take up, and no guy or
organization too big to take on.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.380
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: That's perfect!

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.780
So we'll start in the beginning.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.140
Talk to us a little bit about
your neighborhood growing

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.210
up in East Baltimore, what was
that like and what did you learn

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.610
about public service
from growing up there?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski:
Well, I grew up in Baltimore.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.170
And during those days, it
was a blue collar town.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.470
Would have been part

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.500
of what Roosevelt would have
called the arsenal of democracy.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
In and around our community
was a steel mill.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.860
We built ships.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.150
In fact, even during World War II,
we built the famous Liberty ships

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.610
that sailed the North Atlantic,
taking cargo to our boys fighting

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.350
with the greatest - the
greatest generation.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.590
But it was a community that was
really like an urban village.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.980 position:56%
Different ethnic groups lived in
different communities, Little Italy,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.730
Polish Hill, and people lived,
worked, and worshipped there.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.270
Strong sense of community,
a lot of social capital,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.890
neighbor helping neighbor.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.520
My father had a small
neighborhood grocery store.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.200
He and my mother worked in it, and
every morning, my father would get

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.180
up very early and go over, we lived
across the street from the store,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.200
open up the doors of his store and
say, good morning, can I help you?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.010
Now, I was raised with
that ethnic, that it was,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.960
good morning, can I help you?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.330
To not only do business,
but do business in a way

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.400
that helped the community
and served the community.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.340
I also had the opportunity to go
to Catholic schools, and there,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.240
the great nuns that taught
me, not only the three R's,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.520
but they taught me a fourth R
called, respect for your neighbor,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.050
help your neighbor, and, in my
faith, it was the be attitudes.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.240
Heal -- do what you could to
heal the sick, help the poor,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.330
feed the hungry, and so I
grew up with this whole ethic,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.280
that we are our brother and
sister's keeper, whether --

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.790 position:56%
whatever you do in the neighborhood,
whatever you do in business.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.310
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: You went
on to earn an undergraduate

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.980
and graduate degree, and then
go on to work as a social worker

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.390
for Catholic charities, and
also for the City of Baltimore.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.010
So, tell us about how you
got involved in politics.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.720
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski: Well,
I've always wanted to help people.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.940
Again, I was in that environment,
and has this great opportunity

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.240
to really be able to put
that value into action.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.570
At Catholic charities, I
was a foster care worker,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.710
and at the Department
of Social Services,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.850
I was a child neglect worker.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.160
In other words, protecting
children from child abuse.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.530
I learned a lot, because I
grew up in a wonderful home

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.270
and a wonderful neighborhood.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.720 position:56%
And what I wanted to do was be able
to help people, not only one-by-one,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.970
but to be able to help communities.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.430
I felt that the road to politics
would be social work with power.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.990
I didn't think I would
go into politics.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.880 position:56%
When I was growing up, politics was
political machine, pot-bellied guys,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.240
smoke-filled rooms, they were
named Tom, Dick, and Harry,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.460
they weren't named, you know, Barb,
Olympia [laughter], you know, Sue.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.720
So - but the powers that
be downtown were going

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.130
to be a put a 16-lane highway

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.880
through the older European
ethnic neighborhoods,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.460
and also through the first black
homeownership neighborhood.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.600
Well, I went into -- I got into
a fight to save the neighborhood,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.020
to save homes, people were
being pushed around as well

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.760
as their home being bulldozed.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.000
They weren't getting
replacement value for their home,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.510
they weren't getting
relocation benefits,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.180
so I was part of a hell no,
we don't have to go committee.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.350
And organizing that effort, I
knocked on the doors of City Hall

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.770
and was rebuffed, and I
decided that, what the heck,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.260
I would run for Baltimore
City Council, and open doors

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.300
so that the people could
get in, that if I got in,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.330
I wanted to bring the
people with me.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.150
Well, that's how I got into it.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.090
It was a long time ago, almost
40 years ago, over 40 years ago,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.910
and it has been so wonderful to be
able to have the opportunity to,

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.620
every day, think about how
you can help your community,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.120
and how you can help your country.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.580
What greater job than that?

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.880
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.420
In 1974, you ran a really tough
campaign for Senate, and you lost,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.400
and it was the only
race that you ever lost.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.570
Can you tell us about
that experience

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.090
and what did you learn from it?

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.110
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski:
Well, in 1974, the --

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.010
there was a hotly-contested
republican race.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.580
Senator Mathias was the incumbent,
a wonderful man, and he was known

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.440
for his staunch defense of
America's standing in the world,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.310
he was a strong civil
rights advocate,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.330
and we thought his
own party was going

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.100
to run somebody pretty
ugly and nasty against him.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.020
And there would be no
democrat standing in.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.700
And because he was so
beloved, nobody got into it.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.250
I tried to recruit people, then -
then ended up getting in it myself.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.090 position:56%
I knew it was not [inaudible] fight,
but people called it an edifying

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.170
and inspirational campaign, the
way Senator Mathias and I talked

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.570
about the issues, and in our heart
of heart, we so liked each other,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.830
politics was so different then.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.570
It wasn't adversarial, it wasn't
pugilistic, these were people

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.950
who were debating ideas and
where we could come together,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.510
like on arms control,
protecting the Chesapeake Bay,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.410
standing up for civil rights,
we did, and where we disagree,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.860
which was often more on the
economics of our country,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.990
we did it with civility, and we
did it with a lot of content.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.080
Sounds different in
today, doesn't it?

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.220
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: And you
won your House race in 1976,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.600
and you won a Senate race in 1986,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.620
and you came to the
United States Senate.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.340
When you came to the Senate and
sworn in, 1987, you were only one

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.540
of two women, along with
Republican Nancy Kassebaum,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.060
to serve in the Senate.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.470
What was that like
coming into an institution

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.580
with just one other
woman serving in it?

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.160
And how did you approach
that situation?

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.460
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara
Mikulski: Well, it was tough.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.950
I was the first democratic
woman elected in her own right.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.160
Other democratic women had served,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.200
but they had succeeded
their husband,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.250
like [inaudible] Humphrey
was an example of that.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.420
But I said, though I was all
by myself, I was never alone.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.480
I had wonderful men
that championed me.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.440
One of which was my own senior
Senator then, Paul Sarbanes,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.810
who helped me get on the right
committees, who also showed me,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.900
not only the formal channels of
power, but the informal channels

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.940 position:56%
within the United States Senate, and
when I think of Senator Sarbanes,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.700
I always think of the saying,
we, in the women's movement,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.170
say that men of quality always
support women who seek equality.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.850
And he helped me get started,
and I learned a lot from many

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.010
of the men here that helped.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.580
But it was a different time.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.000
It was before the digital
age, so before computers.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.920
My constituent mail came from
snail mail, we had rotary phones,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.790
etc. I had to break the ice, and
the way I did it, which is the way

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:38.490
so many other women did, I worked
twice as hard, I put in twice

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.240
as much effort on the
committee assignments,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.640
I did every committee
assignment, whether it was a chore,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.860
whether it was a presiding late
night over the Senate, I did it.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.630
So, I earned respect, and
I became one of the gang,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.180
but I never tried to
be one of the boys.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.740
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Now there's
20 women in the Senate, and,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.090
as the dean of women in the Senate,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:05.210
you welcomed newly-elected female
senators, what do you say to them,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.390
and what type of helpful
advice do you give them

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.730
as they enter the United
States Senate?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.030
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski: Well,

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.960
I think about how helpful
Senator Sarbanes

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.650
and Senator Nancy Kassebaum
was to me.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.760
So I kept some notes and
kind of, you don't want to --

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.360
when you become a senator, you
don't get an operation manual,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.370
your people always say, I'll
help you in any way I can!

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.980
But they offer - offer
nothing practical.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.420
So I put together some materials

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.750
on how do you get started
in the Senate?

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.220
What should be your state office?

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.890
What should be in the Senate?

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.150
How do you get on the
right committee?

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.820
What are the staff that you need?

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.220
How do you establish a
reputation for yourself?

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:51.320
And how do you keep your
campaign promises and serve -

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.600
serve in a capacity where
we come to represent states?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.610
Remember, for the women,
yes, we stand up for gender,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.150
like our Women's Health
Initiative, but at the same time,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.530
we know it's not only about
gender, it's about agenda

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.540
and we're elected for the state.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:15.520
So, I speak and organize at every
first few days of the new term,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.040
a woman's power workshop.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.710
The first time I did it, the
press said, are you having a tea?

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.170
And I said, no, but I'm going
to make sure the women are never

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.830
in hot water, and we're going to
know how to boil some things up.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.290
So that became the power workshops
and I did it for both sides

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.330
of the aisle, not only
democratic women.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.640
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: You've seen
the Senate over the past 30 years,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.390
how has the institution changed?

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.110
And how have relationships
changed between senators?

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.410
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara
Mikulski: Well, first of all,

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.220
the world of technology
has changed the Senate.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.370
But number one, we're on TV.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.970
My predecessor, Senator
Mathias, cautioned about that

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.160
so many years ago, would we become
essentially a showbiz senate

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.790
or a real-biz senate?

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.250
But I believe in everything
being televised.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.860
Whether it's the Senate proceedings
or whether it's the committee,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.690
so people say that
our democracy is open.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.090
That's a good thing.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:20.750
The second thing is that we have
moved more to a digital world.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.770
That means it enables my
constituents to see me or talk

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.720
with me, like just look at what
we can do through, you know,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.830
appearing on TV, and where we
can speak to each other even

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.350
on teleconference calls, like
in remote areas of the state.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.160
So technology has facilitated
communication with constituents.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.650
What has changed, though,
is that I feel

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:50.670
that partisanship has become
more hyper and more prickly.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.890
I don't think that's a good thing.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.010
You know, we're here
to represent states.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.570
We're not here to represent
political parties.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.310
We declare our party, because
each party has a platform,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.840
and a philosophy, but at the end of
the day, people want us to be able

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.900
to come together for the common
good and the good of the country.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.200
We've tried to do that
among the women.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:20.200
You know, early on, when more
women came in the senate, 1992,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.670
after the Anita Hill debacle,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.480
when we got our so-called
year of the woman.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.780
I didn't go for that.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.570
It sounded like, oh,
we get one year.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.020
You know, like the year of the
caribou, the year of the mushroom,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.270
it'll be the year of the
woman, so, but more women came

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.620
on both sides of the aisle.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.820
One of whom was Senator
Kay Bailey Hutchison.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.530
She has an idea on helping the
economic empowerment of women,

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.880
where women could contribute
more to the IRA's

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.270
if they were working
at home, or homemakers.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.280
Her staff discouraged her from
working with me, oh, a liberal,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.320
a democrat, my staff wasn't too
excited about it, oh, you know,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.360
a conservative republican from
Texas, but, you know what,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.560
we did want to help
women save for old age!

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.770
And we got together and had dinner

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.340
to discuss possibilities
and strategy.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.160
We had such a good time.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.020
We developed a strategy,
we had some laughs,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.630
we got to know each other
better, and we said,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.390
we're having such a good
time, should we invite -

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.940 position:56%
why don't we invite the other women?

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.910
Which we did, and that became

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.690 position:56%
that famous having dinner once a
month among the women of the Senate,

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.560
and there we had a rule of
no staff, no [inaudible].

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.080
But also that we would work
to be a zone of civility.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.650
That whatever was going on,
that we would try to do it

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.860
with civility among ourselves,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.580
that our debates would
have intellectual rigor,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.890
they would not be dangerous
or hyper-rhetorical.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.600
And when the day was over,
the day would be over.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.650
And I think that has worked,

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.890
and I think it has certainly
helped move the Senate forward.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.820
When women had became
committee chairman,

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.330
I don't know if you noticed,
but we actually passed bills.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.790
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Well, you have a
reputation as a senator for wanting

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.850
to get things done in that way.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.490
You also have a reputation
for adhering to certain values

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.980
or principles throughout
your career.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.430
So how did you balance
that as a senator,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.540
being both principled
and also pragmatic?

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski: Well,
I believe that you can - number one,

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.700
when you work on an
issue, the question is,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.060
how do you get things done,
and what are the must things

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.420
that you must have, etc?

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.990
And I believe, though, that
along the way, just in life,

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.230
you have to also compromise.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:46.510
But you can compromise on
an item, you don't have

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.900
to compromise your principles.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.900
An example, when I was
working on legislation,

00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.510 position:56%
I wanted to have a tax deduction for
people who were full-time caregivers

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.980
in their home, to be able
to help those families out.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.600
When I went to a republican, a
republican male, he said, Senator,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.750
that's a great idea,
but I can't sponsor it.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.200
It'd cost too much money.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.220
Would you, modestly,
shrink, you know, reduce it?

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.460
Well, I said, not to the point
where it would be ridiculous,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.870
but I would be willing
to compromise.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.850
That - that moved along.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:32.280 position:56%
The other was I was working on other
legislation, related to legislation

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.190
to help children who have
Down syndrome and other -

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.300
other intellectual handicaps.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.110
This came from a family
with a daughter

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.660
with Down syndrome,
her name was Rosa.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.910 position:56%
And I said I would change the law as
long as we don't alter the benefits.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:55.270
But I teamed up with a republican,
Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:59.280 position:56%
we looked at the bill, and we wanted
to know, how could it be achievable,

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.400
how could it be affordable, and
make sure we didn't hurt benefits?

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.950
Senator Enzi is a
professionally-trained accountant.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.330
I'm a professionally-trained
social worker.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.230
We put our heads together,
we have passed Rosa's Law,

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:18.590 position:56%
the languages now refer to these
children as intellectually disabled,

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.500
it was signed at the
White House, and by us,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:27.280
being best at what we needed
each other for, his keen eye,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.460
to make sure there was no -
no possibilities it would use,

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.720
that we would not negatively
impact benefits.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.360
I looked at the achievability,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.380
and then we brought republicans
and democrats together.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.210
Isn't that the way
it's supposed to work?

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.410
The best idea came from the people,
we made sure it was a good idea,

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.060
and it did no harm, and then
we didn't want to do any harm

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.300
to the children, and we didn't
do any harm to our budget.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.600
We did it.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.900
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: A
lot of this [inaudible],

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.900
you've been a consistent fighter
for older Americans, for children,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.180
for women, for veterans,
what are some

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.600
of the accomplishments
throughout your career that you'd

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.890
like to highlight in that
regard, and what work still needs

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.040
to be done amongst
those populations?

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.140
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski:
Well, when I came to the Senate,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.410
I wanted to also concentrate
on women's health agenda.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:27.240 position:56%
I was very concerned, because I had
learned about it also in the health,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:33.390 position:56%
that women were being systematically
excluded from the protocols at NIH.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:41.400
They said our childbearing life
cycles would tilt the research.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.470
Well, what was that?

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.750
[Laughing] Was that sound science?

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.050
Was it modern science?

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.320
Or old-fashioned stereotypes?

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.960
And I teamed up, again, bipartisan,
republican, Senator Olympia Snowe,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.460
republican Connie [inaudible],
a sister democrat,

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.950
Congresswoman Pat Schroeder,
and you know what?

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.450
We went to NIH, we pushed for
reform, women are now included

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.560
in the protocols, we worked within
the first woman head of NIH,

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.700
we were able to get the first --

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.590
money for the first
longitudinal study

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.070
on hormone replacement therapy,

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.680
it changed medical
practice and, guess what?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.020
It has lowered breast cancer rates
in our country by 15 percent.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.400
You know, when you work
together and you pound the table,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.960
you then get some results.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.260
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Things done.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.890
You've certainly seen tremendous
transformation, both concerning,

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:40.420
you know, gender equity and other
treatments throughout your career.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.020
Arguably, we may see the
biggest change, in November,

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.720
if Hillary Clinton is elected
President of the United States.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.910
Why do you think it's
important for a woman

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.660
to be elected to the presidency?

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.630
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski:
Well, I don't think it's -

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.580
it's not only a woman, it's
- it's not just any woman,

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.600
I happen to think that Secretary
Clinton is exceptionally qualified.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.290
She has served the nation for
more than 40 years of her life.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.970
But, for us, it is both
about gender and breaking

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.480
that biggest glass
ceiling in America,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.530
but it's also about an agenda.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:20.070
And I know that Hillary will
work on the big macro issues

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:25.470
of national security, economic
growth, create more opportunity

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.460
for many people, but she'll
also work on the macaroni

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.640
and cheese issues, where
she's going to look at,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.270
how does this affect families?

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.880
This is why she's been a
champion of paycheck equity.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.560
Women getting equal
pay for equal work.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.260
She championed it in the Senate
when she became Secretary of State.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.990
I picked that fight up.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.750
It's an issue of not only
economic justice, fairness,

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:53.340
equal pay for equal work, but
it's also an economic stimulus.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:58.440
You pay women what you pay the
guys, and enforce the law that's

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.890
on the books and make
up not reasons,

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.770
you're going to put more
money in the family pocketbook

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.150
and it'll go more into the economy.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.930
So those are the kinds of issues,
I know we're also talking about how

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.550
to make college more affordable,
higher education more in the reach,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:21.200
we need to be able to grow the
middle class, and you grow it

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.820
by the way you advocate
for education.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.700
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: You've also
been an accomplished writer

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.280
in your career, and upon your
retirement, I would like to know,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.110
are you going to continue writing,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.830
and what are your plans
post-Congress?

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.370
&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara Mikulski: Well,
first of all, service is in my DNA.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.610
The way we began this interview,
you know, I've come to Capitol Hill

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:51.550
for 40 years, and when I ride
down - and I'll get choked

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.840
up as the time is drawing near
when I'll no longer have the job,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.030
but I'll have the values
that brought me to the job.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.350
I go up to the Capitol,
and everyday I see that

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.690
and think what my father say,
good morning, can I help you?

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.300
And that's what I want, I want
to contineu to be of service,

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.910
I would like to be in
whatever world of teaching

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.150
or non-profit world to do that.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:19.020 position:56%
So, I'll be thinking and looking at
how I can continue to be - to serve,

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.030
for as long as God gives me
the wits to be able to do that.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:28.980
What I'd also like to be able
to do is encourage young people

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:34.080
to either run for political
office, or to be civically engaged.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.130
We need a society where more and
more people need to be engaged,

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.690 position:56%
and when I am out on college
campuses or talking to young people,

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.340
they have so much energy.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.160
They have ideas and
they have idealism.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.460
We've got to put that
to work for the country,

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.250
for whatever cause they
believe in, and in that way,

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.150
I think we keep democracy alive,

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:04.600
and we also enhance our
standing in the world.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.900 position:56%

&gt;&gt; Senator Barbara
Mikulski: Well, thank you!

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.930
You know, I believe in
this, each and every one

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.480
of us can make a difference,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.840
but when we work together,
we can make change.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.760
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Thank you!

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.640
