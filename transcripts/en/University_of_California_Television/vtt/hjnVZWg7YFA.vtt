Investigation about Alzheimer's
disease in the Latino Community

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:16.410
- [Alex] Welcome to the first episode in
Spanish of the Brain Channel.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.780
My name is Alex Figueroa, and we will be
talking about the Alzheimer's disease

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.006
and Dementia, specifically
dementia amongst Latinos.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.834
With us today is Dr. Soria-Lopez.

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:33.152
Dr. Soria-Lopez is
an associated neurologist,

00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:37.040
member of the memory team and an
investigator here at UC San Diego.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.100
He is originally from Cuba. Dr.
Lopez studied medicine at the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.013
Johns Hopkins University and ended up
here at UC San Diego.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.090
and if you would like to tell us a little

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.254
So thank you very much
for being with us Dr. Lopez.

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:53.127
Tell us a bit more of how you ended
up here at UC San Diego?

00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:54.315
- [Dr. Lopez] Thank you.

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:58.815
Thank you, Alex, for having me over to
talk about this subject which is

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:09.847
very important. I was always interested in
neurological processes and diseases,

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:17.746
when I was younger, so,
further on, I got more interested

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:23.352
in the medical profession,
seeing patients, seeing people and,

00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:28.681
later on, in med school,
I decided to specialize in Neurology.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:38.917
And, more recently, that led me to get
involved in and learn about the processes

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:45.345
of dementia, especially of Alzheimer's,
and that's what I do right now.

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:54.484
My interests in this disease and this
process, come from my interest in memory,

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:59.863
in cognitive processes,
how can they improve and how they are

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.185
affected by diseases of this type.

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:05.068
- Okay, great, thank you
for being with us.

00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:10.825
So, probably, the most important question
right now is: What is Alzheimer's disease?

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:17.231
- It's a very important question.
Defining the illness.

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:28.209
The illness is a dementia disease which
manifests slowly, step by step.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:38.602
It manifests with cognitive problems,
specially a slow and progressive,

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:43.861
mostly and especially, of the memory.
Other cognitive areas that are also

00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:48.586
affected include language,
spatial orientation, time and

00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:55.597
place orientation. And it is a slow
process, and it's progressive.

00:02:55.597 --> 00:03:00.672
- Okay. And what are some signs
that can let us know when our

00:03:00.672 --> 00:03:03.433
family members are suffering
from that disease?

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:12.955
- The disease presents itself, generally,
further on in life. The more we age

00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:17.740
odds are higher of developing the illness.
One of the things that could be noticed

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:26.737
at first are loss of memory. People might
forget conversations they had.

00:03:26.737 --> 00:03:31.814
They tend to repeat the same
conversation, the same questions

00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:37.585
several times. They lack orientation from
the place they are in, to the time,

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:43.972
the hour, the day of the week. And,
at first, it's very mild.

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:49.183
It's not noticeable at first, but it
progresses. It's progressive.

00:03:49.183 --> 00:03:51.668
- Okay, so, the symptoms
are much more serious

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:54.809
than, let's say, forgetting where
you put your car keys,

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.846
or forgetting an appointment,
simple things like that.

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:02.189
- Exactly, that is correct, Alex.
The symptoms...

00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:08.760
Usually, if a person forgets,
they are distracted during the day

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.413
or night, at home, where they put their
things, where they put their keys,

00:04:12.413 --> 00:04:19.391
but they can analyze and find their keys
later, taking their time, focusing.

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:25.916
That, in itself, is not a degenerative
memory issue or dementia.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:30.610
It's more serious.
it would be a case where the person can't

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.104
keep up with their daily activities.
They can't continue doing their job.

00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:40.794
They lose the ability to do more
instrumental activities,

00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:48.347
like controlling their bank accounts,
driving properly without getting lost.

00:04:48.347 --> 00:04:50.889
Those are the symptoms that may present.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.399
- Okay. And how is that this disease
is affecting the Latin population

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:57.445
compared to other populations?

00:04:57.445 --> 00:04:59.756
- What we have noticed, Alex,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.662
with Dementia,
specifically in Alzheimer's,

00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:11.397
is that when we look at various Latino
populations in the United States,

00:05:11.397 --> 00:05:19.333
even in California and locally,
we find that it is more frequent

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:27.143
in the Hispanic population, compared
with non-Hispanic populations in the U.S.

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:30.872
- Okay. And what is being done
to combat this problem?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:36.948
- There are…
Since, we are realizing,

00:05:36.948 --> 00:05:42.459
and seeing the results that show that
the illness is more frequent in the

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:55.143
Hispanic community, we are conducting
clinical studies on how it is that the

00:05:55.143 --> 00:06:00.938
disease is presenting in Hispanics,
compared to non-Hispanics.

00:06:00.938 --> 00:06:07.864
How does it begin and why is it more
frequent, and why does it tend to be more

00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:10.224
severe in the case of Hispanics?

00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:15.079
- It sounds like it is a serious problem
affecting the Hispanic population.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:20.618
So I think it is very important to educate
Hispanics about this problem

00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:25.843
so that they'll to recognize these
abnormal changes happening

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:30.059
to them or their family members, so that
they'll be prepared to fight this problem.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:42.390
- Absolutely. The process of Dementia
and Alzheimer's, when it occurs

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.757
and manifests and progresses, it is,
in itself, a tragedy.

00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:50.865
And recognizing the initial symptoms,
making it more familiar,

00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:57.471
having more knowledge of what the
disease is, allows us, especially in the

00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:01.503
Hispanic community,
to identify it at an earlier stage,

00:07:01.503 --> 00:07:06.855
and get advice, help, information,
about this process.

00:07:06.855 --> 00:07:09.595
- Yes, for example, my grandmother
suffered from Alzheimer's,

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.557
and it took us some time

00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:14.979
to realize that something was going on
because I think that in the

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.037
Hispanic culture, a lot of the time,
when there are any memory changes

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:22.496
we say, "Oh, it's because of their age."
We don't think it could be Dementia

00:07:22.496 --> 00:07:25.330
because most of the time,
we don't know what Dementia is.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:31.649
So, I think it is a big issue, and we are
trying to help all Latinos, right?

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:39.680
- Yes. Yes, Alex, and,
like you said, it's not… sometimes we

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.940
think that memory issues,
to have progressive memory loss,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.064
to forget things is a phenomenon of
aging, but it's not a phenomenon of aging.

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:57.121
Experiencing memory loss,
asking the same questions several times,

00:07:57.121 --> 00:08:04.723
repeating conversations several times,
to lose the ability of being time and

00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:11.036
place oriented, it's not normal and we
shouldn't take it as a sign of aging,

00:08:11.036 --> 00:08:16.001
because it is not. It is not.
There are other, more subtle,

00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:20.084
changes of aging, but they are not the
ones of Alzheimer's.

00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:23.640
- Okay, and speaking about my grandmother,
is this disease something that can be

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.079
inherited from parents to their children?
Is there a genetic component

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.507
to the disease? How does that work?

00:08:31.507 --> 00:08:37.356
- In most cases,
Alzheimer's disease, Dementia,

00:08:37.356 --> 00:08:44.534
aren't necessarily
inherited directly from the parents.

00:08:44.534 --> 00:08:55.013
The disease itself is a biological process
where there are genes and biological

00:08:55.013 --> 00:08:58.449
components that explain the disease,
but what we see is that,

00:08:58.449 --> 00:09:02.188
in the majority of the cases,
it's not a process which is

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:08.091
inherited directly, dominantly,
to the children. With that, actually,

00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:13.949
there are more particular cases in which
the disease presents itself

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:19.732
at an earlier age, it is called
Alzheimer's that occurs in young people.

00:09:19.732 --> 00:09:25.955
Those are less frequent cases,
but some of those cases do manifest as a

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:32.408
genetic character that is passed on from
the fathers to the sons,

00:09:32.408 --> 00:09:35.496
or the mothers to the daughters too.

00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:37.415
- Okay. And when we were talking about how

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:42.662
to fight off this big problem that is
affecting us, you mentioned

00:09:42.662 --> 00:09:45.572
the clinical studies.
Could you talk a little about the

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.418
importance of getting involved in the
clinical investigations and how

00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:51.369
these investigations work?

00:09:51.369 --> 00:09:54.687
- Yes, Alex, that is
a very important question.

00:09:54.687 --> 00:10:04.086
Right now there are ways to look for help,
to look for information and access

00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:08.255
to clinical studies
that include Hispanics.

00:10:08.255 --> 00:10:10.079
The way to do it is

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:14.400
through the Alzheimer's organization
in San Diego,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.642
"Alzheimer's San Diego",
that's the Alzheimer's association more

00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:24.058
on a national level.
There also are… Those are two centers

00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:30.958
where you can look for information about
the disease and you can… There are ways

00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:39.351
to do it. You input your information
and they look for clinical studies

00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:46.251
the person qualifies for.
Part of those clinical studies are

00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:49.792
conducted on a local level,
on a state level, and on a national level,

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:55.052
and are also part of my duties
at the university.

00:10:55.052 --> 00:10:58.219
- Okay. And, as you were saying,

00:10:58.219 --> 00:11:01.484
Latinos are suffering
more with this disease.

00:11:01.484 --> 00:11:04.640
I think it is really important
for Latinos to be involved

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.897
with these clinical studies, right?
And do you think that there are more

00:11:08.897 --> 00:11:13.618
difficulties when trying to get more
Hispanics into this clinical studies?

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:17.550
- Yes, yes. I do believe so,
Alex, that it is more difficult.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:24.623
It is important to include Hispanics in
the studies because we don't know

00:11:24.623 --> 00:11:33.234
for certain if Alzheimer's disease is
the same in non-Latinos than in Latinos.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:40.186
We are realizing that there are
differences, and the way to understand the

00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:45.696
differences and how those differences
could affect the treatment in one

00:11:45.696 --> 00:11:52.101
population or the other,
the way to discover that is having our

00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:58.044
participants...a Hispanic component
to be able to compare Hispanics

00:11:58.044 --> 00:11:59.483
and non-Hispanics.

00:11:59.483 --> 00:12:03.204
- And to be able to know exactly what
the problem is, right?

00:12:03.204 --> 00:12:05.176
- To find what the problem is.

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:09.764
We have an idea. For example,
in the Hispanic community...

00:12:09.764 --> 00:12:17.373
one of the observations we've made
on the Hispanic community

00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:24.345
with Alzheimer's, is that there is a
process in which the brain is being

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:29.124
affected by Alzheimer's in a similar
way than those non-Hispanics.

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:37.798
But Hispanics, we're finding in
several studies, have an additional

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:45.317
component in their brain,
a cardiovascular component that includes,

00:12:45.317 --> 00:12:51.171
we've found strokes, heart attacks,
a little more frequently,

00:12:51.171 --> 00:13:00.293
compared to those non-Hispanics. That,
along with the Alzheimer's process,

00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:07.741
could make the person develop Dementia
maybe a little earlier and more severe

00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:09.286
than what we expected.

00:13:09.286 --> 00:13:12.347
- Okay. And, maybe, after hearing
about all of this,

00:13:12.347 --> 00:13:16.484
a lot of people might be really worried.
So, my next question is,

00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:20.049
is there something that can be done
to prevent Alzheimer's?

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:32.444
- Right now, there isn't a specific way to
completely stop and reverse the process.

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:39.270
We are working on finding ways of
slowing down the process so that the

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:44.163
person can be more comfortable,
with less clinical symptoms for longer.

00:13:44.163 --> 00:13:54.000
There are things we can do to help us keep
our mental health active longer

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.859
like having good clinical health,
good health in general,

00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:04.815
seeing the doctor regularly to control
cardiovascular factors,

00:14:04.815 --> 00:14:08.170
control the blood pressure,
make sure that our diet is the

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.975
correct one, eat properly,
having a healthy diet

00:14:11.975 --> 00:14:22.160
to avoid diabetes, to control diabetes.
Also, to control...when cholesterol

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.749
is high, the triglycerides.
Control factors that could contribute

00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:32.970
to the cardiovascular factor,
which we know is working

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.932
alongside Alzheimer's,
and makes the symptoms more severe.

00:14:36.932 --> 00:14:41.079
- Okay. And, as you were saying,
this disease is a really terrible disease

00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:46.406
for the person affected by it but also for
their family. So what type of resources

00:14:46.406 --> 00:14:50.167
exist for the person affected
and their families?

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:56.966
- Yeah, the resources that currently exist
include, for example,

00:14:56.966 --> 00:15:03.038
we have the Southern Caregivers that
is an association that provide resources

00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:08.453
and advice, particularly,
to the family members that take care

00:15:08.453 --> 00:15:17.710
of the people with Alzheimer's disease.
Southern Care Givers is a resource.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:24.465
Also, two other associations
are Alzheimer's San Diego,

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:29.581
an Alzheimer's Association in
San Diego, and Alzheimer's Association,

00:15:29.581 --> 00:15:37.269
which is a larger Alzheimer's Association.
They have the resources and programs

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:42.750
in which they can help the patient and the
person taking care of the patient.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:48.404
They provide information about how to have
a more social relationship

00:15:48.404 --> 00:15:51.687
in the community, how to be more
communicated with other people who

00:15:51.687 --> 00:15:55.065
have the disease. There are support
groups for people

00:15:55.065 --> 00:15:59.918
with this disease and their families,
that offer social support for this.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.258
- That's great! So there are many
opportunities to obtain resources.

00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:05.692
- There are many opportunities here,

00:16:05.692 --> 00:16:11.709
and there are several ways in which we are
trying to go directly into the community

00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:19.431
to develop a healthy and trusting
relationship with the people with the

00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:22.887
disease and their families.
Here we have program called

00:16:22.887 --> 00:16:28.127
"The Promoters" program,
where there are people, individuals,

00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:32.883
that are in charge of going into the
community and developing a relationship

00:16:32.883 --> 00:16:37.588
and communication with the patients and
family members that suffer

00:16:37.588 --> 00:16:38.444
from this disease.

00:16:38.444 --> 00:16:41.485
- Okay. And with all
these current investigations

00:16:41.485 --> 00:16:45.526
and with all of these new developments,
is there hope for a cure?

00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:52.975
- I think, Alex, that there is.
I think there are. Mainly, initially,

00:16:52.975 --> 00:17:03.909
we are… the goal is to,
in the beginning, slow it

00:17:03.909 --> 00:17:07.738
down a little, little by little,
making the disease a slower process,

00:17:07.738 --> 00:17:12.538
which can allow the person to have more
living years with a better life quality.

00:17:12.538 --> 00:17:21.598
That is the goal that we have, and so,
progressively, we are looking for ways

00:17:21.598 --> 00:17:29.658
of making the disease slower and slower,
to the point where we can have enough

00:17:29.658 --> 00:17:39.476
scientific and medical ammo to get to a
point in which we would be able to stop

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:44.988
the disease. But to get to that point,
we require information about the

00:17:44.988 --> 00:17:52.460
human population, including us Latinos,
we require communication

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:58.941
and collaboration, and it is a slow
process but I think that's how it is.

00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:00.094
I think it is possible.

00:18:00.094 --> 00:18:01.138
- Well, that's great.
We have to keep going

00:18:01.138 --> 00:18:07.116
forward and maintaining hope to try to
solve this disease affecting us,

00:18:07.116 --> 00:18:11.725
a terrible disease that affects the whole
family, not only the one that suffers it.

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:13.012
- Absolutely.

00:18:13.012 --> 00:18:15.119
- Thank you, Dr. Lopez, for being with us,

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:18.889
and thanks to all of you for watching
this episode in Spanish of

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:22.987
the Brain Channel, and I'll see
you next time. Thank you.
