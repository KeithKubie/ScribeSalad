1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,760
All right.
What's going on everybody?

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,810
It is our monthly patrion
exclusive live stream.

3
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,180
We're changing it up this month.
Uh,

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,000
so what we've always been doing here
with Patrion is I do this video,

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:22,230
this live stream where I take questions
from patrons and we only share the video

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,500
with Patrion people. But I realized, uh,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,170
last month that when we were
doing this that it's like,

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:31,800
I think more of you want more people
to be able to hear the questions you're

9
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:36,480
asking. And here my answers. So I
asked everybody basically, I was like,

10
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:41,430
look, how about we let only patrion
members submit the questions,

11
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:46,410
but we'll post this video live to our
youtube feed as we're doing right now and

12
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,730
let everybody hear the answers.

13
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:49,470
That way it gets more people
hearing your questions,

14
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:50,670
more people here in my answers.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,700
And hopefully for some of you guys
that haven't joined us, uh, on Patrion,

16
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:57,660
hopefully you will join us. So if you want
to get a question and to me first off,

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,980
uh, it's patrion.com/rubin
report and I think it's the,

18
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:05,460
a level one tier gets ya,
gets you right in on, on this.

19
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,380
And I've got a trusty iPad here.

20
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:12,381
My guys are sending me questions on the
fly and we're going to do about an hour

21
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,180
of Q and a totally uncensored.
Whatever you want to ask me.

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,490
I'm reading them right here.
I haven't even looked at them yet.

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,890
I've been doing patrion hangouts
all day long. You know, we,

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,090
for the higher tier members, we do small
group chats. We used to do one on ones.

25
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,640
Now we're doing them in groups.
So I've been going all day long.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,530
I am wearing a hat, which people don't get
to see me in a hat that often. Uh, but,

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,280
uh,

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,690
I haven't even showered today because
it's been a crazy freaking day of Patriot

29
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:40,010
hangouts and just catching up on
life. As you guys know. I've been, uh,

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,930
last three weeks on the road with Jordan
Peterson and we were in Denmark and

31
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:47,830
Sweden and Norway and
UK and Ireland. And, uh,

32
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,940
definitely forgetting some other places,
but we've been all over the place.

33
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,420
It looks like we just signed
on for probably another 30
shows in Europe in March

34
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,660
and April. Uh, we got a whole bunch
of stops in Australia in February.

35
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,380
They're just great energy
behind what we're doing. I'm,

36
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,250
I'm so enthused and site and, uh, I just,
I just feel great at the moment and a,

37
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,770
and I'm looking forward to taking
some questions. Oh, just real quick.

38
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:11,650
Let me pimp out one, one event I've been
doing. So I got back from Helsinki. Oh,

39
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,460
Finland. I forgot about Finland.
Uh, I got back from Helsinki, uh,

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,510
two days ago and then I did stand
up immediately that night in Braya.

41
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,590
Uh, and then I did stand up last
night in Oxnard and both nights I a,

42
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,410
I brought two members of the intellectual
dark web. I always bring one.

43
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:32,460
So I do about an hour of stand up and
then I bring the guests from the IDW on.

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,533
Uh,
I bought,

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,070
brought both Weinstein brothers on stage
and we're just having a great time and,

46
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,940
and it's, it's totally different. So I
hope if you guys happen to be in a city,

47
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,310
Warren, I'm doing stand up soon and
I hope you'll come check it out.

48
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:49,311
I'll be in San Jose on November 28th at
the San Jose Improv and there will be an

49
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,260
IDW member, uh, with me and you know,

50
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:56,010
I do stand up but it's a lot of crowd
work and we do live Q and a and it's

51
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:59,650
really interactive and fun and I get
the crowd going at each other and it's a

52
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,570
politically diverse
group of people and it's,

53
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,910
and it's pretty cool and
I'm psyched about that.

54
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,370
And if you want to just check out some
more dates and tours and other things

55
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:07,470
that I'm doing a,

56
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,920
you can go to Dave rubin.com/events
and before I start,

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,200
I assume everybody
wants to say hi to Emma.

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,860
She's been hanging out all
day long and here she is,

59
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,980
14 years old.
A lot of you know the story about her.

60
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,710
She's a rescue from Hurricane
Katrina in New Orleans.

61
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,120
So she's lived in New Orleans then.

62
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,870
She lived in New York for about 10 years
and now we've been living in La for a

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,390
couple of years. She's been to the Grand
Canyon. She's been to the White House.

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,310
The girl has lived through a lot.
Okay.

65
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,410
Let's jump into questions cause
that's what it's all about.

66
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,350
So we will go right there. Uh, when
are you coming back to San Francisco?

67
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,480
So I've done a couple
events in San Francisco.

68
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:47,440
Well I will be in San Jose on November
28 that's pretty close to San Francisco.

69
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,060
So hopefully you can come check it out.

70
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,030
I think we're going to do some more
stuff in San Francisco and I just need to

71
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,970
spend a couple of days there cause there's
a lot going on on tech side of things

72
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,130
as you guys can imagine these days
with all the algorithm craziness and,

73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,180
and youtube stuff and
Twitter shadow banning.

74
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,890
So I need to spend some time
in San Francisco. Um, so maybe,

75
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:08,260
maybe on the 29th I'll do like some sort
of public event there if I can figure

76
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:13,180
out a way to do it. But 20th, I'm in San
Jose, so do come and check it out. Um,

77
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,300
Dave, uh, after listening to the Idw,

78
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:21,130
I can no longer listen to conservative
talk radio. It seems shallow. Uh,

79
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,680
just like the mainstream media.
What have you done to me?

80
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,430
I've done something good my friend.
This is what it's all about. Look,

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,410
what is the IDW trying to do?
Uh, as Eric Weinstein said,

82
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,490
who I think is sort of the,

83
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,510
he was the sort of architect of this in
some ways and I've been sort of the main

84
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,750
facilitator and we've got all sorts
of people that are part of it.

85
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,450
It's like what do,
what do we agree on most of them?

86
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,690
What we agree on mostly is that
we're allowed to think differently,

87
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,000
but we agree on what a conversation is,

88
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,180
what a respectful conversation amongst
people who have different thoughts are,

89
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:56,530
which is why I can sit in my studio
with my own home across from Ben Shapiro

90
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,850
when he'll tell me that he wouldn't
attend my wedding anniversary. And we can,

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,830
we can agree to disagree on things.

92
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,730
So we can agree that we still want to
live in the same societies, each other.

93
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,190
I think what we've done
with the IDW is we,

94
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,370
we've shattered some of the notions that
media and the political establishment

95
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,880
has, has thrust on all of us
about how we should behave,

96
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:24,460
where everyone who
disagrees with us is evil.

97
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,630
And everyone who disagrees with this is
a bigot or a Lib tart or a racist or a

98
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:32,530
homophobe. All of this stuff, it's
not real. It's tearing us apart.

99
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:36,570
It's making people crazy. And I can
tell you guys, I just meant the,

100
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,360
the last three weeks
bouncing all over Europe,

101
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:43,670
I spent the two months before that
bouncing all over the United States. Uh,

102
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,880
we've done 70 plus shows
together. I think Jordan and I, a,

103
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,850
it'll be well over a hundred by the
time we're done. And people are good.

104
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,310
They're out there,
they want to solve problems.

105
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,980
And one of the coolest things is so
you right now, person watching this,

106
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,590
most likely you're watching
this alone, right? You're,

107
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,530
you're watching it either on your phone
or you're sitting at your laptop or your

108
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,680
desktop. Um, you're not
listening to this, right?

109
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:09,020
Cause we're only live streaming
this on youtube. We will,

110
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,320
I think we're going to put this up
on the podcast feed probably. Um,

111
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,060
but this is a sort of solo operation.

112
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,560
Like maybe you're watching it
on your smart TV, maybe your,

113
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:18,740
your husband or your wife or your
boyfriend or girlfriend is there,

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,730
but it's a pretty solo experience
ingesting all of this content. You know,

115
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:26,780
you can walk around listening to
these podcasts and it's a solo thing.

116
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,890
And what I'm,

117
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,430
what I'm really loving right now about
the Peterson events and now doing standup

118
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,090
again,

119
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,510
is that people are coming into these rooms
and they're looking around and you're

120
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,630
going, holy cow. You know,
for the standard shows,

121
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,330
there's hundreds of other people laughing
about the same shit that I'm laughing

122
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,740
about at the Petersen shows.

123
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:47,741
There's thousands of other people that
are as interested in ideas and getting

124
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:51,020
your life right before you fix the world,
fix yourself.

125
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,500
And they're coming together and they're
realizing, holy cow, I'm not alone.

126
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,420
And yes,
they disagree.

127
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,240
All the people that come there
disagree on all sorts of things.

128
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,510
And I have people that come up to
me after the shows. And you know,

129
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,710
a lot of people of course say Dave,

130
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm sort of on the same political
journey is you? I used to be a big lefty,

131
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:09,530
but I'm a liberal and that has
nothing to do with the left anymore.

132
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:10,490
And people come up to me and say,

133
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,670
I'm a libertarian and I've been waiting
for some good liberals to join forces

134
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,730
with. Some people say I'm a conservative
and I disagree with you on some things,

135
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,810
uh, but, but you know, I support what
you're doing and all that. Um, so look,

136
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:23,780
if you can't listen to talk radio
anymore because of what we've done here,

137
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,580
I think that's pretty good.
You know,

138
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:28,580
I'm not putting down anybody and the
people can do what they want and listen to

139
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,750
who they want to listen to.

140
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,110
But I think we've offered up something
a little more and I'm really proud of

141
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:36,260
that and I think we're just
at the beginning again. So
it's, it's pretty exciting.

142
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,100
Um, okay. Let's see. Um, Dave,

143
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,640
have you followed the leftist attacks on
Peter but goes you unrelated to his pro

144
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:47,150
bound grievance studies? I have,
uh, first off, I love Pete.

145
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,810
Pete's been on the show twice
and if you haven't seen, uh,

146
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,890
particularly the second one.

147
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,770
So the first interview that I did with
Peter was the first time we met and we

148
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,710
did mostly a talk an hour
long talk about atheism.

149
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,470
And Pete wrote a book called a
manual for creating atheists.

150
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,570
We did that about three years ago.

151
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,280
I think it was three years
ago this month actually,

152
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,000
it might've been this week and it
was right before thanksgiving. Um,

153
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,860
and Pete was on again about
a year ago in this studio.

154
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,310
And we did, we talked about all
sorts of stuff. But what was great,

155
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,610
I think the first 20 or 30 minutes was
about the nature of friendship. Actually,

156
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:23,210
his father had just passed
away. And, uh, you know,

157
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,160
our friendship sort of blossomed because
I tried to be there for him during that

158
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,640
time. Um, he's, he's a really
good guy. Look, these guys wrote,

159
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:35,870
Pete and James Lindsey and Helen
pluck, rose wrote these, uh,

160
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,790
these fake academic papers
that got accepted by peer
reviewed journals and they

161
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,720
just freaking flipped
all of these nonsensical,

162
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,853
um,

163
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,990
all of these nonsensical ways that these
departments figure out what's real and

164
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,990
what's not real right on their head. I
mean, it's actually incredible. So anyway,

165
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:58,290
Pete is a philosophy professor at Portland
State University and the school paper

166
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:03,291
issued this statement all anonymously
signed by professors and Grad students,

167
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,660
uh, about how awful he is.
And it's like, man, you know,

168
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:11,040
he's put his butt and his career and his
life on the line to fight for what he

169
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:15,120
believes in. And you guys won't even
put your names to this paper, uh,

170
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,240
to this statement against him.
And it's like you're all cowards.

171
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,420
If you were on the side of truth,
you would stand up and be who you are,

172
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:24,900
but you won't. And this guy is
doing good work because what he,

173
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,030
what Pete I think
basically believes is that,

174
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,090
that the gender studies and these
types of disciplines that aren't pure

175
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,440
reviewed, that don't, uh,

176
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,170
that don't come from a place of
empirical evidence like say the stems,

177
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,480
uh, do, um,

178
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,810
Pete would say they are
infecting every part of academia.

179
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,900
And it's not just Pete that says that
it's plenty of other people at Jordan.

180
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,170
Peterson says it,
uh,

181
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,540
plenty of other people in academia or
realize what is happening. And, uh,

182
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,880
so I love Pete. I backbeat
and I hope that, uh,

183
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,900
what he's done will have wider effects
and will ripple for a long time coming.

184
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:05,310
And I do think they will. Um, what
do you think is the future of comedy?

185
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,820
Can it get back to being funny and not
just political watch the Adam Sandler

186
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:09,960
Netflix than recently,

187
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,930
even though I was not a fan and I enjoyed
it partly because the songs were funny

188
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:15,420
and weird and because there
was no political content,

189
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,180
so I haven't seen that thing yet.
You know, when I was younger,

190
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,360
especially in college, I loved
Sandler is comedy was off the wall.

191
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:24,030
That wasn't political.
It was completely ridiculous.

192
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:27,960
Then he had like five or six movies in
a row. There were absolutely horrendous.

193
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,020
And then those Netflix movies
have been pretty awful.

194
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,460
The Sandy Wexler on was sort of okay,
but some of the others are just terrible.

195
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,680
That one with David spade where
he's a secret agent or science,

196
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,810
it's not even a movie. They need another
word for it. It's so bad. That being said,

197
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,070
I haven't seen this yet,
but,

198
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,300
but if he got back to his
off the wall roots where he,

199
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,530
we know what's happening and this
is what your questions about.

200
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,650
It's like what's happening right now
is that these comedians have become the

201
00:10:55,651 --> 00:11:00,030
same type of hectoring preaching blowhards
that they're supposed to be making

202
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,130
fun of.
So imagine if George Carlin,

203
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:06,240
who I think is the greatest stand up and
the most prolific standup comic of all

204
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,740
time,
if he was alive today.

205
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:11,190
Now first off he be getting booed off
college campuses because he'd be an old

206
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:14,130
white guy defending the patriarchy.
I mean, it's so stupid, right?

207
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,720
This is a guy who fought the his entire
life. Um, but what would he be doing?

208
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,310
He would be using comedy to
say what he wants to say,

209
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:26,730
but if you go online now and you
see what a lot of really famous,

210
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,800
far more famous than me comics are doing,

211
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,200
they're just yelling and
preaching and they're all,

212
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,920
they're all progressive activists and
Democratic Party members and all that

213
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,020
stuff and they're not funny anymore.

214
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,870
I mean the amount of people
who I used to like comedically,

215
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:42,510
who now like make me
kind of nauseous as sick,

216
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,760
but that's actually why
I'm doing standup again.

217
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:48,000
And we did great show in Oxnard last
night. We did a great show and Brian,

218
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:48,660
as I said,

219
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,660
I'm doing something that's like more of
like a crazy road show slash town whole

220
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:59,361
thrash interview slash Phil Donahue
Slash Jerry Springer show than anything

221
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,440
else.
And I'm treating my audience with respect.

222
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,330
We're doing some
politically incorrect stuff.

223
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,400
I hope people aren't a recording
all of this stuff because what,

224
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,930
what happens in accountability club
is kind of sacred and a lot of comics,

225
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,870
by the way, now the big, the big
time comics like Rogan in Chappelle,

226
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,730
who both are spectacular comedians.

227
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,820
They don't even let people bring their
phones. You have to give up your phone.

228
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,240
You put it in a bag before you even
go in. Um, because that, you know,

229
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,390
the comedy club is the place where
you're supposed to experiment.

230
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:28,060
And imagine if you were a scientist and
you're experimenting and things were

231
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,970
blowing up in your face, you wouldn't
want that out there all the time. Man.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,080
You know,
I Albert eyes,

233
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:35,020
I didn't want all of his formulas out
there while he was trying to figure him

234
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:39,980
out. So I'm glad to hear that about
Sandler. I will check out the, the, uh,

235
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,040
the special one.
I have a chance and a,

236
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,650
and I do hope you guys will come check out
the, the standup that I'm doing. So, uh,

237
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,700
28th in San Jose at the Improv. I'll be
in the, at the, uh, the Improv in Irvine,

238
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:53,030
California in January and we're,
we're booking out a bunch of other stuff.

239
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,950
So yeah, there you go. Uh, love the Norway
Q and. A. I just posted on the channel,

240
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:02,690
I think yesterday, the Q
and a from Oslo, Norway, uh,

241
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,190
me asking Jordan questions.

242
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:07,400
It's the only public thing that
we've posted from the entire tour.

243
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,530
So if you haven't seen a dude check
it out. So thank you for that.

244
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,470
Just so that Jordan Peterson is
coming to Auckland, New Zealand,

245
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:14,480
will you be accompanying him?
I hope so.

246
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,900
So that's right after Australia and I
had something I have to do that week in

247
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:24,890
the states, so I don't think I
can, unfortunately. I'm sorry.

248
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:29,420
Believe me, I would absolutely love to
go to New Zealand for a million reasons.

249
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:34,010
Of course. I've got to try your lamb.
Uh, I get New Zealand lamb here,

250
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:37,070
but like, and then that's just one of many
reasons that I would love to go there.

251
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:41,120
And I get a lot of email
from a New Zealand also. So
don't count me out just yet,

252
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:45,080
but unfortunately I don't think it's
going to happen. Um, okay. Let's see.

253
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,840
What's your least favorite thing
about touring with Peterson? Uh,

254
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,380
we hear so much about how awesome it is.

255
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:55,810
I'm curious if there's anything
that bothers you at all. Wow,

256
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,500
that's a question.
Um,

257
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,920
okay.

258
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,850
No, there, there really
isn't. Um, you know,

259
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:04,920
the travel can be a little
bit exhausting at times.

260
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:06,240
Like I'm actually a little beat right now.

261
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:09,240
The reason I'm wearing a hat is I didn't
even shower today because it's been so

262
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:11,600
busy doing patrion hangouts today.
And you know,

263
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,510
I got back and I immediately went to the
standup Gig and then this other standup

264
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:17,460
Gig and I interviewed
Bret Weinstein yesterday,

265
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:21,390
which will be on our channel tomorrow.
And I had so much business to catch up on.

266
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,070
And, um, a mirror who's been our
director for three plus years, uh,

267
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,610
who's been just an absolute
all star at every level. Uh,

268
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,410
she actually accepted a new job, has
moved on. So we now have a part time,

269
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,130
part time or taken her job,
which is clearly a fulltime job.

270
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:41,190
It's many people's full time
jobs as we're hiring for that.

271
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,260
And I know a whole bunch of you have
submitted resumes and we're trying to

272
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,570
figure all that out so
there's just so much going on.

273
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:48,150
So I would say the only thing that's a
little sucky is that I feel like I'm a

274
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:51,320
little bit behind on things. And actually
one other thing related to the show,

275
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,050
which I mentioned in a
live stream last week,

276
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,140
the one thing that I think has suffered
on the show is that I haven't been able

277
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,320
to do direct messages because we've been
taping a lot of stuff in advance while

278
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm on the road. I did do two
live streams last week. You know,

279
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,930
this is live stream right now and I'm
going to try to do more of these so that I

280
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,720
can keep that connection with you guys.
And so that I can,

281
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,430
I can speak directly to you and you guys
can ask and, and comment directly to me.

282
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,710
Um, but I do miss the
direct messages. I mean,

283
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,840
I think that's where I can
give you my most clear,

284
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:21,590
cogent thoughts because I write it out
and I go directly to camera over there

285
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,460
and do it. So I, I miss that
a little bit. Um, but we'll,

286
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:26,660
we'll get back to that kind of stuff.

287
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,600
And I also want to change what we're
doing and how we're doing it as,

288
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,570
as the years go by and always remain
fresh and all that good stuff.

289
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,050
But in terms of the tour itself,
nothing bad, nothing bad.

290
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,330
Jordan and I have hit
a nice rhythm together.

291
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:41,150
I think we're really bringing
out the best in each other. Um,

292
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:44,810
I honestly feel like a better person
than I was like five months ago. Like,

293
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,930
if you guys think Jordan has affected
you and if you think you've tried to

294
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,440
incorporate the 12 rules of life to,
to your life to fix yourself,

295
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:55,160
it's like try being on the road with the
guy for six months and try doing Q and

296
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:59,240
A's where we do 45 minutes together in
front of 2000 people and he's talking to

297
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:02,060
them, but then he'll turn and you
know, we're this close. Right.

298
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,470
And it's like there's powerful stuff
there. Um, and that's been, uh,

299
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,540
that's been very exciting.
So it's all good. It's very,
it's very cool. I see this,

300
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,190
there hasn't been one of,
actually the,

301
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,320
the running joke with our tour manager
John, who's also been wonderful.

302
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,220
It's like this guy is like, this is
the easiest tour ever. He's like,

303
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,510
nobody's doing drugs. Nobody's drinking.
Nobodys ripping up hotel rooms. He's like,

304
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,500
the two of you,
you know,

305
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:29,501
you have dinner maybe or you shoot the
shit after you drink some sparkling water

306
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:33,560
and then talk about philosophy. He's
like, this is the easiest thing ever.

307
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:37,550
The only screw up of the entire tour is
I think when we were in where the hell

308
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,050
were,
we were in like Ontario,

309
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:43,100
Canada and I said that we were in Toronto
or something like that, which is like,

310
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,890
that's like tour screw up one
oh one. So yeah, it's really,

311
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,800
it truly has been great.
It really has, uh, Dave,

312
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,950
many of us are such huge fan of yours.

313
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,130
Would you ever consider a patrion reward
where you would follow some of your

314
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:58,340
fans on Twitter? That's actually
kind of interesting. You know,

315
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:00,770
I wouldn't want to make it about like
that that feels like it would almost be

316
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,530
like bribery or something. Um, you know,

317
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,980
the Twitter feeds of just
become such a mess. Let me,

318
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:10,120
let me think about that one actually,
because I suspect too that if,

319
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,370
if you're a fan of mine and
you enjoy what we do here,

320
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:16,880
you probably treat Twitter with
the same sort of respect that I do.

321
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:20,390
So it probably wouldn't be such a bad
idea. Let me think that one through.

322
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:24,620
I think there might be something there.
Um, how much worse do you think youtube,

323
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:28,730
Facebook and Google have to become
before someone who creates a competing

324
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,570
service refuses to sell? And we
start to shift over? I mean, look,

325
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:34,820
this is the million dollar
question, right? Like,

326
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,470
we've been talking about this for months.

327
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,060
If you didn't watch my livestream with
Eric Weinstein from about six weeks ago

328
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,040
or so, uh, we got into a little bit.

329
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,630
There's no doubt that the billionaire
class a is now paying attention to this.

330
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,040
Um, there is a billionaire
that I had on the show

331
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,130
not too long ago who knows what he's
thinking about all this stuff. Um,

332
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,550
I can't tell you everything at the moment,
but yes,

333
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:00,900
I think perhaps finally, um,
we've hit critical mass with this.

334
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:04,620
We're just today I tweeted out that I
just don't see people's tweets anymore,

335
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,360
especially the IDW crew.

336
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,010
I never see Eric's tweets or Brett's
tweets or Sam's tweets. Uh, may maybe.

337
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,880
I see Jordan's every now and again.
Christina Hoff Summers, I never see ion.

338
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,970
I never see 'em a slew of them.
I never see them.

339
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:22,500
What I do see often is I see
the conservative commentators
that I follow like a

340
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,080
bill Kristol or no Rockman.
A couple of guys like that.

341
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,740
I see their tweets all the time,
but I never see my other guy's tweets.

342
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,890
Now we know that there's some
level of shadow banning going on.

343
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:35,580
There's something being manipulated
in the algorithm. Who the hell knows?

344
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,920
And again these companies can
do whatever the hell they want.

345
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,020
People just want some transparency.
So yes,

346
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:44,400
at some point will something
come in and replace them? Yes,

347
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,450
I do believe that.

348
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Hopefully I'll be part of something
that that does do it and it's so funny.

349
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,760
It's like, man, all you guys have
to do, it's sort of like what I,

350
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,890
what I generally say about
the left at the moment,

351
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:00,180
which is all you guys had to do these
last couple of years was not be absolutely

352
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,700
terrible. Like you could
have been basically terrible.

353
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,600
You know like you could have just
been generically terrible and a lot of

354
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,130
liberals and left.

355
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:11,130
These would have kind of stayed with you
because they would have been like, ah,

356
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:14,430
the rights still is too scary for me.
Or something like that.

357
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,940
More the societal pressures to not move
politically or whatever, you know, or the,

358
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,900
the, the cries of racism
and bigotry wouldn't have,

359
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,880
would it stop people from moving,

360
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,820
but instead they decided to be really
awful and I kind of feel like that's

361
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:28,470
what's happening with the
tech companies right now.

362
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,080
It's like we don't know if
videos get out to feeds anymore.

363
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:32,960
I don't know how many of you actually are,

364
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,360
are watching this live at the moment
and did this get out to, you know,

365
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:40,950
we've almost 900,000 subscribers. How many
people actually got this notification?

366
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:44,010
People tell me they get unsubscribed
all the time. All of this stuff.

367
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,970
It's like there's gotta be a better way
to do this, to communicate information.

368
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,580
There's such a starvation for,

369
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,480
for good conversation and
enlightening thought and, and,

370
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:56,910
and not belittling and braiding everybody.
So I think it's coming together.

371
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,790
If you're not,
let's see.

372
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,790
I'd love to see your radical
feminist or SJW on the show.

373
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,430
How hard is it to get one to
accept an invitation? Look,

374
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,810
I think you guys know this.

375
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,520
I am happy to talk to anybody that will
have a decent, respectful conversation.

376
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,980
If there is,

377
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,910
there's a small crew of people out
there that are always attacking me and

378
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,730
mocking me and, and, uh,

379
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,170
lying and slandering me and all these
things and then demanding to come on the

380
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,320
show. And it's like, now I
wouldn't want you in my life,

381
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,710
but I wouldn't want you in my
home much less my show. Um,

382
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,740
but if there's someone out there from
that line of thinking that will honestly

383
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:37,880
defend their ideas and sit across from
somebody and not call you a Nazi or

384
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,750
racist, I'll be happy
to do that. You know,

385
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:44,130
I tweet out this list of lefties all the
time that I would love to have on from,

386
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,431
you know,

387
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:47,890
Michael Moore and Rob Reiner and
Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman and

388
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:51,490
obviously Bernie Sanders
and Elizabeth Warren and a,

389
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:55,930
and a whole slew of, uh, of other
people. So I'd be happy to do it,

390
00:20:55,931 --> 00:21:00,130
but they have to discuss things. Um,
honestly and fairly, you know what,

391
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:02,830
give me one second because my dog wants
to get out of the studio and she's given

392
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:03,880
me to look.
Hold on one second.

393
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,333
Okay.

394
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,470
Sorry. That was, that was six
seconds. She gets, she's 14 years old.

395
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:21,160
She gets up the stairs a little slower
these days. Okay. Let's see. MMM,

396
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,763
yeah.

397
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,960
Uh, will you come to Cincinnati?
Bring Peterson please. Um,

398
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,170
actually Peterson did an event in
Cincinnati, but I was not there.

399
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:34,950
I had to go home for a, where was
I going, I think for a wedding,

400
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,310
so I missed that. Um, but I'd love
to go back there and I've never,

401
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:41,340
I've actually never been to Cincinnati,
so I would absolutely love to go.

402
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,080
One of the funny things he may,

403
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:47,490
it might crazy travels over
the last couple of weeks, um,

404
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,500
was that in the midst of the
whole European thing. Uh,
Bob Saget who's, uh, you got,

405
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,560
you guys all know Bob Saget comedian
from full house, Fuller House,

406
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:59,790
America's home videos and a good Julian
other things and a legendary standup. Uh,

407
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,480
I've become good friends with him and
his fiance at the time. Kelly Rizzo,

408
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,710
who's a great girl. And, uh, we,

409
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,250
they were getting married
and I left the UK.

410
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,140
I flew home for one day,

411
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,080
went to the wedding and then flew back
to Amsterdam in the middle of the whole

412
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:21,470
thing. But the wedding was,
was absolutely great and, uh,

413
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,750
at a great time and they're just
great. And it's like, you know what,

414
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:25,250
when you're in the thick of things,
it's like,

415
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,760
I just didn't want to like do this
and work this hard and then like,

416
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:33,050
just miss important things too. So
just doing my thing. Okay. Let's see.

417
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,461
Hey Dave,

418
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:38,150
a little worried when Jordan told the
pug story in one of your recent lectures.

419
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,290
So if you guys haven't seen this,

420
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:44,291
this was Jordan was referring to the
count dank yellow pug who made the Nazi

421
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:48,230
salute. Uh, and you can watch this
in our interview and from Norway, uh,

422
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,100
just a couple of days ago.

423
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,930
There are single lines out of that that
the left could use to further create an

424
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,100
alt right agenda.

425
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:59,480
I think you'd understand the lines that
could be edited out or combined with his

426
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,370
and the audience laughed or any concerns.

427
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,270
I'm not concerned about it even though
I think we made one or two jokes about

428
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:10,150
that. Um, look, here's the
deal. We cannot look, you know,

429
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:14,980
Jordan's not racist. Okay. Um, the
audience knows Jordan's not racist. Now,

430
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:19,270
could these people
selectively edit these videos?

431
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,100
Could they do this to literally any of
us at any time? Do they do it to me now?

432
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,840
Yes. I see people, these,

433
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:30,340
these awful Twitter anime avatars who
will quote me on things and they will

434
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:33,850
literally cut out the previous sentence
where I said, I do not think, or no,

435
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:37,690
this is not right. Can people do
all of these things all the time?

436
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Yes they can.
And we just live in that time right now.

437
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,700
And I think the best thing
you can do is what we do here,

438
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:48,350
which is do not edit for content.
And,

439
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,590
and what I mean by that is we
don't edit for content in that.

440
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,650
If my guests says something that is
stupid or ridiculous or whatever it is,

441
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,510
we let that stand.
We do not add for content.

442
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,510
The only thing we edit for occasionally
someone like has a sneezing fit or a

443
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,760
coughing fit or if a light
blinks or something like that,

444
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,420
like maybe we would do an edit around
that. But we do not edit for content.

445
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,050
We've only edited for content one time
in the hundreds of interviews I've ever

446
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,090
done. I don't want to throw
the guest under the bus,

447
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:17,240
but it was somebody that really was
not in good shape for the interview.

448
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,600
And it was, it was just a train
wreck. And we, I didn't want to do it,

449
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:24,020
but ultimately my team convinced me
that that's what we should do just to

450
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,720
save. This person's a lot of anguish.
Let's just leave it at that. Um,

451
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,480
but in terms of that,
look, Jordan was mocking,

452
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,990
he was making the point that you
have to be free to express yourself.

453
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,630
You have to be free to make jokes.

454
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,340
And I think he could have even taken it
a step further that even if cow Dacula

455
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:46,010
was racist, which Jordan is
explicitly saying he's not racist,

456
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,990
but you're still allowed to do that.

457
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:50,200
And I would or I would argue that
you're still allowed to do that.

458
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,900
Now we have a stronger defense of free
speech here in the United States with our

459
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:57,110
first amendment than they do in Europe.
And further,

460
00:24:57,111 --> 00:25:01,580
he talked in that Q and a about some of
the things that are happening in the UK

461
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:03,260
right now,
particularly around speech.

462
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:07,520
And you've got the Yorkshire for Yorkshire
Police Literally tweeting out saying,

463
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,730
you know, watch out for hate speech from
your neighbors and report them. I mean,

464
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,450
this is,

465
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,290
this is dangerous totalitarian
stuff that's spreading
all over Europe right now.

466
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,310
And we have to be very careful about this.
So I,

467
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:20,930
I get what you're saying that someone
could isolate one of that and then the

468
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:25,370
audience laughed when he said this, but
his intention, his intention was not, oh,

469
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:29,150
let's make fun of what the Nazis did.

470
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,760
The intention is to make fun
of the Nazis made, you know,

471
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:35,360
flip all of these things on their
head. And I think that, you know,

472
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,260
I think I said this to him in that
interview, but you know, comedy,

473
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:40,071
I think it's Mel Brooks,

474
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:44,210
it's in comedy is tragedy plus time and
you have to be able to look back and

475
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,000
make fun of you of these things.
And I think bart,

476
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,080
with partly as long as you know,

477
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,790
we're talking about this
in the context of Nazis,

478
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:53,220
that's why there's a lot of Jewish comics
because there's a lot of tragedy in

479
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,790
the, in the story of the Jews.
And it's like, all right, well,

480
00:25:55,791 --> 00:26:00,080
you could either be dead or you can
learn to understand your history and what

481
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:03,980
happened and make fun of it
to sort of own it again. Um,

482
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,040
and I think that that's just
one way of coping and that's,

483
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:11,000
and if we don't have comedy, I don't
know what we have. Yeah. Uh, let's see.

484
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:14,450
Have you ever heard the song
politically correct by Sr 71 it's great.

485
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:15,740
20 years ahead of its time.

486
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,630
It read the social trajectory and speaks
uncannily to what is going on right now.

487
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:23,120
I haven't heard it but I will
keep this question up here guys.

488
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:26,630
Don't delete that one so that
I can check it out later. Um,

489
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,633
let's see.

490
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,930
Jordan Peterson is often mentioned that
the left is essential and important to

491
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:37,820
stem portrait, a potential tyranny of
hierarchies of competence. I'm wondering,

492
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,970
do you think that Jordan's audience can
acknowledge this is important to this?

493
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,700
A great question. Jordan has such
nuanced and compassionate perspective.

494
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:45,990
I'm curious if the audience,

495
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,430
his audience resonates with this nuance
or are they more attracted to the

496
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:53,820
critique of roasting the left? It's a
difficult question to answer I guess,

497
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,680
but interested in your
thoughts and perspective.

498
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,040
You might win best question of the day
cause that's, that's seriously good. Okay,

499
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,180
so in essence what you're saying there
is when Jordan critiques the left,

500
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:05,480
which is, which is sort of
the red meat for the audience,

501
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:09,270
is that what they're really into or is
it when he does this more nuance thing,

502
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:13,080
which is that we need a healthy left
the way we need a healthy, right.

503
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:16,230
Because as he would say,
they cause a tension between each other.

504
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,880
And that tension is,

505
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,990
is sort of where a society should live
so that it doesn't tilt one way too much

506
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:26,220
or tilt the other way too much. Yes. I
think they really, really are into that.

507
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:30,750
The red meat, he doesn't do things for
applause lines. Like, um, you know,

508
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,460
he doesn't do just the easy things
like get up there and be like

509
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,680
feminism or not. He never does
that. He never does that. Um,

510
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,970
as a matter of fact, one of the things
that I'll say to him sometimes is, uh,

511
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,060
you know, sometimes he'll get a
big laugh on something and I can,

512
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,330
sometimes it's intentional.
Sometimes it's not intentional. Um,

513
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,510
but he always will talk right through
it because his intention up there is not

514
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,910
to get laughs. And then when I
go up there and then I, then I,

515
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,690
my intention is to get labs and mess
with him and have fun with the crowd. Um,

516
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,920
but his intention is not for the audience
reaction is intention is truly to

517
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:08,130
expand what his thinking is. And I
watched this guy doing it every night.

518
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:11,700
It's pretty freaking awesome.
Um, so as your question,

519
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,200
one of the way he describes this is that
you need this healthy left and right

520
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,540
the way you would want a
relationship in a marriage.

521
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,870
You wouldn't want to beat your
wife and an argument, let's say,

522
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,840
because then you're the
winner and she's the loser,

523
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:26,280
and then you're married to a loser.

524
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:31,281
What you would want is that you could
prove a point so and then sort of offer a

525
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:34,560
handout and say,
we can fix this together,

526
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,650
and you would hope that that's the way
the other side would treat you as well.

527
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,440
I sense that a lot of people
are into that nuance. I mean,

528
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,870
I think that's sort of what's
happening with the IDW. It's right.

529
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:45,190
We're not just saying, look, we're
all frustrated with the left.

530
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,430
Most of us come from the left.
Some of us,

531
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:50,970
like Brett and Eric and Sam still still
believe they believe they're on the left.

532
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,140
I can't honestly say that anymore. I
see a much healthier center, right?

533
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:59,310
These days I see a much more interesting
and rich and politically diverse group

534
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:03,990
of Libertarians and conservatives these
days and former liberals or classical

535
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:08,410
liberals or former progressive that are
making a really wide tent and better

536
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,550
really interested in discussing ideas.
That's what I see and I'm,

537
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,260
I'm very comfortable with them.
Well,

538
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:15,330
I'd be glad to talk to those
people on their side, of course,

539
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,440
but basically that you need these
two healthy sides that have nuance,

540
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,670
that have tension with each other because
otherwise if you break this thing,

541
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,370
then you got one sort of tyrannical side.
And guess what? Look, I know that, uh,

542
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,080
you know,
most of you guys watching this right now,

543
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:34,050
you're at your other classical liberals
generally are your libertarians or

544
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:35,940
conservatives.
Um,

545
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,950
but you don't want to wing to the point
that there's no opposition because that

546
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,960
opposition is what is the sort of gestalt
of what a healthy society is made up

547
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,640
of. Um, so I do think people
are in on it for the nuance and,

548
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:55,330
and he's given it to him. He really is.
He's not doing the red meat stuff. Um,

549
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,760
let's see. Uh, do you ever
fear of the IDW being hijacked?

550
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:02,710
Example,
you can all have conversations,

551
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,850
but now what do you have conversations
about? Can the tolerance go too far?

552
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:09,640
A good question and there's a
little bit of a follow up. Uh, Dave,

553
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,040
I just want to tell you that you were
awesome and Bray at this week and it was

554
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,750
great to meet you. Oh, this is
a different question. All right,

555
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:17,420
I'll get to that one in a second. So do
you ever a fear of the ITW being hijack?

556
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,880
Look, it's, it's tough because
what are we exactly like,

557
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,720
you know, are we, are
we a political movement?

558
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,300
I think there's probably
some legitimacy to that,

559
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:31,270
but we're not a political party
or we a publishing company.

560
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,420
Are we a road touring group?
Are we a podcast network?

561
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:38,740
Are we a youtube replacement? Are we all
of these things? Are we a news network?

562
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:40,600
I mean,
who nobody really knows.

563
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,910
I promise you we're having a
lot of discussions about this,

564
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,580
but in terms of being hijacked,
look, I could see some,

565
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:49,570
I see sometimes now mainstream
trying to hijack some of these ideas,

566
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,910
but I don't think you can fake it.
We have,

567
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:56,050
we have been in the primordial stew,
uh,

568
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,440
with you guys for years doing this.
And I don't think you can fake it.

569
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:04,441
And the things that we see and believe
and talk about our real and authentic and

570
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:08,410
these people, I promise you
guys, these people, I look,

571
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:12,940
I've done plenty of TV shows.
Almost everyone that you
see on a generic TV show,

572
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,300
they are that on television and
there's something else in real life.

573
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:19,720
And you can even see it when the
cameras go on something changes in them.

574
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:24,520
And there are a different person, um,
these, this crude. It's not, it is,

575
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:29,410
it is the real deal. And maybe
look, maybe it could be a,

576
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,690
maybe it could be hijacked in some way
that, you know, who knows, maybe tomorrow,

577
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:39,490
like CNN announces they have a show
with their big thinkers and maybe they

578
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:42,940
grabbed one of the ITW people. And throw
a lot of money at them and whatever.

579
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,480
I'm just not that worried.
And it's almost like I just look,

580
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:50,140
I'm just doing what I think is right and
I'm going to keep doing it and I think

581
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,590
we can fix some of this stuff and I think
we are fixing some of this stuff so.

582
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,500
So that's it right there. Um, Dave,

583
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,960
just want to tell you that you were
awesome in Bray at this week and it was

584
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:01,810
great to meet you. I brought three
friends with me and we all had a blast.

585
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,310
The Weinstein brothers were great.

586
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,490
Also will probably come and again in
January to Irvine and bring a few others.

587
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,830
Keep it up. It's not a question,
but I appreciate it. Yeah,

588
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,630
I think we're really doing something
different and I'm so, it's awesome.

589
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,410
So I'm like,
when I meet you guys after,

590
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:16,110
and especially when I meet
the Patriot on people,

591
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,850
it's like you guys are
supporting what I do and I, I,

592
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:22,240
we showed you guys a great time and you
just laugh and it's not that serious.

593
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:26,290
And we make fun of all of this nonsense.
And I'm a little bit different, you know,

594
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,300
look, it's like when I do
these live streams with you,

595
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,990
I'm a little bit different than Dave
doing the interview and I assure you when

596
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,110
I'm doing comedy I'm a little
bit different than, than
Dave doing this right now.

597
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,460
It's just like a different,

598
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,790
it's like a different frequency that
I'm operating at. So I'm glad you came.

599
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,850
And thank you for, uh, coming. And
for those of you just tuning in,

600
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:48,851
I will be at the San Jose Improv on
November 28 and there will be at least one

601
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:54,110
IDW member, uh, come in.
Let's see. Uh, Hey Dave,

602
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,800
how is it that you were the one who ended
up being attached to Peterson and his

603
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,090
tours?
FYI,

604
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:02,510
my podcast partner and I made it to one
of the shows in Seattle months back and

605
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:06,980
of course, love every second of it. Keep
up the inspirationally profound work. Um,

606
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,840
so the way this whole thing started was,

607
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:13,841
you may remember last January I
had Shapiro and Peterson in studio.

608
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:17,420
And by the way, I'm doing a live
stream with Peterson and Shapiro again,

609
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:21,950
and we're going to cover all new ground
on November 30th. So keep that in your,

610
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:25,310
uh, in your pocket on
your calendar. But anyway,

611
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:29,720
I had them in studio last January and
that night Jordan was doing his first ever

612
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,070
theater show.
Uh,

613
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,320
the book had just come out and they
were just kind of testing it, like,

614
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:35,630
could he sell out a theater and
what would it be like and all that.

615
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,450
And as he was walking out the
door, I said to him, Hey Jordan,

616
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,700
do you want me to open for you
tonight? I'll, I'll warm up the crowd,

617
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:44,060
see what happens. And he's just
like, yeah, Dave, come on down.

618
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,560
I don't know what kind of
Peterson impression that
was. Um, but anyway, he said,

619
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:53,000
come on down. Anyway, we do the show.
It's at the Orpheum here in la downtown.

620
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:54,290
It's about 2000 people.

621
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,670
And I just did a bunch of jokes about
Jordan and about lobsters and all of these

622
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:03,050
things. And the crowd just absolutely ate
it up. And then we did a Q and a after.

623
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:06,800
So basically I do stand up,
Jordan does an hour and a half or so,

624
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:10,330
and then we do some Q and a together
for another 45 minutes. And uh,

625
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,640
Jordan's agents were there and
they immediately were like, Whoa,

626
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,470
we got to do something with this.

627
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:19,760
And I signed with them like two or three
days later, maybe a week later. Uh,

628
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:23,090
and then we decided to do this tour
and I gotta tell you it's, it's a,

629
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:28,100
it's freaking fantastic. It
really is. Um, let's see.

630
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:31,100
Have you invited Barry Weiss on the
Ruben report? She would be interesting.

631
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:34,010
I have invited her many times.
She has said she's going to do it.

632
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,980
We haven't been able to
coordinate the thing in La, uh,

633
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,020
partly because of my travels,
I think part of the cause of hers.

634
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:42,590
But we will make that
happen at some point. Um,

635
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,770
what do you think of attempting to brand
these folks that are attacking free

636
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:50,300
speech as illiberals in particular in
particular using that word whenever

637
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:54,380
referring that to them in order to
distinguish between them and classical

638
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:58,340
liberals that many of ourselves
consider us to be. That's interesting.

639
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:01,550
So that's like saying it's a little bit
of those sort of regressive left thing

640
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:06,140
like these people are not progressive
for progress because being for progress

641
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,750
would mean that you're for
equality for everybody,

642
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,080
not equity are for equality
of opportunity for everybody.

643
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,920
These people are regressive.
They want us to regress.

644
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:19,220
They want us to go backwards and
start looking at people based on their

645
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:20,330
immutable characteristics,

646
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:23,990
their sexuality and gender and
skin color and the rest of it.

647
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:28,160
And that is not progressive. That is
regressive. So illiberal it's good, right?

648
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:30,170
I mean I've heard,
I've obviously heard the word before,

649
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,430
it's good because they are not liberal.
Liberal in its,

650
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,980
in its essence means live and let live.

651
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,460
It means you believe in the individual.
You believe in individual rights.

652
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:43,500
You believe in a light
touch of the government.

653
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,670
This is the reverse of what progressives
are who believe in the collective.

654
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,250
And they believe that the
government has all the answers.

655
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,410
They believe that the
government gives you rights.

656
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:54,300
I don't believe that the
government gives you rights.

657
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,010
I believe you person watching
this right now, you are born free,

658
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,180
you are born free.

659
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:03,150
The government can protect your rights
and it can take your rights away.

660
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:06,670
But it did not give you those rights. It
is your human rights. This is where, uh,

661
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,510
someone on the more conservative side,
if I had Shapiro or Prager,

662
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:11,760
one of those guys, they would
say, these are God given rights.

663
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,930
I would say they are, they
are rights by the, by the,

664
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,810
the fact that you are a human makes
you free. You are born for human.

665
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:23,580
It doesn't matter if
it's God given or not.

666
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,790
You are free and someone can
take that away and lock you up.

667
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,740
They did not give you your freedom. No Man
gave you your freedom. You are free. Um,

668
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,390
and they don't,
they don't believe that.

669
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,840
They believe that the government
gave you those things. Um, so I like,

670
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,750
I like the word illiberal, you know, it's
like one of those things. It's like, look,

671
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:43,860
I had those two years when this was all
bursting forth originally where I said

672
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:47,490
regressive left all the time because so
many people realized there was something

673
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:48,630
wrong with the left.

674
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,830
And the and modularized came up with
the phrase regressive left and it's so

675
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:53,760
captured.

676
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,290
It was an easy way of explaining to
people what this segment of the left was.

677
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:02,370
Now I would argue that segment of the
left has no almost encompassed the entire

678
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,140
world cleft.
It's almost everything,

679
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:07,350
media and political establishment
and the whole thing,

680
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,350
but I don't say regressive left anymore.

681
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,350
It sort of was becoming a little redundant
and a bit memorable. Um, and, and,

682
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,010
and I didn't want it to be a pejorative.

683
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:19,290
I wanted it to be something
that identified something.

684
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:22,200
And I think we've really did that.
We really did do that.

685
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,640
And not only do we do that,
but I,

686
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:27,570
but I'm really proud to say that people
talk about classical liberalism now,

687
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,400
and I think I was one of the people,

688
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,810
if not the really the first person in
this space that got people starting to

689
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:37,080
talk about that again. And then of
course I did that Prager u video,

690
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,730
why I left the left and I am mapping,

691
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:40,680
I think it's their number
one video of all time.

692
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,980
And I think it woke up a
lot of people. So, you know,

693
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:48,840
I wouldn't want to use any of these
phrases as pejorative as to just mock.

694
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,600
But if it's, if it's a phrase,
if you say, if someone,

695
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,240
if you're in an argument with somebody
and they're telling you there are liberal,

696
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:56,710
but therefore all these illiberal
policies, you say, you know,

697
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,310
you're not a liberal,
you're in a liberal and here's why.

698
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,180
Well then I think that's a
pretty effective. Let's see.

699
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,640
Um,
for God's sakes,

700
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:10,050
how can we get Eric Weinstein to post
more on his youtube channel four posts in

701
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:13,650
eight months. There are squirrels with
Warren posts. What can you do to fix this?

702
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,580
I will,
uh,

703
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,330
well I've spent the last two days with
him doing stand up and some other stuff.

704
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,850
Uh, I'm sure I'll see him
in the next couple of days.

705
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:24,060
I will tell him this and he will
not out be out done by a squirrel,

706
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:28,980
I assure you of that much. All right,
we got about 20 minutes left guys. Um,

707
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,470
let's see.
Um,

708
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,070
do you enjoy studying science?
That's outside of politics,

709
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:40,090
learning for learning's sake. All right,
so let me do it with the second part.

710
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,620
I do like learning for learning sake. You
know, I think one of the coolest things,

711
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:47,920
if I've done anything right in this world,
um,

712
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,170
is that I get to learn every week.

713
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,900
So I just yesterday
interviewed Bret Weinstein,

714
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:57,901
which were posting next week and this
guy is a wickedly brilliant evolutionary

715
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:03,520
biologist and he was put on the map
obviously because of what happened at

716
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:03,971
Evergreen.

717
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:07,000
And he and his wife no longer have jobs
and had to move out of the town that

718
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:09,130
they love.
And I don't want to give too much away of,

719
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,210
of where they're at now because you'll
see it in the interview next week. Um,

720
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,240
but we did sort of half the interview
on what happened to him and what his

721
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:17,920
future is,
but then the other half,

722
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,650
and we did about an hour
and a half together on,

723
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,790
on evolutionary biology and explanations
of all of the things that are seemingly

724
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,110
out of whack these days.

725
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,480
And this recent talk that he had with
Richard Dawkins and what they think, how,

726
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:34,980
where they think that evolutionary biology
bread thinks they forked at a certain

727
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:38,970
point and what he thinks Dawkins gets
wrong and what Dawkins gets right. I mean,

728
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:42,960
the fact that I get to sit with these
people or get to tour with Peterson or get

729
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:44,670
to, you know, uh,

730
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,410
listened to Eric Weinstein talk
about mathematics or whoever it is.

731
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:53,280
It's like I learn every week. So
in a way that is learned it. Look,

732
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,730
it's learning for learning's sake.
I happen to be doing it on a show.

733
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,790
I happened to be doing it on
something that now has become a,

734
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,350
a small production company.

735
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:04,140
And that that is a profitable
business that I'm super proud of,

736
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:07,410
that it's allowed me to buy a home and
build a studio here in all of these

737
00:40:07,411 --> 00:40:11,580
things. And, and we're completely fan
funded, which is freaking amazing. Um,

738
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,980
but I do consider most of it learning
for learning's sake if that's possible.

739
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,920
It's like,
it's really cool.

740
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:20,340
Like I get to be around really
cool people and not only that,

741
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,610
but then when I go out and I do these
public events and then I meet you guys and

742
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:23,941
people,

743
00:40:23,941 --> 00:40:26,880
people give me books and they write
these incredible letters and all of these

744
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:30,280
things. And it's like, we're,
we're doing something guys.
Let's, let's keep doing it.

745
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:33,720
And, and what we need more of you
guys to do is share these videos,

746
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,120
is tweet about these things,
is get,

747
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,100
get your friends and families
to know these ideas. Um,

748
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,520
because that's how we really can change
these things. And I, and I think we're,

749
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,660
we're actually doing it.

750
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,110
Yeah.

751
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,410
Um, do you have a fear that
has tech companies veer left?

752
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,910
Do you think things will progress beyond
shadow banning and d platforming to

753
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,850
outright hostile advocacy
against competing views?

754
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,210
I mean this is sort of like the question
of like how much worse is it going to

755
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:02,290
get before it gets
better? And yeah, I mean

756
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,160
it seems that, you know, look, they can be
platform, they can screw with algorithms,

757
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:11,920
they can get rid of likes,
they can get rid of follower accounts,

758
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,770
they can do all of these manipulations.
But it's like,

759
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:18,700
what are the next hostile moves?
And what I would say here is it's like,

760
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,470
forget what you think.
I've said this before,

761
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:24,130
but it's like Alex Jones as
an example. It's like, look,

762
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,620
you may think the guy's
views are all horrible.

763
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:29,860
He said some horrible things about
Sandy Hook and a bunch of other things.

764
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,980
It's like, there are plenty
of horrible people out there.

765
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,130
Go look at Louis Americans Twitter and
tell me that what he's saying on any

766
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,460
given day in the videos that he's
posting aren't probably worse than uh,

767
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,880
what Jones was saying everyday or that
Hamas who is committed to the destruction

768
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:49,490
of all Jews on earth, uh,
has a Twitter account.

769
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:53,500
So those guys were allowed on there.
But Jones can't be on Facebook or on,

770
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,840
on youtube or on any of these
things. Again, I'm not even,

771
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,090
it's so boring to make this about Jones.

772
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm not even talking about him
specifically, but it's like, look,

773
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:05,040
if they can take out one person, they
can take out anybody. And the Pete,

774
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:09,650
the type of people who want to take
people out are not people who ultimately

775
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:12,710
believe in freedom. And again,
this is not a defense of Jones,

776
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:15,230
but it's like of Jones specifically.

777
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,780
But it's like if the type
of people that do this,

778
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:20,960
it's not like they take one person out
and then they're suddenly like, wow,

779
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,620
we're good to go. We want to get dinner.
No, it's like, oh, we moved a lot.

780
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,110
And how can we move that
line a little bit further?

781
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,500
And then you see what happened to
bench pure or the last couple of days,

782
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:31,640
I think it was Ohio state.

783
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:35,840
He goes there and these
people are chanting that he's
a Nazi in this ridiculous

784
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:39,950
bullshit and he's an Orthodox Jew
and they're calling him a Nazi.

785
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:44,030
And then there's this great video by this
guy, I think his name is Joe Flakka, uh,

786
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,910
where he's interviewing these kids that
are protesting Shapiro and he gets the

787
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,680
Migraine. But well, what
don't you like about venture?

788
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,380
And they don't even know any of his views.
And it's like,

789
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,290
it's become this,

790
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,300
this leftist monster and I monsters the
only word that makes sense to me around

791
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:02,720
it as become an infection
in young people's minds.

792
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,340
Unfortunately where they're protesting,

793
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,050
they don't even know
why they're protesting.

794
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,530
They're protesting because
they believe that victim hood,

795
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:14,030
but it's not even just victim of
that perceived victim hood is virtue.

796
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,500
Edit is not virtue. Guys, what is
virtue? Every movie that you love,

797
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:19,940
think of your favorite movie right now.

798
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:21,710
Think of the great adventure
movies of all time.

799
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:24,320
Luke Skywalker didn't look for someone
else to blow up the death star.

800
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:27,230
He went ahead and did it. You know
what I mean? Frodo didn't be like,

801
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,090
oh we're doing is the ring.
Where's the ring?

802
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:32,000
You could somebody take this ring and
get it to your door and drop it in the

803
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:35,630
thing for me. No, he did it. He didn't
just sit there as the victim. He,

804
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,830
it's everything. Neal, what
a neo do you know an Eeo did?

805
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,120
All of these guys,

806
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:45,500
every movie it's like everyone comes
from something and some of us come from

807
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:48,470
shitty or things and some of us were
born with more and some of us were born

808
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:51,440
less than some of us got to limp
and some of us are this color,

809
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:54,410
that color and this sexuality and
that cause none of it matters.

810
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,700
Get you've got your free. If you live
in a Western society you are free.

811
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,180
And if you're afraid to say what
you think in a Western society,

812
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,790
and we were in a bunch of countries
in Europe and Sweden in particular,

813
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:06,800
where people are really
afraid to say what they think.

814
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,390
Well do you think that your silence is
going to somehow make it better? No.

815
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:16,190
There are plenty of bad people who will
take your silence and only use it to

816
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:20,180
make more people be silent. So you
better fight for what you believe in.

817
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:23,690
I don't think I'm anyone special other
than for some reason I feel like I can

818
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:27,950
talk about this stuff and it
hasn't stopped me yet. And,
and you know what? Yeah,

819
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:31,770
it's Shitty when, when
these awful journalists and
they're journalists, they're,

820
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:36,720
they're, uh, they're, well, it's Candizolv
and says their hit men. Um, you know,

821
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:39,660
when they, they're activists though, is
what they really are. They're masking,

822
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:43,500
rating or masking and masquerading
as journalists. Uh, yeah.

823
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:45,570
It's not fun having them
write these things about you.

824
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:47,130
And I know none of you
would ever want that.

825
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:49,350
And I don't like it when it happens to me,
but you know what?

826
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:52,350
We're all still here. Peterson's
still here. Everybody's still here.

827
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,820
That's been through this, this thing.
And you'd be through it too. Uh,

828
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,700
but everyone has to think
about their own life, how,

829
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:01,650
how they will and you responsibly
hopefully in seriously. Um,

830
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,850
but as Douglas Murray said, you
know, uh, when you get in the pool,

831
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:09,960
you might find out that the water is not
that cold. And I think that that is it.

832
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,350
Everyone's afraid of jumping in.
But if you actually just put your foot in,

833
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:16,890
you might find that it's actually more
okay here. And you might find that, yeah,

834
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:18,090
you're going to lose some friends,

835
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:21,780
but you're going to make better friends
and you might find that you feel better.

836
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,270
You physically feel better because you're
being more honest with yourself. Uh,

837
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,840
and I,
and a slew of other things.

838
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:29,610
So get out there and fight
for what you believe in.

839
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,760
Even if you believe in things that I
don't believe I would be all for you doing

840
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:34,140
that.
Um,

841
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,280
how do we begin to translate the important
message concerning individual liberty

842
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:40,110
that you and Jordan are doing to politics?

843
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,800
Individual Liberty is not represented
on the, on the traditional left, right?

844
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:47,340
Political scale. Yeah. Well
there hasn't been a great, um,

845
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,410
there hasn't been a great, let's say
stance for the individual in a long time.

846
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:56,640
Like Rand Paul talks about the individual
because he's basically a libertarian.

847
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,190
Uh, um, what's his name?

848
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,910
Paul Ryan would talk about the individual
quite a bit and I know he was really

849
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:04,530
influenced by Iran.
Um,

850
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,180
but there isn't a real fighter for the
individual the way that there should be.

851
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,441
Um,
you know,

852
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:14,250
as more and more of the left goes to
the identity politics thing and as the

853
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:18,450
Democrats won, uh, just two weeks ago
there they've realized, well, all right,

854
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:20,550
well this may be,
is a winning strategy now,

855
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:24,240
so they're going to only go in on it more,
which is why I wanted them to lose,

856
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:26,130
I wanted them to lose because I thought,
all right,

857
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:30,570
if they lose maybe then the
more extreme set of Democrats,

858
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:32,730
the Democratic Socialists
would be washed away.

859
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:35,850
And then some decent liberals
that used to exist would,

860
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:37,170
would magically appear again.

861
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:41,640
Maybe a JFK could appear again and then
that that could actually be a decent

862
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:44,460
democratic party against something
that I could probably be part of again,

863
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,640
et Cetera, et cetera. Um, but there is no,

864
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,630
as they've done that the Republicans
haven't done a great job or the

865
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:56,631
Conservatives or whatever on the right
have not done a great job of really

866
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:01,740
explaining why the individual is the
root of a free society and that we should

867
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,550
only care about individual rights and
we shouldn't be giving to this group and

868
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:07,230
taking from that group
and things of that nature.

869
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,870
This is a winnable argument
because it's a clear,

870
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:13,620
clean argument and it's the most human
argument there is because every one

871
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:16,920
watching this, everyone listening
to this, you, me, everybody,

872
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,280
we would only want to be
judged as individuals.

873
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,530
None of us are sitting
or no one sitting there.

874
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,440
If you're watching this and you're black,
you're not sitting there going,

875
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:28,320
I wish I could be judged the way
all other black people are judged.

876
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,860
They're a good,
bad black people.

877
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:33,220
There were bad black people there would
use bad Jews. Nice Muslims mean Muslims.

878
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,940
Everybody, you know, great gay people
or gay people, everything is out there.

879
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,990
And so that's why when these people say,
I'm for women.

880
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,890
So Mark Hamill, who's Luke Skywalker, and
you guys know my feelings on star wars,

881
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,140
he tweeted out this thing
the other day about this,

882
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,600
that we should have all women in politics,

883
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,560
but he doesn't really mean that because
you don't mean you want Nikki Haley and

884
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:57,640
Sarah Sanders, uh, Sarah Huckabee,
Sanders and Republican women.

885
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,170
You mean you want women who behave as
you want them to behave. And that's the,

886
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,510
the,
the silliness and the foolishness.

887
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:08,740
And the lazy thinking of
collectivism is that you can't,

888
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,750
if I'm for gay people really,

889
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,800
are you four Republican gay people
or you're for gay people who are into

890
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:18,430
firearms and who happened to be prolife?
No, you're not into those gay people.

891
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,720
So to say you're for gay
people is actually, that's
actually sort of offensive.

892
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,510
Say you're,

893
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:27,160
I'm for certain things and
certain individuals happened
to be for those things,

894
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:31,920
but I'm for women. And then the
new thing is that if you're the,

895
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:35,290
that there was this real push after the
election from the left against white

896
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,360
women and the women's march was teaching,

897
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,690
we're going to have to teach white
women and it's like, oh, really?

898
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:44,350
Do we just have to bow to you forever
because we have different political, uh,

899
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:49,150
thoughts. Oh, it's gross. It's actually
greets gross and racist guys. Um,

900
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,350
let's see here. Uh, we got
about nine minutes left.

901
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,730
I want to get to as many as possible.

902
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,000
I would love to have you interview some
of the climate change scientists who

903
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,430
would challenge MSM
mainstream media narrative.

904
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,980
Have you talked to Mark Stein about that?
You know,

905
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,640
we were in touch with Mark
Stein for awhile and I did
Gutfeld show with him once

906
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:09,940
about a year ago and then it
just kind of fell apart. Um,

907
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,950
so I don't know where that left off,

908
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:15,790
but I'll ask my guys after this and
I'm sure we can make that happen. Um,

909
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,590
let's see.
Uh,

910
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:20,800
do you think the increase in California
fires can be partly caused by the

911
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:22,990
numerous red tape regulations to protect,

912
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,150
to protect trees from humans? Uh, I
don't know enough about the specific,

913
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:33,060
I mean, I feel like this is a slightly
trolling question perhaps. Um, we,

914
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:35,850
we don't know exactly what caused these
fires yet. From what I understand.

915
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:40,240
I think one of them, maybe
it was a campfire. Um, look,

916
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:43,360
a little of this is just nature.
Nature does things now also,

917
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:45,490
we've been in a crazy drought here in la,

918
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:49,690
so I moved to La in February
of 2013 so it's not even that,

919
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,960
it's just about six years.
If I tell you guys that in,

920
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,850
in six years,

921
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,610
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I
would say we've had 20 days of rain,

922
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,320
like real rainy days. We've had, you
know, some drizzle here and there.

923
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:06,460
There was a couple of years ago,

924
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,860
we had like four days in a
row where it really rained,

925
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:12,100
but I don't know that we've had more
than 20 days of bringing ballparking.

926
00:50:12,101 --> 00:50:16,690
It basically, I mean, we're in
a pretty dry, pretty dry, uh,

927
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,850
time.
We're in a drought and you know,

928
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,830
when you drive through the
hills here in Los Angeles,

929
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:24,100
there are times when when it's rained
a little bit and everything's green,

930
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:27,070
and then there's times when everything
is just dry and it's like, man,

931
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,320
you could set fire to everything
just like that. And then, you know,

932
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,020
there's so many houses in
these odd crevices and hills,

933
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,650
and then the way these Santa Ana
winds blow where once the fire starts,

934
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:39,230
it blows it on too.
I mean,

935
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,470
it's literally blowing embers
over there when this was,

936
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,700
when they talk about jumping highways.
Um,

937
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,940
I don't know enough about it specifically
related to regulations and everything

938
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:51,080
else, but I don't think everything can
just be solved by government regulations,

939
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,050
obviously. Uh, and I don't
think everything can be solved.

940
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:59,060
I think nature is pretty freaking
powerful. Um, so yeah, that's that.

941
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,730
That's my thought on that.
Um,

942
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,740
California seems to be at the
past the point of no return.

943
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:10,130
What do you think would have to happen
for a peaceful political remedy to the

944
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:14,780
left? This bottomless pit.
The state is in. I don't know.
It's weird. I mean, look,

945
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:18,950
we have super high taxes here. I don't
know that we get a ton for them. You know,

946
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:22,640
our, our mayor, our governor
now Gavin Newsome, uh, is uh,

947
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,150
is as far left as you can get.
He was the mayor of San Francisco.

948
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:27,590
San Francisco is kind of gross.

949
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:30,500
They have literally have an APP that
tells you where human poop is so you don't

950
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:32,870
step in it.
The last time I was in Berkeley,

951
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:37,320
our car got broken into on a nice street
and they stole my bag. When my, uh,

952
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,440
sister-in-law's,

953
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,230
or when my brother in law's parents
were visiting from out of the country

954
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,530
visiting Berkeley about a month ago.
They got mugged in broad daylight.

955
00:51:45,531 --> 00:51:50,060
They literally tore his mom's rings
off her finger, broad daylight.

956
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,040
Um, so, and I can look, we
go to Seattle when I've been,

957
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,140
now that I've toured the whole country,

958
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,520
when we go to the cities
that are more progressive,

959
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:02,000
those are the cities where there are more
drugs and more crime and more homeless

960
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:02,960
people.
It just is.

961
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:06,740
That is just a fact when I've gone to
the cities that are more conservative,

962
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:10,280
Salt Lake City, Dallas, things like
that. They're beautiful. They're clean.

963
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:12,530
It seems like the economy's
you're strong there.

964
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:17,420
You don't see as many homeless people.
W I mean it all adds up to something,

965
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:20,030
doesn't it? So I, so what can
happen in California? I don't know.

966
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,790
I do know that there is a growing,
uh,

967
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,940
conservative libertarian
movement here in California.

968
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,910
I don't know that it's really
getting a lot of momentum,

969
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:33,230
but when I had John Casick on who's the
governor of Ohio who ran for president,

970
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:36,770
obviously he was meeting with Arnold
Schwarzenegger and a bunch of other people

971
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,640
and look arms. Schwarzenegger was
the governor, believe it or not,

972
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,650
of California not too long ago. And
he was a republican. So, you know,

973
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:44,870
these things ebb and flow.
Um,

974
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,990
but I do think it's possible
that eventually, you know,

975
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:51,500
California will tax out all
the good people who will
just leave and they'll move

976
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:56,300
to Florida and they'll move to Arizona,
New Mexico and Utah and Colorado and,

977
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:59,960
uh, and then who knows what will be
left here. I can also tell you this, uh,

978
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:00,741
just from living here,

979
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:04,280
there are way more homeless people here
now than there were when I moved here.

980
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,440
I don't know what that exactly means.

981
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:11,120
I don't know exactly how all of those
policies that have been put in by,

982
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,920
by democratic and left the politicians
of, uh, laid all of that out.

983
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,180
But you know, we shall see. Um, let's see.

984
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:23,930
You have an open invitation to the
weekly wake up county libertarian party

985
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:28,110
meeting in Raleigh. I will keep that
in mind. Thank you very much. Um,

986
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:34,260
let's see. Uh, Dave,

987
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:38,160
I keep seeing these new laws regarding
gender and sexuality and morality.

988
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:41,490
How can people keep track of what's
legal and what's illegal anymore?

989
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:44,130
Things could be changing
so fast. Um, I, well,

990
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:46,860
I'd want to know exactly what laws
you're talking about specifically.

991
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,020
What I will tell you is, uh, is,

992
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,040
is one of those interesting things that
happened to us during the tour was that

993
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,260
Jordan and I both had
sort of circled a den, uh,

994
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,080
Sweden as,

995
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:01,920
as sort of an interesting stop because
for us on my youtube channel here,

996
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,820
the fifth most watched
country, uh, is Sweden,

997
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:08,190
which is really interesting because
there are not a lot of people in Sweden.

998
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,340
I think there's around 12 million people.
So it's a pretty tiny country.

999
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,480
So us is number one, then it's UK and
then it's usually Canada and Australia.

1000
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:18,720
They, they flipped between
three and four and then, um,

1001
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,980
Sweden and I, you know, I've had a
couple of Swedish people on the show,

1002
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:23,910
which I think is part of it.

1003
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:26,970
Aaron flamme who is a very
popular comedian and I met
him there and he's a great

1004
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:28,020
guy.
Uh,

1005
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:31,620
and I've had a Tino Sanandaji who's an
economist who I had on mostly talking

1006
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:34,860
about immigration. These are both a long
time ago. Tino is a couple years ago.

1007
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:38,520
Right. Um, anyway, um,

1008
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:42,030
we both sort of circled Sweden as cause
cause Jordan gets a lot of mail from

1009
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:44,690
there. We thought what's
going on in Sweden, so a,

1010
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,020
the shows we did two shows in Sweden,
they sold out in like five minutes each.

1011
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,530
The crowds were phenomenal,
like endless, endless cheering.

1012
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:55,530
They were so great. My need and
greets after were absolutely packed.

1013
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:57,690
It was just such an interesting,
cool group people.

1014
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,220
But the reason I bring this up,

1015
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,570
it related to your question is I thought
that most people when we do the Q and a,

1016
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,030
we use this app called Slido.

1017
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,200
When people submit questions
and people can up vote things.

1018
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:08,370
And then with Jordan's onstage,

1019
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,340
I go through the ones that I think are
the best and I pick interesting ones.

1020
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,050
I pick funny ones,
I pick off the wall ones,

1021
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:15,660
they pick heartfelt one's
personal stories, whatever it is.

1022
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,800
And I thought mostly we were going to
see things about immigration in Sweden

1023
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:23,040
because they definitely have
an integration problem. Uh,

1024
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,920
and there were a lot
about immigration but,

1025
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,890
but the vast majority of
questions were gender related.

1026
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,940
Um, and there's, well,

1027
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,060
we'll have to do a show on this
and when I have Jordan and studio,

1028
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:34,950
we'll talk about this a bit more,
but it's really,

1029
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:38,940
really interesting because the Swedes
and the Scandinavian countries in Nordic

1030
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:39,661
countries in general,

1031
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:43,530
I've done egalitarianism really well that
men and women are equal and have been

1032
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:44,730
equal for a long time.

1033
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,270
Sweden right now has a supposedly a
self proclaimed feminist government.

1034
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,340
Men and women are equal completely.
And as this has happened,

1035
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,480
um, what they've realized is that
men and women are still different. B,

1036
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,830
despite equality,

1037
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:03,120
that women are more into people
and men are more into things.

1038
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:06,840
So despite all of the equality
that you would want in a society,

1039
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:08,640
and that's what they have in Sweden,

1040
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,750
that there are still more female nurses
and there were still more male engineers.

1041
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,500
So it's like they ran the
experiment of equality.

1042
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,240
We're going to treat everyone equally.
Men and women can do whatever they want,

1043
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:22,830
everyone can live as they wish. And
yet still there are, there are jobs,

1044
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,740
vocations that women want to do and that
men want to do. And that just is so,

1045
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:28,960
it's like the social
justice warriors of Sweden,

1046
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:30,610
which are now very
embedded in the government,

1047
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,960
aren't letting the experiment of humanity.
They did the experiment.

1048
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,200
How can we do it? Let's keep
it, make everyone exactly equal.

1049
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,220
That's what everyone should want. Well,
we did it and now they've got the result.

1050
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:44,470
They've got the, they did the
experiment, they got the results,

1051
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,080
but they won't let them have the result
because they don't like it because there

1052
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:51,250
were still more women that are nurses
then and there are still more men that are

1053
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:53,780
engineers.
So they want to engineer a society.

1054
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:56,170
So you'd end up having people doing
things that they don't want to do.

1055
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:59,860
So would it make more, would it be
a better society if you had 50, 50,

1056
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,480
or exact proportion, uh, male nurses
and female nurses and exact proportion,

1057
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,340
male engineers and female energies?
I mean,

1058
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:09,280
does anyone think that would be
a better free or happier society?

1059
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:13,120
Know that would very clearly be a worst
tyrannical, authoritarian society.

1060
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,110
So it's really interesting
stuff over there. And I'll,

1061
00:57:15,111 --> 00:57:17,620
I'll talk to Jordan about
it when we have men. Anyway,

1062
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,220
I didn't get to everything here,
but we'll keep some of these uh,

1063
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,330
catalog and we'll get to them next
week or next month. Um, so yeah,

1064
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:29,230
if you haven't joined patrion.com/ruben
report and if you join at level one,

1065
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,380
I take all patrion on questions here.
We also do group chats,

1066
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:33,910
which I was doing all day,
small chats.

1067
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:35,590
Sometimes there's three
or four people in groups.

1068
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,430
Sometimes there's 15 or
16 people in, um, uh,

1069
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,340
there's all sorts of other rewards you
can get free meet and greets to my stand

1070
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:42,790
up events and all that good stuff.

1071
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,820
I will be in San Jose at
the Improv on November 28th.

1072
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:50,740
You can go to Dave rubin.com/events.
I'll be at the Irvine Improv in January,

1073
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:55,330
um, at the Orpheum here in la on
a December 1st with Jordan, uh,

1074
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,120
Jordan and Ben in studio on November 29th.

1075
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:02,560
I'll be in Calgary and Vancouver first
week of December with Jordan. What else?

1076
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,230
Hawaii with Jordan the
day before thanksgiving.

1077
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,920
I'm literally flying there that morning
and leaving that night, which is bananas,

1078
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:12,370
but you know, you're just do what
you've got to do. And uh, what else?

1079
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,780
I think I'm at the University of
Montana first week of December also,

1080
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:17,650
and a whole bunch of,

1081
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:20,000
and then we're going to be in San Diego
and a whole bunch of other things in

1082
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,020
January. Whew. That's a lot
of talking. All right. Thanks
everybody. Appreciate it.

1083
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:28,270
Remember it's patrion.com/rubin report
if you want to get in on this and we are

1084
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:32,020
fan funded and all that good stuff and
I'm not going to talk to the rest of the

1085
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,670
day. All right. Goodnight everybody.
