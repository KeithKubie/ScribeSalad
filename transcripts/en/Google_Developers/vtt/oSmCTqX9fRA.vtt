ANTHONY MAYS: Welcome to
"Engineering Everyday Equity."

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.930
My name is Anthony
D. Mays, and I'm

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.270
a software engineer on the
data visualization team

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.300
here at Google.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.570
Today we have Lea Coligado.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.080
So nice to have you
here today, Lea.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.900
LEA COLIGADO: Thanks so
much for having me, Anthony.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.750
ANTHONY MAYS: In
today's episode,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.333
we're going to talk
about how to build

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.600
inclusive practices into your
product development process.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.630
And we're going to talk over the
next few episodes specifically

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.970
about the design process
and the design sprint,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.154
and how you can think about
inclusion at that stage.

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:33.570
And today we're
specifically going

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.700
to talk about the planning
phase and about how

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.570
to think about
equity, diversity,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.044
and inclusion from day one.

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:41.460
So Lea, it's so great to have
you here to talk about this,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.740
and to share your knowledge
and expertise with us today.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.781
If you can just take a
moment to tell me a little

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:46.911
bit about your background.

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:48.660
LEA COLIGADO: So I
actually just came back

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.710
from giving a speech to
Google Women Engineers Summit

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.670
on intersectional feminism.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.650
I am a software engineer on
Google's local search team.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.280
I'm also the founder of
a diversity blog called

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.870
"Women in Silicon Valley."

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.670
I do a lot of
diversity inclusion

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.580
work because I'm the daughter
of Vietnamese and Filipino

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.730
refugees.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.550
And actually, for a
long time, I didn't

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.430
want that to identify
me, because I felt

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.700
like I was punished for it.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.230
But now I see my diversity
as essential to bringing

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.840
my cultural identity
to work and making sure

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.300
that the people who are
like me and look like me

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.180
are being included
into product decisions.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.480
And so I'd like to learn more
about your background, what

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.190
motivates you to do this work.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.981
ANTHONY MAYS: Sure.

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:31.590
And thanks for
sharing that with me.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.205
As a black man and
as a Christian,

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:35.580
I could really
identify with some

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.330
of the things that you
were talking about,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.399
diversity inclusion
every day, both in terms

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.940
of the products that
I help to build,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.320
and in the interactions that
I have within the tech space.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.530
Sometimes it can be
difficult as a black man when

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.420
I, for instance, need
to proactively think

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
about how visible my badge
is to ensure that I'm not

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.270
more aggressively badge
checked than other people are

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.101
for being on campus.

00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:57.600
And then there are
times when I need

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.480
to worry about or think
about maybe disparaging jokes

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
that someone might make about
my faith as a Christian,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.200
or about religion in general.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.050
And so as I think
about those things,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.780
it drives me to want to
think about these topics

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.250
and how to make
sure that tech is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.720
more diverse and
inclusive in terms of,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.360
again, how we
build our products,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.400
and how we work with
each other as colleagues.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.900
LEA COLIGADO: I
think before we talk

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.030
a more about equity
diversity inclusion,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.875
we should probably try setting
up and defining our parameters.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.500
ANTHONY MAYS: Yeah,
that's a good idea.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.810
So first, let's
talk about equity.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.030
Equity denotes
fairness, and makes

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200
sure everyone has access
to the same opportunities.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.120
In that fairness,
equity recognizes

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.970
that because advantages
and obstacles exist,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.400
everyone doesn't start
from the same place.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.100
Pursuing equity begins
by acknowledging

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.530
that unequal playing field
and continues to course

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.260
correct and address
the imbalance.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.330
The next is diversity.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.420
Diversity, by definition,
is about variety,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.630
the presence of difference
within a given setting.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.790
Studies show that
a team that hails

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.300
from a diversity of backgrounds,
beliefs, and experiences

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.730
can approach the same issue
from many different angles.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.960
So by building diversity into
your organization and dog food

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.710
process, it will help
guarantee a wider base is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.050
considered for your product.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.120
And the last is inclusion.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.910
Inclusion isn't just about
the presence of diversity.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.890
It goes farther
to ensure everyone

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.290
feels valued and welcomed.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.260
As Verna Myers, a thought
leader in the inclusion strategy

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.220
space, puts it, "Diversity is
being invited to the party.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.981
Inclusion is being
asked to dance."

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.980
LEA COLIGADO: So would
you say that means equity

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.749
is about switching
who takes the lead?

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.290
ANTHONY MAYS: Well,
I'd say it's more

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.910
about ensuring
that everyone feels

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.590
empowered to do the asking.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.229
So now that we've
laid the groundwork

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.770
for these fundamental
concepts, let's

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.754
talk about the design process.

00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:50.420
And as I think about
the design process,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.836
there's a story
that comes to mind

00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:54.420
about this app that was in the
process of being developed.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.670
And it involved allowing
people to silence

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.539
their phones by tapping on it
while it was in their pocket.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.830
Now as a guy, I don't see
any problem with this, but as

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.630
a woman, do you see any issues?

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.215
LEA COLIGADO: Yeah, very few of
my pants have pockets sewn in.

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:08.340
ANTHONY MAYS: All it took
was one woman in the room

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.520
to identify an issue that
could have potentially impacted

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.830
50% of their
potential user base.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.660
And so as you think
about the design process,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.860
are there things that
you've encountered

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.980
in your past experience?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.540
LEA COLIGADO: Yeah, I've
seen a lot of the effects,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.330
positive and negative,
of design thinking.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.390
For example, when I was
a student at Stanford,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.700
I took this awesome
senior project class

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.570
where all the teams were
commissioned to build apps.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.420
ANTHONY MAYS: OK.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.760
LEA COLIGADO: And so because
most of the engineers,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.550
if not all, were Stanford
students, a lot of the apps

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.580
we produced were social
media or marketplace

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.780
apps, which assume things like
leisure, time for leisure,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.920
or disposable income.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.380
ANTHONY MAYS: Right.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.690
LEA COLIGADO: So
these apps fizzled,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.940
while the teams that tried
to represent the community

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.760
outside of Stanford and
do field studies actually

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.010
addressed real community needs.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.470
Another example I can
think of in the real world

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.590
is when I joined Google
full-time, a startup popped up

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.720
in San Francisco that
claimed to replace the mom

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.630
and pop corner shops that we
often see on street corners.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.725
Clearly, little design thinking
was infused into this app,

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:12.100
because otherwise
they would have

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.170
known that San
Francisco has a really

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.250
long, controversial relationship
with gentrification,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.670
and by claiming to gentrify
these mom and pop stores that

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.040
were often run and founded
by people of color,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.222
this app crashed and burned,
because it got a lot of uproar.

00:05:28.222 --> 00:05:28.930
ANTHONY MAYS: Ow!

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.101
Yeah, I can totally
imagine that happening.

00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:31.600
All right.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.359
So we've talked
about a few examples.

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:36.650
Obviously, we don't want to
repeat those same mistakes.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.130
So how about we talk about
building inclusiveness

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.972
into our own hypothetical
app and getting that started?

00:05:41.972 --> 00:05:43.180
LEA COLIGADO: It sounds good.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.407
Tell me more about this app.

00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:46.990
ANTHONY MAYS: I have an app idea
for something called Scholar.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.330
And it's an app that connects
matriculating high school

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.430
students with colleges and
scholarship opportunities

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.470
based upon campus size,
preferences, study programs,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.520
things of that nature.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.560
So for me, I care
about this a lot

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.190
because, as confusing
as it was for me,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.140
I'd like to take
that confusion out

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.720
of the process for the next
generation of technologists who

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.400
are looking to get
into tech and pursue

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.790
their educational dreams.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.700
How can I start
thinking about inclusion

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.770
from the very beginning
of designing this app

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.646
that I want to build?

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:17.478
LEA COLIGADO: Well, one
thing we want to do,

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:19.290
Anthony, is create a
challenge statement

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.430
to build the inclusivity
into our app.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.962
What do we have currently
for our statement?

00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:24.670
ANTHONY MAYS: OK.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.520
So in 2018, I want
to build an app that

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.320
connects college
students with colleges

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.900
and demystifies the
application process.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.610
LEA COLIGADO: That's
a really good start.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.100
How about let's take it
further and say something like,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.130
in 2018, we want to
launch an app that

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.730
matches colleges and demystifies
the college search process

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.589
for first generation students.

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:45.380
ANTHONY MAYS: Sure.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.610
Cool.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.109
All right.

00:06:46.109 --> 00:06:49.120
So now that I think we have
a good working challenge

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.340
statement, how can I
ensure that the team

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.119
stays focused on executing?

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:55.160
LEA COLIGADO: Well, there
are a couple of things.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.340
Let's make sure that
stakeholders and execs

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.250
are all on board to build
inclusivity into our project.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.240
ANTHONY MAYS: OK.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.115
LEA COLIGADO: Have them
reiterate to the team

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:04.782
that it's a value
that they share.

00:07:04.782 --> 00:07:06.740
The challenge statement
is actually not enough.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.198
So we're going to
need team members

00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:10.510
to reinforce each other,
reiterate each other,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.077
and keep each other accountable.

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:13.660
One thing to note,
make sure we're not

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.580
putting the burden
of representing

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.740
a certain marginalized
group on someone

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.140
on your team who represents
that marginalized background.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.980
So for example, as a
woman of color who's often

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.170
been the only woman
of color in many teams

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.540
I've worked on in
tech, I was usually

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.720
the go-to for all questions
pertaining to either women

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.100
or to Asian people.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.410
So while I'm happy to
help, it can be difficult

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.660
bearing the brunt of
representing all women

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.430
or all Asian people.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.960
ANTHONY MAYS: How
do you personally

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.464
advocate for people who are
perhaps different than you are?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.880
LEA COLIGADO:
Everyone should just

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.790
care about diversity
inclusion at face value.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.389
But unfortunately, that's
not always the case.

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:52.930
So as a woman of
color, what's helped

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.450
me is when an ally
steps up to the plate

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.960
and explains the benefits of
including my demographic, when

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.370
it was too
emotionally burdensome

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.120
or draining for me to explain
why my demographic should

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.712
be included when it
wasn't at face value.

00:08:06.712 --> 00:08:07.420
ANTHONY MAYS: OK.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.987
So there's ally-ship.

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:10.570
Are there are some
other things that I

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.550
can do for the team to
make sure that we're

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.870
continuing to think on this?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.400
LEA COLIGADO: One thing
is lightning talks.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.816
We want to make
sure that everyone

00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:19.241
who is present at the
sprint is diverse.

00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:20.740
And so how are some
ways that we can

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.080
ensure the building of your
app and that the people

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.649
in the room building it
reflect our user base.

00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:28.190
ANTHONY MAYS: That's
a good question.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.481
Well, the first thing that
comes off the top of my head

00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:31.520
is the fact that--

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.550
well, the challenge statement,
where I want to build this

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.299
app for first generation
college students.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.262
So it probably would help if I
had one or two first generation

00:08:39.262 --> 00:08:41.220
college students talking
about their experience

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.051
and about how they
were able to connect

00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:45.300
with schools and scholarships.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.220
So sound good to you?

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.220
LEA COLIGADO: Precisely.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.500
That's a great idea.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.070
ANTHONY MAYS: So let's just
summarize real quickly.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.920
We talked about the meaning
of equity, diversity,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.770
and inclusion.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.270
We also talked about what it
means to have a great challenge

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.350
statement.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.230
We talked about executive buy-in
and the importance of support

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.960
from leadership.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.900
We talked about ally-ship,
which is really important.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.960
And lastly, we talked about
how to hold inclusive lightning

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.680
talks and about having people
from diverse backgrounds who

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.860
can share their perspectives
and experiences.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.371
Thank you for watching.

00:09:15.371 --> 00:09:17.620
If you'd like to continue
the work of building equity,

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.700
diversity, and inclusion

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.040
check out the link in
the description below.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.600
If you have questions, leave
those in the comments as well.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.245
And lastly, make
sure to stay tuned

00:09:27.245 --> 00:09:28.620
for our next
episode, where we're

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.240
going to talk about
the understanding

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.560
phase of the design process.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.680
And let me leave you
with this last thing.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.440
If you do not
intentionally include,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.410
you will
unintentionally exclude.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.360
