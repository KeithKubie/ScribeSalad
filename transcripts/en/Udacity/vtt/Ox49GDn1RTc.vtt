Well so if I look at my own chromosomes here I, I

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.730
see the red regions are only on chromosome ten and the X chromosome.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.570
So I would say that those are the two chromosomes that actually have

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.460
bits of information on them DNA

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.190
that originated in the Sub-Saharan African region.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.670
&gt;&gt; And, and that is, you know, not

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.210
necessarily a generation ago or, it's probably a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.510
little while ago and you know, could be hundreds of

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.889
years ago that you have ancestors who were living in Africa.
