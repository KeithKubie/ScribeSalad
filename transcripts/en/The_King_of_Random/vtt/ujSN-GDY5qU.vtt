today we will show you something

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.400
how to cut an apple faster and better

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.240
you should cut it upside down because it stays in place that way

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.060
try cutting tick tack toe style

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.320
its faster and will stay together with a rubber band

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.720
