00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.720

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.680
 And improve the quality of our Android apps 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.480

 To strengthen the technical aspects 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.120

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.240

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.400
 Breakdowns and assessments 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.720
 This allows us to closely monitor the performance of our applications 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.000
