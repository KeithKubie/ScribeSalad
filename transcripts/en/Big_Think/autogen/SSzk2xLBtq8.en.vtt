the beginning one of the things about

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700
the beginning one of the things about
 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.430
the beginning one of the things about
goal-setting that makes me a little

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440
goal-setting that makes me a little
 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.840
goal-setting that makes me a little
crazy is that people always think it's

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850
crazy is that people always think it's
 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.900
crazy is that people always think it's
about looking into the future looking to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
about looking into the future looking to
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.700
about looking into the future looking to
5 10 years into the future and knowing

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
5 10 years into the future and knowing
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.280
5 10 years into the future and knowing
that's what you're going to get and then

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
that's what you're going to get and then
 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440
that's what you're going to get and then
they just set off without any clue about

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
they just set off without any clue about
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.630
they just set off without any clue about
where they are right now and you know

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
where they are right now and you know
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.819
where they are right now and you know
just in terms of simple cartography you

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
just in terms of simple cartography you
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.139
just in terms of simple cartography you
can't get anywhere if you don't know

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149
can't get anywhere if you don't know
 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.840
can't get anywhere if you don't know
where you are now so for me when I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
where you are now so for me when I
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.370
where you are now so for me when I
started off it was a question of looking

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380
started off it was a question of looking
 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.799

the thing about plans is that they tend

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109
the thing about plans is that they tend
 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.989
the thing about plans is that they tend
to go wrong at certain stages you tend

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999
to go wrong at certain stages you tend
 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.599
