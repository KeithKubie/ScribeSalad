Speaker 1:          00:01          Every cancer is a case of clonal evolution. Evolution is involved in every single patient who develops cancer. No. Cancer evolution is a different kind of evolution in the sense that it is short sighted and it's selfish. The clones originate through mutations and then they compete for resources and for space within the patient. Two of the key genes that are involved, or p 16 in [inaudible] 53 they control, so the cell cycle in Dna repair among other things and damage to DNA repair increases mutation rate.

Speaker 1:          00:46          The greater the genetic diversity in a tumor, the more likely that it will progress to malignancy. So cancer evolution is not something that is passed from a parent to an offspring with very, very few exceptions. There are, there's a tumor in Tasmanian devils and there's one other that can actually be transmitted, but 99.99% of all cancers are not passed from parents to offspring. Their entire evolution occurs within the body and the lifespan of a single individual human being. The revolution is short sighted because they die with their hosts. Here's selection is operating on cell clones over. No more than about 40 to 50 cell generations. And that's not enough selective events to produce any precise adaptation, but it can produce a rough adaptation to a local environment. So a metastasis to the liver, for example, can have different characteristics in a metastasis to along, and you can show that those differences have something to do with those two environments.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:56          This lovely picture is from Charlie, none. Somatic evolution is actually orthogonal to germline evolution. So this green tree down here shows births of, for example, your birth, the birth of your children, the birth of your grandchildren, and then each individual looks like a tree. These are all of the somatic cells that are growing up out of the single cell of the Zygote. And a cancer is going to be a branch or a twig on one of these trees. It's produced by competition among clonal lineages generated by somatic mutation,

Speaker 2:          02:41          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:41          And these lineage to let these lineages are extremely genetically heterogeneous and that's been detected with many methods. There are changes that range from nucleotide sequences and methylation patterns to chromosome numbers. Cancer cells are

Speaker 2:          03:00          competing for nutrients and to evade. The immune system and the genetic variants that are better at those functions increase in number and frequency. So there are two very important things going on here. One is that there's a huge amount of genetic diversity being generated and the second is that that genetic diversity is being trimmed and shaped by competition. So it's a standard micro evolutionary scenario where genetic variation is the fuel for a selection process. The

Speaker 1:          03:35          two genes in which mutations are particularly important are p 16 which is all so called CD K and two a. This is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor. It produces two splicing variances. One of them inhibit CDK four kinase, which is important for cell cycle progression and the other stabilizes p 53 by sequestering a protein that degrades p 53 p 53 producers, a transcription factor that regulate cell cycle and also suppresses tumor formation. It can activate DNA repair proteins, it can arrest the cell cycle when it recognizes Dna damage and you can initiate a pop ptosis if DNA damage is likely to be irreparable. Interestingly, people who inherit only one functional copy of the TPMT TP 53 gene will almost certainly developed tumors in early adulthood. This is a disease known as Li Fraumeni Syndrome. More than 50% of human tumors contain a mutation or deletion and the TP, 53 g clonal expansions of p 16 and p 53 lesions have been found in cancers of skin, long breast, head, neck, bladder, brain, kidney, prostate, colon, stomach, and esophagus. In other words, these two genes are found to have mutated in a very wide and important range of cancers,

Speaker 1:          05:09          expansions of these in clones or signatures. That natural selection is favoring clones that have mutations in these genes. And so here are papers that you can look up documenting such expansions of p 53 and p 16 in skin, lung, breast, head, neck, bladder, brain, kidney, prostate, colon, and stomach cancer. An important finding is that the genetic diversity in a pre malignant tumor predicts progression to malignancy. So Barrett's Esophagus is a condition of inflammation on the esophagus that predisposes for a cancer called Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. Carlo Maley and his collaborators used measures for species diversity from ecology and evolution to measure how genetically diverse these clones in Barrett's esophagus war. They used numbers, different clones, the Shannon index of diversity and genetic divergence, how genetically different than mutants were. And all three of these measures predicted the patients that were more likely to develop cancer. So here is the incidents of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.

Speaker 1:          06:29          So that's the cancer resulting from Barrett's Esophagus as a function of the genetic diversity of the, uh, inflammations of verus found in Barrett's esophagus. This is the number of years the patients were followed up. And what you see on the graph is the message that the patients that were in the upper core tile for genetic diversity, embarrass Esophagus, uh, we're also those that have the highest incidents of esophageal Adenocarcinoma. Those that were in the lower three core tiles were much less likely to progress to cancer. So the genetic diversity of the conal system instead of evolving cones, which is providing the fuel for natural selection, is also a predictor of how likely those clones will result in full on cancer. Let's take a look at what clonal evolution looks like and how it looks in cancer. So here is a picture of clonal evolution in general. You'll note that clone a though.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Basically what you see is how much of space is being occupied by a clone. Here you have cone, a Columbian. See clone a is competitively superior and it is excluding clone, be in quote and see. And it's also including excluding clone AC. They all pop up, but they disappear because they're out competed by A. However, a B is superior to a. And so when the bee mutation arises in a cell that already has a, it spreads and excludes the others. However, the best combination is a, B, and c. And when the c mutation arises in a clone that already has a and B, it spreads notice. Then the clone a has interfered with clone ac and it's slowed down the spread of the scene. Mutan because the sea is not effective until B has come along. If we now look in Barrett's esophagus here, the orange background is uh, in indicating a region of tissue where there is the inflammation of Barrett's esophagus.

Speaker 1:          08:45          The Gray mutants are neutral. They pop up and disappear. Then a p 16 Mutan arises and it spreads and takes over a neutral Mutan pops ups in a disappears. Then there is a p 53 deletion. However, the p 16 Muneton out competes the p 53 deletion. The p 16 then gets to munes. It's now homozygous for deletions of p 16 it spreads and takes over and within that background, a p 53 deletion arises. It is within that stem, that set of cells that have both the p 16 double deletion and a p 53 deletion that esophageal adenocarcinoma arises. You notice the two pictures look fairly similar. In other words, clonal evolution is going on and there is a process of colonial interference that can be documented in Barrett's esophagus and you can also see that you need a sequence of mutations to get to full on cancer.

Speaker 1:          09:48          So this view now has become standard. The idea is that there are normal cells. Then there are what are called driver mutations. So they're viewed as being causal in the spread of cancer, but it takes a sequence of them until you get a most recent common ancestor of a cell that expands and it's clonal lineage managers to take over and out of this expanded clone come some that conform distant metastasis. So this is now become a standard view of cancer. It's, it's a process of clonal evolution and requires a series of mutations and at a certain time point a mutation will occur which allows metastasis. So to summarize, cancer starts when a combination of germline and somatic mutations produces cells that slip out of cell cycle control, increase in numbers, and acquire the ability to move and to insert themselves into tissues. Cancers are genetically heterogeneous sets of clones that are competing with each other for resources and space. This is critical. This is a critical part of how we visualize what a cancer is. It's not a single thing. It's a genetically heterogeneous set of clones. Competition among the clones generates natural selection that favors clones that can grow faster. They can disperse in the kin, invade this evolution is short sighted and selfish. The cancer is going to die with the patient. It is not transmitted to offspring.
