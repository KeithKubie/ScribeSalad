1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:05,480
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, January 19th. No,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,980
January 9th, sorry, 2017.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,470
January 9th, 2017. You know,
that's how bad I am at math.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,010
I can't even fucking say that date.
Right. Um, how's it going? How are you?

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,970
Oh, the summer wind.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,840
It came fucking blowing in
because of global warming.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,470
It's fucking cold for about
two weeks and then it's hot.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,910
My fucking house is gonna Melt
and then it'll slip into the sea.

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,080
I don't give a fuck that it's
snowing and Massachusetts.

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,070
[inaudible] Hey, what's
going on? What's going on?

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,350
It's already getting hot
as fuck out here. Um, Joe,

13
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,300
you should be a meteorologist. Yeah,

14
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:05,020
it's going to be hardest
fucking fucking Los Angeles. Um,

15
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,040
how are you? How's it going? Are you out
there? You're fighting the good fight.

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,990
You're trying to be a better person.

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,640
You're trying to turn around your
fucking childhood. Well, join the club.

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,660
Had a little setback yesterday,
you know? Oh, all fucking knew.

19
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,930
Billy was running around and old
Williams showed up listed age, just I,

20
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,930
you know, whatever. I just got to keep
fucking, you know, moving forward,

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,040
you know, moving forward like
the Celtics and the Bruins. Okay,

22
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,680
we're not winning championships this
year, but you know, we're trying,

23
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,070
all right, I'm not going to get rid of
all of my anger in fucking two weeks,

24
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,950
but you know, if you can just
chop away even a half a percent,

25
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,210
you'll be a half a percent better
GTA than you were yesterday.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,380
Jesus Christ, you know, it's fucked up,

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,530
is knowing that you fucked up and then
actually really analyzing yourself and

28
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:03,060
you're like, Whoa, I didn't
know it was that deep. Um,

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,980
anyways, so what do you do?

30
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:07,800
What do you do when you know you're
fucked up and you can't really fix it?

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,390
Then Day, what do you do? Well, you know,

32
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:13,980
what you do is you fucking crack open a
bear and you watch some goddamn sports.

33
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,970
That's what you do to distract yourself
from all this shit that's going on.

34
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,590
I love this whole fucking story about
the Russians hacking into the fucking

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,540
democratic national fucking convention
committee, fucking websites and all that.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,020
All these fucking Hillary supporters. Yay.

37
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,470
It's why you fucking Trump was
able to eke it out. It's just like,

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
I can't even fucking,

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,850
I can't listen to any. And then you look
at the Trump supporters, they're like,

40
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,760
what's the big deal?
It's just the Russians.

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,400
The bottom line is you either give a
fuck or don't give a fuck about what the

42
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,910
Russians allegedly did
or didn't fucking do,

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,700
depending on whether you wear
a blue or a fucking red tie.

44
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,980
And I love how in the end of all this,

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,310
like I was supposed to
listen to the fucking CIA.

46
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,200
Like they don't have an agenda. Everybody
in this story has a fucking agenda.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,840
So it's like, all right, who the
fuck do I listen to? You know,

48
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,280
good fucking Lord.

49
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,610
Do you think Obama would give a shit
if the hacking led to Hillary winning?

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,860
We'll, uh, we'll do something, uh, when
the time is right and blah, blah, blah,

51
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,940
blah. Why? Because the lady
with the Blue Bra lost.

52
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:36,430
What if she won Obama? When,
then what the fuck would you do?

53
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,770
You'd ride off into the sunset,

54
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,760
getting ready to do your fucking speeches
for fucking 300 grand to clip to the

55
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,340
exact people that get you in the
White House. It's all, I can't,

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,960
that's why watch sports.

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,880
That's why I watch sports because other
than a couple of mobbed up refs here or

58
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:56,320
there, you know, it's pretty fair.
It's about as fair as it can get,

59
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,700
which means it isn't fair.

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,990
So anyways, um,

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,750
I love that people don't like that Trump
is friends with, uh, Vladimir Putin.

62
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,550
[inaudible], Putnam,
Putin, him, you know, that,

63
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,260
that not being friends with the Russians
the first time didn't work out too well

64
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,430
with the whole thing almost blew
up in our face. So, uh, you know,

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,550
why don't we try to hold hands this time?

66
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,640
I don't know. I, this is,
I don't get into politics.

67
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,000
I think war should be illegal.
I think war is literally,

68
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:38,680
it's the temper tantrum of the fucking
Illuminati and then everybody else has to

69
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:41,020
pay the fucking price. You know,

70
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,700
and those rich loafer wearing cuts will
never step one foot into a battlefield.

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,370
Uh, you know, the I, they all
make the fucking money off.

72
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,510
It's just a bunch of fucking bullshit.
And when are they going to grow up?

73
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,250
I love how I can't go over my
fence and just take a bat out in,

74
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,950
beat the fuck out of my
neighbor because of, I dunno,

75
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,340
whatever the fuck they did. You know,

76
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,330
the apple trees on their property and I
want the apples on my fucking property

77
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:12,331
and I can't just fucking try to force
them to fucking give me their apples and

78
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,420
when they don't, I can then just fucking
come up with an idea. I don't know,

79
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,990
some sort of angle of bullshit that I
tell the rest of my neighbors and I go

80
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,110
over there and I fucking smash up his
house and kill a few people in it.

81
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,060
I don't, why can't, I can't do that on
a fucking local level. But as a country,

82
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,360
countries can do that to one
another. It's just fucking beyond me.

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,730
They can't sit down at a
fucking table and hash it out.

84
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,180
Give us the oils. No,

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,760
sit there at the table for fucking years.

86
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,880
Just doing different
reeds. Give us the oil. No,

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,050
I'm all right.

88
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,900
There's my fucking wingnut fucking
conspiracy theory horseshit full.

89
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,220
You're right out of the gate. So let's
go right back to bread and circus. Okay.

90
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,570
Bread and fucking circus.

91
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,310
You guys watch a the play off play
off fucking football games. Um,

92
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,271
I'll tell you right now,

93
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:16,271
the two luckiest teams in the NFL right
now are the Seattle Seahawks and the New

94
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,400
England patriots. Why you say,

95
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,530
because the other two best remaining teams
in both conferences are going to play

96
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:29,060
each other next weekend. You
know, while the Patriots play the,

97
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,230
the a Houston Texans and the Seattle
Seahawks play the Atlanta Falcons.

98
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,190
Now I'm not trying to disrespect
the Texans or the falcons,

99
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,940
but who's kidding who, if you
see Atul and you got the cowboys,

100
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,110
the packers and the Falcons left,
which is the best game for you,

101
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,250
which gives you the best chance
of moving onto the next round.

102
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,170
Why those fucking dirty
burns down there in Atlanta

103
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,070
with the real housewives and
the down low brothers. Um,

104
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,990
and if in the AFC I would
much rather as a Patriot fan,

105
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,140
watch us play the Texas without JJ. What?

106
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,393
Right.

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,913
Yeah.

108
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,100
Playing a home game while the Kansas
City chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers

109
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,260
beat the shit out of each other. You know,

110
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,760
cowboys and Greenbay are going
to eliminate one of them, right?

111
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,493
You know the deal.

112
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,580
So rather than Seattle having to go
through fucking Green Bay and Dallas,

113
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,010
the only got to go through
one of them and the Patriots,

114
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,770
rather than having to play the
Steelers and the fucking chiefs,

115
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:37,860
we only got to play one of them
thank Christ the way that worked out.

116
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:41,610
So both of us, if we play
the game that we should be,

117
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,760
fuck that we know how to play
should easily, not easily,

118
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,380
but we should make it to the, uh,

119
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,000
to the fucking NFC AFC championship
game and the fucking patriots at a buy.

120
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:54,270
So we're fucking, we're wearing flip
flops to the AFC championship game.

121
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,230
Having said that, I have no idea
who's going to win the Superbowl. Um,

122
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,260
I like many people I think were amazed
at how easily the packers handled the,

123
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,850
uh, the New York football
giants. And as a patriots fan,

124
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:13,620
I did not enjoy that outcome
because I wanted the rematch.

125
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,380
You know, I, I sat dead fucking for
the last five weeks. I want to see,

126
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,590
I want to fight, I wanted the
patriots play the giants again.

127
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,770
I wanted to see if definitively
if the giants just fucking own us,

128
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,230
okay.

129
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,180
You know, for the trilogy or could we
get some revenge? You know what I mean?

130
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,170
That, that's what I was looking
forward to. Um, so, you know,

131
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:43,020
and I also love Eli and I actually
love the giants, believe it or not,

132
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:43,860
as a patriots team,

133
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:47,340
I don't understand like as much
as those two losses were painful,

134
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,890
what is there to hate? They
were a great fucking franchise.

135
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:54,560
They always have a great fucking defense
and a couple of tough years. But, um,

136
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,920
I wanted the rematch. Oh my God, that
would have been huge fucking ratings.

137
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,030
Although rematch patriots, Seattle
could also be a good thing. However,

138
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,050
how many times have we beaten the
Steelers in the playoffs? Playoffs.

139
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,410
We've beaten them up. I don't
every fucking significant. Goddamn,

140
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,250
I don't even know. I lost count
this. Would this be number four?

141
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,350
Um,

142
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,640
so you can't tell me the Steelers aren't
due and I don't know shit about Kansas

143
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,620
City other than people telling
me that they're really good.

144
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:27,710
So it's not going to be an
easy AFC championship game.

145
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,610
And if you're asking me if I'm
looking past the Dallas Texans, uh,

146
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,340
I kind of am, but only as a fan. I
don't play for the New England patriots.

147
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:41,600
So I think the Patriots will be fine
that I'm kind of looking past that.

148
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,370
The Houston Texans going into
New England without JJ Hawaii.

149
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,530
Um, how about that fucking
catch by Richardson?

150
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,410
You probably should say which one,
but that one in the fucking end zone.

151
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:57,590
That was like one of the best catches
I've seen since Odell Beckhams. You know,

152
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,080
it wasn't anywhere near as
good as that, but Jesus Christ,

153
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:03,170
fucking lily reaching around
below the guy, you know,

154
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,850
around his junk past his taint, they
throw a flag for an interception.

155
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,290
You still fucking catch it.

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,900
How many fucking times is
there a flag in the end zone?

157
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,220
And the offensive team gets to deny it
because the fucking wide receiver reached

158
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:20,480
around, you know, that sounds fucking
perverted. But yeah, around the defender,

159
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,220
you know why? Cause I stopped at
reach around, reach around Jack,

160
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:28,610
reach around, fucking
reached around the defender.

161
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,720
They probably teach you that in
broadcasting school. You know,

162
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,810
and one of the main things you have to
look out for other than staying away from

163
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,410
advocacy of domestic violence against
women is when you're going to use the

164
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,460
expression that the, the,

165
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,700
the wide receiver have
reached around the defender.

166
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,340
You gotta get, you can't
pause after a rant.

167
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,840
You gotta go right to defendant reached
around the defender and then continue

168
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:04,550
with your idea. Um, anyways, sorry. So,

169
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,893
um,

170
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,953
yeah,

171
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,520
I don't know. A lot of people thought
some of those playoff games are boring.

172
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:13,550
I know I did. The Steelers dolphins won
it and that was a fucking snooze fest.

173
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:18,110
But it's the early rounds, the early
rounds, everybody's evenly matched.

174
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,320
I think next week's will be a,
we've agreed it will be great.

175
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:24,320
We'll see what the fuck happens.
Who Do you like? Who Do you like?

176
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:28,820
I think a lot of people are on Seattle's
fucking beak as they say, right?

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,340
Everybody's fucking looking at
them like, oh well, you know,

178
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:32,570
they were just there and our,

179
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:36,620
they played pretty good against
the fucking lights, you know,

180
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:39,740
and then Green Bay, green bay been there
and everybody's like, Oh, you know,

181
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,600
fucking all of a sudden here we go.

182
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,400
Aaron fucking Rogers looking like
a beast in the second half. Right.

183
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,490
And then there's other people go,
oh, what about those fucking cowboys?

184
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,070
That's

185
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,580
why I don't fucking watch pre or post
game analysis and probably why you guys,

186
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,040
well actually maybe you shouldn't
fast forward through this because I'll

187
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,020
honestly tell you, I don't know
what the fuck is going to happen.

188
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,670
I have no idea. I don't know what happens.

189
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,490
I haven't watched Kansas City all
year. I just know that, uh, the,

190
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,690
what the Fox is, Andy Reed is their coach.

191
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,980
And the last time I watched them was
the first time I saw him in a red jacket

192
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,040
and he looked like a big fucking
tomato. And I said, you know what,

193
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,660
I'm done with this franchise.

194
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,560
And the only other time I paid attention
to was when Paul Versey kept telling me

195
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,880
that US trading Matt Castle or letting
them go to the chiefs was a huge fucking

196
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:28,714
mistake.

197
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,520
And do you think he ever apologized
for me to me for making that sort of a

198
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:37,510
comment? I don't think he
did. Ah, I don't think he did.

199
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,540
Um, anyways, so I'm just continuing
to try and do the impossible, uh,

200
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:48,541
which is watch every home game of the
Boston Celtics and the Boston Bruins while

201
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,790
sustaining a healthy marriage.

202
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,861
It's not easy.

203
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:01,300
You know what makes it really fucking
hard is the spoons and Celtics a lot of

204
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,480
times play on the same day. And I,
for some reason, never think, well,

205
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,330
why don't you just watch one of them
and then watch the other one on the off

206
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,890
day? That's what I have to do. But I
watched 'em, you know, I watched the,

207
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,070
uh, the selto against, I
taped the Pelican game,

208
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,350
so I watched the Celtics
beat the Pelicans,

209
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:23,190
and then I watched the Bruins fucking
play the Goddamn Hartford whalers via

210
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:28,000
North Carolina. And, uh, every time
we play the fucking hurricanes,

211
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,550
it always goes into the light. We played
them three times in the last month.

212
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:35,350
It always goes into overtime and we
usually, we usually lose to those cuts.

213
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,900
I don't know what it was. We used to
own the Hartford whalers, but every,

214
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:42,370
once they become the fucking Carolina
hurricanes, we always lose to them.

215
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,900
They reminded me of what used to happen
when the Patriots would go into Denver.

216
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,090
We always lost, you know,

217
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,090
granted they had Craig Morton
and then into John Elway.

218
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,620
What do we have? We had Tony
[inaudible], we had Steve Grogan,

219
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:59,530
we could match up, Eh, the,
the orange crush defense.

220
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:00,850
And then John Elway was better than,

221
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:04,330
I'm sorry we gave you is
better than Tony Asen and uh,

222
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,890
but it wasn't still on the draft board.

223
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,580
And I know you think we should've
picked Dan Marino. Well, you know,

224
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,390
we didn't like everybody
else. We fucking didn't.

225
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,780
And you know who paid the price
more than anybody else. Dan Marino.

226
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,350
Cause he went to fucking Miami and
they never got him a running game or a

227
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:23,730
defense. And to this day
people fucking trash them say,

228
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,360
and he couldn't win the fucking big one.

229
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,480
And meanwhile they had to change every
possible fucking rule in passing and tip

230
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,610
it. So totally forward to the fucking,

231
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,530
the scales to the orphans for Dan
Marino's records to finally start falling.

232
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,190
Yeah. I'm a big Damn Marino fan.
Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um,

233
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,590
and I've been watching the, uh,

234
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,070
the Celtics just having a great fucking
time watching both in the broad,

235
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,090
you know, they hang in there,

236
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,640
we were out of the playoffs for
a game playoffs and then we won.

237
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,200
I don't even know who the fuck we beat.
They watched it so many fucking gays.

238
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,910
We'd be buffalo twice and then we fucking
lost to Edmonton and then we'd beat

239
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:07,760
somebody and then we fucking
lost in overtime toe a.

240
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,083
Okay.

241
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,550
So the fucking hurricanes
I believe. I Dunno,

242
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,700
it gets crazy to try to
watch 162 fucking games.

243
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,513
Um,

244
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,950
but anyways, they're both fucking,

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
we play the blues and then the fucking
Celtics got a huge game against the

246
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,190
Toronto Raptors. Now if you're not
watching the Celtics of Boston,

247
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,230
this is all you need to know.

248
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,310
I'm going to read you their wins and
losses and you tell me if you can fucking

249
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:38,990
pick up what's going on. We'll go back
to them beating. They beat the, uh,

250
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,060
all right, here we go. December 16th,

251
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,320
we beat the sh we beat the fucking,

252
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:48,980
okay.

253
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,150
Does that say the Hornets? One of
the Hornets. Stop being the bobcat's.

254
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,250
The Horn is moved to New Orleans.

255
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:58,730
Then they became the Pelicans and then
that name freed up and then the bobcat's

256
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:00,080
like alright, there's really, you know,

257
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,860
not enough bobcat's out here in North
Carolina. Can we go back to horn?

258
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,020
It's cause there mother fuckers are
everywhere. Overalls and shoofly.

259
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,320
North Carolina. All right,
that we beat the Miami Heat.

260
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,540
Then we'd beat the Memphis Grizzlies,

261
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,140
then we beat the fucking Indiana Pacers.

262
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Then we played the Oklahoma
City thunder and we lost that.

263
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,230
We played the next, we beat him.

264
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,610
Yeah.

265
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,230
Then we played the
grizzlies. We beat them.

266
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,230
Then we played the Cavaliers and we lost,

267
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,280
you see in a pattern here that we
beat the heat. Then we beat the jazz,

268
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,140
then we beat the sixers, then
we beat the fucking Pelicans.

269
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,990
And then Tuesday we're playing the Toronto
Raptors. So if you look, we fucking,

270
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:50,290
we beat all the fucking regular
Joe teams lunch pail Larry's,

271
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,950
but we can't beat the cavs.
We're not beating fucking OKC.

272
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,250
And now we got fucking,
uh, we got Toronto.

273
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,980
So I don't know, I'll be very
excited if we fucking, um,

274
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,240
I'd be very excited if we fucking win
that game cause we haven't really beat a

275
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:11,230
contender yet since I've
started to f watching them. Um,

276
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,760
okay.

277
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,593
But anyways,

278
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,860
they're saying the Celtics are like one
fucking player away then not one player

279
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,051
way.

280
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,650
If you really watched the Cavaliers and
you watch the Golden State Warriors were

281
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,180
at least two fucking players away,

282
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,230
the fact that they want to move like
fucking Marcus smart and fucking Jae

283
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,230
Crowder for that white kid who used
to play at Butler for Brad Stevens.

284
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,763
You know,

285
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,220
I'll tell you right now I'm reverse
racist when it comes to fucking basketball

286
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,680
too.

287
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,660
We're going to trade a black guy and
draft picks for a light guy who plays in

288
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:44,350
Utah. I don't know.

289
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,700
Versus he's telling me the guys of
beast, whatever the Hawthorn is,

290
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,730
some shit like that. I don't, I don't
know about hoop. I just started watching.

291
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:54,550
I'm like a fucking housewife that
finally got her Celtic Apron in is stop

292
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,550
making. Hamhocks is peaking
into the living room.

293
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,790
So I don't have no idea what I'm talking
about. All I can tell you is that a,

294
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,320
I'm loving watching the uh,

295
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,140
the games during the Pelicans got
a great fucking announced it too.

296
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,720
I was so pissed. Cause I love
lists at the Tommy Heinsohn.

297
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:09,240
And the other fucking guy who, I
don't know his Goddamn name, I should,

298
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,980
he's been doing the southwest games
forever, but a, the pelting the that,

299
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,020
we'll see that that was the,
the Pelicans and the Celtics.

300
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,890
The pelicans are the Celtics. Um,

301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,810
they actually combined during World
War II, they played the steals.

302
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Um, they got a great announcer,
old school fucking uh,

303
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,350
I don't know, had a lot of
elements of a Vin Scully.

304
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,410
I thought it was a class act. He could
tell he was rooting for the Pelicans,

305
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:41,370
but he gave you, you know, when his team
committed files, he said, all right,

306
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,430
that's a foul. You know,
he wasn't a total homer.

307
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,280
I like guys like that. And I also like
total homers, like Tommy Heinsohn. Um,

308
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,413
alright, I'm going to tell him,

309
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,780
stop talking about fucking basketball
cause that's about as deep as I go. Uh,

310
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,400
let me read a couple of, a
couple of advertisements here.

311
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,820
All set there. Billy, you know,

312
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,800
thought I came out of the fucking
clouds, right? Okay. Dollar Shave Club.

313
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:11,610
Everybody. Oh Jesus. Here we go.
Dollar Shave Club gives you a clothes,

314
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,790
smooth shave and you can't beat
the convenience or the price.

315
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,820
What is, can VR convenient
cause they bring it to you.

316
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:23,100
There's nothing convenient
about shaving and fucking sucks.

317
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,550
And when you were a kid, all you want
to do, you be get old and fucking shave.

318
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:31,230
It's the fucking worst. It's so
ridiculous man that you didn't,

319
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:35,280
you didn't have to shave for
like the first fucking, I dunno,

320
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,340
1314 or 10 if you're one of those
fucking hairy people years of your life,

321
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:45,450
you want at least a God damn decade, 12
years without having the fucking shave.

322
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,870
Although you never know today with all
the horse tranquilizers that they put in

323
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,410
their fucking food. You've seen
kids today. You know what I mean?

324
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,740
There'll be like some fourth grade boy
with a beard talking to some fucking

325
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:58,240
fourth grade girls who's beginning
to have titties. You know,

326
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,380
we'll be there like nine or 10
years old. You just looked at it.

327
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,560
But not those fucking, those little
people know. They've just bring,

328
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,920
just been drinking the milk from the
cows that had been fed or the cows.

329
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:12,760
And that's the result. They make
it a little fucking adults. Um,

330
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,320
you don't have to choose between settling
for a cheap bag of disposables or

331
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:21,321
paying out those out the nose for raises
with a laser pointer and 17 blades

332
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,250
awful than dollar shave club broke
onto the scene with the smarter choice.

333
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,440
Before Dollar Shave Club,
there was no middle ground.

334
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,970
It was either save money and get a
painful shape from a disposables. Uh,

335
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,520
like the ones that give
away for free at the gym,

336
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,860
which felt like shaving
with the piece of glass.

337
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,640
I will tell you going from one blade to
two blade was great. Everything else,

338
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,840
three, four, five is all been
fucking complete bullshit. Um,

339
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,210
two blades is the perfect
one. That's the one you want.

340
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,960
The third blade one became too thick
and you can't get under your cute little

341
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,190
button nose to shave there.

342
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,410
So you've got to start fucking
grabbing and pushing it up.

343
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,710
Giving yourself a pug nose like that
completes fucking Psycho Orange County

344
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,260
wife. When are they going to retire?

345
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:09,190
Those fucking broads every day there's
like, they're like on season 98.

346
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,550
I walked by the TV and I'm like,
that fucking lady still here.

347
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,830
She hasn't gone to the loony bin.
Her fucking nose looks like the,

348
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:22,660
it's like the Lincoln and the fucking,
uh, what's that other tunnel in New York?

349
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,240
Have I, did I move away that
long? It wasn't the Hawthorne,

350
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,240
the Holland. Brooke.

351
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,480
What's the one down there by a fucking
Deniros restaurant to the Holland tunnel.

352
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,700
Jesus. I guess that jokes over,

353
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,210
it's going to say fucking nose looks
like the Lincoln and Holland tunnel,

354
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,750
but you know when you can't remember
the other name of the tunnel bill,

355
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,580
can you just complete the read? Okay.

356
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,910
Dollar Shave Club is the best of
both worlds. You get premium shape,

357
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,510
the dish premium shaped quality
at the disposable shave price.

358
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,150
If you haven't tried dollar shave
club yet, you're missing out.

359
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:57,820
It's an amazing shave
at an affordable price.

360
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,070
There's no smarter choice in the market.

361
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:04,660
And right now they are giving away a one
month trial of any of their razors for

362
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:08,110
only a dollar with free shipping.
And that's an after that.

363
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:10,960
It's just a few bucks a
month. Jesus fucking Christ.

364
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:14,080
Can you just give them the website?
There's no longterm commitments,

367
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,740
Bar I really don't feel like
fucking reading these this week.

368
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,430
How many of these for fuck fucking sakes.

369
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,550
I could never be president. I could never
sit there and read the whole speech.

370
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,310
I couldn't do it. I'd be like,
guys, can we, can you cut this down?

371
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,623
You know,

372
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,940
ask not what your country can do

373
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,940
by you fucking figure out the
rest. Alright, Alex Helix,

374
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,210
you're unique. You know,
walk like everyone else.

375
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,120
Talk like everyone else or
sleep like everyone else.

376
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,880
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

377
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,010
Because it truly customized mattress
will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until

378
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,720
now. Is that true?

379
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,830
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com answer a few
simple questions and they'll run a three

380

381
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,400
Okay.

382
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,970
The poor fucking robots, robots,

383
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,560
fucking people.

384
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,980
A model model model of your body through
the proprietary algorithms they develop

385
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:32,270
with the help of the world's leading,

386
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,930
leading arrogant anomalies
and biomechanic experts. Oh,

387
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:39,920
there's a bunch of big words that must
be a comfortable mattress. The result,

388
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:44,060
the most comfortable mattress you've
ever slept on. There you go. Helix.

389
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,470
Customers report a 30% improvement
in overall sleep quality. Well,

390
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:51,080
how the fuck would you
know you're asleep? Yeah,

391
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:56,060
but my dreams are so much nicer and for
couples, okay, now they're getting, oh,

392
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,540
Jesus need porno music. Now they
customize each side of the mattress.

393
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,440
Is there a side of the mattress and
muffles? Your apartment is snoring.

394
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,120
Your mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% fee.

395
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:13,150
That's why everyone from GQ magazine
to Forbes are all talking about a helix

396
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,090
sleep. You have 100 nights to try
it out and if you don't love it,

397
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:21,050
they'll pick it up for
free. Gross and give it,

398
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,130
give you a 100% refund. No questions.
Ask. Oh my God, that's disgusting.

Go to helix, sleep.com/burn get
$50 off your order. That's helix

400

Ah, here we go. But OPO, boom.

401
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,040
Beyond these me undies, Jayson, and
on a fucking mattress. Do, do, do,

402
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,830
do me undies me on these three
weeks later you can give it back.

403
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,670
Backtracks to those fucking creepy cons.

404
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:51,671
They show up with Hazmat suits and
a couple of bunt fucking cakes.

405
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,180
I don't know what I'm singing about,

406
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,890
but your balls will feel nice
and velvety on your new mattress.

407
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,390
Maybe you shave your balls with
dollar shave club. All right.

408
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:05,750
Picture a world where putting on a new
pair of underwear isn't just fresh.

409
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,240
You're stepping into a
better day. Think about it.

410
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,030
Underwear is the first thing you put
on and the last thing you take off.

411
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,540
Why would you settle for anything less
than the best feeling underwear on the

412
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:18,990
planet? Maybe because you're
satisfied. I don't know.

413
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,190
Maybe cause you don't think about it.

414
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,930
Please include all of the following points
during your read me on these focuses

415
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,350
solely on producing the most comfortable
underwear you've ever experienced.

416
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,690
Flatter, mere Putnam wears him.

417
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,630
He wears him when he hacks into the
Democratic national fucking convention.

418
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,340
And you know what, if Hillary
had been wearing them,

419
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,360
maybe she would've won
the election. You know,

420
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:40,910
I was watching a little bit of the
Golden Globes last night and Jimmy Fallon

421
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:44,180
made a joke about the popular vote
versus the electoral vote. You know,

422
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:47,600
it's so funny watching all these liberals
having a problem with that fucking

423
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,120
like, why do you have a problem with it?

424
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,410
Because you think it's fucked up or
because your person lost. I can't,

425
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,590
I can't fucking like literally
watching that politics shit. It's like,

426
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,300
it's like watching Yankees, red sox,

427
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,740
my friends at me undies sent me a few
pairs a while back and now I can't imagine

428
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:06,620
wearing anything else. Well, I
can't imagine where I can, you know,

429
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:07,910
I have a hell of an imagination.

430
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,050
It really makes each day that much
better for the price of two cocktails.

431

Me undies will deliver your new

class materials that are scientifically

437
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:36,080
proven, scientifically proven to
be three times softer than cotton.

438
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,870
And you can believe that because
modal paid for those fucking

439
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,690
research scientific experiments.
I don't fucking know.

slash bar hey, you know what?

448
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,080
Somebody came up to me the other day,
Bill do two to do it, and they go, hey,

449
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:17,490
did you see that story about
the pit bull? These peep,

450
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,440
this family tried to put
a Christmas sweater on the
pit bull and it fucking just

451
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:26,310
snapped and mauled this woman. And
you know what I said? I said, hey,

452
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,630
did you hear about the Cocker Spaniel?
That bit, that little girl's ear off?

453
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,710
And then the person goes, no, I didn't.
And I said, of course you didn't.

454
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,220
It is. They don't report on it.
All the other shit for instance.

455
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:41,580
So I look up this whole pit bull thing
is once people just go like these

456
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,720
pitbulls man to crazy,
they're licking your face and,

457
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,380
and they love their owner. And then one
day they just kill them in their sleep.

458
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:53,580
All this bullshit. I looked
it up. Okay. Two things. One,

459
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,010
the dog's name was Scarface.

460
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,470
Repeat the dog's name was Scarface.

461
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,420
Number two, they lived in Florida. Okay,

462
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:08,910
can we quit blaming
the fucking breed here?

463
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,620
Jesus fucking Christ.
That poor fucking dog.

464
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:18,180
I can't imagine the abuse that that dog
went through. The dogs named Scarface.

465
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:20,250
What kind of dog do you
think they wanted it to be?

466
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,640
What do you think they trained it to
be? That's what the fuck they did.

467
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,770
Do you know when I was a kid, we had
a west Highland white terrier. Okay.

468
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,850
And me and my brothers teased
the fucking shit out of that dog.

469
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,320
And it bit as routinely bit me in the
face one time. And I almost lost my eye.

470
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,480
You know why? Because we were
horrible to the dog. That's why.

471
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,220
Okay.

472
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,420
If you get a pit bull and you name it
fucking Scarface and you start feeding it

473
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:51,930
fucking raw meat and making
it attack shit, eventually,

474
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,910
you know when you,

475
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:56,910
I guarantee you they abused the
fucking shit out of that thing.

476
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,610
And what happened is when
you put a sweater on a dog,

477
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:03,300
at some point its head is underneath
the fucking material and it probably

478
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,960
flipped out. And then what
happens is you've abused the dog.

479
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:10,140
And rather than it being a little west
Highland terrier that you can push off of

480
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:11,100
your fucking face.

481
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,300
You've done it to a dog that is in a way
class that you cannot fucking handle.

482
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,550
But then what happens is,

483
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,470
is they blame the dog because human
beings are so fucking precious and fucking

484
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,030
make no goddamn mistakes. It's,

485
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,560
it's fucking ridiculous that they
keep blaming those fucking dogs.

486
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,910
And I know what you guys
are, think of what bill,

487
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,280
didn't you just give
away your pitbull? Yes,

488
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:36,900
I did because I understood that I didn't
have the capabilities as a fucking

489
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:41,560
owner because of the abuse that
happened to my dog. You know, my dog,

490
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,430
when I first got it,

491
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:45,970
I picked up a hockey stick to fucking
stick handle in my living room and it ran

492
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:50,080
to the other side of the room and
started shaking uncontrollably. Okay?

493
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,120
I don't know what the other
people did that, but you know,

494
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,690
when you do that to a fucking
dog, you know, I dunno,

495
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,510
I still love pitbulls and I hate that
people come up to me with those fucking

496
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:02,270
stories. I don't give a fuck. You know,

497
00:30:02,271 --> 00:30:04,640
dogs bite people all the fucking time,

498
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,480
all these different breeds bite
people all the fucking time.

499
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,820
Every day a dog bites somebody.

500
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,690
You bringing a fucking animal
into the fucking house. Okay?

501
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,020
And if you're not a good owner and you
don't know what the fuck you're doing,

502
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,170
you could get bit, you get a
hamster, you're going to get bit,

503
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,150
you get a pet snake,
you're going to get bit,

504
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,490
you bringing a fucking
animal into the house.

505
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,030
My whole fucking life
pitbulls were biting people,

506
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,470
but it didn't get brought
up until somewhere in the
nineties when I was growing

507
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:38,010
up. It was one German shepherd, one
Doberman Pinscher after talking to other,

508
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,310
you know, meanwhile,

509
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:44,310
Dalmatians are out of their fucking
mind because they're pure bred yet I,

510
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:47,670
you know, I dunno. All right, let's,
let's get back to the fucking podcast.

511
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:50,910
I just, I don't, I don't
buy into it the same way.

512
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:54,030
I don't buy into the fact that these
people in other countries, you know,

513
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:57,690
just sitting there more evil than what
the fuck is down the street from me.

514
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,710
We're all fucking human beings. Some
of us are good. Most of us are cunts.

515
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,390
You know, I didn't know what the
fuck I'm talking about at this point.

516
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:10,890
All right, let's continue on. Let's
continue on with the podcast here. Um,

517
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,570
as you might've guessed at
this point, still no baby.

518
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,750
So we're still fucking waiting.

519
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,990
We are still waiting on
pins and needles and um,

520
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,690
I am getting to the fucking
point where it's just like, it's,

521
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,760
it's like enough already. It's just like,

522
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,400
it's like waiting to go on
stage in front of a rowdy crowd.

523
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,211
You just want to be like,

524
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:34,260
can you just bring me up already so
I can fucking get this over with?

525
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,600
Um, oh my God. And I become,

526
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:43,650
I become an expert at talking
people out of the vortex of,

527
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,260
um, them give me, giving me advice
about what to do on the day.

528
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,120
Um, cause they just start telling me
their stories and then I'll just be like,

529
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,900
hey, did you see that fucking
nor'easter they just had Becky,

530
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,540
I've got family back east and I just,
I waltzed them out of the conversation.

531
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,670
Um, because I've tried being blunt
with people being like, listen, listen,

532
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,400
listen. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't care.

533
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,140
I don't want to hear your fucking story.

534
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,330
Your fucking story is
not going to help me.

535
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,620
Your story is all about you and you just
talking about yourself in everything

536
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:21,060
that you learned. I don't give a shit.
I've talked to a thousand fucking people.

537
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:24,870
It seems like in every one of you tells
me a different story and a different

538
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:25,830
thing for me to expect,

539
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,740
which makes me feel like every
fucking things a little bit different.

540
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,340
So for the love of God, can
you please shut the fuck up?

541
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:37,120
Can you please stop with
the verbal home videos? Ugh.

542
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,250
I can't wait to be a dad and, and not
tell other people how to be a dad.

543
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,150
That is my goal as a parent.
I probably won't do it.

544
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,720
I'll probably fucking follow the herd
right over the cliff. It'd be like,

545
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:57,260
you know what? You got it though.
Tell you right now. Look out for this.

546
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,873
You know?

547
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,210
Okay.

548
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,340
Do you know this person told
me the other day that fucking,

549
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:05,920
I would never play drums again.
The second my kids sport.

550
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,720
Can you fucking believe how
ridiculous that is? Yeah.

551
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,080
You won't be playing drums anymore. I'll
really, well, you know, fucking, uh,

552
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,610
Dave Grohl plays drums.
He Plays Guitar Too,

553
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,730
and he sinks in a band
while touring the world.

554
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,260
As far as what I've read, he's got a
couple of kids. I think he's doing fine.

555
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,080
John Bonam had a kid when he was fucking
19. His band didn't even make it yet.

556
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,230
He had a fucking kid
before his band made it.

557
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,040
He was a teen dad before MTV and he went
on to become arguably the greatest rock

558
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:45,850
and roll drummer of all
fucking time. You know what?

559
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,630
I think all freckles could sneak in a
couple of paradiddles. What do you think?

560
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,090
You don't even really think about parents.

561
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,770
I think that there's certain people that
know how to be a parent and s and not

562
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:02,250
lose themselves in it and actually still
have a balance in their life where they

563
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,320
, they have a card game
every once in a while.

564
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,140
Obviously your life is has to adjust.

565
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,350
But these fucking people
that just like, they just,

566
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,580
they have no life and they just sit
there staring at their children.

567
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,800
You know honey honey, how you
don't take no, no, no, no, no, no.

568
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,450
They never let their kids fall down. They
don't let them fucking do everything.

569
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,740
They just sit there

570
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,300
like a fucking penguin with that goddamn
egg underneath them except the kids

571
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,100
already bored. I don't
think, I don't know.

572
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,840
I don't want to do that. I don't want
that to be my life. You know what I mean?

573
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:42,850
I think if a kid is inside,

574
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,170
considering that we were cavemen and
we used to have babies and they were in

575
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:52,171
caves and at any point a saber tooth tiger
can come in and fucking just take the

576
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,450
kid from you and then that's it.

577
00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:00,450
The fact that your fucking inside with
with fucking central air heating and

578
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,130
food, you don't have to hunt.

579
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,840
He can go right down the street
and go to the grocery store.

580
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,400
I know I'm oversimplifying this, but
I have, I have to be honest with you.

581
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:13,930
When I talked to other parents, all
they do is just give me anxiety.

582
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,900
I'm so excited for this thing to happen.

583
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,800
And then I talked to people
that have kids and they, they,

584
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,950
they just dump all this anxiety
on you. And I swear to God,

585
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:26,290
I might be reading into this,
but there's like a certain,

586
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,320
like 30% of them that take like a certain
perverted joy and making you feel not

587
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:40,440
feel well about this experience that's
allegedly the greatest experience you're

588
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:45,070
ever going to have. Like they
actually take this perverse joy. Um,

589
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,090
and I think that those people are
actually bad parents because I think, uh,

590
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm, I'm totally guessing here.

591
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,470
I think that they resent their children
in what they took from them and they

592
00:35:55,471 --> 00:36:00,180
still wanted to do blow and go around
and fucking have random sex with people

593
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,000
and they're there. They
never quite got past,

594
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,470
they didn't quite fuck enough
broads or jump on enough Dick's,

595
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,010
I don't know what it is, but I
found it equally with men and women.

596
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:16,011
Like 30% of them will take a perverse
joy in trying to infuse some sort of like

597
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,580
preemptive misery into your fucking life.

598
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,750
Cause I can tell you this right now.
I'm still going to play fucking drums.

599
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,940
I have to, because if I don't, I
will go out of my fucking mind. Um,

600
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,470
I'm not saying I'm going
to play as much as I play,

601
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,790
but to sit there and if you fucking think
that I'm going to sit here with the 71

602
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:39,210
green sparkle fucking Ludwig drunk pit
and I'm not going to keep fucking play in

603
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:43,560
this thing. You know those people out
there who play an instrument. Okay,

604
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:46,140
but you don't make a living off of it
and you stopped playing it because you

605
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:48,450
have a kid. Did you ever
think about maybe, you know,

606
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:52,110
just playing the instrument in front of
your kid and maybe that they'll take to

607
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,170
it or maybe they'll play an instrument
that they could play in the Ted together.

608
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,850
You could have your own little
fucking, you know, good time together,

609
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,690
bonding through.

610
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,440
Okay.

611
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,280
The, I dunno, the wonder of
having music as a fucking hobby.

612
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,520
Who you are hurting. They right now,

613
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,790
you better play that Ukulele.
Cause once that kid comes,

614
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:15,280
you're never gonna play to
me. What is this kid like?

615
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:19,540
Some little Donald Trump and he's going
to fire me as a dad if I continue to do

616
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:23,680
my little rudimentary
on my practice pad. Um,

617
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,830
how about I watch less TV and the amount
of time I spent watching all the Bruins

618
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:30,431
and Celtics,

619
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:34,990
why don't I take that out of my life and
then put that towards watching the kid

620
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,070
and then continue to play drums? I mean
there's the adjustments you can make,

621
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,810
right? Um, oh fuck. I gotta
tell you this story. I um,

622
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,440
I always look at houses and you
know, I'm not gonna sell my house.

623
00:37:47,441 --> 00:37:50,020
I love this fucking place as much as I
pitch your best white bitch about it.

624
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,630
Cause I love this fucking house and I'm

625
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:53,990
okay

626
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,750
and I'm going to continue to fucking
repair it and I'm going to do the fucking

627
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:59,180
homeowner three 60. And when
I have the whole thing fixed,

628
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:00,950
I'm going to start over
again on the first job.

629
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,120
Cause now it's going to be
fucked up whenever I repaired
at that point will then

630
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:07,670
be fucked up. So anyways, I um,

631
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,520
there was this house for
sale and uh, I went to go,

632
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,700
I went to go see it and it basically
had everything that you could ever want.

633
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,270
Right. It was a beautiful house,
you know, from the outside.

634
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,700
It was a beautiful house.
It had a fucking pool,

635
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,860
had garage detached from the house with
a room above it, which to me is like,

636
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,180
oh there you go. I got the kid,
I got the house with the F,

637
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,360
I got the garage with fucking
room above it. I put my drums up,

638
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,930
they're turning into a drum room
slash podcast room. There you go.

639
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,400
That is my fucking dream. So I go over
to go look at this fucking place, right.

640
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,440
Knowing full well I'm not going to fucking
buy it cause I can tell at this point

641
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,890
having bought a fucking house that
needed all the work it does. But as,

642
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,300
as I'm driving up to it,

643
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:59,170
I can already see the fucking windows
need to be replaced and it needs a new

644
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,890
roof. Even though they told me, we don't
know. We checked out the roof there.

645
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:07,720
We had some inspectors. They said it's
fine. Oh yeah. Is that what they said?

646
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,870
Why are all these water stains all
over the side of the fucking house?

647
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,400
What's that about? I like how
the windows don't fucking quite,

648
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,710
they're not flush. Look at that.

649
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,440
Look at the rot around all
of those fucking windows.

650
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,870
This House I can tell you right now is
already a borderline tear down and I

651
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:30,040
haven't even gotten into it yet.

652
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:34,840
So I walk into this fucking house
and Holy Shit. Holy fucking Shit,

653
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,400
dude. I took a tour of this house.

654
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,070
There was three separate times that I
thought I was going to get murdered.

655
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,670
All right. First of all,

656
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,550
we go to look at the room above the
garage first and there's just this,

657
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,460
this moss growing on
the side of the house,

658
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,670
which I don't know if it was mold or
if it was moss. It was fucking green.

659
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,520
And I'm the guy trying to sell it, as,
you know, he's doing his best going,

660
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,700
you know, it's a mother-in-law's sweet.
He can fucking do this, you can do that.

661
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:04,570
There's room to add a little more under
the garage. And I just point to the,

662
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,800
I'm like, what is that? And he goes,
yeah, well you know, you need need.

663
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,280
That definitely needs a little bit of
work. And uh, so I go into the house

664
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:18,190
and there's this random guy
living there who isn't the owner,

665
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:23,050
Reza punk ponytail. It's sparsely
furnished, was made the 1920.

666
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,250
So it's already like creepy.

667
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:27,250
You can already feel how many people
have lived there and are now dead.

668
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,010
And uh, we just walk around the house.

669
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,920
It got remodeled sometime in the 90s.
He had it still had the fucking, uh,

670
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,230
you know, Long Chaney Jr
vibe of it from the 20s.

671
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,910
And uh, I go down stairs,
it was like a basement,

672
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:49,990
which they just don't have out
here. And, uh, the guy's like,

673
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,430
he can make this into a TV room.

674
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,300
And there was all like these fucking
files and film and all this shit down

675
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:56,860
there. And like, you know,

676
00:40:56,861 --> 00:41:01,570
that was the first time I was thinking
about like a saw or the Blair witch.

677
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,080
And I'm like, alright, uh, can we go
back upstairs? So we go back upstairs,

678
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,340
we go all the way upstairs and there
was this random like teenage girl living

679
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,670
there that was the daughter of the
dude downstairs who wasn't fucking,

680
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,340
who lives there, but I don't
know, it's not as house.

681
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,850
And we look up there and this
is stuffy, fucking smell.

682
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,210
And then as we go down to go to the master
bedroom, they said, oh, the owner is,

683
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,180
uh, the owners, just to let you know,
the owner is there. He's in the house,

684
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:31,810
which usually they fucking leave.
There's all these people just there.

685
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:36,811
And this fucking cat just sitting there
looking at me and I do the after you to

686
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:41,150
go to the master bedroom and
he does the after you to me.

687
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,410
And then I didn't want to be rude.

688
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:47,270
So now I'm walking towards the master
bedroom down this creepy fucking

689
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:51,640
Transylvania Hall with
the, with the fucking,

690
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,750
the guy, Smiley real estate agent
behind me who, you know, he's still,

691
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:58,510
I'm sitting there going like, he's
regular looking good looking guy.

692
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,590
That was to make me feel safe and now
I'm fucked and I'm walking towards this

693
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:07,390
fucking door and I opened the fucking door

694
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,790
and I look in there and I swear to God,

695
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,900
this is guy with like gray skin.

696
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,350
Yeah,

697
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,800
totally fucking bald. Like the landing
strip. And then like, you know,

698
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,400
like the little fucking Mr whipple
fucking hair around the side that he sorta

699
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:28,950
died at some point, but now it was
like this gray. He was totally gray.

700
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,710
You could see the veins on the side
of his head, like Clint Eastwood,

701
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,590
but not like, I wouldn't want to
fight Clint Eastwood more like,

702
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,850
did this guy die? And then come back.
And he was sitting down, hunched down.

703
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:43,450
I think he was typing on the side
of his bed. The place was a mess.

704
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,720
He just sort of looked
over me and as I say,

705
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,820
he looked like the fucking dad and uh,

706
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,940
the Texas chainsaw massacre
and I was just like,

707
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:57,600
what the fuck? So I went
like, hey man, how are ya?

708
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,650
I sorta stepped around him and then
when I went to look into the bathroom,

709
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,500
which I did for fucking
two seconds, you know,

710
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,460
trying to feel the backside
pressure by the way, you know,

711
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,190
like when a quarterback doesn't feel the
Russian of trying to feel that fucking

712
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,720
ax, it was about ready to go into my back.

713
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,640
I look into the bathroom
and all along the bathtub,

714
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,700
this guy had knee high dress socks
drying on and I was just like,

715
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,090
no. I was just like, aw man,
I'll fuck it's sealed later.

716
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,660
And I did, I like give a see
that walk racing that they,

717
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:35,220
that was a big fad in the seventies I
did that right out of that fucking house.

718
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,180
And I tell, I said, the real
estate guy, I go, Jesus Christ,

719
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:41,670
I can see why this has been on
the market for so fucking long.

720
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,850
How the fuck he supposed to sell it
when the Goddamn creek kipper keepers is

721
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,770
creek keeper, the crypt keeper.
I'm like verbally dyslexic.

722
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:56,670
Forget about trying to read.
Um, is sitting up there.

723
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,300
I didn't dare of looking, you know,

724
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:03,180
I was standing there and I said all
this shit. I know those old houses,

725
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:04,470
you can hear everything
when you're outside.

726
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,560
I'm standing right underneath the fucking
bedroom window and I didn't dare look

727
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,170
up there cause I had a feeling he was
going to be standing in the window staring

728
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:13,920
at me and I was gonna have fucking
nightmares and a, and I just,

729
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,570
I just five fucking left.

730
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,820
I left and I had this creepy fucking
feeling that because I went into that

731
00:44:20,821 --> 00:44:24,510
house, I got exposed to something and
at some point today, my home phone,

732
00:44:24,511 --> 00:44:25,580
which I never used,

733
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:29,370
so it never fucking rings is going to
ring and I'm going to pick it up and it's

734
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:34,371
going to be that guy's voice going
daish and then I gotta somehow expose

735
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,540
somebody I know to it so I don't
fucking die. Having said that,

736
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,310
it was a great house that
had a lot of potential.

737
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,060
Oh my God, Jesus Christ,

738
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:51,630
that that house needed a giant fucking
hug needed to get that guy out of it and

739
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:52,440
just the,

740
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,440
you needed to buy all the sage in the
state of California and fucking set it on

741
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:00,060
fire. And if in one
thing he either happens,

742
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:03,900
either burns out all the spirits or it
burns down the house and you start over

743
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,650
again. Um, having said that though,

744
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,580
despite how fucking creepy it was, uh,

745
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,460
the fact that it had a
room over a garage, that's,

746
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,470
that's the only way I would ever leave
this house is if I could find a fucking

747
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:20,280
house. You know, I dunno.

748
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,180
I got to get out of this fucking state.
I got to get out of this fucking city.

749
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:27,090
It's so fucking stupid. Every fucking
house. I don't care how nice it is.

750
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,770
You can literally stick your head out the
window and before your hand completely

751
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,230
extends, you can touch
your neighbor's house.

752
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,650
It's unbelievable. It's like,
where the fuck do you have to go?

753
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,690
There's just too many fucking people.
Um, anyways, plowing ahead here.

754
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:45,740
Um,

755
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,470
okay.

756
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,780
Should I do some breeds for
this week? Let's do some rates.

757
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,540
What are we got here? I got a little
more advertising to go. A who?

758
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,980
Who the fuck wants to listen to me
read out loud anymore? Let's Ah,

759
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,860
let's read some of the, uh, some
of the questions for the week.

760
00:45:59,861 --> 00:46:02,200
I'll read two of these and then the
last two. Advertisings how about that?

761
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:04,270
All right. And then I'll read the
rest of the questions. All right.

762
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,220
Polish invention. Hey
Bill, I saw this on reddit.

763
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,680
Kind of fucked. Do people
go to Reddit, by the way?

764
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:15,770
How do you even figure out what's
going on? It looks like computer code.

765
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,930
People always tell me you got to
go on and read it. It's like, I, I,

766
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,520
I looks like the fucking
declaration of independence.

767
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:25,820
I'm not reading all that
shit. I saw this on reddit.

768
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,120
It was a machine made by
some Polish guy to cut wood.

769
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,770
Does knowing it's Polish make
you double guests yourself?

770
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,690
Double guessed yourself as to whether
or not it's good invention because of

771
00:46:37,691 --> 00:46:42,400
Polish jokes. Double guests yourself for
this guys making fun of Polish people.

772
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,260
I definitely did. I'm at the point
where I have no idea your thoughts.

773
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,580
Um, well, I don't know how to click. I've
got to go back here to click the link.

774
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,990
I can tell you this. We don't,

775
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:56,230
I don't think we need any better
way to cut down fucking trees.

776
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,020
Did you ever see that fucking invention?

777
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:00,940
Okay.

778
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,720
It looks like a fucking bulldozer without,
without the bulldoze of front end.

779
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,370
And the thing just reaches out, grabs
the tree, rips it out of the ground,

780
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,580
turns it fucking horizontal and it goes
up one side where down the other end

781
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:19,660
completely strips it down. And
it does this within like fucking

782
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:21,410
okay.

783
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,150
I Dunno it within 10 seconds.

784
00:47:23,151 --> 00:47:27,320
And literally one man in that machine
can do the work of like an army of

785
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:30,100
lumberjacks for a year. It's a,

786
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,850
it's terrifying when I sought
to be honest with you. You know,

787
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,790
as I talk about looking at a house
that I don't need and then redoing it,

788
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,900
what are you gonna Redo at bill?

789
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,560
What are you gonna Redo it
with the fucking wood that
that machine cut down. Um,

790
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,440
all right. Let me see
if I can find the, uh,

791
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,020
all right, here's the link. Let
me look at this thing. All right.

792
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,103
[inaudible]

793
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,753
oh God.

794
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,993
Oh

795
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,430
well, you know what? I know you're
making fun of Polish people.

796
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:06,130
This is just some guy in his
backyard came up with this.

797
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:09,460
I bet you couldn't come up with this
fucking thing. And to be honest with you,

798
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,420
I just had to cut up my Christmas
tree for this year. Sorry.

799
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:18,190
I'm sure that was really annoying
to listen to. Uh, that's great.

800
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,110
Let's see what people say underneath.

801
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,700
This is way better than the a
thousand degree knife videos.

802
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,530
I am irrationally angry at the completely
different sizes of cuts of the second

803
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,560
log short on fire load.

804
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:35,200
We specialize in short firewood.

805
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,940
I don't even know what this guy
put on there, but he basically,

806
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,210
he hooked it up to his a,

807
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,140
once that thing between the transmission
and the district differential, uh,

808
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,140
passed the universal joint,
I'm going fucking blank here.

809
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,360
He basically just hooked it up to that.

810
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,670
And he's using the engine
turning of the engine. Um,

811
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,320
why, why, why do people just hate on
everybody out there? Good for him.

812
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,120
I don't fucking, what was I
supposed to trash Polish people.

813
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,680
I like Polish people. I
like their food and uh,

814
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,070
I dunno, I mean I'm, I'm sure
they've made movies about it,

815
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:23,150
but not here in the United States because
we're so focused on our own fucking

816
00:49:23,151 --> 00:49:24,650
point of view, like most countries.

817
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:29,651
But Poland I'm fascinated with because
during World War II they were sandwiched

818
00:49:31,641 --> 00:49:34,130
between two of the biggest
mad men of all time,

819
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,370
Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.

820
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,670
They was stuck in between the two of them,

821
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,630
the most precarious fucking position
of any country that I can ever fucking

822
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,600
think of. And they somehow fucking
survived. So I don't think they're dumped.

823
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,610
Um, and I look forward someday to going
there and seeing that beautiful country

824
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,640
eating their food and
doing a fucking show. Woo.

825
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,760
Having a couple of fucking
beers. All right. From Turkey,

826
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,100
I'm sick of being called a delusional
conspiracy theorist by my family and my

827
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,210
legs.

828
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,310
E

829
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,170
he said, I live in the Republic of Turkey.

830
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,700
Maybe you've heard that there was a
coup here last year. Yes, I did a,

831
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:20,470
I put it in quotation because it was
the most pathetic attempt in Turkish

832
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:22,750
history. Uh,

833
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,410
so it didn't go down like the Ukraine. Um,

834
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,510
long conspiracy short your guys,

835
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,100
we're losing control of our guys who
may installed here to have a nice little

836
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,370
proxy to the loves the,

837
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,140
to the lovely oil desert
downtown deserts downtown.

838
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,700
I already love how this
person is thinking. Ah,

839
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,490
so they try to pull the carpet from
under our guys cause God knows they can't

840
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:49,460
pass aggression wars in
your congress anymore.

841
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,570
Since you American citizens
are woke as fuck now,

842
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:57,980
thankfully I guess we're not cause
I don't know what any of this means.

843
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,530
By the way. You don't, right?
Like you're from Turkey.

844
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,150
Like this is your second language.

845
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,200
You're using like really high level
slang for someone who lives on the other

846
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:08,380
side of the world. Um, anyways,

847
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,680
this pathetic coup attempt created
a lot of turmoil here. I mean,

848
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,710
it would be less destructive
if it succeeded because
now through their paranoia,

849
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:20,480
they are going full apeshit,

850
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,660
which turns Turkey to a bittersweet heaven
for conspiracy theorists like myself

851
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:28,700
with all this stuff
going on. Um, all right,

852
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:31,880
well there's no fucking way I'm reading
your name so you don't end up in a jail

853
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:34,370
if you actually are from Turkey. Um,

854
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,260
I can deal with my family's indifference
to all this and my friends are most

855
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:41,960
likely are most like me
regarding these subjects,

856
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,000
but the fact that my girls
stonewall's being goes, um, yeah, DOL.

857
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:50,210
Okay. Really annoys Pete
down deep. Of course it does.

858
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:54,740
Anytime you're passionate about an opinion
and somebody just goes, oh, really?

859
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,300
Okay sweetheart, forget about us. If
it's a woman that you have feelings for,

860
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,100
um, she is a totally dope
chicken. Every other aspect, dude,

861
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:07,580
you not from Turkey, you're not from
Turkey, but I'll, I'll continue with this.

862
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,020
Fun to hang out,

863
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:14,050
hates the movies and music I hate has
c cup fun pillows that were sculpted by

864
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:15,830
God himself from my palms.

865
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,460
But I can't help lose respect
for her when it comes to her.

866
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:22,220
Not giving a single shit
about politics and stuff.

867
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:26,330
She's convinced she doesn't get effected
by them for some reason and it doesn't

868
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:29,720
matter. I'm curious how you
dealt with this feeling. Also,

869
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:34,721
I'm very interested in how you reach
information about the world and what news

870
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:39,380
outlets you trust a from Turkey with
love to you and Nia. Uh, all right,

871
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:43,940
well let's say you're from Turkey. Very
impressive. Your English and your slang.

872
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,890
You're actually better at my
language than I am. Um, all right.

873
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:53,540
Here's what you have to understand as
a conspiracy theorist is that you're,

874
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,610
you're really, uh,

875
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:01,430
you're a lot to deal with and
you really wear people out.

876
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,310
This is what I learned when
I went down the rabbit hole,

877
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,620
which I got out of a good
two, three years ago,

878
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:12,430
is that as much as you don't trust
what the fuck people are telling you,

879
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,870
which is really common sense.

880
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,320
And I'm not saying there's a bunch of
fucking crazy people live in under a

881
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,510
mountain pulling the strengths.

882
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:25,070
But what I'm saying is that everybody
is spinning this shit because everybody

883
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,310
has their own agenda. So you
can't, you don't, like if you just,

884
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:33,240
if you fucking showed up to
a two car accident, okay,

885
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,630
both people are going to spin it in a way,

886
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,740
even if one person was 100% right,
they're still going to spin it.

887
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,400
So there's no fucking way that,
you know, they can be perceived,

888
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,870
they gonna spin it just cause the other
person has spinning just to offset this

889
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:52,050
spinning of it. It's like, listen to
that whole fucking Russia tapped into a,

890
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:53,790
you know, hacked into our shit.

891
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,270
You're gonna listen to the Democrats
spinning it. The Republicans spinning it,

892
00:53:57,271 --> 00:54:00,270
the CIA spinning it and then
fucking Russia their spin on it.

893
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:02,640
So at the end of it, who the
fuck knows what happened?

894
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,900
Okay.

895
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,490
I just love how our country is acting.

896
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:10,330
Like we don't spy on Russia and we don't
try to influence elections around the

897
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:14,230
fucking world and we haven't placed people
in power taken people out and all of

898
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:15,490
that. It's fucking hilarious.

899
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,180
All of a sudden it happens to us and
it's a big goddamn tragedy. So, um,

900
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,470
I would say, uh,

901
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,170
respect the fact that
she's not into politics.

902
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,190
I'm envious of people that can then, you
know, I kind of did that after a while,

903
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:36,090
like after a while it's just like
you screaming into a tornado.

904
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,353
Alright,

905
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,400
it's way bigger than you are.

906
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,560
Um,

907
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,340
there are people out there that have the
ability and the influence to fucking,

908
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,190
I guess turn shit around.
But I'm not that guy.

909
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:54,191
I'm just some fucking guy ruining
your beer at a bar by bringing all my

910
00:54:55,341 --> 00:54:58,850
delusional paranoid fucking
thoughts, whether I'm right or not,

911
00:54:58,851 --> 00:55:01,880
which I was probably right on a few
things like Mel Gibson in that movie where

912
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,380
he drove the taxi cab. I was probably
right about a few fucker. Thanks.

913
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,740
But I don't know what they are.

914
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,250
So all you're doing is just
annoying the shit out of people.

915
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:11,600
And I have to be honest with you.

916
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:16,420
If your girl actually loves you and
she's to the point of responding of, hm,

917
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,840
yeah, doll. Okay. I think
you've probably worn her down.

918
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,640
I bet she didn't say
that in the beginning.

919
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:28,760
She probably listened to
it and you probably freaked
her out and you don't have

920
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:29,630
a solution.

921
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,590
You're just saying all this fucking
shit that's just gonna ruin her day.

922
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,220
So maybe that's her
defense mechanism. And I'm,

923
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,240
what I'm doing is I'm not being a,

924
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:42,950
I'm not going Dr Phil here and just siding
with the woman because I don't have a

925
00:55:42,951 --> 00:55:46,550
female audience, unlike that
fucking dishonest con, right?

926
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:50,350
You need to do what she says. Well,

927
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,620
when you look at ladies,
when you look at Dr Phil,

928
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,910
when you honestly look at that man,
do you see somebody? Do you honest?

929
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,790
Do you not see how volatile
a human being that guy is?

930
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:10,440
Can you just imagine living
with that man when he loses his,

931
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,200
his shit? Just imagine

932
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,260
that semi bald head and face
just beat red screaming at you.

933
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,610
His spittle getting caught in
his mustache. Just imagine that.

934
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,970
And he's a big man too.
Okay? I'm telling you,

935
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:29,320
I know he's got that southern drawl and
you just think everybody's a fucking

936
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:33,520
gentleman. You know the way women
love of foreign fucking acts.

937
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:37,720
I guess guys like it too. I Dunno. I don't
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

938
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,460
Anyways, let's get back to this guy. Um,

939
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,520
to lose respect for the fact
that somebody's not into
what the fuck you're into

940
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,000
is, uh, at, that's a sign. You know,

941
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,950
it'd be one thing if she just didn't give
a fuck about a mate, I don't know. I,

942
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,720
I'd have to know who the fuck she was.

943
00:56:57,721 --> 00:57:00,060
That could just be a defense
mechanism where it's just like,

944
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:02,880
whatever doesn't affect my life. You know,

945
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:05,310
I've done that with global warming
and all of that type of shit.

946
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:10,340
I've just started to block it out because
there's nothing I can do to get people

947
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,160
to, I don't,

948
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,570
and I don't even know what the s I
don't even what the fucking solution is.

949
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:21,090
The only solution I have is to
fucking exterminate most of us,

950
00:57:21,091 --> 00:57:25,290
90% of us. And then just fucking everybody
sits in a ball and hopes that, uh,

951
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,590
everything that we've put into the
earth and into the air kind of goes away

952
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,390
after a while that that's
the only solution I have,

953
00:57:33,391 --> 00:57:37,680
which I don't think that
that's gonna work. So, um,

954
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,350
I don't know. I just, you know, I, I,

955
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:45,300
I try to fucking do whatever the fuck
I can do, which is, you know, I dunno.

956
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,720
See Dude, this is why people
don't like could see you lea.

957
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:52,680
You literally bringing this up is Brent
brought me to a dark fucking place and

958
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:56,520
your email alone just told me that
just got me to say that we need to

959
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:59,910
exterminate 90% of the people on the
fucking planet. How insane is that?

960
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,420
How are you going to do that, bill?
You're going to do that to babies too,

961
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,100
or you're not going to do babies,

962
00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:07,250
but you're going to kill all those
fucking parents and then what you're gonna

963
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,630
have the most giant fucking
nursery like it all.

964
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,600
It all unravels the whole fucking thing.

965
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,720
That's why I kinda stopped
doing the conspiracy theory
thing even though I still

966
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:18,450
throw it out there
because it's fun. And I,

967
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:22,110
and I also don't believe a fucking
word anybody's telling me. Um,

968
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,200
when it comes to that shit,
you know, one-on-one, you know,

969
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:28,080
if I sat down with somebody and there's
not cameras around then I could feel

970
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:31,080
like they can really be honest with me.
But the second year on TV, you know,

971
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,790
there's only so honest
you could be. Um, so

972
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,383
wow.

973
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,061
I Dunno. I,

974
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:43,061
I would probably guess that on some level
your a lot to be around during certain

975
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:49,160
new stories and uh, I think you
should lighten up a little bit.

976
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,260
Take your girlfriend out,

977
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:54,020
go get a fucking ice cream and enjoy
the fact that someone is beautiful as

978
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:58,490
you're saying is she is actually
can tolerate you and your,

979
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:03,470
your fucking theories. All right. Having
said that, if I ever go to Turkey,

980
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:05,700
I'll definitely have a beer
with you and I'll fucking, I'll,

981
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:10,560
I'll go fucking Tofa toe with you
that with conspiracy theories. Um,

982
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:13,250
all right. And thank you for
listening to the podcast. Okay.

983
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:17,300
Girlfriend was unwillingly married. What?

984
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,040
All right, dear Billy psycho tits. I don't
know what means, but I like that one.

985
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,720
I'm 25 years old and finally found out
the girl of my dreams and finally found

986
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:30,210
the girl on my dreams. Well, good for
you dude. You found a pretty young a,

987
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:34,820
she's 23 years old,
smash, super attractive,

988
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,000
and we have been in a relationship
for the last nine months.

989
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,660
I don't even have the urge to go to
bars and sleep with women anymore.

990
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,710
She has me all types of screwed up.
It's amazing. My family loves her,

991
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:50,600
especially my father who never gives
a shit about my relationships. Um,

992
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,730
she's from Yemen and is
Muslim and although she hit,

993
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:59,030
she doesn't really follow
the religion. She is forced.

994
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,290
She's forced to by her parents. That
being said, one weekend last month,

995
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,240
she told me her sister was
having an arranged marriage
and she was headed to the

996
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:12,950
wedding. I did not hear from her for
three days. She finally contacted.

997
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,813
Oh No.

998
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:19,300
She finally contacted me back after I
constantly reached out to her and she told

999
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:23,300
me we had to talk. Oh No.

1000
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,950
Once we met up,

1001
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:29,951
she told me she was unwillingly married
off to a man from Yemen and that she had

1002
01:00:31,581 --> 01:00:36,360
no idea this was going
to happen. Oh my God.

1003
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:41,020
Is this real? Is this a lifetime script?

1004
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,920
She told me that since her parents
sign the marriage documents,

1005
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:49,150
she really had no choice in her
religion, in God's eye. She was,

1006
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:50,170
she's married.

1007
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,350
She made it clear that she was in love
with me and that she wanted to be with

1008
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:56,760
me.

1009
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,160
Is is dead fucking chick
who punches herself in the
chest going to start singing

1010
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:04,890
at this point. What's her
name? She does the casino gigs.

1011
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:09,830
She's from Canada. She sang
the titanic song. Right.

1012
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:11,960
Okay.

1013
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,960
Leonardo DiCaprio on the the ship.

1014
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:22,640
Whatever the fucking song, you know
that's, that's in the arms of the angel.

1015
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,720
That's about rescue
dogs. What fucking song?

1016
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:30,830
Oh yeah. Nia Fall. Whoa,

1017
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:33,483
Woo.

1018
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:36,370
Ugh. How much does she
fucking hate that song?

1019
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,520
Having to sing that to
a bunch of casino dope.

1020
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,420
Sit there and flip flops
getting teared up, you know?

1021
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,420
Anyways, she made it clear with me.

1022
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:50,800
She made it clear that she was in love
with me and that she wanted me to be with

1023
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:55,090
me only she told me she pleaded with
their parents, but they wouldn't budge.

1024
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:59,560
We then came up with the date that
if her parents still wouldn't budge,

1025
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,030
she would just move in with me out of
her parents' home and we would figure it

1026
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,620
out together during the,

1027
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:11,040
during the week after text messages turn
to about three messages a day and I did

1028
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:13,000
not get to see her at all.

1029
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:14,270
Okay.

1030
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:15,970
All right. Then this, you
know, even if you made this up,

1031
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:17,050
this is an incredible story.

1032
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,940
I then got a message from her best
friend and she told me that our debt,

1033
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:25,130
my girlfriend was lying to me. Oh, now,

1034
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:26,300
now who do you believe?

1035
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:30,470
She told me that my girl had been
engaged since she was 16 years old.

1036
01:02:30,471 --> 01:02:35,471
Her new husband is forcing himself to try
to fuck her and she is threatening her

1037
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,000
and is threatening her with
violence. All right, dude,

1038
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:41,450
this is going outside the realm of,
of my silly little podcast here,

1039
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,910
as well as taking her, taking
her f uh, away or phone.

1040
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:53,090
Um, she does make it clear that my
girl does love me with all her heart,

1041
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,890
but will never leave due to her parents
disowning her if she decides to leave

1042
01:02:57,891 --> 01:03:01,580
this marriage, what the
fuck? Oh, what period?

1043
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,110
The period fuck period.

1044
01:03:03,111 --> 01:03:06,440
I immediately contact my girl and
she admits to everything she told me.

1045
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:10,100
She knew about the wedding beforehand and
doesn't think she could do that to her

1046
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:14,480
family. He's trying to have sex with her,
but she cries and then he just stops.

1047
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:18,170
Oh boy. Well, you know what? I commend
that other guy. You know what I mean?

1048
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:21,770
Any guy who can plow through
a woman crying, that's,

1049
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,400
she's just a fucking animal that needs
to be shot in the back of the fucking

1050
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,890
head. So this guy is
actually not a bad guy.

1051
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:32,240
I don't think he's just wrapped up in
the fucking customer. Ah, Jesus Christ.

1052
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,480
Gotta love religion. Everybody,
I have no idea what to do.

1053
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:39,620
She won't go against her parents, but
she loves me and she just given up.

1054
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,430
Uh, she was such a
strong and tough person.

1055
01:03:43,431 --> 01:03:45,620
Now she just going with the unwilling.

1056
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,330
Maybe she should just keep crying and
that guy's decent enough to do due to just

1057
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:50,990
be like, all right, you know,

1058
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:55,970
fuck this over t or a friend told me
she's depressed and doesn't have the fight

1059
01:03:55,971 --> 01:03:57,770
in her. Currently she's
blocked by friends.

1060
01:03:57,771 --> 01:04:00,110
Our mutual friends and our
family are from social media.

1061
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,810
My family and friends
have been calming me down.

1062
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:07,811
This guy who thinks he owns my girl would
get American history x Curbstop if I

1063
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:13,910
find out he lays a hand on her. All right.

1064
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,520
This stop being funny, like
at least nine paragraphs ago.

1065
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:19,040
Like I usually have like
lighthearted, funny shit here,

1066
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:24,290
but that might also complicate things
for her. Yeah. If you murdered the guy.

1067
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:27,360
Absolutely. Anyways, I love your
podcast. Don't stop what you're doing.

1068
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,860
Want to go fuck yourself. I don't
believe that. I don't believe that story.

1069
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,320
I'm not saying Shit like
that doesn't happen,

1070
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:36,770
but I don't believe that someone would
write this level of serious shit into me.

1071
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,720
Um, yeah, I don't put that deck.

1072
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,790
That got a little too
fucking sensational for me.

1073
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:45,470
Not saying that shit
like that doesn't happen,

1074
01:04:45,471 --> 01:04:46,970
but I know if that actually is true.

1075
01:04:46,971 --> 01:04:50,170
I don't know why you're
writing to this podcast. Um,

1076
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:51,950
okay.

1077
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:56,780
I think at that point you need to write
to a, I'm going to say it's wrong,

1078
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:01,430
isn't it? Niamh Lisa Ma, Liam
Neeson, that fucking guy. You need,

1079
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:06,440
you need to write to that guy and find
out who wrote the scripts in the words

1080
01:05:06,441 --> 01:05:11,150
that he said and then find out what they
base that off of and gradually go back

1081
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,780
and find whoever the fuck
Liam needs some Niamh.

1082
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,980
Lisa is pretending to fucking be. I
should know who guy's fucking name is,

1083
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,860
right. Considering I act
every once in awhile.

1084
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,800
I should know who one of the
best guys out there at Liam.

1085
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,510
Okay.

1086
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,850
Neeson. Oh, okay.

1087
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:33,420
Liam Neeson is born in 1952 Jesus Christ,

1088
01:05:33,421 --> 01:05:38,160
decades like 60 63 fucking years old.

1089
01:05:38,161 --> 01:05:41,730
And I still wouldn't fuck
with them. Not even remotely.

1090
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,030
You know certain actors that play
a character and you're like, yeah,

1091
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:46,350
he's just pretending to be a tough guy.

1092
01:05:46,351 --> 01:05:48,480
Then there's other people where
you're just like, you know, you know,

1093
01:05:48,481 --> 01:05:51,870
I think that guy could really
beat the shit out of me. You know?

1094
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:54,940
You just saw on the ground,
where does this say? All right.

1095
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:59,430
[inaudible] banged friends. Virgin x,

friend was at my house and unbeknownst

1099
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:15,270
to me, his girlfriend at the
time was my next door neighbor.

1100
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,580
All right. I was just thinking
about the Beatles. I got distracted.

1101
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:23,180
Let me read this a month
back. Hey, recently.

1102
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,200
Yeah. Jesus Christ. You know what I, I

01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,780
Advertising's. I know you guys
like, what the fuck I know.

1104
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:34,310
Just just let me just knock these out
really quickly. Can I just do this here?

1105
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,890
All right. I did me on these. Oh, wait
a minute. Do I only have one left?

Think about how much time you've wasted.

1111
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:01,010
Go into the post office driving there,
finding parking, fighting old ladies.

smelly, old people.

1118
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:26,420
Crazy people going up there and having

1119
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:31,421
have to go back to the end of the line
thinking your next and then fucking the

1143
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,710
Virgin X. Okay. All right. Let's
start again. Deer, strawberry,

1144

Billy pubes forever. Star Billy
pubes forever. There we go.

1145
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:54,860
A month back.

1146
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:59,150
A recent recently acquired friend was
at my house and unbeknownst to me,

1147
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:02,600
his girlfriend at the time was my
next door neighbor. A few weeks later,

1148
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:04,910
they had broken up because
she wasn't putting out.

1149
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:07,490
Apparently they had dated for three
months and he couldn't take it anymore.

1150
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:12,050
Here's the thing of Jesus. One thing
led to another. Next thing you know,

1151
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,570
long story short, a week ago, I
was drunk with a different buddy.

1152
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,200
One thing led to another, sorry. Uh,

1153
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:24,710
and we decided it would be funny to
invite her and her roommates over to play

1154
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:28,430
board games. I was pretty buzzed and
had all the confidence in the world.

1155
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:31,760
I walked over to her house and it just
so happened she was the only one home

1156
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:35,810
though Jesus. She invited me in.
It's just like some red shoe diaries.

1157
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:38,690
This really happened. She
invited me in for some cookies.

1158
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,900
Her sorority made one
thing led to another.

1159
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:49,280
Hey, we go and we ended up
fucking, one thing led to another,

1160
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:54,530
a the classic phrase, she
was obviously inexperienced,

1161
01:09:54,531 --> 01:09:56,450
so it was nothing to write home about.

1162
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:59,750
This normally wouldn't be a problem
except she's my next door neighbor.

1163
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:04,550
So naturally I have repeated the process
about a dozen times. My question is,

1164
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,720
should I tell my friend normally
I wouldn't say anything,

1165
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:10,670
but I think I'm falling for this girl.

1166
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:15,560
He's been kind of distanced lately
so he might have some suspicions.

1167
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:19,200
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.
Please come to San Diego and cool.

1168
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:21,500
Congrats on the baby. Uh, Jesus.

1169
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:24,980
Is there anything funnier
than a young man with a Dick?

1170
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:29,330
You know Jesus Christ, Dude. You
think he's getting suspicious?

1171
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,240
She lives next door. You've
been over there 12 times. Yeah,

1172
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:36,080
he's going to figure it out. Um,

1173
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,520
well look, you know, he broke up with her.

1174
01:10:39,521 --> 01:10:44,250
He was only there with her for three
months. How well did you, how well, how,

1175
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:49,290
how much, how f are you great
friends with this person?

1176
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:53,670
Yeah. It gets messy. It gets mad. I
don't know what you're asking me here.

1177
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,070
You know it's a fucking great story.

1178
01:10:56,071 --> 01:10:59,790
Other than it used to be your friend's
girlfriend, but he fucking tapped out.

1179
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:03,330
Maybe that's what you should say to him
when he calls you on it. You just spend,

1180
01:11:03,331 --> 01:11:07,140
he should have tapped out, man.
Should've kept mining for gold.

1181
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,580
Is Golden in there hills. Um,

1182
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:13,140
I don't,

1183
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,900
the fact that you've been with this
girl for 12 times and you think you're

1184
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,910
falling for her, I don't
think you're falling for her.

1185
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:20,610
I think you'd love the convenience
of it. If I had to guess.

1186
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,720
You really didn't write too
deeply about your fucking

1187
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:27,680
okay.

1188
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,370
Yeah. About your fucking
feelings for this girl.

1189
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:32,610
I think you went further into the fact
that how you fucking nailed this girl and

1190
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,460
your, your, your friend didn't. So, uh,

1191
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:38,370
I don't know if you're
really not into this girl.

1192
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:42,360
I would just pull the fucking plug and
I would never bring it up and I'd wait

1193
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,640
til that guy is a couple of
Miller highlights into him.

1194
01:11:44,641 --> 01:11:49,641
And at that point I would stay out of his
wheelhouse cause he might fucking suck

1195
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:53,010
a puncher cause you know
what happened. All right.

1196
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,890
What did he say? Bang
friends. Ex girlfriend.

1197
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,340
So he didn't say he accidentally
did it. So yeah. Well you know,

1198
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:02,530
you knew what you were doing and
you did it and now that's the,

1199
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,170
that's that's the world you
created and you're living in it.

1200
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:08,080
So I don't know what to tell you. Um,

1201
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:12,070
other than if you're not really falling
for this girl, I would stop fucking her.

1202
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:16,530
There you go. I don't care how
good the cookies are. All right.

1203
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,970
Calling girlfriend at cunt a belt.
Hope Fatherhood is treating you well.

1204
01:12:19,971 --> 01:12:21,650
If it finally happened
has not happened yet.

1205
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:26,510
Recently my girlfriend was being very
unreasonable and running her mouth about

1206
01:12:26,511 --> 01:12:30,050
something and I said she was being a cunt.

1207
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:34,280
Didn't call her a [inaudible], rather
acting like one. I, you know what?

1208
01:12:34,281 --> 01:12:39,240
There is a loophole there.
There is a loophole there,

1209
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:42,390
but when he dropped the seaward
it's, it's very difficult.

1210
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,070
Like I've never called
my wife a bitch ever.

1211
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:51,930
I've never done it the entire time
at Bu. I never called it that once.

1212
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,760
One time I did say that she
was acting like one and uh,

1213
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:01,020
she brought that up for like fucking
three years because she knew how important

1214
01:13:01,021 --> 01:13:04,140
it was to me to never call
her that and she fucking,

1215
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:08,160
we got into a fight and then she pushed
my buttons trying to get me fucking more

1216
01:13:08,161 --> 01:13:11,820
and more mad cause that's what they do
and they're not doing it maliciously.

1217
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:15,840
That's how they fight. Most of them
were guys go, what'd you've talked,

1218
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,660
you'd say? And then you
start fucking fist fighting.

1219
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:21,630
Women usually don't get to that level.

1220
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,510
So their fist fighting is a, they,

1221
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:29,511
they've already broken you down psych
psychologically and they just try to make

1222
01:13:29,761 --> 01:13:32,790
you as mad as they can. And um,

1223
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,880
if you're with a cool woman, they'll,

1224
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:39,770
they'll take responsibility for that
and they'll eventually forgive you. Um,

1225
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,440
so anyways. All right, so you said
that she was acting like one. Okay.

1226
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:47,880
Since then, she's had her panties in a
twist and thanks. I owe her an apology.

1227
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:52,020
I haven't given her one. My
thoughts are that if anyone,

1228
01:13:52,021 --> 01:13:55,140
male or female is acting like
a con, I can call them a con.

1229
01:13:55,790 --> 01:14:00,790
What she thought thoughts on women
calling women account and have you gotten

1230
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:04,560
into trouble for calling a woman
account? I've never done that. Uh,

1231
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:07,770
to a woman that I've dated, have
I ever called a woman at account?

1232
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,110
You know, it's funny.
Much as I use that word,

1233
01:14:12,111 --> 01:14:16,960
I don't think I've ever done that. Um, no,

1234
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,370
I don't do the name colon thing

1235
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,480
as angry as I am. If I ever done that,

1236
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,780
I'd definitely like, yeah, fuck you. You
fucking psycho. I've done that. But I,

1237
01:14:32,781 --> 01:14:36,230
I don't, I don't do the, uh, I
don't do the, the, the fucking,

1238
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:40,730
the a, those classics. I don't, I
don't, I don't break out the classics.

1239
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:44,360
I don't say bitch cunt. I
don't say any of that. Um,

1240
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,720
yeah, I don't, I just don't. I saw,

1241
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,590
I saw that early on in my
life that that doesn't work.

1242
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:57,450
And I saw what it does to a relationship.
I just saw it. Um, you know,

1243
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,750
I had a paper route when
I was a kid. So, you know,

1244
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:04,890
you get to step into a lot of people's
homes and watch a little movie trailer

1245
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:09,740
and a lot of times you're walking up
to the house and you can hear the, the,

1246
01:15:09,741 --> 01:15:13,080
the director's cut of what's going on
before you went in there, you know.

1247
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,770
So I saw a lot of that, you
know, being from Massachusetts,

1248
01:15:16,771 --> 01:15:21,120
it was a lot of hotheads and, uh, I dunno

1249
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,780
as much as a, as a dick as I am, um,

1250
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,730
I've never done that and I can
tell you that it gets you nowhere.

1251
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:37,080
So, um, and the thing,

1252
01:15:37,081 --> 01:15:41,700
the stubborn thing that you're doing
right now that you're not apologizing for

1253
01:15:41,701 --> 01:15:44,040
it, is going to cause
her to dig her heels in.

1254
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:48,600
And what you're doing is you're creating
this toxic fucking cesspool in your

1255
01:15:48,601 --> 01:15:50,490
relationship. Okay.

1256
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,870
You could have set a bunch of other
words and you went to def con five or

1257
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:58,960
whatever the fuck is it one? Is
One the worst or is five the worst,

1258
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:01,270
whatever the worst one you
went? No, killer honor.

1259
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:05,530
I think you should apologize
and just say, for the record,

1260
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:09,250
I didn't say you were a cunt. I respect
you enough to not call you a cunt.

1261
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:13,570
I just said you were acting like what?
Okay. I won't do that in the future.

1262
01:16:13,571 --> 01:16:15,850
I was wrong. I don't even don't
even defend you, but you say,

1263
01:16:15,851 --> 01:16:20,670
I apologize for what I said. I
shouldn't have said it. Just,

1264
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,210
just apologize. All right.

1265
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,680
Yeah.

1266
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,480
And there'll be some rigid residual shit,

1267
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:28,590
but I can tell you right this right
now, if you're gonna make a real, uh,

1268
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,920
a relationship work, when you're in
the wrong, you have to apologize.

1269
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:36,400
You have to do that. Because
if you don't apologize,

1270
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,530
if you always get your fucking back up,

1271
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,260
if you fight him every
fucking step of the way,

1272
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:46,500
then you stopped being a person to
them. You just this thing, you just,

1273
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:50,970
this loud, annoying fucking thing.
Okay? But if you say you, sorry.

1274
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:55,730
If he ever, if you say like, you know
what, you're right, and blah, blah, blah,

1275
01:16:55,731 --> 01:16:59,570
blah, blah. The Times when you
actually are defending your position,

1276
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:02,510
you have clout because you admitted
that you were wrong when you were wrong.

1277
01:17:02,511 --> 01:17:06,980
So there you go. Now I'm not saying
she wasn't being a cunt, okay?

1278
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,110
Now that's the type of thing.

1279
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:14,070
If you want to say that, that's what you
say when you got you one fucking buddy,

1280
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:17,220
who for the most part can keep his
fucking mouth shut. But even then,

1281
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:21,330
you can't depend on that, okay? If you're
ever going to call you a woman a can,

1282
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:22,680
you fucking do it.

1283
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:27,710
You go for a drive and you do it in your
car by yourself and you yell everything

1284
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:31,650
that you want to yell because
she's not listening to you.

1285
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,920
You make all your fucking
points. You fucking crush it.

1286
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,450
You give your closing argument to
the invisible jury inside your car.

1287
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,580
And then in the end, you know,

1288
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,760
and if you actually stop for
a second and listen to me,

1289
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:49,640
you don't understand that, but you
can't because you're such a fucking cop,

1290
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:51,953
right?

1291
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,170
And then you'll look over, you know,

1292
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,810
at the other person's sitting
there at the red light with you.

1293
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,650
And if it's another guy, if
it's me, I'm going to laugh,

1294
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:09,400
you know, not at you, but I'm going to
laugh. No one, what the fuck you doing?

1295
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,980
And if it's a woman, she's
probably going to laugh.

1296
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:14,380
No one what the fuck you're
doing. Or if she's a cunt,

1297
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:17,680
she's going to fucking squint,
arise at her and be more of a cunt.

1298
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:24,550
There you go. So, um,

1299
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,530
yeah, I do not. Nor would I ever do that.

1300
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:33,980
I would to the, to the, to my wife,
I would never fucking do that. Uh,

1301
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,620
I wouldn't do that to any woman
that I was in business with.

1302
01:18:36,621 --> 01:18:41,210
I would do that with any fucking PR.
I would do that in general. Uh, but,

1303
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,610
uh, generally speaking,
when I talk about people,

1304
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,133
um,

1305
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,220
I kind of just call men cuts.

1306
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,193
Okay.

1307
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,310
I think it's funny to call a
man a cunt, to call a woman.

1308
01:18:54,311 --> 01:18:56,650
A conti is a [inaudible] system. Funny.

1309
01:18:58,980 --> 01:18:59,230
Yeah.

1310
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:04,060
I would call it a guy who can't, is
fucking hilarious. And I stand by that.

1311
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,210
All right? Not say that this,

1312
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:11,660
God knows that word exists
for fucking reason, but, uh,

1313
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,890
it's just too fucking mean
and I'm telling you, you lose,

1314
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,850
you lose in the end because, uh, you know,

1315
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:21,940
they could just make your life
miserable in every court of law,

1316
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,490
generally speaking, out there
is going to side with them.

1317
01:19:24,491 --> 01:19:25,390
And next thing you know,

1318
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:28,960
you will never play drums again because
she's going to take them from you,

1319
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,070
all right? Not The fucking baby. Okay?
That's the podcast for this week.

1320
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:39,020
Uh, God bless you. All
right, you fucking cons. Uh,

1321
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:42,540
go fuck yourselves and I will
check in on you on Thursday.
