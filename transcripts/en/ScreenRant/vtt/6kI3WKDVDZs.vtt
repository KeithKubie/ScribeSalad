00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.520
Unless you’ve been living under a rock for
the last eight years, you’ve probably noticed

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.840
a certain trend in superhero movies: the shared
universe.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.540
While superhero films used to be treated as
independent series that would reset after

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.940
two or three movies, they now build on top
of each other to create an almost overwhelming

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.630
amount of shared continuity.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.030
Case in point: the upcoming Captain America:
Civil War, which functions as a follow up

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.590
to Captain America: Winter Soldier, an action-packed
reunion of the Avengers: Age of Ultron cast

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.640
and an introduction to both Black Panther
as well as a new iteration of Spider Man!

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.010
But how long can this go on?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.160
Hollywood’s obsession with fan approval
shows that one day a series that seems to

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.050
be riding strong (Amazing Spider Man, for
instance), can bottom out within 9 months

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.640
of the latest films release.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.891
Steven Spielberg has even gone on record saying
the superhero film will soon go “the way

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:56.680
of the western” and fall out of popularity
in mainstream Hollywood.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.230
Is the father of American Blockbuster Cinema
on to something?

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.079
Around 30 characters have already enjoyed
multiple appearances across the Marvel films

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:09.570
so far, and a library of characters in Marvel
Comics continuity that number in the thousands,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.380
most of whom can appear and cross over between
a number of films and TV series.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.030
With a potentially infinite number of combinations,
will this cinematic universe collapse under

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.030
its own weight?

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:29.439
Or will the Marvel Cinematic Universe go on
FOREVER?

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.819
The History: How Marvel Became a Movie Studio

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.770
It may be inconceivable now, but there was
a time when Marvel wasn’t a huge player

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.109
in blockbuster filmmaking.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.049
It used to be just a comics publisher that
would license its intellectual property to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.709
various movie studios.

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.530
The first movie based on a marvel comic property
was the Captain America serial, released in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.679
1944, back when Marvel Comics was known as
Timely Comics.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.419
Instead of Steve Rogers, Captain America’s
alter ego was District Attorney Grant Gardner,

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:02.719
played by Dick Purcell, who actually died
a few weeks after filming was completed.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.909
Changes like these, as well as the omission
of Captain America’s iconic shield, made

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.860
the finished film extremely unpopular with
creators and fans of the character.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.470
The next film adaptation of a Marvel property
was 42 years later, a co-production between

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.030
Universal Studios and LucasFilm.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.580
Howard the Duck was released in 1986 to critical
scorn and financial ruin, tanking the careers

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.200
of most of its cast, and forcing George Lucas
to sell the animation branch of LucasFilm

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.000
in order to recoup his own personal losses.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.020
Far from being the box office gold they are
now, Marvel licensed a couple direct-to-DVD

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.780
releases as well as a still unreleased Fantastic
Four movie before their first major blockbusters

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.360
hit the screens with Blade and X-Men over
a decade later.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.730
The Kevin Feige Years

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.120
As the success of the X-Men and Spider Man
movies began to gain traction for the superhero

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.540
movie genre, the newly incorporated Marvel
Studios began re-acquiring movie rights to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.400
characters it had sold off to other studios
around 2004, with the intent to develop in-house

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.580
feature films.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.090
By 2007, the studio had the film rights to
Iron Man, Ant-Man, and The Incredible Hulk.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.180
They hired producer Kevin Feige to oversee
the project as Iron Man began production in

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180
2007.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.990
The massive success of Iron Man lead to a
snowball effect that took the blockbuster

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.150
world by storm, but Feige and Marvel Studios
were only getting started.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.380
Within 4 years, the MCU had not only created
fresh new adaptations of Thor and Captain

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.100
America, it saw the first major crossover
film, The Avengers, become the third highest

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.150
grossing film of all time.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.870
The infrastructure of the MCU, overseen and
produced by Kevin Feige, has held so far.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.510
What possibly could stop them?

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.780
Possible Obstacle #1: Box Office Failure?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.450
One major franchise killer in Hollywood is
the prospect of financial ruin.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.760
The paranoia surrounding box office numbers
is one massive reason for Hollywood Studios

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.150
to rely on surefire hits – like popular
comic books, for instance.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.930
But what financial disaster could possibly
derail Marvel?

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.660
As of 2010, Marvel is owned by Disney, one
of the few companies with carte blanche to

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.190
do whatever it wants with intellectual property
it owns.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.069
Considering they now own Lucasfilm’s properties
as well, it would take a financial storm of

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:23.250
biblical proportions to get Disney to lose
enough money to consider Marvel a liability.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.770
And considering the closest thing the Marvel
Cinematic Universe has to a box office Failure

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.860
is 2008’s The Incredible Hulk, which still
made its budget back with over 250 million

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.710
worldwide, it does not seem the MCU is in
any real financial danger – in the foreseeable

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.169
future.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.569
Possible Obstacle # 2: Critical Disaster?

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.540
But will the movies be able to sustain their
own quality standard?

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.389
Franchises like Transformers, which routinely
make massive amounts of money despite critical

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.810
derision are common, but part of the Marvel
Cinematic Universe’s appeal is that the

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.810
films themselves are generally held to a higher
standard than your average blockbuster.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.400
Can the studio sustain the same level of critical
favour as their movies get more complex and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.020
potentially convoluted?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.680
This possibility is inherently more difficult
to predict, because there are two kinds of

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.879
backlash that could force Marvel to change
course: fan backlash and critical backlash.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.379
Once again, we find ourselves looking at the
biggest critical failure of the MCU: The Incredible

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.379
Hulk.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.509
The Incredible Hulk received mixed response
from fans and critics alike, much like its

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.479
2003 predecessor, and there hasn’t been
a solo Hulk movie since.

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.309
Edward Norton was replaced by Mark Ruffalo
for The Avengers, and the greater cinematic

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:33.510
universe continued unimpeded.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.069
That is the Ace in the Hole for Marvel – The
MCU serves as a system of checks and balances

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.930
in case any particular series underperforms
or is critically panned.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.340
Soft reboots are commonplace, as evidenced
by Tom Holland’s appearance as a new Spider-Man

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.969
in Captain America: Civil War.

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.270
And even if films are released to critical
indifference, like the two Thor films, their

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.759
characters’ relation to The Avengers keeps
them afloat.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.789
The Marvel Strategy: Filmmakers

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.089
How does one guarantee consistent quality?

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.419
Marvel Studios’ ongoing plan follows the
pattern that made both X-Men and Spider Man

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.309
a success in the early 2000s: Find up and
coming directors with interesting voices,

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:17.009
and tap their talent for the Marvel Cinematic
Universe.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:21.499
Who would have thought the director of Elf,
Jon Favreau, would make a great Iron Man movie?

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.379
From Kenneth Branagh to James Gunn, Feige
and the heads of Marvel are exceedingly clever

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.729
at tapping talent for their projects - so
that their movies stay relevant to current

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:31.729
cinema.

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.169
The hiring department at Marvel remains the
best at poaching rising talent from smaller

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.379
or more obscure ends of the movie industry.

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.729
Just recently, they signed acclaimed Creed
and Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.309
and What We Do in the Shadows director Taika
Waititi for Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:47.309
respectively.

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:50.919
And with their new Spider Man film, it seems
Marvel is exceptionally clever at catering

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:59.779
to what their audiences want on both the filmmaking
side as well as the content side.

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:04.300
Obstacle #3: Introducing Audiences to New
Characters

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.800
Probably the biggest doubt everyone ever had
about the Marvel experiment was how they would

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.169
get a mainstream movie-going public invested
in shared universe storytelling in the same

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.949
way fans of their comics are.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:17.590
They proved they could make stand alone stories
about their heroes engaging, but bringing

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.590
that full universes together seemed like a
different challenge entirely.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.839
Keeping diverse mythologies and scores of
characters straight is something that people

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:29.749
can barely manage for one franchise, how could
they think this would work for multiple intersecting

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:30.749
series?

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:35.020
Though it was clear by The Avengers that the
MCU was a box office success, it was in Guardians

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.610
of the Galaxy that Marvel proved their brand
alone is worth more than the individual comics

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.610
they adapt.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.389
Guardians of the Galaxy took a goofy space
opera, that even some Marvel fans didn’t

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:49.330
know well, starring a talking tree and racoon,
and made it a success on par with their other

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.330
films.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.800
And Marvel’s smaller screen ventures as
well – such as Jessica Jones and the upcoming

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.110
Luke Cage – prove the studio can draw attention
to even the most obscure property with the

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.550
right creative staff.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:05.220
All they have to do is worry about sharing
that continuity with the Avengers.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.990
Obstacle #4: Too Many Characters

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.850
The most present threat to the Marvel Cinematic
Universe seems is likely one that comic book

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.360
movie fans would have never imagined.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.149
Managing a whole Universe is a tricky thing,
and while Marvel has so far been successful

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:22.030
at their shared universe experiments, when
will the world they’ve created simply become

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.409
too big to sustain?

00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:28.229
Avengers: Age of Ultron garnered criticism
for feeling trimmed down, and now Avengers:

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:32.909
Infinity War is set to be a saga-spanning
epic with a budget reportedly around 1 Billion

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.289
dollars between two films and a cast overstuffed
with Marvel regulars.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.780
As viewers of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of
Justice can attest, trying to cram too many

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.030
characters, events, and effects into your
movie can result in a film that is more overblown

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.970
than necessary, and deters new viewers.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.990
In a movie series that has weathered metaphors
for Terrorism as well as fantasy space magic,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.310
is there any going back once they threaten
to blow up the known universe?

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.330
There is no ready answer for this particular
question, but the numerous franchise obligations

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.100
of the series has previously proved overwhelming
for directors working under Marvel’s umbrella.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.940
See for instance, any interview Joss Whedon
attended during the press tour for Age of

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:16.700
Ultron.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.620
Obstacle #5: Audience Fatigue

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.520
The biggest and most dangerous obstacle Marvel
may face is their own success.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.281
With 2-3 films a year, Marvel Studios is the
largest producer of superhero films, and it

00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:33.160
is matched by their competitors in DC and
Fox, producing Justice League and X-Men sequels

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.580
to fight for their piece of the superhero
pie, making for an average 5 – 7 superhero

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.970
films a year for the foreseeable future.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.800
This is what Spielberg was referencing when
comparing the superhero film genre to the

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.080
western in old Hollywood.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.810
Back when western TV shows and movies were
all the rage, the genre suffered from oversaturation,

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.580
and eventually fell out of fashion.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.220
But is it an accurate comparison to draw parallels
between the two genres?

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.990
A large influence in the western falling out
of favour was growing cynicism toward the

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.830
myth of the west and American exceptionalism
post-World War II.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.150
And, let’s face it: The western is not nearly
as flexible as the superhero film, which in

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.200
the Marvel Cinematic Universe encompasses
heist movies (Ant Man), espionage thrillers

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.430
(Captain America: Winter Soldier) and space
operas (Guardians of the Galaxy), among other

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.430
subgenres.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:20.030
Still, shared universe fatigue is a reality
that modern Hollywood will have to face.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.280
Now that Star Wars is branching out into standalone
films and DC is trying their best to catch

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.020
up with the MCU, the blockbuster market is
leaning toward shared universes more and more.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.890
Will the bubble burst on multiverses - and
audiences will, instead, start craving satisfying

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.600
standalone experiences?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.950
The MCU is built to sustain both smaller individual
films and galaxy spanning epics, but dwindling

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.310
audience interest may make billion dollar
ventures like Avengers: Infinity War a bigger

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:53.800
risk than might seem apparent right now.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.200
With a plan going through 2028, it’s clear
the Marvel Cinematic Universe is dedicated

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.700
to keeping its own course.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.530
If it ends, it is going to be on the terms
of Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios, not due

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.850
to external forces such as the performance
of the inevitable Justice League movies or

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:08.970
Avengers: Infinity War.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.350
Will audiences lose interest and prove Spielberg
right, or is this money making machine never

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.350
stopping?

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.350
So what do you think?

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.660
Are you suffering from superhero fatigue or
have you already marked every Marvel opening

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.910
