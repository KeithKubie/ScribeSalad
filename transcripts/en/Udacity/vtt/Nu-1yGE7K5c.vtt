00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.980
We've talked a lot about marketing
goals throughout the course.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.570
Now these goals are really important,
but

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.300
they're not worth anything if all
you do is mention them in a slide.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.820
You need a way to follow them and

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.710
to ensure you're on track
with meatier goals.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.020
&gt;&gt; You have to be honest and

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.390
find the most accurate metrics
to measure these goals.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.920
&gt;&gt; You're looking for

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.050
something that is clear and that will
help you to evaluate your progress.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.640
Think about your car dashboard.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.802
The fuel gauge indicator turns on
the light to transfer the message.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:29.764
No more gas, soon enough,
you won't be able to keep driving.

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:32.788
You need metrics that are so
clear and relevant to your goal,

00:00:32.788 --> 00:00:37.160
that every event tells you something
about the health of your business.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.120
&gt;&gt; Your metrics must
be measured correctly.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.410
You don't want inaccurate or
incomplete data.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.130
This could lead you down the wrong path.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.550
It has to be simple, if it's too
complex to explain how to relate it

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.580
to your business and marketing,
then there's something wrong.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.749
Let's look at our goals for
aBARKment that we created in lesson.two.
