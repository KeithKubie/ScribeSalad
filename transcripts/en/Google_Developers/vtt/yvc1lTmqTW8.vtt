00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:07.990
COLE: Well for all of
you indies out there,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.570
our next presenter
is going to help

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.450
you learn how to
make tons of money,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.800
sell out, and then not be
an indie anymore, right?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.542
Welcome to the stage
Admiral Bob Meese.

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:18.988
BOB MEESE: All right, sir.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.220
Thank you, Cole,
and I'm not Admiral.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.720
All right.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.620
So welcome everybody.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.620
Thanks for the joining
for the continuation

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.580
of the Google
Developer Day today.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.560
I'm here to talk about
making money on Google Play.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.850
So I'm the token
business guy on the day,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.240
and this is actually
based on a presentation

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.410
that myself and colleague of
mine, Brahim, did at Google I/O

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.980
last year.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.780
And so this is
different enough where

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.490
if you want to check that one
out to see what that was about,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.390
you can find it on
YouTube also called

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.190
"Making Money on Google Play."

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.670
So a quick agenda
here, so just quickly

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.670
going to introduce the Play
Games BD team, talk about some

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.730
of the drivers of
the revenue growth

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.710
that we're seeing on Google
Play and mobile in general,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.360
talking about some
developer success stories,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.900
and so covering a variety
of different developers

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.940
from the indies to the
big guys, spending time

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.440
across the full spectrum, and
then going into a bit of a Play

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.305
update on commerce
international.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.980
All right.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.300
So our team, we are growing,
and so the six of us on the top

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.890
are based in the Bay Area.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.840
We're growing quickly.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.320
Jamil on your upper
right started yesterday.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.170
John next to him started
last week, so we're growing.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.670
And then all the
folks on the bottom

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.280
are our international
colleagues so covering

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.530
Japan, Korea, and London.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.750
And so this is our team.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.440
So we appreciate you guys.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.900
Like we love getting
to meet all you guys.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.710
We're still quite small for
the size of Google Play.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.961
You'll see, some of the stats.

00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:56.501
They're definitely
impressive, but we

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:58.710
want to be engaged with
more and more of you guys,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.226
and so we're going
to keep growing.

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:02.850
And just kind of bear with us as
we adjust the size of our team

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.630
to suit all of you guys.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.690
And one last shout out
to-- I had to do this,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.699
but here's my son Isaac.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.802
He's turning two today, so--

00:02:10.802 --> 00:02:12.766
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.129
Biggest thing.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:15.670
He's a gamer.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.090
He likes racing games,
so this is Isaac.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.575
See him on YouTube, what not.

00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:21.880
Cool.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.750
Thanks for that.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.880
That was cool.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.410
So yes.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.410
So in terms of the drivers of
what's happening right now,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.522
I mean, this is well reported,
but the top developers are

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:33.980
definitely breaking
out of the top,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.680
and I'm not going to talk the
whole talk about these guys,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.250
obviously because the
market is much broader,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.910
but you've got to address these
guys because what they're doing

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.535
is really outstanding.

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:45.160
The breakout success
that we're seeing,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.070
the platform level is
certainly driven in much part

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.610
by these guys.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.760
So you look at
GungHo 2012, 2013.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.210
This is all publicly reported.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.904
They're a public-trader company.

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:58.070
You can find this elsewhere,
but it's really notable

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.677
to say more than 6x growth
year on year from GungHo.

00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:04.760
It's really just an
astounding year that they had,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.343
and they're driving
the overall growth

00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:07.843
in the middle of
the games business.

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:09.426
They actually did
an interesting thing

00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:11.320
as well too where
during the last quarter,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.270
they actually broke
out that $1.6 billion,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.390
and it looks pretty
favorable for us, actually.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.960
Google Play is a big deal
worldwide, but especially

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.860
in Japan as well.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.620
And so we're seeing the leading
developers like GungHo really

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.440
doing great things for us and
for the ecosystem as a whole.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.780
Moving on to King, not that 6x
was anything to shout about,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.550
but more than 11x
growth year on year.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.880
These guys just recently filed
IPO and so this information

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.370
was contained there.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.409
They didn't actually breakout
the individual platforms

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.450
in the composition there.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.325
They did actually break
out the mobile piece,

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.090
and so they went
on the mobile side.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.469
Mobile was 10% of
their revenue in 2012,

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:55.510
and last year it was 70%.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.512
And so you can really
see just the growth

00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:58.970
overall that's
happening in mobile,

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.510
that's driving some really big
numbers, the top of the market.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.770
And finally, in
this set Super cell.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.040
So for them, more than
8x growth year on year,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.850
so you're seeing just some
really dramatic and fantastic

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.810
growth here at the top end of
the market with these leading

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.520
developers.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.320
Supercell, as many folks
know, just came to Google Play

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.079
in about the last
six months, and so

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.649
they didn't breakout
by platform,

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.265
but they're really notable
for driving the top market.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:26.330
But as I said,
there's definitely

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.630
many different categories
of successful developers,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.990
and here you have these breakout
successes, the three companies

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.890
that we just talked
about, but the market

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.730
for mobile and for Google Play
is much, much broader than just

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.340
that.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.090
And so there's large
developers like Gameloft

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.812
and like EA that are very, very
important developers for us.

00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:46.770
There's a number of new
developers as well too,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.180
and so the three developers that
I have here, Goodgame Studios,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.870
Pixelberry, and Space Ape, none
of them were on Google Play

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.910
last year at this time.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.650
So it is really
important for us just

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.457
to have a very healthy
ecosystem overall.

00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:02.040
And so it's really important to
recognize the good work that's

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.742
being done by the
new developers.

00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:05.200
And then finally
on the right here,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.000
the small developers,
so both of these teams

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.350
are really gracious,
but the fact

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.320
remains that in
both of these cases,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.535
two people is doing the
majority of the work

00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:15.410
for these developers.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.840
And so it's interesting
and exciting

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.930
to see that that still remains
a true thing within mobile

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.977
is in some cases the
mediocre, they just

00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:25.560
launched a game a
couple of weeks ago,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.990
and it's done quite well.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.260
So we can talk a little
bit more about that.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.580
And it's interesting to note too
that just the tactics change,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.080
right?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.080
So King, another thing they
disclosed was last year,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.650
they spent more
than $300 million

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.030
on mobile user acquisition.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.931
The guys on the right
are spending zero.

00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:45.180
And so it's a really interesting
environment right now

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.554
in terms of the
different tactics

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:51.320
that you can take to success
on mobile and Google Play.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.820
So cool.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.490
So let's move on to
like a little more

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.490
about the 10 developers.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.277
So for the first
three, I'm not going

00:05:56.277 --> 00:05:58.860
to spend much more time there,
but the important thing to note

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.730
is around focus.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.940
And so all three
developers in this case,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.790
they're not getting
their revenue

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.380
from a vast number of games.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.120
So "Puzzle &amp; Dragons"
is driving more than 90%

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.480
of the revenue for
GungHo last year.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.540
And so is that one hit game,
just the focus of just making

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.250
that an amazing experience is
really driving their success.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.980
In the case of King, more than
80% of the revenue for mobile

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.879
and nearly 80% of the revenue
for the whole business

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.170
was driven by "Candy Crush
Saga" in the fourth quarter,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.674
and so there's just a lot of
power in having that hit game.

00:06:30.674 --> 00:06:32.590
In the case of Supercell,
they didn't break it

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.923
out in terms of the competition
between their two games,

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:37.465
but virtually all the revenue,
they have a third one coming.

00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:40.090
But virtually, all their revenue
is coming from just two games.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.200
And so that's clearly
something we're

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.300
seeing as a best practice.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.216
There was a time when
developers are launching

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:47.720
a bunch, a bunch of games, but
what we're seeing right now

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.196
is the message to take from
the folks leading the top,

00:06:50.196 --> 00:06:51.695
and their doing
some amazing things,

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:54.540
but focus is clearly
what's a big part of what's

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.550
winning for these guys.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.340
In terms of the
larger developers,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.798
one of the trends
that we're seeing

00:07:00.798 --> 00:07:02.540
is they're adapting
to free-to-play.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.650
They're amazing game developers,
but free-to-play is definitely

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.010
an art.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.982
There's a lot of folks out there
that love free-to-play games.

00:07:11.982 --> 00:07:13.440
There's other folks
there that feel

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.030
passionately the other way.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.994
And so it's something
where you definitely

00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:18.785
need to make sure that
you're doing it well

00:07:18.785 --> 00:07:20.050
and you're doing it right.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.050
And so to talk a little
bit more about Gameloft,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.570
so they did a really
interesting experiment last year

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.950
where we worked very closely
with them for Asphalt 8.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.710
They actually launched that
game in August of last year

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.840
as a premium game
with an app purchase.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.074
But they had an
explicit experiment,

00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:40.490
which was very cool, to see
how much money they could make

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.700
through in-app
purchase, and could they

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.670
make that game free-to-play.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.480
And so there they
gave themselves

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.270
a couple of months to
develop the economy there,

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.430
and they found now the
game is free-to-play,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.930
but the testing
that they did before

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.450
that in the month up to when
they pushed it free-to-play,

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.830
they were making nearly
3/4 of their revenue

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.480
through in-app purchase,
which was really powerful.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.170
So it went free in
November last year.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.760
They actually
increased their revenue

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.270
by going free-to-play because
they had built up the economy,

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.110
and then they did 24x their
installs in the 30 days

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.890
post the switch versus pre.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.130
So it just really speaks
to revenues of piece,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.810
but just the
engagement they benefit

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.830
from doing this is massive.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.290
And so it was certainly
a success for them,

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.810
and it feels like
Gameloft is definitely

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.379
developing in shops
in terms of being

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:32.670
a great free-to-play developer.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.440
Next big company
is Electronic Arts,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.520
so their "Simpsons" has clearly
been the big win for them.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.320
So in terms of just focus and
learning from those larger

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.520
developers,
"Simpsons" has clearly

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.360
been the breakout
success for EA.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.610
It's been hanging on the top 10,
top grossing for a year plus,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.290
and so that's just a really
impressive accomplishment.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.970
When we think about
EA, just great brands

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.510
are just a core
part of the company.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.810
And so we're really excited to
be working more closely with EA

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.220
to bring-- all of these
brands are there right now.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.860
They continue to
invest in all of them.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.410
The "Simpsons" like they're
just doing great things

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.250
with just the storytellers,
like, if you guys are playing

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.690
the game, you know what I mean,
but if you haven't, the writers

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.430
from the Simpsons are actually
writing the game as well too,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.763
and they're having a ton of fun.

00:09:19.763 --> 00:09:22.120
And so it's quite a fun game.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.820
And there EA is coming
into free-to-play

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.880
where we're not going
to come up here and say,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.380
everybody has to
go to free-to-play,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.963
and we'll definitely
cover that later,

00:09:28.963 --> 00:09:32.120
but if you want to compete
with GungHo and Supercell

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.460
and King, that's been
the dominate model

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.430
to get that level of
success, and so that's

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.260
what EA is shooting
for in mobile.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.160
So the new developers, so
Goodgame, Pixelberry, and Space

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.580
Ape, just talk
about them quickly.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.764
So as I said earlier,
none of these guys

00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:49.680
had a game on Google
Play this time last year,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.744
even kind of the
middle of last year,

00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:53.160
and all have caught
our attention.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.031
So these guys are the
guys to learn from.

00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:58.280
For me, one of the important
goals in this [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.010
is just the other
developers that

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.730
are kind of noteworthy to us
or catch our attention, that's

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.188
how I want to
highlight these guys.

00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:07.290
These are the guys who have done
variation things that we think

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.480
are notable and we want
to hold up for you guys.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.010
And so "Empire, Four
Kingdoms" from Goodgame,

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.005
it just launched on Play
middle of last year.

00:10:16.005 --> 00:10:18.380
It's an interesting company,
because they're a bit bigger

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.805
than Pixelberry and Space Ape.

00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:22.250
These guys, it was
two brothers that

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.330
founded the company
several years ago,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.120
and they were big on
online free-to-play,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.580
but they just came
to mobile last year.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.955
But after that
time and honestly,

00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:33.080
we're just getting to know
these guys a little bit.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.080
I mean, we've met with them,
but they're based in Hamburg,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.175
and so we see them a
little less often than some

00:10:38.175 --> 00:10:39.550
of the folks that
are based here.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.650
But it's really a steady
rise in top grossing,

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.680
reaching the top 10, top
grossing most recently,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.710
and so they're doing
a lot of things right.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.720
And so just please,
there's limited time today

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.590
to go into all the
mechanics of the games,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.640
but just for those of you who
are looking at what's working,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.135
we think that Goodgame
is a really good example.

00:11:02.135 --> 00:11:04.260
So a slightly different
demographic with Pixelberry

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.460
here.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.070
I pick Truth!

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:06.620
I pick Dare!

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.230
I pick just making out!

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.810
So I don't know if this is
everybody's game in the place,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.180
but they've done
some amazing things.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.130
They just started in
the middle of 2012

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.780
and just launched on Play
just a few months ago.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.080
But one thing that's really
interesting about them

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.380
and really differentiated
is passion about story

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.540
and not just saying
that, but if you

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.360
look at the employees
of the company,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.590
a full half of the
people at Pixelberry

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.540
are actually writers.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.260
And so when you
think about that,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.519
that's just a huge
commitment to doing that,

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:38.560
and then you look at the
day one retention number

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.280
and clearly it's
paying off for them.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.670
I mean 71% is massive,
and so these guys, they've

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.680
taken a very story-driven
approach to the business,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.480
and it's working for them.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.440
And one thing too is just
on the bottom left there,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.390
cyberbullying is
something where,

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.500
I spoke to Oliver, the
founder and he was saying,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.520
I wanted to know how he got into
cyberbullying because they're

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.840
doing some really cool
things with Cybersmile, which

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.114
is a cyberbullying charity.

00:12:05.114 --> 00:12:06.780
And he said we had
started the game when

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.620
we were doing this thing and
he was reading more and more

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.540
about cyberbullying.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.110
And he said, we have
this amazing platform

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.270
with "High School Story"
to do something about it.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.020
And so it's actually
really cool that they

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.120
have Cybersmile-inspired
quests, and they've

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.390
had more than two million
people go through them.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:28.450
And they also have a bunch
of different donations

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.780
as well as they've actually
had people who-- cyberbullying

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.950
or even suicidal situations
to be able to help.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.630
So for here, they're
building a business,

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.400
but it's really inspiring
for us that we're

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.620
seeing them do so
much good as well.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.990
And then Space
Ape, new developer

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.110
launched "Samurai Siege" in the
fourth quarter of last year.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.380
Recently formed as well,
just a really talented team.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.280
So these guys really
stand out so a bunch

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.940
of ex-Playfish and Mind
Candy folks based in London.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.010
And so they're just really smart
and really analytical about how

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.105
they run their business, and
that's been quite fun to see.

00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:08.480
And so that for
them, it was just

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.104
how they thought
about their first game

00:13:10.104 --> 00:13:12.140
was just get it
out there, be fast.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.220
They have more on the
pipeline that they're

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.500
really excited
about as well too.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.140
But you can look at
the headline here,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.760
and "Events" is a well-known
structure for just improving

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.460
a variety of metrics
within your game.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.990
There's definitely a
fair amount of investment

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.560
that's required to do that, but
it can work for a lot of folks.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.630
And so "Events" are an area
where Space Ape has really

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.615
chosen to invest and to try
to differentiate itself,

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.740
and so they have a variety
of different tournaments

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.260
that we lay out here, and you
can look at the relative impact

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:40.760
there.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.280
And so the top one is what they
call a personal tournament,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.980
or how they describe is it's
March Madness right now,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.610
so kind of an enunciated bracket
for events within the game

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.660
where it's single player, so
not having to join an alliance,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.120
multiround, and at
the end of that,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.230
you have one single
winner through

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.880
that personal tournament.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.870
In the second one we
have the "War Rush,"

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.830
so that's just a compression of
the existing "Alliance Wars,"

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.360
but rather than 12 hours, you
move it down to three hours,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.400
and you get a lot of
good things in terms

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.594
of just the engagement in
the game during that time,

00:14:12.594 --> 00:14:14.010
but as you can
imagine, that might

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.301
be a little tiring as well too.

00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:18.580
So they're iterating on a bunch
of different event structures,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.920
and as you can see
here, they're measuring,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.700
what was the effort level
required to support that?

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.427
What did it do to our metrics
in terms of retention engagement

00:14:26.427 --> 00:14:27.010
modernization?

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.950
And then onto the small
developer category.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.420
So as I mentioned
earlier, some really

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.660
stand-out folks with Vector
Unit and with Mediocre,

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.570
where it's largely for
both of these companies,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.710
about two people, which
is really quite amazing.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.030
And the point here
is that there's

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.940
a bunch of rules where for the
large developers, if you're

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.670
looking to raise money,
build a business,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.760
you have kind of a
different set of things,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.800
and I think for the
large developers,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.480
it's more important to follow
best practices where it can

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.070
be-- you're a bit
more constrained.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.270
With these guys, if you have a
cost structure of two people,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.140
you can kind of do
whatever you want,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.910
and these guys are showing that.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.270
So for Vector Unit with "Riptide
GP2," their state of premium

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.967
game and [INAUDIBLE]
is two people

00:15:16.967 --> 00:15:18.300
have done a great job with that.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.750
As I mentioned earlier,
so no paid advertising,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.172
so that they do an amazing job
engaging with our community,

00:15:24.172 --> 00:15:25.880
so they were doing a
lot of work in terms

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.620
of getting early APKs out
to developers and reviewers,

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.080
doing a bunch of social media,
doing a bunch of cross-promo

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.670
in several of their existing
games, and for them,

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.980
just taking a very sort
of throwback approach

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.010
and just not doing
pay-use acquisition.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.140
For them too, they work
very closely with us

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.700
where they actually
were part of our keynote

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.636
last year at Google I/O
Show, where we presented some

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:51.630
of the multiplayer earlier,
they were basically

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.810
the reference game for that.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.440
So I mean, these guys are
super easy to work with,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.090
and one demonstration
of that is like,

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.160
hey, you guys mind if I'm going
to talk about you guys at GDC,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.380
and they're like, yeah, sure.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.879
Here's all our
revenue for the game.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.697
And so these guys
are like super open.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.780
You can't quite do this
with like the bigger guys,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.590
but this is what the game did.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.000
So this is their
Google Play revenue,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.530
and so here you can see when you
have that premium style though,

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.170
you are going to spike
early, and even though they

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.480
do have enough
purchase in the game,

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.540
it does taper off after
that initial purchase

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.320
cycle is through.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.653
But for them, they're driving
a quarter of their revenue

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.400
through in-app
purchases of the game.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.700
And for them the message
here is, this is a success.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.310
it's clearly a success
for Vector Unit.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.720
If you're a larger company, this
is a more challenging thing,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.230
but for smaller developers,
it's really important

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.100
that we have diversity
in the ecosystem

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.840
and you have developers
that are making

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.555
amazing games of
this quality, and you

00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:50.180
can have a different
product out there.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.130
There's a bunch of premium
gamers still on Google Play

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.270
even though the in-app
purchase is the dominant way

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.909
that revenue is
generated, so these guys

00:16:57.909 --> 00:16:59.450
are a great example
of somebody who's

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.870
having success doing that.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.369
Then more recently, some
guys at Mediocre based out

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.530
of Sweden who I've known for
the last several years, so

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.030
interesting game
with "Smash Hit."

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.759
It's blown up right now if
you guys haven't seen it.

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:15.740
It launched In the
last couple of weeks,

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.156
but they have an
interesting model

00:17:17.156 --> 00:17:19.770
where it's free
with level unlocks.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.790
So it's pretty basic
modernization in some ways,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.950
but it's not
something where you're

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.826
going to have players pay
you over and over again.

00:17:27.826 --> 00:17:29.200
I asked these guys
the other day,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.340
I said, is it possible for
me to pay you more than $2

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.530
for this game?

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.544
And they said no.

00:17:34.544 --> 00:17:35.960
And so there's a
lot of developers

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.494
that aren't willing to make that
trade-off, but these guys have.

00:17:39.494 --> 00:17:40.910
And so some of the
changes they've

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.770
made from their previous games,
so the example of "Sprinkle."

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.020
Previously, they had separate
APKs for a free and a premium

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.490
game, but it's a bit of
an awkward experience.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.420
And so in this case,
for "Smash Hit,"

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.650
they've actually condensed
that into a single APK.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.750
And so it starts free and then
you have a premium unlock,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.147
which is a really
nice way to do things.

00:17:59.147 --> 00:18:01.230
And there in terms of the
approach that they take,

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.530
so just really
highly-polished games.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.160
So getting folks,
it doesn't hurt

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.660
that I'm talking
about it now, but I

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.660
think they have a lot of
just folks who are just

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.170
passing the game
to their friends,

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.830
showing it to their
friends, really focusing on

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.230
that sort of word-of-mouth
is their approach to getting

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.350
the word out.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.450
And again, too, they have other
games they can cross-promo.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.920
They did some PR,
but again, no ads,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.010
so it is possible
to go that route.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.770
In terms of monetization
results, as I mentioned,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.430
the game has-- it's a free
game with a premium unlock.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.780
And so there, you play
through and they say,

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.450
hey, you have
these check points.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.487
It's basically a way
to save your progress

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:42.070
across the various
levels of the game,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.176
and so you play through rather
than having to start over

00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:46.550
all the way at
the beginning, you

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.440
can save your progress at a
bunch of intermediate points.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.450
There is really clear user value
that's created in doing that.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.240
It's relatively simple, but
it's also very effective.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.940
In terms of the early results,
that's kind of remarkable.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.040
It's under two weeks.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.430
I've just been
refreshing my phone,

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.140
but they actually hit number
one on Top Free on Google Play

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.310
yesterday.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.380
It's pretty amazing that
two guys can do that.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.140
And as I said, the
monetization is basic,

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.610
and I don't know if it will
exactly follow the "Riptide

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.024
GP2" curve, but these
guys will likely

00:19:15.024 --> 00:19:16.690
spike early in terms
of the monetization

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.330
just because folks like
myself, as much as I would like

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.440
to pay them more than $2 for
the game, I can't, right?

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.400
But they have hit Top 100,
top grossing right now too,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.680
so I mean, they are making
good money on the game.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.880
So that was a quick recap
of a lot of the developers

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.000
that we think are doing
really exceptional things

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.500
for their businesses,
for Google Play,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.340
and should be role
models for a lot

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.783
of the folks in the ecosystem.

00:19:40.783 --> 00:19:42.715
So just a quick
update on our side

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:44.340
in terms of some of
the things we hear.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.190
So I mean, I know all you
guys talk to each other,

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.557
but in terms of like
there are some themes

00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:52.140
I just wanted to share with you
guys in terms of what we hear.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.532
And so some of the developers
will come to us and say,

00:19:55.532 --> 00:19:56.490
here's all our metrics.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.907
Here's Google Play where I
think you guys could do better.

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:00.406
And so I don't know
if you guys have

00:20:00.406 --> 00:20:02.110
a sense of what
do developers say

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.330
we need to work
on at Google Play?

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.038
Do you guys know?

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.450
So the answer is conversion.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.500
So it's one of the things
we hear most often where

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.000
we have great
engagement, like we have

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.740
a ton of engagement
on Google Play.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.987
Like the payers who
were done, like they're

00:20:18.987 --> 00:20:20.570
spending a bunch of
money on the game,

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.260
but it's the conversion
piece where we would really

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.330
like to see you
guys, Google, work

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.980
on helping us convert more
of our players into payers.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.150
And so that's something
where we hear that,

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.840
and so how do we want to do it?

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.340
Right?

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.097
So we've had [INAUDIBLE]
billing programs that

00:20:36.097 --> 00:20:38.612
have been in place
for a number of years.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:40.695
Gift cards have started
to roll out more recently,

00:20:40.695 --> 00:20:42.400
but are really
catching momentum,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.440
and we're expending
that more broadly.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.860
Supporting other
forms of payment.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.450
We're exploring a variety
of different options

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.040
and even for credit card, too.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.990
One of things we're
focused on is just

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.680
enabling more and more
people to be payment

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.140
ready to have their credit
card on file with Google

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.930
and with Google Play.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.544
And so how are we
planning to do this?

00:21:01.544 --> 00:21:03.960
And of course, the answer to
this one is all of the above.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.890
And so, we're pursuing all
of these things in parallel.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.080
And so payments is one of
the big things for us too,

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.810
so all the great
work the developers

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.250
are doing to make
money on the platform.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.250
A big focus for us right now,
in some ways it's not sexy,

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.042
but it's really important, where
if you have that player who

00:21:22.042 --> 00:21:23.750
has found your game,
installed your game,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.220
is playing your game, loves
your game, wants to pay for it

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.830
and just gets caught at that
part of the process, that

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.420
really just feels
like it's something

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.230
that shouldn't happen.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.080
And so it's something
we're spending

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.000
a lot of time
focusing on ourselves.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.620
And so I'll just cover a
couple of things there.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.300
So in terms of
international, so Google Play

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.605
is strong worldwide,
but there's a variety

00:21:42.605 --> 00:21:45.010
of markets on the left that
are some of the largest

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.440
markets for us now, on the right
some of the fastest growing.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.240
It's just a remarkable
platform for us

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.781
as we travel more
parts of the world.

00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:54.670
And we just see the
growth of Android

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.275
and the growth of Google Play.

00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:58.750
It's just remarkable
and humbling.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.270
And from a payments perspective
though, supporting payments

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.990
well in all these
places is not simple.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.180
And so it's something
that definitely

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.770
has taken some time to work on.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.267
So this is available online
as well too but just kind

00:22:11.267 --> 00:22:13.100
of presenting it here,
I think is important.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.810
The direct carrier
billing side, there's

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.470
a variety of markets like Japan
like Korea like the United

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.790
States where we have
direct carrier billing

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.280
deals with all the major
carriers in those markets.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.320
And so those three countries are
some of our largest for sure,

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.590
and we believe that definitely
a contributing reason to that

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.760
is that the strength
of the payments options

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.680
that are available in those
markets, and we continue.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.480
I mean, this list every
week or every couple

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.480
of weeks this list is
getting longer and longer.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.980
This is definitely
an area where,

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.440
in some markets in particular,
where direct carrier billing is

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.370
a big focal point for consumers.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.760
It's something we're adding.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.770
And similarly for gift cards.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.827
So for gift cards, there
are fewer countries

00:22:52.827 --> 00:22:55.160
that are supported, so as I
mentioned for direct carrier

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.868
billing, there is more
than 20 countries.

00:22:56.868 --> 00:22:59.140
For gift cards, it's
seven at the moment.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.680
But they are some of the
most recent countries that

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.714
would have been able to--
gift cards have been Germany

00:23:04.714 --> 00:23:07.130
in the middle part of last
year and saw a nice bump there,

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.530
and then most recently
Japan just in December,

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.450
and so we had a market as
strong as Japan with the numbers

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.490
that you saw for
"Puzzle &amp; Dragons,"

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.440
and there, all of
2013, we had gift cards

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.100
for all of the last couple
of weeks of that year.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.060
And so as we add more and
more forms of payment,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.480
it enables just an
overall better ecosystem

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.820
across the way, too.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.440
And so on the left, is the
countries on the right,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.750
it's just a sampling of
the US, as an example

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.650
of a country where you have
the best coverage of gift cards

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.070
were based here, but a
variety of retailers there.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.820
So you'll start seeing
that more and more.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.120
We're supporting Google Play
branding with above-the-line TV

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.760
campaigns, and you'll see
the Google Play gift cards

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.217
in more and more retailers.

00:23:49.217 --> 00:23:50.300
So that's about it for me.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.420
So I just wanted to say
thank you from all of us

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:57.250
on the Play Games BD team,
and yeah, find me after.
