00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.680
With both sides stuck in a hard stalemate, they knew this war wasn't going to be about taking territory,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.040
but about simply wearing each other down.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.600
The Allies had plenty of men to expend from its overseas dominions.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.780
And the British also started a naval blockade,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.160
so Germany couldn't import stuff, like food.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.660
Neither side really wanted a long grueling war, though.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.500
So, they both thought of ways to break the deadlock on the western front.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.860
Idea number one: New Frontiers.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.380
When the war first broke out Australia was quick to take German New Guinea

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.640
The Allies also quickly jumped on Germany's colonies in Africa,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.000
and particularly in German East Africa,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.060
locals were enlisted as soldiers and carriers by both sides.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.860
Leading to a tragic loss of life for the Native Africans.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.280
Some new combatants entered the war as well.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.760
The Allies newest friends were Italy,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.620
and Japan.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.060
Japan was busy building itself an empire.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.780
So, it was more than happy to take away German Islands and colonies in East Asia

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.360
Italy actually had an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary before the war.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.320
But after some tense relations,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.240
and then the Allies promising to give them some of Austria-Hungary's stuff,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.800
they switched sides.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.020
Italy opened up a front in the mountains here,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.920
but like everyone else,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.900
they were stuck in stalemate for most of the war.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.240
The Central Powers' new friend was a struggling empire in the middle East.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.560
The Ottomans....

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.240
(Ottomen?)

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.260
The Ottomen where divided on whether to actually join the war or not,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.640
since they had been exhausted by the recent Balkan Wars.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.480
Some of the politicians who did want to join went off on their own and fired some shells at Russia.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.860
And then came back and said,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.960
"Whoops, looks like we're at war now."

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.000
The Ottoman entry into the war was of particular concern to the British,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.419
since the middle East was full of oil and Britain wanted all of that oil.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.258
First, the Ottomans tried to attack Russia in the Caucasus Mountains.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.500
But they weren't prepared for the cold and many of them froze to death.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.440
Then they crossed miles of desert to take the Suez Canal from the British.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.800
But that failed, too.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.540
Then the Allies tried to take the Dardanelles at Gallipoli in a long and hard trench warfare campaign....

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.860
but that also failed.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.760
The Ottomans blamed their initial losses on the ethnic Armenians living within Ottoman territory.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.660
And the resulting Armenian genocide

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.060
led to the deaths of one and a half million people.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.440
Then, the Germans sent spies into Afghanistan

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.100
to try to convince the Arab tribes there to rise up in Jihad against the British

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.080
and attack India.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.700
But that plan failed. Partly because the spies got bored, brewed their own alcohol, and got drunk....

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.460
which is a bad thing to do in Afghanistan.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.760
All these new Frontiers hadn't done much to change the war.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.920
Aware that the Allies had more men and supplies than them,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.620
the Germans knew they had to do something to break the stalemate.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.120
Before the war, there was a big conference that set out the rules of Modern warfare:

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.360
No chemical weapons,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.620
no killing civilians.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.760
Basically: Don't be jerks.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.500
The Germans held a meeting, and decided to be jerks.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.080
Zeppelin air raids commenced over British cities,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.040
they also started attacking the ally trenches with chlorine gas,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.540
and they used submarines to sink civilian ships.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.380
One such civilian ship was the Lusitania

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.340
which had a hundred and fifty-nine Americans on board when it was sunk.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.140
Further swaying US opinion against the Germans.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.460
Not to be completely unfair to the Germans,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.960
the Allies also engaged in chemical warfare soon after,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.440
and they had been hiding anti-submarine weapons on their civilian ships.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.620
Which led the Germans justify their attacks.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.580
Meanwhile, Austria-Hungary still hadn't dealt with Serbia,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.860
so the central powers enlisted some help.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.080
Bulgaria wished it was bigger and was still bitter about

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.620
losing the second Balkan war.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.540
The Central Powers promised to make all of Bulgaria's wildest dreams come true if they helped.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.400
So they signed on and together they knocked out Serbia.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.440
The Serbian troops retreated through Albania

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.920
which was neutral but had some ties to Austria-Hungary.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.820
So, Austria-Hungary entered Albania in a 'friendly invasion' to chase down the Serbians

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.660
many of whom escaped by sea.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.060
It's 1916 and a lot is happening.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.160
As if they didn't have enough enemies already,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
Germany added one more to the list.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.020
Portugal had been getting a bit chummy with the allies behind the scenes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.960
and Germany didn't like that one bit.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.940
Around the same time, the only sea battle of the war happened.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.920
Both sides had a new powerful class of battleships called "Dreadnought."

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.740
But they were so expensive to build that neither side wanted to risk losing them in a battle.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.020
So they kept them in port. Except for one time when they had a big fight and a bunch of them got damaged.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.180
So they didn't try that again. The UK started conscripting men to the army so they had plenty of reserves.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.660
Which is just as well because the western front was about to get brutal.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.280
The longest and one of the bloodiest battles of the war started

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.100
when the Germans launched an attack around the French city of Verdun.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.100
The French defended it desperately,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.840
leading to hundreds of thousands of casualties.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.800
Under pressure, the French called on its allies to do something to draw the Germans' attention away.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.140
So, the British started their own long and brutal fight, the Battle of the Somne,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.380
with 60,000 British casualties on just the first day.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.240
It was also here that the British first used one crazy brand-new piece of Sci-Fi technology.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.320
The Russians had been getting pushed back further and further into their own territory,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.030
but in response to the French call for help,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.560
they began a huge offensive

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.720
and did really well until they ran out of supplies and got stuck.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.600
Seeing how well the Russians have been doing

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.780
Romania decided now would be a great time to jump in on win the war.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.740
And then they got pounded.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.920
The Greeks were fighting amongst themselves about whether to join the war or not

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.860
The king liked the Central powers while the prime minister wanted to join the Allies.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.720
After a brief national Schism during which the country split into two,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.800
the king finally abdicated and the country reunited.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.600
With Allied help they began a new offensive.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.280
In the Middle East, Russia was pushing into Ottoman territory from the North.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.100
The British had also made a landing in Mesopotamia to protect Persia's oil fields.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.820
And they'd also sent a small army up the Tigris river to try to take Baghdad

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.600
but the army got sieged in the town of Kut along the way

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.000
And eventually surrendered.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.300
A new offensive was launched from the south with all-out desert warfare.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.140
The offensive was aided by one famous British officer, better known as Lawrence of Arabia,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.980
who helped to lead the Arab tribes in a revolt that wreaked Havoc on the Ottoman supply lines.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.640
By the time 1917 rolled around everyone was exhausted.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.820
There are mutinies in the French army, the German populace was starving,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.820
and the war had drained all of Russia's supplies.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.520
There is no clear winner, and it was still anyone's war.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.500
The only question now was: Who is going to break first?

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.540
And the answer was: Russia.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.500
Tired of not eating and mad that a crazy magic homeless guy was calling some of the shots

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.440
there was an uprising in Petrograd complete with riots and strikes.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.340
The riots turned into a full-scale revolution

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.400
and a new government overthrew the Tsar.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.480
Then a few months later the Bolsheviks overthrew the new government.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.360
And they pulled Russia out of the war.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.140
This was great news for Germany that now only had to focus on the western front.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.660
But there was still one problem:

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.320
The pesky United States of America was looking increasingly like it was going to join the war.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.500
America had been selling supplies to the Allies throughout the war

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.440
and was getting super rich off the back of it.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.260
Meaning it was in fantastic shape and was dangerous to the Germans.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.020
So Germany sent a telegram to Mexico saying:

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.680
"Wouldn't it be crazy cool if you guys attacked America?"

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.100
But the British intercepted the message, showed it to the Americans, and that was the final straw.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.700
American troops began shipping out to Europe.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.589
This was terrible news for Germany.

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.260
And they knew their only hope now is to force France and the UK to surrender

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.519
before the fresh American troops arrived. It was now or never.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.440
So they started one final attack.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.920
They converged their troops and hit hard at the Somme

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.060
and pushed the Allies back.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.820
They hit a second time for the north, then again, and again.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.020
With each hit the germans were spending more and more resources

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.120
while the allies were getting better and better at repelling their attacks.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.700
By the fifth punch, the Allies held the line and even pushed back.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.900
With American troops now arriving in larger numbers

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.800
the Allies launched a counter-attack, and that was it.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.920
The central powers were being pushed back on all fronts.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.940
Bulgaria collapsed first, followed by the Ottoman Empire,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.460
then Austria-Hungary and finally on November 11th, 1918 at 11 o'clock, Germany surrendered.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.060
At the peace treaty Germany was forced to

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.540
reduce its military, accept war guilt, and pay the bill for the war.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.580
After indescribable suffering and millions dead, the world learned its lesson

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.580
and never had such an awful war again.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.860
For about 20 years.
