00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.110
Once again the solution is pretty straightforward. If an entity is alive, we

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.480
call its update function. Otherwise, we push it onto the deferredKill list.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.315
Once the entire list has been iterated, we are then free to walk the deferred

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:13.771
list again. Erase any of the entities that are referenced there from the

00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.651
original list, and then of course at the end, we clear the final deferredKill

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:21.010
list, so that we don't try to delete entities that don't exist anymore.
