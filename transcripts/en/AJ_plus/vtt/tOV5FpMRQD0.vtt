00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
It is 11 a.m. on a Sunday in the San
Francisco Bay Area and I am headed to

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.859
brunch.
It's an unusual scene for me because

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.010
where I grew up
the type of dedication I'm showing to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.540
eggs was reserved for this.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.680
Church -- where the enthusiasm comes from food for the Soul and not the stomach.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.390
Today, fewer people in the United States
are keeping the faith. Protestants no

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.980
longer make up the majority of U.S . adults.
Yet, discussions about evangelicals

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.570
seemingly dominate the political
landscape.  We're going to protect

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.050
Christianity. The right to keep and bear
arms it's not bestowed by man but

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.430
granted by God and Christians
overwhelmingly.  Made up the majority of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.110
Congress in 2016. So how does this
national focus on Christians affect

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.550
their perceptions, their politics, their
beliefs, and the nation?  So I believe that

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.289
many people believe evangelicals are
part of a political party rather than a

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.470
subset of the Christian faith. The word
evangelical is sort of been hijacked and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.440
has become to be known as more of a
right-wing

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.140
purist type of political term. Hey fam. I'm Imaeyen. This is AJ+  and this Sunday

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.560
we've traveled in hopes of finding out
what it really means to be an

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.549
evangelical and whether faith and
politics should be interwoven.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.140
Only 6% of adults in the U.S. are
evangelicals, and yet the candidates and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.560
the news media were obsessed with them.
And they still are.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.240
How much support do you think Donald Trump has within the evangelical community?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.740
God bless the great state of Florida.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.600
It's revenge of white America.
It is revenge of evangelical right-wingers.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.040
And I noticed a curious
thing.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.400
Whenever I would hear the word evangelical, it was almost always synonymous with white Christians.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.700
And a series of campaign controversies didn't stop him from winning 81% of the white evangelical vote.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.380
This overwhelmingly
white depiction of evangelicals is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.240
vastly different from what I had known
growing up as a kid in the south.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.180
These images made me question the actual
definition of evangelical and who gets

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.480
to be one. Are they evangelical? Or them?
To be evangelical means different things

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.140
to different people and that's part of
the reason why it's so difficult to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.020
define the term.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.360
To get a better understanding of the
term evangelical, and the people who

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.520
identify as such, I visited one of the
most Bible-minded cities in America:

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.880
Houston Texas.
That's where I met Avis Blake-Thomas.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.100
An evangelical Christian really is -- in my
opinion -- about the basic doctrines, the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.280
basic beliefs, the core beliefs of
Christianity.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.900
Evangelical Christian to me s a little bit of redundancy because every Christian knows that one of the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.000
key components of being a Christian is
to spread the good news -- to spread the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.440
gospel of Jesus Christ.
Blake-Thomas is a pastor

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.120
and co-founded the open Bible Academy, a nonprofit organization that gives free theological

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.180
biblical training. She says she's seen
the word evangelical be co-opted. You

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.500
have people that identify as evangelical
but don't share evangelical belief. I am

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.960
an evangelical, but not from a political
viewpoint. I'm an evangelical from the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.660
basic understanding of what it means for
the Christian faith.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.600
She believes many of the people identified as evangelicals are totally unfamiliar with the Bible,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.920
the tenants of the Christian faith, and
the history of evangelism. In most cases

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.600
Christians in America, particularly today,
don't have a good understanding of the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.500
Bible. So, they don't know what they
believe. They don't understand that it's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.520
more than going to a two-hour service on
Sunday. The evangelical movement began as

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.560
a populist revolt in the 18th and 19th
centuries. It was anti-intellectual and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.200
anti-elitist, and it was often spread by
untutored preachers who used common

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.280
storytelling to spread their message.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.500
And then a little quirky decade called the 1980s happened.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.320
The 80s are when a former
actor named Ronald Reagan -- who was

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.800
divorced and rarely attended church --
watched an alliance between the

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.800
Republican Party and religious leaders
emerge --one that helped him win the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.540
White House. It was a political act by
the political right which created the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.860
religious right. It was politically
created for the sake of the Republican Party.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.120
Christian writer and evangelical Jim Wallis

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.500
says the GOP's plan was a
concerted effort.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.680
Literally there were operatives, political operatives, from the right who came to mega-church pastors

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.060
and said,  "I'll make you a household word.
Give me your list." And that's how they

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.800
created the Religious Right. Soon faces
like this one became one of those

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.300
associated with the religious right.
That's conservative activist Jerry

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.580
Falwell and along with the political
action group called the Moral Majority.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.340
He pushed for a more conservative
religious agenda. The Moral Majority

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.520
mobilized conservative Christians in
politics. Wallis says Falwell's

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.480
politics and interpretation of the faith
represented a major change in how

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.260
evangelicals were seen. Before Falwell,
people like evangelist Billy Graham were

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.340
the face and the voice of mainstream
Christianity in the United States.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.840
Do you love God? Do you love him with all your
heart? With all your soul and your mind?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.220
And by Wallis' definition, this guy is
also an evangelical.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.480
King spoke frankly about the racial divisions within the
American Christian Church.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.700
And actually this obelisk behind me is dedicated to
his memory outside a modern chapel in Houston, Texas.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.040
I think it is one of the tragedies of our nation,  one of the

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.180
shameful tragedies that 11 o'clock on
Sunday morning is one of the most

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.920
segregated hours and if not the most
segregated hours in Christian America.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.060
50 years after King's assassination the
exact same problem still plagues the

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.020
American Christian Church, racial
division, according to Wallis.  And we saw

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.900
that firsthand in the aftermath of the
2016 election cycle when the vast

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.880
majority of white evangelicals voted for
Donald Trump but the majority of

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.060
evangelicals of color didn't. Evangelicals, if they're gonna be really

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.200
evangelical, should name and denounce
racism as a sin from their pulpits. How

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.240
many white churches have done that?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.080
You're a chosen race. You're not a black Christian or a white Christian. You're a Christian who's white or a Christian who's black.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.740
Pastor Ikki Soma says part of what
keeps the church divided is the

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.900
variation and how black and white
parishioners see the world.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.440
For many white evangelical Christians and black evangelical Christians, the way that they

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.160
view the world is different even though
they read the same Bible and trust the

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.900
same Jesus. The lenses that we study the
Bible through this colored by our

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.340
culture. Soma is a Japanese born U.S.
citizen who grew up attending mostly

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:01.140
white churches and was naturalized 15
years ago. He doesn't identify as either

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.880
a Republican or a Democrat, but says he's
seen how politics is intersected with

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.840
religion. In fact when you hear the term
evangelical you're probably more likely

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.720
to see it presented this way.
Jesus himself gave us the flu shot. A

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.520
person for their Christian convictions
is going to be put in jail because they

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.620
refuse to bow to a decision that is
suspect at best. You're gonna be held

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:30.900
seriously, seriously to account by God if
you don't vote.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.420
The word evangelical has a different meaning in the United States than it does internationally, according

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.560
to Wallis. And he says that's because
the U.S. does a poor job of

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.460
representing people of color in general.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.120
In fact, there are more than two billion Christians
worldwide, according to Pew. That's about

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.520
a third of the global population and
Christians are so widespread that no one

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.500
region can claim to be the center of
global Christianity.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.580
About 26% of Christians live in Europe, 37% in the Americas, and sub-Saharan Africa is home

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.540
to 24% of the population. For Wallis
being a Christian means a commitment to

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.540
the Bible, Jesus, and the poor.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.320
"America first," for example, is a heresy.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.240
It's not "America first," it's Jesus first. But if our
gospel isn't good news to the poor,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:23.020
it is not the gospel of Jesus Christ, period.
And white evangelicals in America are

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.500
not known to have a gospel that is good
news to the poor.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.140
The Bible also has two thousand verses about the poor compared to just twelve on homosexuality, according to

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.160
Wallis, but you've
probably heard much more about those verses on homosexuality in news coverage.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.460
We're talking about marriage. We're talking about an institution that has survived and served this civilization

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.240
for over 5,000 years with one definition.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:53.980
You are never going to stop AIDs until you stop treating homosexual sodomy as a civil right and start treating it

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.380
as a form of conduct to avoid.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.180
Do these types of depictions really mean that the news

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.780
media doesn't understand religion?
Wallis  thinks so. And he says that the

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.700
news media's portrayal of faith is a big
part of the problem.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:12.520
Media, who are not very faith friendly, like to paint Christians in the worst possible way.  And

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:19.680
And so if you make religious right synonymous with Christian or evangelical synonymous

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.440
with white evangelical then that makes
Christians look bad.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.240
If the media have a religious literacy problem, it's not alone. Americans don't know much

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.160
about religion. Pew Research says that
those most likely to be knowledgeable

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.620
about religion in the U.S. have an
advanced college degree. This lack of

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.340
understanding may explain the public's
perception -- a perception that makes it

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.580
much more difficult for self-identified
Christians, according to Blake-Thomas.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.680
Those of us who are true evangelicals
get a bad rap because they see the

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.900
evangelical term used in the political
sphere. The challenge is that in the

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:02.000
marketplace when people hear the term
"evangelical," and they then see how those same

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.500
people their values may not match or
their understanding does not seem to match ours.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.560
She says she believes it's just one reason why the Christian faith is on the decline in the U.S.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.480
When you have people that just simply identify with it from a political standpoint, they don't

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.680
bring to the table those same sets of
beliefs. They they see it as political expediency

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.140
versus a belief system versus a part of religion.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.640
So how do evangelicals go about fixing what seems to be a public relations problem?

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.320
Well the first thing
can be realizing that faith doesn't have a political party.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.500
We shouldn't be religious right or really just left. I don't take that on either. We should be Christians.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.340
It's Jesus first.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.920
And just because you're evangelical,  it
doesn't mean that you don't struggle

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.180
with understanding issues of identity,
race,  gender,  and sex.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:02.780
The Christian can still struggle with sins like racism,
prejudice, and things like that.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:09.740
So I would say the place that the church has in politics is [to] encourage their members to be upright citizens.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.300
Either we're Christian or we're not. And we will be known by our fruit that we bear.
