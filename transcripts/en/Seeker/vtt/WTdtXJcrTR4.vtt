00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:11.910
Just like flowers, we humans are also fully
capable of producing Volatile Organic Compounds.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.700
Hey there flowering buds, Jules here for DNews!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.570
As you know, plants are usually anchored to
the ground and can’t go anywhere.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.800
But somehow, despite their relative immobility,
plants are actually surprisingly good at staying

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.500
alive and defending themselves.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.330
A recent study in the journal Functional Ecology
found that certain plants, when damaged, will

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.900
emit a chemical that wards off insects.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.960
When neighboring plants sense the chemical,
they too begin to excrete it, creating a little

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.890
smelly, defensive plant pocket.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.310
The excretions are called “Volatile Organic
Compounds” or VOCs.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.681
Although you may think of the word volatile
here as having a negative connotation, the

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:50.880
word actually means that the chemicals being
secreted are able to quickly evaporate and

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.880
enter the air.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.039
And plants use VOCs to fulfill a lot of functions.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.769
Sweet smelling VOCs are used to attract pollinators,
which is why some flowers give off a pleasant

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:00.800
scent.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.760
Roses release volatile organic compounds like
Rose Oxide, Damascenone and ionone, which

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.660
we associate with the smell of roses.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.930
And when it comes to defense, plants have
a few smelly tricks up their sleeve.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.690
The VOC 3-pentanol, for example, is an insect
pheromone, and can be produced by broccoli,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.720
cabbage, and brussel sprouts.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.700
When these plants become infested with very
hungry caterpillars, they give off 3-pentanol,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.790
which attracts several insects, including
what is called, the “kissing bug”, an

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.170
insect that sucks the blood of caterpillars.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.080
Instead of having to fight their own battles,
these plants simply summon swarms of bugs

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.500
to take over for them.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.910
Those bugs get big juicy caterpillars to feast
on, while the plants are left to recover and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.730
rebuild, sparing any neighboring plants as
well.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.330
Wow, way to make others fight battles for
you, PLANTS.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.390
This natural defense system is also used by
farmers to protect their crops.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.420
Some pesticides are based on synthetically
derived chemicals that are the same as or

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.420
mimic the chemicals produced by plants with
strong defense systems.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.310
But chemicals aren’t the only way plants
can fight back.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.320
If you’ve ever reached for a rose and been
stabbed by its thorns, you’ve stumbled onto

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.030
another defensive technique.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.190
Many plants have thorns, spines, prickles,
barbs, or any other name for hard, sharp,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.470
protruding body parts.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.450
Their primary purpose is to prevent herbivores
from chowing down, as the spiky-defense mechanism

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.230
can hurt the predator, telling them to stay
away and find food elsewhere.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.410
So while plants may not have wings or legs
or really any way to escape pests, they’ve

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.670
found ways to fight them with other defense
mechanisms.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.250
All they really want is to be left alone.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.000
So that covers animals eating plants, but
what about animal-eating plants?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.450
Yeah, there are certain types of plants that
can eat animals from insects to small rodents!

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.600
I know that sounds crazy right, find out more
in this video right here.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.970
And what is the most dangerous plant, in your
opinion?
