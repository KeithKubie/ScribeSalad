00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.594
All right.
What we are working on today is

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:23.405
we are still talking about
buffers.

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:28.000
This is from the handout from
Friday.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.965
And we will be continuing
throughout today and probably a

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:38.972
little bit on Wednesday on
acid-base titrations.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:43.766
This is all in the acid-base
equilibrium unit.

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:49.838
We were talking about buffers.
And so a buffering agent is

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:56.549
something where you can add acid
or base and the pH stays pretty

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.253
much neutral.
You usually add an acid and its

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:05.759
conjugate base in the form of a
salt, or you add a base and its

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.375
conjugate acid in the form of a
salt.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.992
You have a dynamic equilibrium
going.

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:15.353
And when you add acid or base,
the buffering system acts as a

00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:19.641
source of protons or a sink of
protons to keep the pH pretty

00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:22.839
much constant.
Let's work through a buffering

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:28.000
problem and consider first the
initial buffering material.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.076
And then what happens if you
add something to it,

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:35.813
you stress the system,
add an acid or a base,

00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:39.550
how the pH is affected by that.
In this case,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.052
we are adding one mole of an
acid and 0.5 moles of its

00:01:44.052 --> 00:01:49.317
conjugate base in the form of a
salt, the form of a sodium salt

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.800
in this case.
And they are added together,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.000
and you add water and bring the
total volume up to one liter.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.406
And you are given information
about the Ka of this particular

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:09.543
acid and asked to calculate the
pH under these conditions.

00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:13.508
You can write this out,
as we've seen before,

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:19.095
as an acid in water leading to
hydronium ions and the conjugate

00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:22.159
base.
And you can set up a table to

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.566
see how much you have in the
beginning and what you will have

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:32.077
at equilibrium.
We can set up this initial

00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:36.312
molarity, change in molarity and
equilibrium molarity.

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:39.589
But this time we have something
different.

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.824
Now we have acid and the
conjugate base when we start.

00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:48.139
In the problems we have looked
at, up until this point,

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.694
these guys were both zero when
we started, but in a buffer

00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:56.929
problem it is not zero.
You have some amount in there.

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.723
And so we had one mole in one
liter, or molarity of 1.5 moles

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:06.620
in one liter or 0.5 molar.
Now, as it comes to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.373
equilibrium, we have the same
kind of change.

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:13.614
We have minus x over here,
plus x here,

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:17.111
and plus x here.
And then, at equilibrium,

00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:21.717
we would have 1 minus x,
x, and 0.5 plus x on the other

00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:23.167
side.
And, really,

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:27.517
a lot of the trick to doing
these buffer problems is

00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:32.294
remembering that you are
starting with something here and

00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:36.112
here.
It really is not much more

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:38.793
complicated than that
recognition.

00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:41.312
And you would need to have
both.

00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:45.050
Otherwise, it is not going to
be a good buffer.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.300
Now, if you have this
information set up,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.143
you know the Ka,
we can solve for x.

00:03:51.143 --> 00:03:54.474
And x is what we want,
because we want pH.

00:03:54.474 --> 00:04:00.000
And pH is minus log of the
hydronium ion concentration.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.323
We can set this up.
We are given the Ka.

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:08.096
And this is going to be equal
to products over reactants,

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:10.909
the concentrations at
equilibrium.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.085
We have hydronium ion,
the conjugate base over the

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:18.664
conjugate acid.
And so we can fill this in,

00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:21.647
0.500 plus x times x over 1
minus x.

00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:26.590
Now, here you can do what

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.963
we talked about last time.
And that is to first simplify

00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:36.027
and see if we can get rid of
these x's here to make it easier

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:39.209
to solve, or you can use the
quadratic equation.

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:42.325
But on the exam,
with the calculators you have,

00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:44.762
that is a little more
time-consuming,

00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:47.471
so it is nice to see if you can
simplify.

00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.993
Basically we are saying,
how big is x if x is a small

00:04:50.993 --> 00:04:54.853
enough number that it doesn't
really change this 1 or this

00:04:54.853 --> 00:04:57.155
0.5.
Then you can sort of ignore it

00:04:57.155 --> 00:05:02.319
and solve for x that way.
This is just written up again

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.959
that we had on the last side.
We are going to first try the

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:11.600
approximation that x is small
compared to 1 and compared to

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.839
0.5 and solve that way,
and then go back and check and

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.480
see whether that was valid or
not.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.959
If we assume it is small,
we can rewrite that equation as

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.040
0.5 times x over 1.0,
which makes it easier to solve

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.972
and get an answer for x.
Which in this case is

00:05:31.972 --> 00:05:36.480
3.54x10^-4 molar.
And now we can go back and take

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.209
this number, divide it by 0.5,
and see whether it is less than

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:45.497
5% of 0.5.
We are going to check the

00:05:45.497 --> 00:05:48.502
assumption and say is this
small?

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:54.232
And you don't need to do both.
If it is small compared to 0.5,

00:05:54.232 --> 00:05:59.961
it will also be small compared
to 1.0, so you can just look at

00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:06.286
the smaller number of the two.
Here it is less than 0.1%.

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:10.596
That is less than 5%,
so that assumption was okay.

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:13.938
You can just go ahead with this
number.

00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:16.752
Again, we have the 5% rule
there.

00:06:16.752 --> 00:06:20.182
This is the hydronium ion
concentration,

00:06:20.182 --> 00:06:23.700
that was x.
Now we can find out the pH by

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.537
taking minus the log of that
value, and that gives us an

00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:33.303
answer of 3.45.
And we have two significant

00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:37.826
figures after the decimal point
because there were two

00:06:37.826 --> 00:06:40.642
significant figures in the
volume.

00:06:40.642 --> 00:06:43.629
All right.
That is how you look at a

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.530
buffer problem.
And now we can say,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.053
was this a good buffer?
Let's consider what happens if

00:06:51.053 --> 00:06:55.490
we add some strong acid,
HCl, 0.1 moles of it to this

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.477
solution.
Again, in this case we are

00:06:58.477 --> 00:07:03.000
keeping the total volume at one
liter.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.746
If you had made up your buffer
and added that 0.1 moles of the

00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:10.858
strong acid to it,
what would be your pH?

00:07:10.858 --> 00:07:14.749
Is it about the same,
or did it dramatically change

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:17.317
the pH of the solution?
All right.

00:07:17.317 --> 00:07:21.518
Now you have to do some
subtractions to do this kind of

00:07:21.518 --> 00:07:25.487
problem, and you have to
remember what we know about

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:28.521
strong acids.
HCl is definitely a strong

00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:32.142
acid.
And so we assume that when we

00:07:32.142 --> 00:07:36.280
add 0.1 moles of it that it is
going to react completely.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.492
When we are adding the 0.1
moles, it will react with equal

00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:44.852
number of moles of the base.
The base is going to act as the

00:07:44.852 --> 00:07:48.399
sink for protons,
it will react with the acid and

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:52.684
you will form the conjugate,
the same equal number of moles

00:07:52.684 --> 00:07:56.009
of a conjugate.
Here the base is reacting with

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:00.000
the acid and trying to
neutralize the pH.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.800
If we consider the HCOO minus
here, what we had originally,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.199
we had 0.5 moles.
Now it has reacted with 0.1

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:14.899
moles of the HCl.
And so you only have 0.4 left.

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:20.600
And we have 0.4 in one liter.
We always need to convert to

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.399
molarity for these problems.
Now, in terms of the conjugate

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:32.000
acid over here,
we had one mole to begin with.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.646
Now we have 0.1 moles more
because the strong acid reacted

00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:41.375
with the conjugate base to form
more of the conjugate acid.

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:45.288
Now our total is 1.1,
and that 1.1 is in that one

00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:48.222
liter.
And so we have a new molarity.

00:08:48.222 --> 00:08:52.788
Now we can just do the same
thing we did before and solve

00:08:52.788 --> 00:08:55.885
for x, the hydronium ion
concentration,

00:08:55.885 --> 00:09:00.369
which will give us the pH.
We can set up this expression

00:09:00.369 --> 00:09:04.790
again.
Now we have to put in our new

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.408
amounts, our 1.1 over here and
our 0.4 over here.

00:09:09.408 --> 00:09:13.450
We are still going to reach an
equilibrium.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.202
x will be converted to plus x
over here.

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:20.185
We have 1.1 minus x,
0.4 plus x.

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:25.573
We can use the same Ka value
that we had before to solve.

00:09:25.573 --> 00:09:30.000
We can use the same
approximations.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.185
Set up the same equations.
Put in our new values over

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:39.992
here.
Do the same simplification.

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:43.561
See if that works.
Solve for x.

00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:47.486
The value for x now is
4.87x10^-4.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:53.791
And that is still okay.
It's only 0.12% of the smaller

00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:59.977
number, the 0.4 number.
That is less than 5% so it is

00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:05.041
fine.
And we can solve then for pH.

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:11.018
And now we get a pH of 3.31,
two significant figures after

00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:14.374
the decimal point.
We had before,

00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:20.247
initially in a solution that
didn't have the strong acid,

00:10:20.247 --> 00:10:25.280
a pH of 3.45 with 0.1 moles of
strong acid added.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.000
The pH has changed slightly to
3.31.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.516
That is a decent buffer.
It didn't change really

00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:36.807
dramatically when you added some
strong acid.

00:10:36.807 --> 00:10:40.249
This is a way that you can
manipulate a buffer,

00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:44.064
if you are trying to design a
buffer at an exact pH.

00:10:44.064 --> 00:10:47.581
Then you can calculate.
You look at what kind of

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:52.144
buffering agent you want to use
and figure out how much strong

00:10:52.144 --> 00:10:56.708
acid or base you might have to
add to it to sort of adjust the

00:10:56.708 --> 00:11:01.911
pH to where you want it to be.
That is one way of doing a

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.220
buffer problem.
Now let's consider designing a

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.705
buffer, and how we would think
about going about it if you are

00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:11.838
in a biochem lab,
for example,

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:15.000
and you need to buffer
something at this pH,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.426
how could you set these things
up?

00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:21.838
Some of the things you would
think about are the ratio of the

00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:25.367
acid to its conjugate,
so the conjugate acid base

00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:30.000
pair, what ratio they have.
The pKa of the acid.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.050
What pH you want to be for your
particular condition.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.741
All right.
Now we are going to drive an

00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:44.665
equation that is going to help
you in designing buffers and in

00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:49.133
doing buffer problems.
Here comes a derivation.

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:54.571
The derivation starts with a
generic equation for an acid

00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:58.594
buffer problem.
We have an acid,

00:11:58.594 --> 00:12:04.376
HA, in water forming hydronium
ions and the conjugate base.

00:12:04.376 --> 00:12:08.961
We also know Ka,
the generic expression for Ka,

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:14.443
products over reactants.
Or, in the case of this acid in

00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:20.225
water, we have hydronium ions
times the conjugate base over

00:12:20.225 --> 00:12:25.209
the conjugate acid.
Now we can take this expression

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:30.365
and rearrange it.
We can bring Ka to the other

00:12:30.365 --> 00:12:35.179
side and hydronium ions to the
other side of the equation.

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:40.332
And then we can take the log of
both sides of the equation and

00:12:40.332 --> 00:12:45.316
multiply both sides by minus 1.
This is the equation that we

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:49.201
would get as the result of those
manipulations.

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:53.594
What is minus log of the
hydronium ion concentration?

00:12:53.594 --> 00:12:56.128
What else is that equal to?
pH.

00:12:56.128 --> 00:13:01.680
And what about minus log of Ka,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.927
what is that equal to?
pKa.

00:13:03.927 --> 00:13:08.855
We can substitute those in.
pH is going to equal pKa minus

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:14.216
the log of the concentration of
the acid over the concentration

00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:18.365
of its conjugate base.
Here there are equilibrium

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:22.775
concentrations because it came
from that equilibrium

00:13:22.775 --> 00:13:26.406
expression.
Now, this is not that useful an

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:30.869
expression to us.
We want to see whether we can

00:13:30.869 --> 00:13:33.898
make it more useful.
And what would make it more

00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:37.572
useful is if we consider the
initial concentrations of the

00:13:37.572 --> 00:13:41.052
acid and its conjugate base
rather than the equilibrium

00:13:41.052 --> 00:13:44.017
concentrations.
This will make it a more useful

00:13:44.017 --> 00:13:46.144
expression.
At least Henderson and

00:13:46.144 --> 00:13:49.689
Hasselbalch thought that was a
pretty useful expression,

00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:53.298
and I guess other people
thought it was as well since now

00:13:53.298 --> 00:13:56.263
it has the name
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

00:13:56.263 --> 00:13:59.873
Usually things don't get named
unless they turn out to be

00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:03.601
fairly useful.
The simplification,

00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:08.741
the approximation that is being
made here, is that the initial

00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:13.039
concentrations are similar
enough to the equilibrium

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:15.988
concentrations.
Let's consider when,

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:20.792
in fact, that would be true.
Here are the same expressions

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:23.741
again.
What this is really saying is

00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:27.365
that x is small,
something that we have been

00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:32.000
talking about for the last
couple of days.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.111
x, in this case,
is the acid in equilibrium with

00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:37.692
its conjugate base.
x, the hydronium ion

00:14:37.692 --> 00:14:40.208
concentration,
is small compared to the

00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:43.848
initial concentration of the
acid in the conjugate base.

00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:47.952
The equilibrium concentrations
are more or less the same as the

00:14:47.952 --> 00:14:51.527
initial concentrations.
This is that approximation that

00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:54.704
we have been using,
and we had been using that 5%

00:14:54.704 --> 00:14:57.484
rule, which we will continue to
use for the

00:14:57.484 --> 00:15:02.222
Henderson-Hasselbalch.
This is assuming x is pretty

00:15:02.222 --> 00:15:05.000
small.
Another way of thinking about

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.126
this is that a weak acid
typically only loses a small

00:15:09.126 --> 00:15:12.301
fraction of its protons or
hydrogen ions.

00:15:12.301 --> 00:15:14.285
It is weak.
By definition,

00:15:14.285 --> 00:15:17.222
a weak acid only loses a small
amount.

00:15:17.222 --> 00:15:19.761
A strong acid,
on the other hand,

00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:24.603
pretty much ionizes completely.
And a weak base typically only

00:15:24.603 --> 00:15:30.000
accepts a small fraction of
protons or hydrogen ions.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.379
Most of the time,
x is small; most of the time

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:37.435
there isn't a huge change,
and most of the time you can

00:15:37.435 --> 00:15:40.815
use that 5% rule.
Most of the time the initial

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:45.396
concentrations are not all that
different from the equilibrium

00:15:45.396 --> 00:15:48.701
concentrations.
This holds a lot of the time.

00:15:48.701 --> 00:15:52.907
And, again, the rule we will be
using is this 5% that the

00:15:52.907 --> 00:15:56.587
concentration of hydronium ions
needs to be small,

00:15:56.587 --> 00:16:00.568
this over HA or A minus,
whichever of these is

00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:05.000
the small number,
needs to be less than 5%.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.549
And if it is then you can use
this expression.

00:16:08.549 --> 00:16:11.546
And that expression,
you will find out,

00:16:11.546 --> 00:16:15.884
turns out to make your lives a
lot easier in doing these

00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:18.960
problems.
Now let's use this to design a

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.932
buffer.
When would you use

00:16:20.932 --> 00:16:25.033
Henderson-Hasselbalch?
We can consider it right here.

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:29.371
Now, suppose you wanted a
buffer that is going to buffer

00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:33.000
in the acidic range,
around 4.6.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.272
What we would do is go to a
table in the book and see which

00:16:38.272 --> 00:16:43.363
acids have a pKa around 4.6.
And we could look down here.

00:16:43.363 --> 00:16:46.545
That one is pretty close.
Let's see.

00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:49.090
Acetic acid,
that is not bad.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:53.000
That is around that pH.
Let's pick that one.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.909
There are a couple other
options, but that was one that

00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:02.195
would work.
Acidic acid is suitable.

00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:06.676
It has a pKa of 4.75.
And we want something around

00:17:06.676 --> 00:17:10.609
the pH of 4.6.
And so most buffer solutions,

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:16.280
something that is effective to
buffer at a particular pH if its

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.859
pKa is plus or minus one from
that pH, if the pKa is more than

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:26.707
one away from the desired pH
that is not going to be a

00:17:26.707 --> 00:17:32.351
particularly good buffer.
You want it within that range

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:36.405
of plus or minus one.
And that becomes important if

00:17:36.405 --> 00:17:40.054
you have, say,
an enzyme that you are studying

00:17:40.054 --> 00:17:43.945
in a biochemistry lab.
If you are doing it at the

00:17:43.945 --> 00:17:47.513
wrong pH, the enzyme may not be
happy at all.

00:17:47.513 --> 00:17:52.459
You might not get any results.
Let's use Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:17:52.459 --> 00:17:57.405
now to consider how much of each
thing we should add to make a

00:17:57.405 --> 00:18:02.558
pretty good buffer.
Here is our equation again.

00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:07.771
And we can consider these
original concentrations of the

00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:13.078
acid and its conjugate base.
Now we can rearrange this to

00:18:13.078 --> 00:18:18.859
solve for things that we know.
We know the pKa and we know the

00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:22.650
pH that we want.
And so the pKa was 4.75.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:29.000
The pH that we want is 4.6.
We subtract that and get 0.15.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.753
And then if we do inverse log
over here, we find that the

00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:40.198
ratio of the acid to the
conjugate base that we should

00:18:40.198 --> 00:18:45.541
add is a 1.4 ratio of those two.
What does this mean?

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:50.061
How much would you then add?
Well, you could,

00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:54.684
with this ratio,
add 1.4 molar of the acid and

00:18:54.684 --> 00:19:00.842
one molar of the conjugate base.
But the exact amounts are not

00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:03.954
as important as the ratio.
The ratio here is quite

00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:06.750
important because,
again, for it to be a good

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.799
buffer it needs to be able to go
both directions.

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:13.165
If you add strong acid,
then that strong acid needs to

00:19:13.165 --> 00:19:16.596
be able to react with the
conjugate base to keep the pH

00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:18.629
constant.
If you add strong base,

00:19:18.629 --> 00:19:21.932
it needs to be able to react
with the conjugate acid,

00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:25.680
again, to keep the pH constant.
The ratio is important here.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.000
The ratio is more important
than the exact amounts.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.242
But if you add too little then
you do not have enough of what's

00:19:34.242 --> 00:19:38.143
called buffering capacity,
and you have less resistance to

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:40.196
change.
The more that you have,

00:19:40.196 --> 00:19:43.412
the more resistant to change
the buffer will be.

00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:45.944
So, if you have higher
concentrations,

00:19:45.944 --> 00:19:49.913
the less likely it is that
there will be a problem that you

00:19:49.913 --> 00:19:53.814
will sort of swamp out your
system by adding too much acid

00:19:53.814 --> 00:19:55.867
or base.
And if you use too low

00:19:55.867 --> 00:20:01.000
concentrations then you are not
going to make your 5% rule.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.582
And the Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation will not be valid and

00:20:05.582 --> 00:20:10.398
you will not end up with the pH
that you think you are going to

00:20:10.398 --> 00:20:14.902
because this will not tell you
the right answer under those

00:20:14.902 --> 00:20:17.233
conditions.
What would that be?

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:21.427
Well, you can go back and
calculate what is sort of the

00:20:21.427 --> 00:20:26.242
minimum concentration that one
would need to keep your 5% rule?

00:20:26.242 --> 00:20:29.815
For a pH of 4.6,
that is equal to hydronium ion

00:20:29.815 --> 00:20:35.500
concentration of 2.5x10^-5.
And so if you put that up here

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.333
then either of these,
the smaller one of these,

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:44.166
for this to be less than 5%,
you can go back and calculate.

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:49.000
And so you would need at least
5x10^-4 over here for the 5%

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.250
rule to work.
If you had less than that,

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.000
then the equation wouldn't be
valid.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.817
OK.
We are working our way through

00:21:04.817 --> 00:21:08.914
this list, and we will move into
today's handout.

00:21:08.914 --> 00:21:12.926
Remember, there are only five
types of problems,

00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:18.134
and the trick is to figure out
which type of problem it is and

00:21:18.134 --> 00:21:21.463
apply the right kind of
procedure to it.

00:21:21.463 --> 00:21:26.500
Again, the two easiest ones we
have left are the strong acid

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.629
and the strong base in water.
And then we are going to go

00:21:32.629 --> 00:21:38.666
into acid-base titrations which,
in one problem of an acid-base

00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:44.411
titration, you can do almost all
of these different types of

00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:48.307
problems.
Titrations are really a summary

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:53.078
of all the types of problems put
into one problem.

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:57.111
Acid-base titrations.
And I will say,

00:21:57.111 --> 00:22:00.518
before we get started,
that acid-base titration

00:22:00.518 --> 00:22:05.111
problems are often the problems
in this half of the course that

00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:08.814
people struggle with,
although the year before last

00:22:08.814 --> 00:22:12.962
there was an actually quite good
performance on acid-base

00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:15.777
titrations.
And so last year I told the

00:22:15.777 --> 00:22:19.185
class that the year before had
been quite good,

00:22:19.185 --> 00:22:23.481
and I was curious to see how
they would do in comparison to

00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:27.185
this pretty good year.
And they responded and did a

00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:32.075
really fantastic job.
So I am beginning to think that

00:22:32.075 --> 00:22:35.089
this, in fact,
is not a hard unit necessarily.

00:22:35.089 --> 00:22:38.973
It is a little bit different,
I think, but you just have to

00:22:38.973 --> 00:22:42.120
work the problems.
And there are problems on the

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.200
problem set to work.
And then it starts to come

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.611
together.
I am really optimistic that

00:22:47.611 --> 00:22:51.294
this year's class can even
outperform last year's class.

00:22:51.294 --> 00:22:54.910
I mean you did on Exam 2,
so I feel like this will be a

00:22:54.910 --> 00:23:00.000
little contest to see if people
can do better than last year.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.652
Acid-base titrations,
you will see them again.

00:23:02.652 --> 00:23:06.129
If you take organic chemistry,
you will talk about pKa's all

00:23:06.129 --> 00:23:07.426
the time.
Biochemistry,

00:23:07.426 --> 00:23:10.844
you are going to talk about
acids and bases and buffers and

00:23:10.844 --> 00:23:12.730
pKa's.
If any of you are going to

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.206
medical school,
oh boy, will it be back big

00:23:15.206 --> 00:23:17.328
time.
When I was a graduate student I

00:23:17.328 --> 00:23:20.275
TA'ed medical students,
and pretty much all we were

00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:23.222
doing was acid-base titrations,
getting through it.

00:23:23.222 --> 00:23:25.933
If you learn it now,
you are just going to make

00:23:25.933 --> 00:23:28.113
many, many years ahead be much
easier.

00:23:28.113 --> 00:23:31.750
All right.
Acid-base titrations,

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.750
what is this?
Well, you are basically

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.083
titrating an acid with a base or
a base with an acid.

00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:43.750
Often they are used to find out
an unknown concentration.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:48.500
If you know the concentration
of one thing you are adding,

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.916
you can find out the other.
Let's just look at some of

00:23:52.916 --> 00:23:56.333
these things.
Here you would have a strong

00:23:56.333 --> 00:24:01.333
base on top, in this picture,
and a strong acid in this flask

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:05.378
here.
And you are dripping amounts of

00:24:05.378 --> 00:24:07.833
strong base into the strong
acid.

00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:11.132
And you can calculate out a
titration curve.

00:24:11.132 --> 00:24:14.432
Here we have pH versus volume
of base added.

00:24:14.432 --> 00:24:17.808
At the very beginning,
we are very acidic pH.

00:24:17.808 --> 00:24:20.800
We only have strong acid at
zero volume.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.020
And then, as you add base,
you eventually get to a point

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.470
called the equivalence point or
the stoichiometric point or

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:34.678
sometimes called the end point.
And here are some of the

00:24:34.678 --> 00:24:38.106
definitions of those.
Basically here the number of

00:24:38.106 --> 00:24:42.373
moles of acid is equal to the
number of moles of base that you

00:24:42.373 --> 00:24:46.569
have added, so equivalence or
stoichiometric because they are

00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:49.997
equal amounts here.
And it is often called the end

00:24:49.997 --> 00:24:53.914
point because experimentally,
when you get to that point,

00:24:53.914 --> 00:24:56.502
you are at the end of your
experiment.

00:24:56.502 --> 00:25:00.000
And this one is really a
theoretical.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.133
This is experimental.
They should,

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:05.818
in fact, equal each other.
You can measure pH up here with

00:25:05.818 --> 00:25:08.469
the pH meter.
And when you are doing these

00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:12.219
kinds of acid-base titrations,
you often see something like

00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:14.547
this.
You have some kind of dye which

00:25:14.547 --> 00:25:17.392
indicates when you have reached
the endpoint.

00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:20.883
And so it will be clear,
clear, clear and then all of a

00:25:20.883 --> 00:25:24.051
sudden you will start seeing
this change in color.

00:25:24.051 --> 00:25:27.801
And you want to measure the
endpoint when you just start to

00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:32.108
see that change.
How many of you have actually

00:25:32.108 --> 00:25:35.597
done these titrations in a lab?
Almost everybody,

00:25:35.597 --> 00:25:37.341
okay.
What happens often,

00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:41.267
at least when I did it,
you would be going along really

00:25:41.267 --> 00:25:43.447
slowly, drip,
any change, drip,

00:25:43.447 --> 00:25:45.992
any change.
And finally you just get

00:25:45.992 --> 00:25:50.062
incredibly frustrated and you
add just a little bit more,

00:25:50.062 --> 00:25:54.133
and all of a sudden it is
really, really bright color and

00:25:54.133 --> 00:25:57.986
you have gone too far.
But then you can sometimes back

00:25:57.986 --> 00:26:02.275
calculate approximately where
the end point should be and go

00:26:02.275 --> 00:26:07.000
fast to that point and then go
kind of slowly.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.456
And so it sometimes helps to be
able to do these sort of

00:26:10.456 --> 00:26:14.415
theoretical calculations to help
you figure out when you need to

00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:16.991
drip slowly.
How many of you have had that

00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:20.636
same kind of experience of
really, really slow and then all

00:26:20.636 --> 00:26:23.653
of a sudden bright colors?
How many people did it

00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:25.035
perfectly one time?
OK.

00:26:25.035 --> 00:26:28.491
We have just a handful of
people who did that perfectly.

00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:31.316
All right.
Some people ask me,

00:26:31.316 --> 00:26:35.613
why don't we have a lab course
affiliated with our GIR courses?

00:26:35.613 --> 00:26:39.841
A lot of times you have a lab
course for freshman chemistry or

00:26:39.841 --> 00:26:42.960
for first year physics and this
kind of thing.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.049
It would be hard because you
take so many science courses at

00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:51.346
once to have a lot of the labs,
let alone the number of people.

00:26:51.346 --> 00:26:55.435
But I tell people mostly you
are not missing out too much in

00:26:55.435 --> 00:26:59.920
the freshman experience.
Because I think most freshman

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.033
college courses,
pretty much this is what you do

00:27:03.033 --> 00:27:06.344
most of the semester.
So, you have already done it.

00:27:06.344 --> 00:27:08.993
And you will learn how to do it
on paper.

00:27:08.993 --> 00:27:11.973
And so the next couple days,
this problem set,

00:27:11.973 --> 00:27:15.549
you can declare that a lab
experience and feel like you

00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:19.125
have saved yourself an
incredible amount of time by not

00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:22.105
actually being in a laboratory
doing the drip,

00:27:22.105 --> 00:27:25.947
drip, drip, drip experiment.
You are not missing out on too

00:27:25.947 --> 00:27:29.169
much for this.
Later courses,

00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:33.096
I think the labs become
increasingly valuable to

00:27:33.096 --> 00:27:37.274
understanding the material and
can be a lot of fun.

00:27:37.274 --> 00:27:40.365
And, of course,
research experience is

00:27:40.365 --> 00:27:43.206
fantastic.
The UROP program here is

00:27:43.206 --> 00:27:45.044
spectacular.
All right.

00:27:45.044 --> 00:27:49.806
Acid-base titrations here.
Let's look at the shapes of the

00:27:49.806 --> 00:27:53.232
other kind of curve.
We can do the reverse

00:27:53.232 --> 00:27:58.161
experiment and have strong acid
up here dripping into strong

00:27:58.161 --> 00:28:01.953
base.
And so in the beginning you

00:28:01.953 --> 00:28:05.355
just have strong base,
so you are up here in the

00:28:05.355 --> 00:28:07.888
curve.
You add some until you get to

00:28:07.888 --> 00:28:10.710
the stoichiometric or
equivalence point,

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.967
and then it is equal amounts of
acid and base.

00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:18.236
And then, as you keep adding,
your pH drops because then you

00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:20.914
start having more strong acid in
here.

00:28:20.914 --> 00:28:25.256
These are the shapes of these
curves, and you should know how

00:28:25.256 --> 00:28:29.381
to draw these and you should
know how to calculate various

00:28:29.381 --> 00:28:33.000
different points on those
curves.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.897
Let's look at that.
Here we have a strong base,

00:28:38.897 --> 00:28:45.179
NaOH, and it is being titrated
with a strong acid,

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:48.512
HCl.
And so we are going to

00:28:48.512 --> 00:28:54.538
calculate just a couple of
points on that curve.

00:28:54.538 --> 00:29:02.358
Let's start by doing 5 ml's of
the acid that has been added to

00:29:02.358 --> 00:29:08.000
25 milliliters of our strong
base.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.107
And let's figure out what the
pH will be at 5.

00:29:12.107 --> 00:29:16.854
First, what we have to do is
calculate how much OH is

00:29:16.854 --> 00:29:20.323
present.
And remember for strong acids,

00:29:20.323 --> 00:29:24.340
strong bases,
you say that the amount of NaOH

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:30.000
added is going to be equal to
the amount of OH formed.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.784
The NaOH completely ionizes
into sodium plus and OH

00:29:35.784 --> 00:29:40.196
minus.
We can calculate the number of

00:29:40.196 --> 00:29:42.647
moles.
We know the volume.

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:46.666
We know the concentration.
We had 25 ml's.

00:29:46.666 --> 00:29:51.666
We know this and can calculate
the numbers of moles.

00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:56.568
Then we have to figure out how
much acid was added.

00:29:56.568 --> 00:30:02.644
We added 5 milliliters.
What does that correspond to in

00:30:02.644 --> 00:30:06.226
terms of moles?
Again, it is a strong acid.

00:30:06.226 --> 00:30:10.235
We can say for the amount of
HCl that was added,

00:30:10.235 --> 00:30:13.561
we have formed completely
hydronium ion.

00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:17.400
It is completely ionized.
It is a strong acid.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.432
You have complete conversion to
the acidic form to hydronium

00:30:22.432 --> 00:30:24.735
ion.
We had 5 ml's times the

00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:29.000
concentration of acid that was
given.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.311
And now we know how many moles
of acid were added.

00:30:34.311 --> 00:30:40.272
Now we are going to have a
reaction between the base and

00:30:40.272 --> 00:30:46.451
the acid, so these will react.
And so if we had 6.25x10^-3

00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:51.979
moles of hydroxide ion,
and we are going to subtract

00:30:51.979 --> 00:30:58.048
the amount of acid that is
formed to find out how much OH

00:30:58.048 --> 00:31:01.787
is left.
We just subtract those.

00:31:01.787 --> 00:31:04.896
There is a complete reaction,
one to one.

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:08.937
And so we just subtract the
amount of acid to get the

00:31:08.937 --> 00:31:12.668
numbers of moles.
Then we need to convert that to

00:31:12.668 --> 00:31:15.466
molarity.
Here, we have the number of

00:31:15.466 --> 00:31:19.740
moles that we just calculated
divided by our new volume.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.093
We added 5 ml's of acid and we
had 25 ml's to begin with,

00:31:24.093 --> 00:31:30.000
so now we have 30 total and we
can calculate the concentration.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.741
And I will just mention that
this is one of the common

00:31:33.741 --> 00:31:37.694
mistakes that people make on
exams when you are hurrying,

00:31:37.694 --> 00:31:41.717
and it is not to actually
figure out the total volume that

00:31:41.717 --> 00:31:45.458
you have at that moment.
Put maybe a little star by it

00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:48.494
to remind yourself to do this
addition here,

00:31:48.494 --> 00:31:52.588
because if you have the wrong
volume all your numbers start

00:31:52.588 --> 00:31:55.623
coming out very strangely.
Once you have the

00:31:55.623 --> 00:31:58.588
concentration,
then it is easy to calculate

00:31:58.588 --> 00:32:01.197
pOH.
Now, this is,

00:32:01.197 --> 00:32:06.173
again, the concentration of
hydroxide ions that we had.

00:32:06.173 --> 00:32:10.596
If we take the minus log of
that, we get the pOH.

00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:15.848
And then
we need to change it to pH.

00:32:15.848 --> 00:32:20.915
All of the problems you will do
are at room temperature,

00:32:20.915 --> 00:32:24.970
so you can always use 14 for
your conversion,

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:28.195
and you come out with a pH of
13.18.

00:32:28.195 --> 00:32:34.000
Now we have our first spot on
the titration curve.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.428
We had volume of acid.
We were adding 5 ml's to begin

00:32:41.428 --> 00:32:43.714
with.
This is pH.

00:32:43.714 --> 00:32:50.857
And we are starting out here.
That's back a little.

00:32:50.857 --> 00:33:00.000
At 5 ml's we are up at 13.18,
so we are at quite basic pH.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.708
And remember that as you are
doing these problems,

00:33:03.708 --> 00:33:07.491
if you had ended here and
decided that was your pH,

00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:12.032
think about the fact that you
have mostly strong base at that

00:33:12.032 --> 00:33:14.832
point.
You realize you need to do this

00:33:14.832 --> 00:33:18.843
conversion to go to pH.
Now let's figure out about the

00:33:18.843 --> 00:33:22.400
equivalence point.
We need to know the volume to

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.637
get to the equivalence point.
How much acid do we need to

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:30.133
add?
Well, initially we know how

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:33.688
much OH was present.
At the equivalence point,

00:33:33.688 --> 00:33:36.928
by the name equivalence or
stoichiometric,

00:33:36.928 --> 00:33:39.614
you need equal amounts of the
acid.

00:33:39.614 --> 00:33:44.276
If this is how much we had in
moles, this is how much we are

00:33:44.276 --> 00:33:48.938
going to need in moles of HCl.
We just need to find out what

00:33:48.938 --> 00:33:52.967
volume we need to add to get
those numbers of moles.

00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:57.313
And so here are the moles.
This was the concentration of

00:33:57.313 --> 00:34:02.500
acid we were given.
And so that means we are going

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:07.000
to need 18.4 milliliters to
reach the stoichiometric or

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.083
equivalence point.
And what will be the pH at that

00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:13.000
equivalence point?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.800
Strong acid mixed with a strong
base.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.000
7.
It will be neutral.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.611
Somewhere around here,
we are going to have a pH of 7

00:34:34.611 --> 00:34:38.602
when we get to 18.4 milliliters
of acid added.

00:34:38.602 --> 00:34:40.730
Strong acid,
strong base,

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.366
the equivalence point pH will
always be 7.

00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:49.155
If you are starting to talk
about a weak acid or a weak

00:34:49.155 --> 00:34:52.969
base, it will not be 7,
but for strong acid,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:59.000
strong base it will always be
7, will always be neutral.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.726
What about if we add 1 ml
extra?

00:35:01.726 --> 00:35:05.947
We have reached the
stoichiometric or equivalence

00:35:05.947 --> 00:35:10.695
point, and now we are going to
add an extra mL of acid,

00:35:10.695 --> 00:35:15.180
what is going to happen?
You can do this a couple of

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.962
different ways.
I think this is probably the

00:35:18.962 --> 00:35:23.623
simplest, is just to say how
many extra moles is that?

00:35:23.623 --> 00:35:28.108
If concentration was 0.34,
we are adding 1 mL extra,

00:35:28.108 --> 00:35:34.000
so we are going to add
3.4x10^-4 moles of acid extra.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.019
And then we just need to find
out the concentration of that.

00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:42.310
The only trick here again is to
remember that you have to add up

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.784
all of the correct volume.
You had 25 to begin with.

00:35:45.784 --> 00:35:50.008
You have added 18.4 milliliters
to get to the equivalence point

00:35:50.008 --> 00:35:53.550
and you have added 1 mL beyond
the equivalence point,

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.228
so you have this new volume.
And we have this number of

00:35:57.228 --> 00:36:02.289
moles of acid.
Then you can calculate the

00:36:02.289 --> 00:36:10.387
concentration from that and then
take minus log of that number to

00:36:10.387 --> 00:36:15.195
get the pH.
And so we can put that down

00:36:15.195 --> 00:36:19.751
here.
When we go sort of 1 milliliter

00:36:19.751 --> 00:36:25.318
beyond, now we are down at a pH
around 2.116.

00:36:25.318 --> 00:36:32.272
We started at very basic pH.
We added 18.4 milliliters to

00:36:32.272 --> 00:36:35.275
get to pH 7, to the equivalence
point.

00:36:35.275 --> 00:36:39.495
And then, if we keep adding
acid, the pH drops pretty

00:36:39.495 --> 00:36:42.904
dramatically.
And now you are quite acidic.

00:36:42.904 --> 00:36:47.855
That is how you would calculate
points on a curve for a strong

00:36:47.855 --> 00:36:52.481
acid, strong base titration.
And so we will have two kinds

00:36:52.481 --> 00:36:56.457
of curve shapes here.
This one that we just talked

00:36:56.457 --> 00:36:59.688
about.
And then, of course,

00:36:59.688 --> 00:37:04.670
if you are going to the other
direction, you will start at a

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:09.313
low pH when you have acid,
reach the stoichiometry point

00:37:09.313 --> 00:37:13.451
at pH 7 and then keep going.
As you add more base,

00:37:13.451 --> 00:37:17.841
it will get more basic.
Now let's talk about when the

00:37:17.841 --> 00:37:21.978
acid is weak or strong.
The only kinds of problems

00:37:21.978 --> 00:37:26.875
here, you either have strong
with strong or you have a weak

00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:31.354
acid with a strong base.
Or strong with strong.

00:37:31.354 --> 00:37:34.617
Then we also could have a weak
base and a strong acid,

00:37:34.617 --> 00:37:38.373
but you never are going to have
two weak things titrating each

00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:40.528
other.
That is not a kind of problem

00:37:40.528 --> 00:37:43.053
you will see.
Here I just want to show the

00:37:43.053 --> 00:37:46.254
difference in curve shapes.
We talked about this one,

00:37:46.254 --> 00:37:49.764
this strong with strong curve
shape, where the equivalence

00:37:49.764 --> 00:37:51.919
point is pH 7.
Now let's look at the

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:54.874
difference over here,
when the acid that is being

00:37:54.874 --> 00:37:57.399
titrated is weak.
A couple things you will

00:37:57.399 --> 00:38:01.214
notice.
One is that the equivalence

00:38:01.214 --> 00:38:06.134
point no longer has a pH of 7.
It's a pH that is greater than

00:38:06.134 --> 00:38:08.841
7.
And another thing that you will

00:38:08.841 --> 00:38:12.941
notice is the curve shape down
here is kind of odd.

00:38:12.941 --> 00:38:17.042
It flattens out in a region.
And this is called the

00:38:17.042 --> 00:38:20.322
buffering region.
And partway through the

00:38:20.322 --> 00:38:24.177
buffering region,
in the middle of the buffering

00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:30.000
region you have a point called
the half equivalence point.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.375
And that is the point when you
have added half of the volume to

00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:39.884
convert half of the acid that
you started with to its

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:42.658
conjugate.
You are halfway to the

00:38:42.658 --> 00:38:46.734
equivalence point.
And that is a special kind of

00:38:46.734 --> 00:38:51.156
category of problem.
Let's look at what is happening

00:38:51.156 --> 00:38:54.190
at various points in this
titration.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:39:00.000
Let's look at what happens when
you start this problem.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.802
When you start doing a
titration problem and you have a

00:39:03.802 --> 00:39:08.028
weak acid being titrated with a
strong base, at volume equals

00:39:08.028 --> 00:39:10.563
zero, all you have is your weak
acid.

00:39:10.563 --> 00:39:14.577
All you have is a weak acid,
and so this is a weak acid in

00:39:14.577 --> 00:39:17.253
water problem.
At the very start of the

00:39:17.253 --> 00:39:21.478
titration, that is the first
problem that we worked in class.

00:39:21.478 --> 00:39:25.422
You have a weak acid in water
problem, so you know how to

00:39:25.422 --> 00:39:28.309
solve those.
This is my little cartoon for

00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:30.781
an acid.
We have A.

00:39:30.781 --> 00:39:33.517
It is HA.
And so this is going to be

00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:36.878
titrated off.
The acid is going to be losing

00:39:36.878 --> 00:39:41.334
its proton or hydrogen ion to
interact with a strong base.

00:39:41.334 --> 00:39:45.633
Now, when we start adding a
strong base, we are going to

00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:48.447
move into this buffering region
here.

00:39:48.447 --> 00:39:53.059
And so, as we are adding the
strong base, the strong base is

00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:59.000
going to start stripping off the
protons of the hydrogen atoms.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.178
And leaving the conjugate base
of the weak acid that we had to

00:40:03.178 --> 00:40:05.849
begin with.
And so when you have an acid

00:40:05.849 --> 00:40:09.684
and its conjugate base both
present in solution that is a

00:40:09.684 --> 00:40:12.356
buffer problem,
so you can be going both

00:40:12.356 --> 00:40:15.232
directions.
And the buffering region is the

00:40:15.232 --> 00:40:18.178
region of the plot that is
pretty much flat.

00:40:18.178 --> 00:40:21.465
And what does flat mean?
Well, flat means this is

00:40:21.465 --> 00:40:24.684
against the scale of pH.
Flat means the pH isn't

00:40:24.684 --> 00:40:27.424
changing much.
Well, that's what a buffer

00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:30.237
does.
It keeps the pH fairly

00:40:30.237 --> 00:40:32.488
constant.
You are going to be moving into

00:40:32.488 --> 00:40:35.245
this buffering region.
And if you were doing these

00:40:35.245 --> 00:40:38.508
kinds of titrations in lab,
these are even more frustrating

00:40:38.508 --> 00:40:41.771
than the ones I just showed you.
Because when you reach the

00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:45.372
buffering region you keep adding
and adding and adding and the pH

00:40:45.372 --> 00:40:48.353
is not changing at all.
You are just adding and adding

00:40:48.353 --> 00:40:51.448
and the pH does not change.
Then all of a sudden it just

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:53.529
goes wild and you jump way up to
here.

00:40:53.529 --> 00:40:56.117
And so that is what is
happening in this curve.

00:40:56.117 --> 00:41:00.000
You don't have much of a pH
change in this region.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.957
All right.
When we get to the middle point

00:41:02.957 --> 00:41:06.636
of the buffering region,
we have a special category.

00:41:06.636 --> 00:41:10.676
And the volume here is the
volume at the half equivalence

00:41:10.676 --> 00:41:13.273
point.
You have added half the number

00:41:13.273 --> 00:41:17.169
of moles in this case to the
strong base that you need.

00:41:17.169 --> 00:41:21.425
When you have added half the
amount, you have converted half

00:41:21.425 --> 00:41:23.805
of the acid to its conjugate
base.

00:41:23.805 --> 00:41:29.000
You have a 50/50 mixture here.
This is a special category.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.717
When the amount of the weak
acid equals the amount of the

00:41:32.717 --> 00:41:35.040
conjugate base that is being
formed.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.762
Notice, as we go up,
here it was all acid,

00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:41.346
here there is some mixture,
here there is more mixture.

00:41:41.346 --> 00:41:44.466
You are titrating off,
you are pulling off these

00:41:44.466 --> 00:41:47.321
hydrogen ions as the titration
goes forward.

00:41:47.321 --> 00:41:51.237
Once we reach the equivalence
point, you have pulled off all

00:41:51.237 --> 00:41:54.224
the hydrogen ions,
you have removed all of the

00:41:54.224 --> 00:41:57.809
protons from the weak acid,
and now all you have is the

00:41:57.809 --> 00:42:02.193
conjugate base.
Really, what you formed here is

00:42:02.193 --> 00:42:04.669
a salt.
But this salt is a conjugate

00:42:04.669 --> 00:42:07.995
base of a weak acid,
so it is going to be basic.

00:42:07.995 --> 00:42:11.250
It really is just a weak base
in water problem.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.433
And that is why the pH is
greater than 7 here,

00:42:14.433 --> 00:42:18.325
because what you are left with
at the equivalence point,

00:42:18.325 --> 00:42:22.075
when you have pulled off all of
the protons is a base,

00:42:22.075 --> 00:42:25.400
so it will be above 7.
Not dramatically above 7,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.000
because it is a weak base,
but it will be above 7.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.965
And then, as you keep going,
you still have this around.

00:42:33.965 --> 00:42:38.364
You still have a conjugate base
around, but now you are really

00:42:38.364 --> 00:42:41.753
just adding strong base.
It is not reacting with

00:42:41.753 --> 00:42:44.565
anything.
You are jumping up in pH quite

00:42:44.565 --> 00:42:47.449
dramatically as you do that.
And, really,

00:42:47.449 --> 00:42:50.550
this is just a strong base in
water problem,

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.290
like the one that we just
talked about.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:56.967
In doing one titration,
all these points along here,

00:42:56.967 --> 00:43:00.645
you are doing a weak base
problem, a buffer problem,

00:43:00.645 --> 00:43:04.971
a special category of buffer
problem, a weak base problem and

00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:10.311
a strong base problem.
In every titration there are

00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:13.942
just five different really kinds
of problems.

00:43:13.942 --> 00:43:18.565
You just need to recognize
where you are in the titration

00:43:18.565 --> 00:43:22.279
and which type of problem you
should be doing.

00:43:22.279 --> 00:43:26.736
Just going the other direction,
it is the same thing in

00:43:26.736 --> 00:43:29.707
reverse.
Now here we have a weak base

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:34.000
that we are titrating with a
strong acid.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.076
At volume equals zero,
it is just a weak base problem.

00:43:38.076 --> 00:43:42.076
As you start to add acid,
the acid is protonating the

00:43:42.076 --> 00:43:44.307
base.
And so now you have some

00:43:44.307 --> 00:43:46.769
conjugate acid of your weak
base.

00:43:46.769 --> 00:43:49.230
so again, it is a buffer
problem.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:53.615
At the half equivalence point
these guys are equal to each

00:43:53.615 --> 00:43:56.461
other.
You have converted half of your

00:43:56.461 --> 00:44:01.947
weak base to its conjugate acid.
And when you get to the

00:44:01.947 --> 00:44:06.011
equivalence point,
you have converted all of your

00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:11.091
weak base to its conjugate acid.
This is a weak acid in water

00:44:11.091 --> 00:44:16.171
problem, and so we would expect
the pH here to be less than 7

00:44:16.171 --> 00:44:19.135
because we are acidic at this
point.

00:44:19.135 --> 00:44:23.707
And when we get all the way
past the equivalence point,

00:44:23.707 --> 00:44:28.702
then we are just talking about
how much extra strong acid we

00:44:28.702 --> 00:44:32.089
have added.
Again, it is the same type of

00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:34.544
problems.
In this case you are

00:44:34.544 --> 00:44:38.468
protonating.
You are starting with base,

00:44:38.468 --> 00:44:41.621
and you keep protonating it
until you have converted it all

00:44:41.621 --> 00:44:43.742
to acid.
Let's see if we can do a couple

00:44:43.742 --> 00:44:46.895
of points along this curve.
Now we are talking about a weak

00:44:46.895 --> 00:44:48.962
acid being titrated with a
strong base.

00:44:48.962 --> 00:44:52.333
And I will move fairly quickly
through some of these because we

00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:55.432
have already seen how to do
these parts a couple of times.

00:44:55.432 --> 00:44:58.423
The trick to titration is just
to recognize what type of

00:44:58.423 --> 00:45:01.969
problem it is.
In the beginning,

00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:06.718
we added no base.
This is just a weak acid

00:45:06.718 --> 00:45:10.540
problem.
We have our acid in water

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:15.405
forming hydronium ion and a
conjugate base.

00:45:15.405 --> 00:45:20.965
We are given a Ka value.
This is just a weak acid

00:45:20.965 --> 00:45:25.135
problem.
We can set up our plot here.

00:45:25.135 --> 00:45:33.669
We had 0.1 molar to begin with.
And at equilibrium we will have

00:45:33.669 --> 00:45:39.469
0.1 minus x, x and x.
We can plug this into the Ka

00:45:39.469 --> 00:45:43.967
expression.
x squared over 0.1 minus x.

00:45:43.967 --> 00:45:49.767
We can
assume x is small.

00:45:49.767 --> 00:45:53.910
Simplify this to x squared over
0.1.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:59.000
Solve for x,
which is now 0.00421.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.103
We can check that this is less
than 0.1 and is less than 5%.

00:46:05.103 --> 00:46:08.413
It is 4.2% so it is less than
5%.

00:46:08.413 --> 00:46:12.344
We are OK.
We can make that assumption.

00:46:12.344 --> 00:46:16.689
We don't have to do the
quadratic equation.

00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:22.068
And so then we can plug x,
which is the hydronium ion

00:46:22.068 --> 00:46:26.620
concentration,
into this expression and solve

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:32.770
for our pH.
Then we can put a plot over

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.983
here.
We have one point.

00:46:35.983 --> 00:46:41.849
And here is volume of base
added versus pH.

00:46:41.849 --> 00:46:49.251
And we start down here,
before we have added any base,

00:46:49.251 --> 00:46:54.000
and we are at a pH of 2.38.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.862
All right.
Now let's look at a problem in

00:47:02.862 --> 00:47:06.049
the buffering region real
quickly.

00:47:06.049 --> 00:47:11.071
Now, what happens if we have
added some small amount,

00:47:11.071 --> 00:47:16.576
5 mLs less than the volume at
the equivalence point of our

00:47:16.576 --> 00:47:18.700
base?
The OH is strong.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.370
It will react completely with
our acid.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:27.778
It is much stronger than the
conjugate, so we will have a

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:32.076
reaction.
We need to do the subtraction

00:47:32.076 --> 00:47:36.158
at first and assume the amount
of strong base you add will

00:47:36.158 --> 00:47:39.595
react completely with whatever
acid is available.

00:47:39.595 --> 00:47:43.534
We know how much acid we had to
begin with, volume and a

00:47:43.534 --> 00:47:46.757
concentration,
so we know the number of moles.

00:47:46.757 --> 00:47:50.552
We also can calculate the
number of moles of hydroxide

00:47:50.552 --> 00:47:53.058
ion.
We know the volume added and we

00:47:53.058 --> 00:47:56.496
know the concentration,
so we have this number of

00:47:56.496 --> 00:48:00.021
moles.
Then the moles after the

00:48:00.021 --> 00:48:02.715
reaction.
We had 2.5x10^3 before.

00:48:02.715 --> 00:48:07.684
Now we subtract the amount of
hydroxide ion and come up with

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:11.389
new moles of acid,
the moles of acid that are

00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:14.084
left.
That amount of base is also

00:48:14.084 --> 00:48:18.631
going to produce the conjugate.
This guy is going to be

00:48:18.631 --> 00:48:23.010
converted to this guy,
so we will have that number of

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:26.210
moles of conjugate base that is
formed.

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:32.408
This is like a buffer problem.
We need to convert to molarity

00:48:32.408 --> 00:48:34.415
first.
We know the volume.

00:48:34.415 --> 00:48:37.866
We had 25 mLs,
plus we have now added 5 mLs.

00:48:37.866 --> 00:48:41.880
And we have two new
concentrations that we can plug

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.850
in here.
That is how much acid we have

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:49.747
left after the reaction with OH.
This is how much conjugate is

00:48:49.747 --> 00:48:53.681
formed after the reaction and
then at equilibrium.

00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:58.096
And we can just go through,
make the same approximations

00:48:58.096 --> 00:49:00.825
that this is small,
come up with x,

00:49:00.825 --> 00:49:05.000

00:49:06.921 --> 00:49:11.486
And on Wednesday we will talk
about another option for the

00:49:11.486 --> 00:49:14.529
buffer problem,
which is looking at the

00:49:14.529 --> 00:49:15.995
