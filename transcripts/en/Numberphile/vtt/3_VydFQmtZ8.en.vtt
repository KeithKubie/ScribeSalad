00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.590
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: This really is the
galactic concentrator, OK.  If you hold that

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.700
in the right spot it will take the power that
comes from the black hole at the centre of

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.460
the galaxy and you focus upon you and it gives
you eternal beauty and intelligence and all

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.460
the good stuff. But don't tell that to anybody
else.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.500
Hi, were going to talk about the topology
of twisted toroids.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.839
Now that sounds a little frightening, does it?

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:21.380
&gt;&gt; BRADY: It does.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.189
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: Right, it is going
to be simple. I'm Carlo Séquin and this

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.130
is a bagel and if you're familiar with bagels
you know we don't just eat a bagel dry. What

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.500
you do is you basically slice it, right? You
kind of cut it open and then you put cream

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.780
cheese on it. For a mathematician, this is
a torus. Anything that has a smooth shape

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.750
with just one hole, that's called a torus.
To a mathematician you can smoothly deform

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.970
that in to any other shapes. Interestingly
enough if you take you coffee cup with a handle

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.250
like that, and even though it has this big
void and all of that, topologically it is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.640
still a torus. So to mathematicians, you know,
shape is not important, it's just the connectivity.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.909
And something that has one tunnel here or
one handle, that essentially is a genus one

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.020
surface and they call that a torus.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.020
Now, if we cut this bagel, what do we get?
We're basically getting two tori, each one

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.229
individually even though the shape is different,
you know, still has essentially one ring,

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.319
one handle and one hole through it so it's
still a torus.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:33.060
But now, what if we're kind of crazy and
rather than slicing this in one nice plane,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.710
we essentially start stabbing through the
torus like that and then as we go around the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.549
perimeter we rotate our knife around. And
if I'm doing that very carefully and kind

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.889
of cutting through and I'm rotating my knife all the way around and then doing it on the other

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:57.709
side, the doughnut will still fall apart in
to two individual pieces.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.109
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Is that two pieces professor?

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.179
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: It's two separate
pieces but they're now linked. Individually,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.569
both of them are still tori. They're still
essentially rings with one handle, but now

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.150
I can hold one and the other one will not
fall on the floor, which is a great advantage

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.980
if you're eating those on the train and it's
kind of shaking.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.299
And there's another benefit. If you compare
that surface in here, compared to the surface we had before,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.239
this surface here is actually bigger.
That means we can put more cream cheese in

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.220
to this bagel and then when we've put it
back together it'll make a much juicer bagel.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.930
To a topological oriented mathematician they're
just two tori because in topology we're actually

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.430
allowed to have sliding surfaces through one
another. Now, if you're a knot theoretician

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.030
and you're talking about knot and links then
this is different because these two rings

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.409
are linked, whereas the other two were not
linked. You can separate them, you can move

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.260
them apart but you cannot separate those two things.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.769
Now, this geometry is not my invention. This
geometry is actually due to Keizo Ushio. He

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.659
is a well-known stone sculptor in Japan, well
known over there, not so well known in this

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.650
particular country. I first met him in 1999.
It was at a conference on art and mathematics

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.540
in San Sebastián, Spain, and before the
conference he had carved a really large, about

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.849
three foot diameter, granite torus in a perfect
shape like that. And then, during the conference

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.629
he was drilling a sequence of a couple of
a hundred holes in this spiral fashion through

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.969
this granite doughnut, just like I have sliced
through the bagel before.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.590
Now, in this case we have a nice hole and
that diameter of that hole is just about the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.730
same diameter as the diameter of the rim.
So now, when I take these two apart, they

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.719
come apart much more nicely and they rattle,
and not only that but I can put them into

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:59.400
this configuration which you can see is locking
up very nicely. And he then rearranged those

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.819
two rings and then essentially left a sculpture
there that looks something like that.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.400
And yeah, I wanted to better understand that
because I saw it and I understood it but I

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.599
felt until I have one in my hand that I can
manipulate I really don't know. So, I went

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.989
home and within one month I made this object on our own fused deposition modelling machine

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.160
which is, you know, a very sturdy rapid prototyping machine. Built it a little bit apart so, just,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.900
it wouldn't touch, just so in this particular
shape. And there's kind of a filler material

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.810
that would be in the gap when you build it,
but the filler material can easily be then

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.020
scratched out and you can wrench these things apart and then clean out the surface, all

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.199
the filler material. So, I get the really
perfect replica of this object and now I finally

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.639
understand what is going on.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.300
So, we have two of these interlinked. Could
I somehow get three of them interlinked?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.330
And so, I had to think about it for a while,
but then it suddenly became obvious. Well,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.130
if you take a different kind of knife, not
kind of like, you know, the straight knife

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.410
that we sort of rotate around the middle of
the blade as we go around the torus. But we

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.990
instead take a knife like that, so now we
have essentially three sort of half blades

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.319
coming together in the middle and I slowly
rotate that knife as I push it forward along

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:24.000
the rim of the torus, and going once around
the torus I will make sure this rotates exactly 360 degrees.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.710
It's kind of important to do it that way and then

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.600
you get this, and you can see those spiral cuts and you don't know
what to expect until you kind of shake it loose.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:40.779
&gt;&gt; BRADY: That's brilliant.

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:46.710
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: And now, we can see we have three of those pieces all inter linked.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.039
Of course, we can do it with three blades,
what about if you used four blades? I could

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.520
put them at 90 degree and add a fourth one.
It's the same as basically using two cuts

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.220
with a knife, one going around that way, the
other one going around that way. But in either

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.120
case we would still turn the whole contraption
through a full 360 degrees so every piece

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.610
of material winds around the torus and connects back to itself. Well, what would you get?

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.110
Probably something that has four rings and
in order to make it more visible I gave this

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.910
one, not a round doughnut shape cross-section, but I basically made a square cross section.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.319
It's topologically still a torus, just the
fact that it is rigid and has flat faces doesn't

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:36.600
matter, and now after the cut, yes indeed,
you get something that has four intertwined rings.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.419
You immediately ask, what about five,
what about 6? Well, six is a nice one because

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.860
now we can start out with a hexagon cross-section, a perfectly regular hexagon, and we cut the

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.860
hexagon we say on three diameters. Then each one of the pieces is itself a small triangle

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.860
and these triangles are perfectly equilateral,
so we can see a perfectly equilateral cross-section

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.240
and then six of those essentially form the
hexagon that makes this shape and by cutting

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:17.000
it apart, yeah, you of get now, six rings.
And that makes an even more intriguing kind

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.560
of potential sculptures that we might have
and that it makes an even harder puzzle.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:30.000
That's where I stopped, so now I tried to build one of these, OK, like we've seen before, rotating

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:38.900
the knife a full 360 degrees as we go around
the doughnut. Well, if you do it wrong and

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:46.500
you rotate your knife only 180 degrees, and
what does that do? Well, somehow this doesn't

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.210
want to come apart here. If you look at that
then, it still hangs together. It seems to

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.729
be like one band, actually it's a band that
goes around the loop twice and seems to be

00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:58.289
somewhat intertwined. And-

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:00.899
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Is that one continuous piece of
bread then?

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:04.009
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: It's one continuous
piece of bread, so it's a little harder to,

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:10.189
you know, cram the cream cheese in there.
And again, we can look to some sculptures

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:15.569
of Keizo Ushio who has made this kind of shape
but much more beautiful and much more regular.

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:19.849
I've exaggerated what he has done in some
of his sculptures and you can see, it's basically

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:26.289
a doughnut and you get this one groove that
spirals around, it goes to the inside. Now,

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:30.949
I really would like to make a really giant
sculpture of this. It would be awesome to

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:35.229
have a sculpture like that where you could
step inside and see yourself reflected again

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:41.630
and again in all the different parts of this
inner space. So, let's focus on that inner

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:49.100
space. What have we taken away from the torus?
We have cut something out and that thing that

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.700
we have cut out is actually a Möbius band.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.000
&gt;&gt; BRADY:  Aaah.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.900
PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: Ah, what's a Möbius band? Oh, let's see.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.540
If you take off your belt here, right, and you
wrap your belt around, you know, that, in

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:13.500
the ordinary way you close your belt is just
a cylinder. But, if we give that belt a 180

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:19.089
degree twist so the dull side gets to the
shiny side and connect it in that way, now

00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:23.800
we have a Möbius band. And what's special
about the Möbius band is that if we start

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.589
hiking on the shiny side and we go around,
we go around, we go around, we go around,

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:33.950
and suddenly oops! We're ending up on the
other side. So we have stepped from one side

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.250
of the band to the other without going over
the edge, by just going once around the loop.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.519
So that's a Möbius span and that's of course
a very famous structure. But before, I already

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:47.300
mentioned that we might want to rotate the
knife at different rates, so what happens

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.110
if you rotate it three times as fast? So as
it goes around it swings through three times

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.770
180 degrees? And you get this.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.330
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Wow.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.209
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: But now we've taken
out a Möbius space that makes three flips.

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:07.300
I call it the Tripley-twist-it Möbius space
and I certainly sent pictures of that to Keizo Ushio

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.800
and asked him whether he would carve
one of those, and so far he hasn't done it

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.730
yet but I think one of these days he might
come up and create a big stone sculpture that

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.600
has this particular shape.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.000
&gt;&gt; BRADY: That looks like kind of a propeller
or something, the one on this side,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.510
it looks like that should be on the front
of a plane or something.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.100
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: Yeah, or it could be
the head of a tunnel boring machine going

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.800
[imitates machinery noise] or, but you don't
know, this really is the galactic concentrator, OK

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.479
If you hold that in the right spot it
will take the power that comes from the black

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:38.770
hole at the centre of the galaxy and you focus
upon you and it gives you eternal beauty and

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.209
intelligence and all the good stuff. But don't
tell that to anybody else.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.750
[Both laugh]

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:51.430
&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR SÉQUIN: Yeah, you're not the first one that thinks I'm crazy. Now, you were

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.519
asking is this any good? And you know, some
architects were fascinated by the concept

00:10:56.519 --> 00:11:01.060
of Möbius something, so obviously its 'can
you build a Möbius house?'
