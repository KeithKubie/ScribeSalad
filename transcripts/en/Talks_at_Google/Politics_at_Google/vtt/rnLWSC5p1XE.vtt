00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.669
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Many, many years ago back when the
acronym CD meant certificate of deposit and

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:21.730
not compact disc, I was a Linguistics graduate
student at the MIT here. And it was way late

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.900
in November when the [INDISTINCT]. I just
returned from New York City where I did my

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.669
very first linguistics paper conference and
it was very late one Thursday night. I was

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:37.110
walking on front of Building 20 which no longer
exists. And as I was walking across because

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.840
I'm going to go to hear Noam Chomsky speak,
and I'm thinking about how we're about to

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.020
have this birthday party for Professor Chomsky.
So graduate students were putting together

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.210
a surprise birthday party to celebrate his--what
was it, half a century of living, 50 years?

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:57.230
So, I'm thinking about this and then I noticed
this figure coming out from the parking lot,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:07.160
and he was approaching me. And I think he's,
"Hi Anne." I was, "Oh, it's Professor Chomsky,"

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:15.440
and he says, "How was your talk?" Then I looked,
and I said, "It was really good. I enjoyed

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.050
it. It was nice, but I was so formal, maybe,
it felt so old like I was really feeling old."

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.650
And I pulled back from there to here. And
he said, "To them, it's fighting words." So,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.060
here he is.
&gt;&gt; CHOMSKY: She reminds me a little bit of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.820
a--they moved us, after they destroyed Building
20 which Anne was talking about which was

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.049
a great mistake. It was a wonderful, old building,
contemporary World War II building, which

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.190
was the best building on campus by far, movable
walls, squirrels climbing up inside the walls,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.460
you know, windows falling out, noises from
the garbage being taken out behind our windows,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.670
but terrific place to work. They put us in
a fancy, new building. You can't miss it if

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.439
you walk on campus. And the first seminar
I had to give there, maybe, 30 people, I noticed

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.150
I couldn't hear any of the students which
then surprised me all that much. But they

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.569
couldn't hear me which surprised me a little
more until somebody finally pointed out to

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.420
me that the ceiling is 30 feet high. And we
asked why they can't put up an acoustic ceiling

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.569
and they said, "Well, that would interfere
with the decor of the building." And so, therefore,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.450
tough luck, you just won't hear each other.
That's what's known as progress, I think.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.841
So I'll try to make myself heard but as I
say, India is the place to be.

00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:48.260
&gt;&gt; MALE: The first question, Mr. Chomsky,
comes from Christas Gudrov [ph]. How have

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.890
your ideas on universal grammar changed over
the years? Are you more or less convinced

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.660
of the theory now than you were initially?
&gt;&gt; CHOMSKY: Well, there's a lot of confusion

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.110
about the notion, universal grammar. Universal
grammar had a traditional meaning but in--not

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.980
only linguistics, the last 50 years or so,
it has had a technical meaning which is not

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.790
unrelated to the traditional meaning but it's
not identical either. Universal grammar is

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.190
just the name for the theory of the genetic
component of the language faculty and, transparently,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.900
there's some genetic component, right? Now,
there's a reason, say, why my granddaughter

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.239
reflexively identified some part of her environment
as language-related, which is no small trick--nobody

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.470
knows how to duplicate that--and then, more
or less, reflexively picked up the capacity

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:56.000
that we're all now using whereas her pet,
say, kitten or chimpanzee or song bird or

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.659
whatever it may be, with exactly the same
inputs, couldn't even take the first step,

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.489
can't identify part of the environment as
language-related, obviously, not the later

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.950
steps. Well, there are two possible answers
to how that happens. One is it's a miracle.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.540
The other is there's--she has some specific
genetic capacity that's like the capacity

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.920
that had her grow arms and not wings, let's
say; just some fixed--or had a mammalian visual

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.090
system but not an insect visual system. Now,
this is not controversial for anything except

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.900
human higher mental faculties. For some reason,
when people investigate human higher mental

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.940
faculties, they have to be insane, you know.
You can't accept the approach that we take

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.400
to everything else in the world, the kind
of methodological dualism. Everything else

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.840
in the world we study by the standard methods
of science, but when we talk about human higher

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.420
mental faculties, we have become mystics.
So, therefore, there's a controversy about

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.620
the existence of universal grammar which is
like--which means a controversy about whether

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.850
there is some genetic property that distinguishes
humans from everybody else which leads to

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.169
these--to the ability to doing what we're
now doing. But there shouldn't be any controversy

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.970
about that. The only question is: What is
it? Well, there have been theories about it

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.860
from the 1950s when these studies began up
to the present and it's a living field so

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.020
it kept changing. So, in that sense, yes,
my views about universal grammar keep changing.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.729
So when Anne walked into my office as a graduate
student and told me I was wrong about everything,

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.199
so, okay, my views changed, you know. But,
in that sense, sure, there's going to be constant

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:57.580
change until the field disappears or is dead
or something. And there's a long way to go.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:05.550
These are not trivial questions. There's sort
of general tendency of change and not every

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.170
linguist would agree by any means; so that's
personal opinion. In the early stages, when

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:19.479
the first question was asked seriously, about
50 years ago, as to how we are capable of

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:28.009
doing what we do all the time, how are we
capable of understanding, producing expressions

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.169
which we've never heard, which may have never
been, other than the history of the language

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.139
and doing it over an infinite range or where
there is strange properties that they have

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:44.260
as soon as you look up on how do we do it.
The only answer seems to be that each of us

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:51.600
has a highly intricate computational system
in the brain which yields these very specific

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.390
results. But that then poses a paradox because
it must be the case that we all--all humans

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:08.020
have the same genetic capacity with marginal
variation. The reason is if you take a child

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.900
from, say, a hunter-gatherer tribe in the
Amazon and the child is raised in Cambridge,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:23.301
Mass., it will have made this--become a graduate
student studying quantum physics at MIT with

00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:29.110
no difference from anyone else and conversely.
So we all have the same capacity. And it's

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:36.169
more or less understood why. The capacity
developed very recently in evolutionary time

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.360
and probably in some window between 100,000
and 50,000 years ago, something like that,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.979
and that's just the flick of any eye. So whatever
happened never changed except extremely marginally.

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:54.389
So we're all fundamentally identical for all
practical purposes. Human genetic variation

00:07:54.389 --> 00:08:02.639
is very slight anyway; the superficial differences
are not very profound. A foreign--an outside,

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:08.080
extraterrestrial observer looking at us the
way we look at frogs would say there's only

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:16.389
one human and one language with minor variations.
So, on one hand, it's got to be uniform. On

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:22.110
the other hand, it seems to be the case that
each particular language had a highly intricate

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.860
and complex system of rules, computational
system, and they're very different from one

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:33.620
another. And that is a paradox, in fact, a,
you know, serious paradox. Well, over the

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:40.969
years, there have been efforts to deal with
it, to try to overcome the paradox. A major

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:45.879
step was taken and when views on universal
grammar, at least for many of us, did change

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:50.160
radically was around 1980.
ANNE: I was still there.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.079
CHOMSKY: You were there, yeah. It's her fault.
When a different view of the matter sort of

00:08:56.079 --> 00:09:01.449
crystallized, what's called--sometimes called
the principles in parameters view. The picture

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:06.291
that the principles, the fixed principles
which were really embedded; nobody has to

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:12.100
acquire them. They're part of universal grammar.
And then, there's a number of options that

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:19.179
can be taken, called parameters, that the
child has to pick up from experience and they

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:23.019
have to be pretty simple. You have to be able
to pick them up from limited evidence because

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:29.449
that's all there is. And so, for example,
in some languages like English, the--it's

00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:36.009
called the head-first language, so the verb
precedes the object and the preposition precedes

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:40.550
the object of the preposition and so on. Other
languages, like, say, Japanese, are almost

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:47.230
mirror image. The verb follows the object;
the postpositions, not prepositions, and so

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:53.089
on. So languages are virtually mirror images
of each other and you have to set the parameter.

00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:57.899
The child has to set the parameter which is,
"Am I talking English, or am I talking Japanese?"

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:04.259
And that can be determined from very simple
data. So that's a reasonable choice of a parameter.

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:09.699
And the hope was that you could find some
finite set of parameters like a finite switch

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:14.850
box, where you set the switch, the child has
set the switches one way or another and can

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:23.480
do it on the basis of fairly simple data.
And then once this enters into the predetermined

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.749
system of principles, you get things which
superficially look very different. They are

00:10:28.749 --> 00:10:35.161
actually almost identical or just differing
in superficial choices. Well, if you could

00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:41.819
work that out, you would have solved the paradox.
It's a long way to work that out. But that

00:10:41.819 --> 00:10:46.480
made it possible at least to confront the
issues seriously without facing an immediate

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:55.179
knee-yourself contradiction. And it set off
a lot of the really rich period of research

00:10:55.179 --> 00:11:00.360
and inquiry, nothing like it, in thousands
of years of the history of the study of language

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:07.420
in the last 25, 30 years of a wide variety
of typologically different languages, new

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:12.600
questions at a depth that could never have
been proposed before, sometimes the answers

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.269
leading to new questions and so on in a very
lively period. And it also raised another

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:22.470
question: What about the principles? Where
do they come from? And that's a fact of the

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.601
choice of parameters: Where do these things
come from? If they're in universal grammar,

00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:33.959
if it's part of the genetic endowment, then
it had to evolve somehow. But not a lot could

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:39.869
have evolved because it's too recent, you
know. You go back 100,000 years, there's,

00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:46.939
as far as we know, nothing. Humans had the
same anatomy, anything that's preserved in

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:51.259
the fossil records are about the same, you
know, hundreds of thousand years back. So

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:59.529
some small change must have taken place in
the brain which somehow allowed all of this

00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:05.429
to suddenly blossom and pretty soon after
that, again, in evolutionary time, like, maybe,

00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:11.249
a couple of tens of thousands of years which
is no time at all, humans started leaving

00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:19.249
East Africa where we all come from as far
as anyone knows. So some small groups developed

00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:23.970
this system and then spread it all over the
world and, now, they're all essentially the

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:29.399
same. But what evolved in that short period
of time cannot have been very complex. You

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:36.360
know, I wouldn't expect a series of extensive
stages, like say, development of limbs, you

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:45.490
know, millions of years. Therefore, what you
predict is that some other principle external

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:51.709
to language, maybe some principle of nature,
principle of computational efficiency or something

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:59.759
like that which is not specific to language,
interacted with a small mutation which just

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:07.079
gave rise to the universal grammar. But that
sets forth a new goal of research to ask--to

00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:13.529
see if you can determine, like, the principles
themselves do really have the intricacy that

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:20.350
they appeared to have, but are actually the
result of application of non-linguistic, in

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:26.779
fact, non--maybe, non-human principles, like
general principles of computational efficiency

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:34.350
to whatever small change took place. And the
small change was probably the capacity to

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.600
carry out recursive enumeration, basically,
the capacity that gives you the number system,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.529
for example, to take two things, two objects
already constructed in the mind and make up

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:51.339
a new object out of them and then keep that
process up indefinitely so you get an infinite

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:59.809
array of possible expressions, each with some
semantic interpretation and some mode of externalization,

00:13:59.809 --> 00:14:04.160
speech or sign, whatever it may be; well,
that would be--and the goal would be to try

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:11.230
to show that was essentially instantaneous—-once
the small mutation took place given the--this

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:16.149
operation, recursive enumeration operation,
that allows you to create a discreet infinity

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:21.420
of expressions--structured expressions. Well,
that's at least the feasible picture; the

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:27.449
trick is to show that it's true or how close
it is to true and can you cut away at the

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:32.549
apparent complexity of the principles and
show that they can actually be accounted for

00:14:32.549 --> 00:14:39.850
in terms of general principles of the hold
for organisms--generally perhaps and maybe

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:46.399
even elsewhere in the physical world, and
that are instantly or almost instantly applied

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:53.759
once the original move is made to whatever
small move it was to produce the capacity

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:58.639
for recursive enumeration. Well, that's a
goal, you know. It's far from being attained

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:05.120
but the last 15, 20 years, there's been considerable
progress towards it. But there's a lot of

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:13.101
things that it seemed, 20 years ago, you had
to assign to genetic endowment. It now have

00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:19.829
been rather plausibly shown to be possible
consequences of just application, particularly

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:26.850
the principles of computational efficiency
to a system which had only the ability to

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:32.249
construct an infinite hierarchy of expressions.
And that, we don't know enough about the brain

00:15:32.249 --> 00:15:37.089
to know how might that happen but that could
have been a very small mutation-—just changing

00:15:37.089 --> 00:15:44.229
something in somebody's genome and then spreading
through the small breeding group. So that,

00:15:44.229 --> 00:15:49.800
in that respect, it's a goal, you know, and
steps have been taken towards it. But you

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.959
would expect that something like that ought
to be true, just from the-—what's known

00:15:54.959 --> 00:16:04.790
about the history of evolution of Homo sapiens
in very recent times without much opportunity

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:10.379
for selection that had any effect-—maybe
a small effect but not much. So, that's, I

00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:19.839
think, that's the tendency of thinking, at
least my thinking and some other—-many others,

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:25.420
on how theories of universal grammar have
changed. But the idea that there is universal

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:31.499
grammar that exists, that can't be controversial
unless you believe in magic, not for the elementary

00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:35.319
reasons that I mentioned.
&gt;&gt; MALE: This is from Robin Green. And we

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:39.629
can actually have local questions as well,
but this is one from Robin Green who says,

00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:43.809
"You are well-known for your criticism of
our current generation's lack of insight and

00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:51.279
sense of history but what do you see in the
younger generations that you personally find

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:56.419
energizing and encouraging?"
&gt;&gt; CHOMSKY: I don't know if I had that criticism

00:16:56.419 --> 00:17:01.850
of the younger generation. So, I'm not sure
I accept the premise of the question; although

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:10.799
I think it is a very sad fact about our culture,
our general culture, that it's extremely insular,

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:18.149
ingrown, lack of knowledge of the world, of
history and so on and that really goes way

00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:23.829
back and I think it's probably less true now
than it has been in the past; but it is certainly

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:30.080
true. And in United States, it's dramatically
true as compared with comparable societies.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:36.320
There's some obvious reasons for that. The
United States is very different from any other

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:44.320
industrial society in many respects. For one
thing, I mean, there's talk about, you know,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.600
there's debate about the American empire--is
there one, isn't there one and so on. There

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:55.409
shouldn't be any debate. This is the one country
in the world that was founded as an empire--that's

00:17:55.409 --> 00:18:00.750
what George Washington called a "nationed
empire" when the country was founded. And

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:07.039
the goal, as Washington put it, was to drive
the indigenous population--the savages as

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:14.830
he called them--away; they will disappear
just like the wolves who they are identical

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:21.039
with, except in shape. Thomas Jefferson, for
him, "We are going to drive them behind the

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:27.539
stony mountains where they belong and then
the country will be free of blot or mixture,

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:32.110
red or black..." It didn't quite make it but
that was the goal. "And then this will be

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:39.320
the nest from which the entire hemisphere
is populated by members of our superior race..."

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:45.450
You'd read later of Walt Whitman, others--some
hideous racist comments which were just taken

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:51.289
for granted. So, yes, it's an empire and it
extends--supposed to extend everywhere. Back

00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:58.690
in the, you know, 1820, roughly around then,
the principle was laid down that--as modern

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:04.039
historians put it-- that "expansion is the
path to security. The only way to be secure

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:10.500
is to expand." At that time, the argument
was that's why we had to conquer Florida to

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.990
defend ourselves from what were called "the
runaway slaves and the lawless Indians" who

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:23.130
were a threat because there were in our way
so we have to expand. And then on to the present,

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:28.340
the main scholarly book on the origins of
the Bush doctrine which approves of it; John

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:34.880
Lewis Gaddis, historian at Yale, traces it
back to that moment and says, "Yeah. That's

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.789
the right principle. Expansion is the path
to security," and, now, that means expanding

00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:44.450
over the whole world and, you know, space
and the, you know, the galaxy or whatever.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:50.320
That's the only way to be secure and to ensure
that the empire rules the world. So it's unusual

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.070
country in that respect. I mean, the British
wanted to be an empire. They modeled themselves

00:19:55.070 --> 00:20:02.150
on Rome; but the United States had a different
picture from the origins. Furthermore, once

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:07.269
the native population was, you know, driven
beyond the stony mountains as Jefferson put

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:14.639
it, it was, the country--the continent was
open, you know. They were very rich, you know,

00:20:14.639 --> 00:20:24.240
very rich in resources. Ultimate security,
nobody ever had comfortable security all to

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:30.029
us, you know, where the waves of immigrants
are and there's no reason to look anywhere

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:35.420
else. It's essentially homogenous. So you
travel in Europe, you don't have to go very

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.169
far to hear completely different languages.
We go back 50 years. It was even more so before

00:20:40.169 --> 00:20:45.790
the unifying effects of television and national
states. Just, you know, plenty of people in

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.860
Europe can't talk to their grandmothers because
they speak a different language. But even

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.899
now in Europe, you don't have to go very far
to see different cultures, different languages,

00:20:54.899 --> 00:21:00.519
you know, and so on. In United States, you
go from Boston-Los Angeles and you have so

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:05.500
nothing changes. You have slight difference
in accent, maybe the cars or superhighways

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:12.100
are faster out there but--so there's every
reason to expect people to be insular and

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:18.289
you see it dramatically. I mean... people
are just unaware of what's happening on the

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:25.970
outside world. Actually, this changed significantly
after 9/11. It had an interesting effect in

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.960
the United States. One of the effects was
to engender fear. That was the first attack

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:38.240
on American soil since the British had burned
down Washington in 1814. People mentioned

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.279
Pearl Harbor but it's irrelevant. That was
an attack on a U.S. naval base, and would

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:50.409
have amounted to a colony and, by our standard,
incidentally, a very legitimate attack. I

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:57.210
couldn't explain that if it's not obvious.
But that wasn't an attack on a national territory.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.970
In fact, there has been none except tiny forays;
you know, Pancho Villa got a couple of miles

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.810
into the country or something. But here was
an attack on the national territory--the kind

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:12.549
that other countries face all the time-—and
it did engender fear. That's not what's supposed

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:18.020
to happen but it also opened a lot of minds.
So, I think, since then the insularity has

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:24.990
declined and more people are curious about
the world and even about history and that's

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:33.159
largely an effect of the 1960s. The 1960s
had a highly civilizing effect on the society

00:22:33.159 --> 00:22:38.190
and that's why they're almost universally
condemned as a terrible period, the time of

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.429
troubles and so on. You are going to hear
a lot about that this year because it's the

00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:50.071
40th anniversary of 1968--it's the 40th--do
the arithmetic--but a lot of talk about the

00:22:50.071 --> 00:22:55.070
1968, a terrible time. Actually, it was a
terrible time. It civilized the country. You'll

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:02.230
see it's so in MIT like, say, when I got here,
if you walked down the halls at MIT, what

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:12.179
you saw was well-dressed, differential, white
males doing their homework, no political meetings

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:17.549
advertised. You know, you do your work, you
build the electrical circuit, you know, build

00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:21.410
the bridge, whatever it is. That's a little
bit of a caricature but that's pretty much

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:26.389
what it was. When you take a look down the
halls now, it's totally different; half women,

00:23:26.389 --> 00:23:32.500
third minorities, informal relations, a lot
of activism, all kind of topics and that's

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.179
symbolic of what happened in the country.
And that's a consequence of the civilizing

00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:41.790
effect of the '60s which is, of course, very
frightening to elites. People are supposed

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:47.480
to be passive, apathetic and obedient. In
fact, one of the major studies of the horrible

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:55.330
effect of the 1960's by liberal internationalists,
incidentally, condemned the era for its excess

00:23:55.330 --> 00:24:00.029
of democracy. The book is called "The Crisis
of Democracy." There was too much democracy

00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:05.940
in the 60s. The people who are supposed to
be passive and apathetic and obedient like

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:11.390
minorities, women, the young, the old, what
are called the "special interests"; that is

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:16.809
the whole population except for the corporate
sector. We're supposed to be passive, apathetic

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:21.259
and obedient. They weren't doing it. They
were trying to enter the political arena to

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:25.600
press their demands, you know, change the
society. It was intolerable. We have to have

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.700
more moderation in democracy. And, particularly,
we're concerned about what they called "the

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.471
institutions responsible for the indoctrination
of the young"--their phrase--meaning schools,

00:24:35.471 --> 00:24:41.270
universities, churches and so on. They weren't
indoctrinating the young properly and that's

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:46.210
why we got all these excesses like the women's
movement and the opposition to aggression

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:54.039
and all sorts of terrible things. But the
country did change and positively and it has

00:24:54.039 --> 00:25:01.049
changed a lot since then and that has—-going
back to recognizing history, it did that too.

00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:08.040
At the time, let's give you a personal example,
just not on typical--I had a daughter in fourth

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:16.759
grade in 1969--I remember the time precisely
because of the context-—and this is in Lexington,

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:22.470
which is called a very progressive town, you
know, professionals, academics, everybody

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.309
votes for McGovern, you know, all that sort
of thing. I have been looking through her

00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:35.850
school textbook one day; it was called "Exploring
New England." The structure of the textbook

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:44.190
was there's a young boy. His name is Robert,
and he's being taken through colonial New

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:49.570
England by an older man who shows him the
glories of New England, and I was curious.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:54.159
I was wondering: How are they going to handle
the massacres, you know, like the terrible

00:25:54.159 --> 00:26:02.370
massacre the Pequot massacre--in which the
colonist waited for the men to leave the village

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:08.200
and then went in and slaughtered all the women
and children and old men and when the men

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.910
came back, they were frightened and they all
fled, you know, so they got rid of the Pequot--so

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:19.840
how did they handle this, you know? So I looked
at it and it was described accurately but

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:26.590
with praise and it ends up with Robert, the
young boy, saying, "I wish I were a man and

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.169
had been there" you know. Well, you know,
I sort of couldn't believe it. I showed it

00:26:31.169 --> 00:26:35.700
to my wife. She was appalled, went to talk
to the teacher. The teacher couldn't see what

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:41.430
was wrong with it, you know. That was 1969,
and you couldn't have a textbook like that

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:47.480
in any corner of the country today. It's inconceivable.
There's some recognition of the horrors of

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:54.429
the past. Incidentally, the founding fathers
were well-aware of it. John Quincy Adams,

00:26:54.429 --> 00:27:01.309
for example, I talked about that hapless race
of Native Americans who we are exterminating

00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:08.460
with such merciless cruelty and so on. But
then it sort of disappeared and it just became

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:15.039
an empty continent full of a few scattered
hunter-gatherers and if we kill a couple of

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:19.590
them, that's fine, and so we drive them over
the stony mountains. But, by now, that's gone.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:25.220
You know, there's at least some appreciation
of it and also of slavery and other things.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.240
So there's more understanding of the history.
There's more understanding of the outside

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.820
world; though it's still pretty insular and
I think it's getting better. So I think the

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.539
next generation will be even better in this
respect.

00:27:37.539 --> 00:27:43.799
&gt;&gt; MALE: A question from Trevor Sarah--probably,
maybe it ties in--due to the Internet, mass

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:49.710
media is increasingly becoming more distributed,
blogs, independent news, et cetera. How does

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.280
the Internet media impact propaganda model
described in "Manufacturing Consent"?

00:27:54.280 --> 00:28:01.110
&gt;&gt; CHOMSKY: Well, literally, the propaganda
model described in "Manufacturing Consent"

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:07.970
does a gnarly hold of the Internet. I mean,
that's a model that's concerned with the intuitional

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:15.129
structure of the media. Okay, the media, the
institutional structure is major corporations

00:28:15.129 --> 00:28:21.419
selling audiences to other businesses to simplify
it. And that's not true with the Internet.

00:28:21.419 --> 00:28:27.631
So it doesn't reply directly but it's not
completely inapplicable. So though the Internet,

00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:34.330
like almost the entire Hi-tech economy is
a product of the state sector, I mean, contrary

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:41.340
to illusions, the United States is very far
from a free enterprise market economy. I'm

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:46.080
sure all of you--people know that things like
computers, the Internet and microelectronics

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.029
and biotechnology and I'll go on across the
list, come out of the state sector, places

00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:57.770
like MIT. In fact, for long periods, the Internet
was in the state sector for about 30 years

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:06.869
or more before it was handed over to private
enterprise for profit. But the Internet, nevertheless,

00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:14.369
there is a question and, in fact, it's a live
question now about keeping the Internet neutral,

00:29:14.369 --> 00:29:23.779
the neutrality of the Internet. So will the
few private systems that have control of access

00:29:23.779 --> 00:29:31.330
to the Internet, once it became privatized,
will they be able to use that control to differentiate

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:38.321
access to yield preferred, say, you know,
fast, easy access to the places where they

00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:44.309
want you to go and make it harder and, you
know, more devious and so on for the place

00:29:44.309 --> 00:29:50.370
that I don't want you to go. So that neutrality
is a big issue. People know more about this

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:55.570
than I do. So we'll kind of talk about it.
But in that respect, in that corner of the

00:29:55.570 --> 00:30:01.129
system, yes, the propaganda model still holds,
but other than that, it's been at least in

00:30:01.129 --> 00:30:06.600
its early years, a very free system. When
it was under state control, like control of

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.640
the Pentagon, it was totally free. That's
an illusion that many people have. The Pentagon

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:20.220
is, I mean, actually, we know that here, MIT
was like, you know, maybe 90 percent Pentagon-funded

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:26.360
up until the early '70s and it was the periods
of the greatest freedom. No classified work,

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:33.019
complete, free interchange. You wrote anything
you wanted; nobody cared because the generals,

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:39.629
unlike many economists were well-aware that
the--it's the state sector that's providing

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:46.830
a large part of the initiative, the dynamism,
the inventiveness and so on; that keeps the

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:51.799
hi-tech economy going. So they didn't put
many constraints in. As it gets more corporatized,

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:59.289
there's more constraints. But for a long time,
it was just in the Army. It was the Military.

00:30:59.289 --> 00:31:04.980
You know, it's ARPANET. That was the former
Internet. And just to give you an illustration

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.909
on how it worked, the United States was--I
had another daughter who was living in Nicaragua

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:15.739
in the 1980s, and the United States was carrying
out a major terrorist war against Nicaragua,

00:31:15.739 --> 00:31:20.720
practically destroyed the country. Communication
was impossible. You couldn't go by phone.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.049
You know, the mail wasn't going and so on.
But I could communicate with my daughter through

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:31.049
the Pentagon system. Since I'm in the MIT,
I was on the ARPANET and she found some place

00:31:31.049 --> 00:31:35.700
where she was on the ARPANET. So thanks to
the Pentagon, we were able to communicate

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:40.690
during a period when the US was trying to
destroy the country. That's an indication

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:46.980
of how free it was. And the question is, "Can
it be kept free?" So, yes, that's a problem.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:52.610
But there are other issues that arise with
the Internet that are serious. It's undoubtedly

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:58.840
a tremendous contribution. If you're into
research, for example, it's just fantastic.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:04.549
I probably do 50 Google searches a day or
something like that. And you could get things

00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:10.769
that you'd really--I haven't been in the library
for a long time, but thankfully, I have some

00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:14.460
friends and colleagues who go to the library
for me. But a lot of it, you have to go to

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:21.509
the library for--you can just pick up quickly,
a matter of fact, a lot more. If you want

00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:25.720
to find out about information about, you know,
say what's going on in world news and so on,

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:31.190
yes, if you know where to look, you can find
it. A much wider array of information is available.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:36.179
All of that is positive but it also has a
negative side; in fact, a number of negative

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:45.149
sides. Imagine, say that you're a biologist,
and you have now available every article that's

00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:49.980
been published all over the world on the field
that you are interested in and you spend your

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:56.190
time reading those articles. But the end result
is you're the worst biologist in history.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:02.129
It's a total waste of time. In order to become
a serious biologist, you have to know what

00:33:02.129 --> 00:33:07.989
you're looking for. If you're flooded with
massive information and you sort of try to

00:33:07.989 --> 00:33:13.059
wade through it, you're totally paralyzed.
You have to know what to look for, you have

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:18.220
to know the framework of understanding, you
know, some background conception of what's

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:24.070
going on. The framework can't be rigid like
you have to be willing to let it modified;

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:30.549
but it's indispensable. If you don't have
it, you're just flooded with meaningless information.

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:37.889
What the problem is that the people--a large
majority of people who are using the Internet

00:33:37.889 --> 00:33:42.450
do have a framework but it's the framework
that comes from the indoctrination that they've

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:49.299
been subjected to. Normally, what the propaganda
model applies to and it also generalizes to

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:55.799
the academic, you know, to the schools and
the colleges and to the general intellectual

00:33:55.799 --> 00:34:01.000
community. There is an intellectual community
which the media are a part which I do have

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.200
time to talk about it if you like, but it
does give an extremely skewed picture of the

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.540
world. I could illustrate it from this morning's
newspapers if you want. In fact, you can always,

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:15.970
when I give talks on the media, I usually
never prepare them for the very simple reason,

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:22.069
that morning's newspaper gives all the evidence
you need. It never failed yet in Europe or

00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:29.830
here. So I could talk about it. But it is
an extremely narrow doctrinal universe and,

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:37.799
in fact, the participants have it internalized.
If you want to see a good example of that,

00:34:37.799 --> 00:34:45.950
do a Google search and find a program, an
interview with Charlie Rose, you know, the

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:57.390
intellectual man's interviewer. He interviewed
the most respected correspondent in Iraq,

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:03.770
you know, John Burns, who's kind of like the
dean of the foreign policy--foreign correspondents.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:12.570
It's a very interesting interview and he asks
Burns various questions about reporting in

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:20.260
Iraq, and Burns expresses quite clearly and
I'm sure unconsciously the doctrinal framework

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:27.540
that shapes coverage and interpretation. To
put it simply, we have to be cheering for

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:33.069
the home team so--because the home team is
perfect. You know, that's the picture. So

00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:38.510
what he says is--you have to get it in his
words but the picture is that the United States

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:44.680
is certainly, since the Second World War has
been the major force in the world and protecting

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.500
human rights, freedom, justice, all kind of
wonderful things and history is irrelevant,

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.859
we don't look at that, that's boring; but
that's the nature of the United States, like

00:35:55.859 --> 00:36:02.510
its essence. And he says if the outcome of
the Iraq War was that we would lose our willingness

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:07.619
to intervene all over the world with force
to protect human rights and everything the

00:36:07.619 --> 00:36:12.700
way we've been doing for the past 15 years,
then there will be dark days. Okay, that's

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:18.680
the picture. It's not unlike the picture that
you would have heard from a correspondent

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:26.710
at Pravda in 1985 about how Stalin was defending
democracy and human rights and so on against

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:31.359
the fascist attack, and I probably would have
believed it. I'm sure John Burns believes

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:37.089
it. But if you look at the actual coverage,
it confirms pretty well of what he describes.

00:36:37.089 --> 00:36:43.319
If that's the approach you take towards using
the Internet, you might as well be reading

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:49.730
some local tabloid. That's what you'll find.
If you have a different framework of interpretation,

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:54.730
of understanding, you'll find other things,
whether it's science or public affairs or

00:36:54.730 --> 00:37:03.299
anything else. And that--to achieve that requires
something way beyond access; it requires understanding

00:37:03.299 --> 00:37:10.809
and that comes out of other factors.
&gt;&gt; MALE: On frameworks, Bryan Clint writes

00:37:10.809 --> 00:37:16.230
"Politicians are adept at changing public
opinion by inventing new phrases such as "enemy

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:21.550
combatants" and "enhanced interrogation techniques";
does this expose some flaw in humans that

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.990
we reason based on surface words rather than
their underlying meanings?

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:30.809
&gt;&gt; CHOMSKY: I don't think it's a flaw of humans
and I'm not sure how much to determine--you

00:37:30.809 --> 00:37:36.059
see there's two different questions you have
to distinguish here. So go back to the propaganda

00:37:36.059 --> 00:37:44.079
model. That is a discussion of what the media
are doing as institutions. And, in fact, it

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:50.891
generalizes to the intellectual cultured much
more broadly. But there's a separate question,

00:37:50.891 --> 00:37:55.549
and that is how much are people influenced
by it? That's quite a separate question. Okay,

00:37:55.549 --> 00:38:02.190
so to what extent do people accept and internalize
the doctrinal system that's, say, described

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:09.520
by John Burns? Well, the answer is pretty
complex when you look. And say, for example,

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.309
say, take to Vietnam War. It's far enough
back so we can think about a little bit objectively

00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:20.430
perhaps. If you look over the Vietnam War,
there was never in the mainstream--never is

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:27.420
a strong word; but close to never, like 99.9
percent. A principal critic of the war, New

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:33.549
York Times correspondent C.J. Chivers, who
was there recently talks about "booming Grozny."

00:38:33.549 --> 00:38:38.740
It used to be rubble. Now, it's booming. They
have electricity run by Chechens. Of course,

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:44.119
the Russians are on the background, but a
great success. I mean if Petraeus could achieve

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:51.059
anything remotely like that in Iraq, he'd
probably be crowned king. But we don't praise

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:56.420
Putin; at least we shouldn't. We condemned
it even though it succeeded in their terms

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.940
like the Germans succeeded in Vichy, France--it
was a French-run society and, more or less,

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:07.630
stable; but we don't praise it. However, for
ourselves, we take totally different principles.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:13.640
We never, almost never permit or can't even
think of a principled critique of our own

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:22.480
crimes. You can test it. But what about public
opinion? Well, there you got a striking gulf.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:28.411
So, for example, when the Vietnam War ended,
everyone, you know, serious analysts had to

00:39:28.411 --> 00:39:33.609
write a commentary on it and the most interesting
ones, as always, or way out on are the ones

00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:39.180
at the left extreme of the mainstream. So,
say, take Anthony Lewis of the New York Times

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:45.150
who's about as far as we can get and, you
know, not be from Neptune or something. But

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:53.079
he wrote a critical commentary; he said the
Vietnam War began with, like, blundering efforts

00:39:53.079 --> 00:40:00.640
to do good. Notice that that's mostly tautology.
Since we carried it out, it was efforts to

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:08.140
do good, period; no further discussion necessary.
That's by definition. It was blundering because

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:13.210
it didn't entirely work. So, it began with
blundering efforts to do good, but he says,

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:21.740
by 1969, coming back to the date, it was clear
to most of the world that it was too costly

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:28.900
to ourselves, okay? That's the left end of
the critical spectrum. You can search and

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.520
see if you could find anything that goes beyond
that. But what did the public think? Well,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:40.300
we know. In 1969, it happens, the first general
polls were taken of public opinion on the

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.510
Vietnam War. General, important ones, the
Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations, they

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:54.070
continue to be taken up till today quadrennially.
In 1969, 70 percent of the public said the

00:40:54.070 --> 00:41:01.470
war was fundamentally wrong and immoral, not
a mistake. Try to find that anywhere in mainstream

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:09.000
discussion. Okay? Good exercise. And those
figures persist up until the latest polls,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.170
a little vacillation, but basically, there's
a huge gulf between public opinion and intellectual

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:21.059
elites, the doctorinal managers. And that's
true on a lot of other issues. That's true

00:41:21.059 --> 00:41:27.210
on the Iraq war. That's true on the threat
to invade Iran. That's true on national health

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:31.901
care. That's true on relations with Cuba.
You know, just run across the list. And it

00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:38.119
turns out there's a huge gulf between public
opinion and intellectual opinion; hence, doctrine,

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:43.970
media and so on. So that does raise a question
about the extent to which the public actually

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.840
accepts this. To what extent they do, so I'll
take your example, just like enemy combatant.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.591
Well, what's an enemy combatant? Well, actually
one of them is coming up for trial. I think

00:41:53.591 --> 00:42:00.200
it may be the first trial from Guantanamo.
It turns out it's a kid who was picked up

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.869
as an enemy combatant when he was 15 years
old because he did something, maybe threw

00:42:05.869 --> 00:42:12.619
a stone or did something, maybe shot or something,
an American soldier, okay, so therefore we

00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:19.230
have to try him and maybe sentence him. He's
been in Guantanamo for years now. Who knows

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:26.289
what will happen to him? What kind of a framework
is that? I mean if the United States was invaded

00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:34.290
by Iran, let's say, and some 15-year-old kid
tried to do something to the invaders, is

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:44.070
he criminal? I mean, the framework, the conception
is kind of like in outer space; unfortunately,

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.350
it's real. And what was the other term you
asked?

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.880
MALE: Enhanced interrogation.
CHOMSKY: Yeah, enhanced interrogation, it's

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:56.030
just another word for torture. Like there's
a huge fuss now about Guantanamo. Delegations

00:42:56.030 --> 00:43:01.069
are taken there by the Army to show how beautifully
the prisoners are treated, and there's books

00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:05.859
and articles about is there torture and so
on and so forth. It's all totally beside the

00:43:05.859 --> 00:43:12.190
point, entirely beside the point. As soon
as you hear that those who are captured are

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:18.170
taken to Guantanamo, you know it's a torture
chamber. There is no other reason for sending

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:24.480
them to Guantanamo. Why not send them to a
security prison in New York, let's say? Okay?

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.680
It's perfectly safe, they'll never get out
and so on. Well, the problem is if you send

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.119
them to New York, automatically, you start
getting the whole civil rights system coming

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:39.880
in. Did they have lawyers? You know, can they
be tortured? Are they told the charges against

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:45.030
them and so on? You send them to Guantanamo,
you can do anything you like. So, therefore,

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:50.130
as soon as we hear the word Guantanamo, we
know it's torture chamber without the investigations,

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:56.010
without the inquiries, anything and then you
can ask a further question: What's U.S. doing

00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:03.280
in Guantanamo? I mean, actually, the reason
they chose Guantanamo was because they can

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.599
pretend that the U.S. doesn't have jurisdiction,
because it's in Cuba. Okay? So the courts

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:12.040
don't have jurisdiction, and there's big debates
about that. But the debates are ridiculous,

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.231
of course. I mean, what is the U.S. doing
in Guantanamo in the first place? Well, it

00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:21.030
turns out, if you look back, that there's
a treaty between the U.S. and Cuba, which

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:27.150
Cuba signed at gunpoint. It was under military
occupation. And the treaty has absolutely

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:32.200
no validity by any standards you could think
of, and the treaty allowed the United States

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:40.540
to use Guantanamo--it's a big port--as a calling
station for the Navy. It didn't say anything

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:48.400
about keeping prisoners there so we're violating
the illegal treaty that we forced on Cuba.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.630
And, in fact, why is the United States--it
leads to a further question. Why does the

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:57.799
U.S. hold on Guantanamo altogether? Well,
for one thing, it is a major port, a naval

00:44:57.799 --> 00:45:04.329
base for controlling the Caribbean and South
America. But there's another reason. It prevents

00:45:04.329 --> 00:45:10.859
Cuban development. That means that the eastern
end to the island is blocked from development.

00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:17.960
So if you want to strangle and destroy Cuba,
which we've wanted to do since 1959 for reasons

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:22.380
that are explained in the internal record
because of--and we go back to the Kennedy

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:27.910
and Johnson administration, because of it's
successful defiance of U.S. principles going

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:33.589
back to the Monroe doctrine and the Russians.
The Monroe Doctrine stated we're going to

00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:39.339
run the hemisphere. That was the goal of the
founding fathers. As I said, Jefferson, it's

00:45:39.339 --> 00:45:44.160
the nest, we're the nest from which we'll
people the whole continent getting rid of,

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:50.630
you know, the red men and the Spanish speakers.
And Cuba is carrying a successful defiance

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:55.310
of this, and that's intolerable so, therefore,
we have to seriously punish the people of

00:45:55.310 --> 00:46:01.260
Cuba as we've been doing with terrorism, economic
strangulation and so on. Incidentally, an

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:06.599
opposition to popular will here; a large percentage
of the American population, that's around,

00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:12.089
that's usually around two-thirds think we
are under normal relations with Cuba. But

00:46:12.089 --> 00:46:18.200
holding on to Guantanamo is part of the strangulation
of Cuba, ensuring that they can't develop

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.250
into the island which we have based for trade
with Europe and so on and so forth. Well,

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:26.840
all of these questions are the ones that would
be in headlines in the free press, and not

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:32.800
whether this particular 15-year-old shot an
American soldier invading his country. So,

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.700
yeah, there's a lot hidden behind the word
"enemy combatant." And, in fact, you can just

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:42.789
take about almost anywhere of political discourse.
You almost pick it at random. I mean, it has

00:46:42.789 --> 00:46:49.329
two meanings. It has its literal meaning and
it has its doctrinal meaning. And the two

00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:54.250
have, usually, almost nothing to do with each
other. So it takes aggression, an important

00:46:54.250 --> 00:47:00.860
term. It has a technical meaning. It was defined
at the Nuremberg Tribunal, and it was then

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:08.530
accepted internationally. But what it means
is the obvious thing: sending military forces

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:14.559
into another country, you know, not at their
request or something. Okay, that's aggression.

00:47:14.559 --> 00:47:21.279
And that's the term we used, applied to anyone
else. Like the Nazi war criminals, the primary

00:47:21.279 --> 00:47:26.670
reason they were hanged was because of the
crime of aggression. And, incidentally, which

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:33.630
is defined more carefully. It defines--the
Nuremberg Tribunal defines aggression as the

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:41.339
supreme international crime which encompasses--which
differs from other crimes in that it encompasses

00:47:41.339 --> 00:47:48.480
all of the evil that follows. So the initial
aggression in Iraq encompasses the sectarian

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:55.400
warfare, the destruction of the antiquities,
the millions of refugees. Everything that

00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:01.190
happened since is encompassed in the initial
act of aggression. Justice Jackson, the American

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:09.390
justice at Nuremberg gave a passionate declaration
to the tribunal. He said that, "We're handing

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:15.109
the defendants a poisoned chalice, and if
we ever sip from it," meaning if we are ever

00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:20.099
guilty of the same crimes, "we must suffer
the same punishment or else the whole trial

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:26.839
is a farce." Okay? Again, this should be the
headlines, except for one problem: The United

00:48:26.839 --> 00:48:33.570
States cannot commit aggression by definition.
We don't commit aggression. Take a look at

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:40.910
the front page of the Wall Street Journal
today, the big lead article, "Iran still—-U.S

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:47.740
claims Iran is still sending arms to Iraq."
Maybe true. Is Iran the only country sending

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:56.039
arms to Iraq? Well, Condoleezza Rice a little
while back was asked on television, "What's

00:48:56.039 --> 00:49:02.059
the solution to the Iraq problem?" She said,
"Simple, just end the flow of foreign fighters

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:09.549
and foreign arms, then it's over." Nobody
batted an eyelash, for good reason. We--our

00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:14.860
forces are not foreign. They are indigenous.
Wherever they are, they are indigenous. If

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:21.130
we invaded Canada, we would be there by right.
And if a Canadian, a 15-year-old kid threw

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:26.160
a stone at an American soldier, he'd be an
enemy combatant, and we send him to Guantanamo.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.470
And it follows from a very elementary principle.
It's the one on which the country was founded,

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:36.930
we're a nationed empire; expansion is the
path to security; we are indigenous everywhere.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:44.579
We own the world so, therefore, the questions
can't be asked. And if you look at commentary

00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:53.119
and debate and discussion, we find that that's
internalized. Nobody points to it. It's just

00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:58.250
part of our picture of the world, you know.
And that infects everything. That's why every

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:03.800
term, like the terms we used has, from an
outside point of view, it sounds like you're

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.349
talking about a bunch of madmen.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Marie Bingham writes, "There has

00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:14.049
been a lot of discussion about the detrimental
effects of e-mail, instant messengers, and

00:50:14.049 --> 00:50:19.360
this phone text messaging and the like on
syntax and grammar, especially English, do

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.480
you feel this is the case or these changes
are just a part of natural evolution of language?"

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:31.480
&gt;&gt; CHOMSKY: Well, I have experience with it
having two 15-year-old grandsons. When my

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:37.210
grandson comes over to the house to do what's
engaging, what's called doing his homework,

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:41.990
you know, Sunday evening. Of course, everything
is put off till the Sunday evening. He sits

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:48.859
there with his computer in front of him, earplugs,
listening to something that's called music.

00:50:48.859 --> 00:50:54.779
Don't ask me to describe it. And while he
is doing this thing called homework, he is

00:50:54.779 --> 00:51:02.470
meanwhile text messaging to about 15 friends
in a form which I can't even read. You know,

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:08.790
it's just a few letters and you know. It's
not doing anything to the language. I mean

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:13.390
I think that's a mistake. The language is
robust enough so it won't be affected by that.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:20.670
But I think it's doing something to the minds.
You know, the--the kids are just stimulus-hungry.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:27.212
They can't set aside, like, my own children,
let's say, you know, they go to the library

00:51:27.212 --> 00:51:32.690
and pick up 10 books and come home, and go
off into a corner and read the books. I actually

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:37.480
have a granddaughter in, grew up in Nicaragua,
and now in Mexico, and when she comes to visit,

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:41.790
it's the first thing she does, 10 years old,
go to the public library, come back with a

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:46.819
stack of books, go off in a corner and read
them. It's almost inconceivable for a kid

00:51:46.819 --> 00:51:50.859
that age here. I mean, maybe there are some
but, you know, they're just--they have to

00:51:50.859 --> 00:51:58.700
be stimulated constantly by noise, by visual
imagery, by what's called interchange with

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:04.200
friends, although the interchange are so superficial
that it's shocking, you know, to take a look

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.589
at it when they decode it for you. And I'm
sure that's having an effect. It's having

00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:15.670
an effect on children growing up, and I don't
think a good effect. But it's not really an

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:19.840
effect on the language. That's not going to
change. I mean, it's true that if you look

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.329
over the history of language, teenage--teenagers
generally tend to develop around sort of argot,

00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:30.200
you know, way of talking. And I mean, it's
one of the sources of innovation and change

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.720
in language because the teenagers grow up
and, you know, they get what--they sort of

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:41.339
develop this peer group, separation from the
adult world, those have some effect on what

00:52:41.339 --> 00:52:46.349
the next stage of the language is though not,
you know, not like on the syntax or anything

00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:50.839
like that. But this I think is serious and
it's having--and I think one should be concerned

00:52:50.839 --> 00:52:56.170
about the effect on the children. I can see
the differences on, say, my grandchildren

00:52:56.170 --> 00:53:01.000
who grew up here and the ones who grew up
south of the border, you know. And I suspect

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.583
that's fairly general. As for e-mail, it is
a mixed blessing. I mean, I think it's a great

00:53:07.583 --> 00:53:12.990
thing. On the other hand, I spend maybe five
or six hours a night just answering queries

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:18.920
and comments. So I'm not sure if it's the
best way of distributing energy but...

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:27.840
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Well, thank you very much for coming
here.
