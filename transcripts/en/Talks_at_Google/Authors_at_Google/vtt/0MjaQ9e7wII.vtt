[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.060
KIRK LOMBARD: So
let's do that one.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.120
This is a famous one,
especially if you're in Ireland.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
And it's really what
I am at this point,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500
well, beyond going out
to catch my own dinner,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.680
I am a fishmonger.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.460
I have to accept that
that's what I am.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.900
I'm a fisherman too, but
I'm mostly a fish monger.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.360
This book, however, is about
how to catch your own fish.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.012
But there's a lot of
songs about fisherman,

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:39.220
but there's only like two
or three about fishmongers.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.890
So here's one.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.420
[SINGING "MOLLY MALONE"]

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:48.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.130
You see, the real
reason that we do

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.180
that is just it loosens
me up, and then it's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.550
kind of nice to
start with clapping.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.830
Whether I end with clapping
or not is a whole other issue.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.380
Well here's my book.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.650
And I'm supposed to talk
about my book today.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.814
And run a business
called Sea Forager.

00:03:12.814 --> 00:03:14.230
Many of you may
know this already,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.340
but I'm just going to
backtrack a little bit.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.980
And Sea Forager
is the culmination

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.180
of sort of my crazy
misspent life walking

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.940
the intertidal
zone of this area.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.080
The intertidal zone
is a fancy term

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.950
for that area between
high tide and low tide.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.030
That's kind of my zone.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.850
There's a famous book about the
intertidal zone of California

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.406
called "Between Pacific Tides."

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:43.280
Raise your hand if you've
heard of this book?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.404
Oh great, that's excellent.

00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:51.330
It just makes me feel smarter
than you, or more nerdy,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.940
really.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.760
"Between Pacific Tides"
was written by a biologist

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.830
by the name of Doc
or Ed Ricketts.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.350
Ed Ricketts was the
central character

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.630
in Steinbeck's "Cannery Row,"
and was also Steinbeck's best

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.650
friend, John
Steinbeck's best friend.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.570
And they wrote a
little book called

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.930
"The Log Book of
the Sea of Cortez,"

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.660
which is a wonderful
sort of travelogue

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.637
of their experiences
in the intertidal zone,

00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:23.220
that area between high tide and
low tide, along the California

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.140
coast all the way down to Baja.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.390
And it's kind of a cool place.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.240
I didn't actually mean
to do this, but why not?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.890
That book, "Between Pacific
Tides," sort of made

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.100
the California intertidal zone,
put it on the map, so to speak.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.620
It's sort of a tome
of marine biology.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.540
So if you go to Humboldt
State or wherever,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.130
you can get a good
degree in marine biology,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.690
and you'll know all about
"Between Pacific Tides."

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.900
And if you get a first
edition copy of that book,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.930
you'll notice it looks-- sort
of the aesthetic of the cover

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.120
is not dissimilar to this.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.230
And that's not an accident.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.790
My book is a foraging
and fishing guide.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.730
It is not a textbook
of marine biology.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.700
This is filled with
humorous haikus and poems

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.390
and funny anecdotes about
some of the strange things

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.810
that I've eaten and
hunted on the shoreline.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.680
In other words, it's
not a piece of science.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.920
And yet there's some good
scientific data in here,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.180
if you are interested in that.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.780
But I was so influenced by that
book "Between Pacific Tides"

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.320
and by its writer,
Doc Ricketts, who's

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.660
one of the great eccentrics
of the California shores.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.050
He tragically died at
the age of, I think,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.430
38 or something, so very young.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.800
He was hit by a train.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.920
And it took him three days
to die after getting run over

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.180
by a train.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.110
And John Steinbeck
said rather famously--

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.020
they were like best
friends, inseparable.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.830
And Steinbeck, who
was just heartbroken

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.500
by this, he said, "Well,
the only thing that could

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.190
have killed Ed was a train.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.460
And it took three days at that."

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.530
In any case, when I got my
buddy Leighton to do all the art

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.290
work.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.810
And if you just look through
this, and you kind of just,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.850
boop, boop, boop,
I think you'll see

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.200
that the detail and sort
of the humor come through.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.420
So if you look at the
[INAUDIBLE] page on page 85,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.210
you'll see that the
thing that he always

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.310
puts in the background
of an image,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.030
so that you can see the size,
is some form of detritus

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.360
from our American civilization.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.530
So if you look in
the bait section,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.320
you'll see under the--
innkeeper warm on 81, a rather

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.272
adult illustration.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.370
Yeah, because the
fat innkeeper one

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.670
is also called the penis
fish, by various cultures.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.770
And, well, you can see that
there is a spent condom wrapper

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.180
there to illustrate the size.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.040
And then if you
look at page 168--

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.400
I just thumbed through there--
we were singing about cockles

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.847
and mussels, and we got all
kinds of cockles and mussels

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:28.930
in this book if you're
interested in those things.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.946
We have cockles in California.

00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:32.820
There's cockles that
everybody calls cockles,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.750
and then there's real cockles.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.840
We talk about that later.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.530
But if you look on
page 168, you'll

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.160
see the size of the thing
that he put for scale here

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.370
is a cigarette butt.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.140
So I wanted it to sort of
have this feeling of being

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.442
part of the modern world.

00:07:49.442 --> 00:07:51.150
And that's how Leighton
chose to do that.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.015
But Leighton, the
illustrator of this book,

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.640
is just somebody I've
known a long time

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.720
and I've just always
loved his little drawings,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.340
and I wanted to
collaborate with him.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.800
And so the publisher, when
they saw a few of his drawings,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.910
they immediately hired
him on, and paid him

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.560
to do all of the illustrations.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.610
But he didn't just want
to do illustrations.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.360
He wanted to have a hand
in the design of the book.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.150
And so he called me
one day, after he had

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.364
been hired on to the project.

00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:17.530
And we were both very happy.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.790
And he said, Kirk, "I don't just
want to do the illustrations.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.200
I want to have some say
in the font and the color

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.970
and the cover and
the back cover.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.360
I don't want them just to
take it and do their thing.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.810
I want to have some input."

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.200
I said, "Well, you've
gotta talk to the designer.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.789
I'm not sure she's
open to that."

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.309
As it turns out, she
was open to that,

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:38.990
and actually did a great job.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:45.570
But in any case, the
point being that while I

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.660
was talking to Leighton,
and he was telling me

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.470
that he had a larger
goal, he said, "So,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.580
just speaking
aesthetically, what do you

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.840
want this book to look like?"

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.920
And I said, "Well,
there's a book,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.860
the first edition of this
very famous marine biology

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.380
tome that all fish geeks
know all about this book

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.870
or all vertebrate geeks
know about this book."

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.730
And I just assumed
that Leighton would not

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.660
know this book because he's
not an outdoorsman kind of guy.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.984
He's more of just a
brilliantly talented artist,

00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:20.650
but I don't think of
him as a person who

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.220
forages in the intertidal zone.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.302
So I didn't think he would know
about "Between Pacific Tides."

00:09:26.302 --> 00:09:28.760
And I said, "Well, the name of
the book is 'Between Pacific

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.410
Tides.' And if you get a first
edition copy, I'll pay for it.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.960
I just want you to look at it
so you get a sense of the feel

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.620
and the look of that book."

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.140
And he goes, "That's strange,
because I'm holding a first

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.410
edition copy of 'Between Pacific
Tides.' I've had it for, like,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.415
my entire life.

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:47.620
It's like 35 years old,"
or however old Leighton is.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.370
"And it was sitting
right here on my desk.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.720
And that's actually
why I was calling you.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.011
I wanted to know if you wanted
the book to kind of look

00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:53.600
like that."

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.340
And it was one of those
moments of synchronicity.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.730
But it gets weirder.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.325
And I said, "So Leighton,
you're not a forager.

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:03.700
You're not a fisherman and
you're not a marine biologist.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.783
Why do you have that book?

00:10:04.783 --> 00:10:07.000
And why do you have a
first edition copy of it?"

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.410
And he said, "Well, I've been
meaning to tell you this,

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.580
but did you know that my
grandfather, Richie Lovejoy,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.770
did all of the illustrations for
'Between Pacific Tides?' I said

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.560
"No, I had no idea," which
is just really bizarre.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.780
And you know, when
things come together

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.590
like that-- it was
sort of at that moment

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.510
that-- I knew from the
start that Leighton

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.530
was the guy for the job.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.420
But then that just kind
of cemented the deal.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.720
And so I gave Leighton,
in the back of the book,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.690
there's a little-- I love his--
he always remains incognito.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.710
He did a little sketch
in the back of the book,

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.830
and he didn't want
our full visages.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.330
If you go back to page
257, he put a catfish

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.360
in front of his face.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.130
Of course that catfish,
in Vietnam or somewhere

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.960
in Southeast Asia, that catfish
is referred to as a lele.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.990
And that happens to be
Leighton's nickname.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.070
But on the last couple
pages, page 258, 259,

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.610
I let Leighton tell the story
of his grandfather Richie

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.970
Lovejoy, who was best friends
with Ed Ricketts and John

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.872
Steinbeck.

00:11:23.872 --> 00:11:26.080
I want you to know that I'm
more proud of the editing

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.510
that I did on these--
because this was six pages.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.510
Leighton is a little verbose.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.560
I cut him down to
a page and a half.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.360
I'm very proud of that.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.160
And he would be
happy about that too,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.170
because he kind of went
off on some tangents.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.765
He doesn't know
this, so hopefully he

00:11:41.765 --> 00:11:42.640
won't see this video.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.580
Hi Leigh.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:53.030
Anyway, so blah, blah,
blah, so here's my book.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:58.490
And this book is basically a
coming together of the walking

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.040
tours that I do
around San Francisco

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.190
where I take people out.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.909
I took a bunch of
Google people out once,

00:12:03.909 --> 00:12:05.700
right across the street
on the Embarcadero.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.650
Is that there?

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.880
It's there, right?

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.260
And like when you go and
you sit at the counter

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.660
where I just ate lunch,
and you look down,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.860
that's where I did my
walking tour for you guys.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.910
And then along
that same shoreline

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.940
I do herring tours
in the winter,

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.930
because that whole
shoreline just becomes

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.160
infested with Pacific herring.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.240
When they spawn, they
spawn right there,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.675
and armed with a casting net,
you can throw a casting net

00:12:32.675 --> 00:12:34.660
and get your supply of
herring for the year.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.230
Most people, that would
be like three pounds.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.700
That's not mine.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.180
But in one throw when
you're fishing for herring,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.390
you can you get 25 pounds
if they're really spawning.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.370
And it's just amazing.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.157
You can do that right here.

00:12:48.157 --> 00:12:50.740
As I discussed in the book, when
you're eating small schooling

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.620
fish that aren't eating in
the area where you catch them,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.720
the health risks are minimal.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.150
Herring don't live long enough
to bioaccumulate toxins.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.025
So I'm just sort of
thinking ahead here, I'm

00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:04.650
talking about catching
herring, getting

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.691
your supply for the year.

00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:09.250
And I know you guys are
thinking, from there?

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.500
But again, this is a
small schooling fish

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.917
that lives up to
maybe five years,

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.666
doesn't have time to
bioaccumulate toxins.

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:17.050
So they're super high in omega
3s and all the good things

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.180
that a fish has.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.784
Just in the winter, it's just
insane the amounts of herring.

00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:23.450
I mean literally, you
take a little net,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.200
you throw it in the
water, you pull it up,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.880
and there's 25 pounds
of flapping fish.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.360
I used to have a
video of myself,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.377
and I showed you guys
that one of my talks here.

00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.710
I held up the cell and everybody
was just-- because it's

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.570
right by the arrow,
the bow and arrow,

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.790
like right on the other side of
that right where the water is

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.190
just-- throwing that in
the water in the winter,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.280
on certain days.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.360
Anyway, I don't know why
I'm going there, but--

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.566
I do these tours.

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:49.440
And this was the
culmination of all the stuff

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.550
I talk about on my tours, plus
little anecdotes and things.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.680
One of my favorite chapters
to read from in here

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.200
is my bait chapter.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.940
And there's a reason for that.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.740
I tend to notice
that most books that

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.980
talk-- most books
about fishing, that

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.480
mention fishing in any way--
there's a lot more than fishing

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:09.980
in here.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.190
There's sea weeds and clams
and mussels and everything.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.350
But there's a lot of
fish talk in here.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.400
And most books that
talk about fishing,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.850
I just find them
terribly boring,

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.000
because it's usually about how
do you catch the biggest fish.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.320
And this goes for most fishing
websites and most fishing blogs

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.220
and fishing videos on YouTube.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.830
It's, OK, this guy's going to
show us the big fish, which

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.610
is compensation usually
for something else,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.250
or I should say a lack of
something else, in my opinion.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.630
In any case, I wanted
to give a whole chapter

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.460
to the little fish that people
use for bait in our area.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:56.230
And one of those fish is
a remarkable toadfish.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.239
I guess they're called toadfish
because they have-- well they

00:14:59.239 --> 00:15:00.280
look kind of like a toad.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.029
They have these little
bumps on their eyes

00:15:02.029 --> 00:15:04.890
and they've got an
ugly face like a toad.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.670
But they have this other
salient characteristic

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:12.710
that toads and frogs have,
which is that they sing.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.260
And this singing fish is
called the plainfin midshipman.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.130
And it strikes me as
bizarre, even now,

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.600
having talked about this
fish ad infinitum, all

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.260
of these little mud
dwelling little fish-- now

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.110
this guy's about the size
of this book, a big one.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.480
And there's a
whole bunch of them

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.867
that live in the same area
that look kind of similar

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:35.700
and live in the mud.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.850
And you could turn a rock over
at low tide in San Francisco

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.230
Bay in the summer, you'll
find these little fish.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:46.320
And they're all little
ugly, but kind of cute,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:53.830
mud dwelling monster looking
fish with totally weird names.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.330
The one that I'm
going to talk about

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.746
is called the
plainfin midshipman.

00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:59.190
But the fish that you
often find right next to it

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.170
is called longjawed
mudsucker, which I just

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.550
find that is such a great name.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.633
It's like something that
you would yell at someone

00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:06.540
you don't like.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.914
But it's a beautiful
little fish.

00:16:07.914 --> 00:16:10.410
It used to be the
dominant mudsucker.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.050
It's such a dubious distinction.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.900
It was at one time the dominant
mudsucker of our region,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:24.610
but it's been replaced by an
invasive goby from Tokyo Bay

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.080
called the yellowfin goby, which
in Japan is called the haze

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.880
or the "haz-ay."

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.255
I don't know how
to pronounce it.

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:31.270
It's spelled H-A-Z-E.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.080
And they have
little charter boats

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.390
that go out into
Tokyo Bay and catch

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.900
this fish as a targeted
fish that people eat.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.720
No one that I know of
in San Francisco Bay

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.090
has ever eaten one of
these, but we have them

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.187
here now because they
travel in ballast water.

00:16:47.187 --> 00:16:48.770
And then when the
big tankers come in,

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.936
they dump the ballast water.

00:16:49.936 --> 00:16:53.300
And now we have
this other species

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.970
called the yellowfin
goby, which has

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.320
displaced our lovely longjaw
mudsucker because it's

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.624
more adaptable.

00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:02.540
So there's the longjaw
mudsucker, the plainfin

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.040
midshipman.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.060
And then there's a thing
called the Pacific staghorn

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.430
sculpin, which is named for the
opercular spine that comes out

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.150
of its gill, has little
notches on the side of it

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.460
that some biologist
with a microscope

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.359
decided looked like
the antlers of a stag.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.319
So they called it the
Pacific staghorn sculpin.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.060
And these are all
fish that at low tide

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.893
if you went down there
and turned over rocks

00:17:23.893 --> 00:17:24.826
you would find.

00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:26.200
And then the last
one, of course,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.680
has the best name
of all, and that

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.640
is the sarcastic fringehead.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.870
And the sarcastic
fringehead, I really--

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.090
you guys are all,
I know, eminently

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.920
capable of doing this.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.400
Go to YouTube and do a search
for mating ritual or mating

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.060
fight of the
sarcastic fringehead.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.790
You will not be disappointed.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:54.360
The head of this fish, its
mouth is proportionately,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:00.640
I think, larger than the
proportionate body size

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.510
to mouth ratio of any species.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.037
So when it fights,
it unfurls the mouth.

00:18:06.037 --> 00:18:08.370
So you have this little fish
that's got a body this long

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.010
and a head that's like that.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.320
It's insane.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.659
It's just designed by evolution
to just freak people out

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:17.450
to make them laugh.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.814
In any case, back to the point.

00:18:22.814 --> 00:18:24.480
My little fish that
I want to talk about

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.040
is called the
plainfin midshipman.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.622
And it's got all
these great talents.

00:18:27.622 --> 00:18:29.330
I'm going to go through
them real quickly

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.871
and then I'm going
to read the story.

00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:32.630
It's a page and a half.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.820
Among the many talents is that
singing that I talked about.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.660
But it also has this
fish, the plainfin,

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.630
he has spots all over
the sides and belly.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:49.440
And when it's been eating a
certain type of phytoplankton,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.340
the spots light up bright
blue like your shirt,

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.905
except iridescent.

00:18:53.905 --> 00:18:56.460
And they blink like
a Christmas tree.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.590
So it's a humming fish that
lights up with blue spots.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.404
It also has poison in its
mucus around its spines

00:19:05.404 --> 00:19:06.820
so that if you get
jabbed with it,

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.460
your thumbs-- your fingers
kind of blow up like sausages.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.820
And beyond that, it also
has the unique ability

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:21.490
to survive an incredibly wide
ranging series of depths.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.410
So it lives offshore
in 3,000 feet of water,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.910
and then when it's
time for spawning

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.500
it comes all the way
into San Francisco Bay

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.020
and goes down to Candlestick
Park in the toxic mud

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.210
flats and digs under a rock
in three inches of water.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.170
And the female lays
her little golden eggs

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.640
on the ceiling, if you will,
of the rock that she goes in.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.140
And she lays the eggs.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.060
And then the male comes
in in a successive wave.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.060
And the male comes in and
goes into that burrow.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.360
And she's like sitting there.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.485
And the first male comes
in. "She's like get away,"

00:19:51.485 --> 00:19:52.130
bap, bap, bap.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.713
And she knocks him
away and he leaves.

00:19:53.713 --> 00:19:55.910
And then the male that
she's looking for,

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.710
he comes in the hole, and
she goes, "Oh, OK, come in."

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.242
And then she goes,
"They're my eggs."

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.700
She doesn't really
speak like this.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.540
I'm anthropomorphizing the fish.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.870
And so she lets this male in.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.340
And the male, you know,
he's like OK, this is it.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.090
This is where I'm going
to be for a while.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.046
And then she takes
off and she goes

00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:20.420
and gets nice and big and fat
so that maybe at some point

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.810
she can make more eggs.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.850
And she goes out every day
and she forages and eats.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.730
Meanwhile, the male
that she's agreed upon,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:31.370
well he gets to spritz
those eggs with his seed.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.516
And then his job for the rest
of the summer is to sit there.

00:20:34.516 --> 00:20:36.390
Every single time a
little piece of mud lands

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.090
on one of those eggs,
he picks it off.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.506
And he keeps them
perfectly clean.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.890
And if a male comes in to
try to spritz those eggs,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:51.460
he chases the male away,
unless it's the type two male.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.760
The type two male is the beta
male of the plainfin midshipman

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.600
population.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.150
And the type two male
impersonates a female,

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.330
and then goes into
the same hole.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:07.337
And when the guard, the male
who's guarding those eggs,

00:21:07.337 --> 00:21:08.920
he sees the female
come in, he thinks,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.080
well maybe she'll plant
some more eggs on it

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.780
to do the thing.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.779
So I won't chase her away.

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:16.570
And he's like, OK, you
can stay over there.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.460
And he kind of watches her.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.660
And then when he's
not looking, basically

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.730
that female
impersonator, who has

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.560
gigantic testes compared to the
other one-- I don't know why.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.400
But the invader, the type
two male, suddenly goes over

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.670
and he spritz the eggs.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.116
So any eggs that weren't
fertilized by the first one

00:21:35.116 --> 00:21:36.240
get fertilized by that one.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.420
And so that's how the
beta male keeps his genes

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.170
in the population.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:47.180
I know too much about this
species to speak about it

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.040
for less than 20 minutes.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.050
In any case, I have now
told you everything you

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.982
need to know about this fish.

00:21:53.982 --> 00:21:56.190
The way we catch them as
fishermen, and the reason we

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.227
use them, we use them for
bait because you take a hook,

00:22:00.227 --> 00:22:02.060
big hook, and you stick
it through his nose,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.860
and you throw the
midshipman out there,

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.410
and they're so tough
they don't die.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.200
So you can fish with one for
hours and hours and hours.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.390
Even when they die, they
release some kind of ooze

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.740
that fish really like to eat.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.010
So what fishermen look
for in a live bait

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.510
is something that
wriggles and stays

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.700
alive on the hook
for a long time.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.930
And this has always struck
me as uniquely tragic,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:29.420
to value an animal for how
wonderfully it suffers.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.720
And so I just thought
that no one else

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.310
is going to write
this chapter singing

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.440
the praises of this little
fish, so I'm going to do it.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.790
And I call this little piece,
that's in the back of my book--

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.760
and it's, I think,
representative of sort

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.104
of my feeling about the book.

00:22:46.104 --> 00:22:48.520
There's a lot of little pieces
that are kind of like this.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.136
I try to take a
different look at things.

00:22:52.136 --> 00:22:53.760
This little thing is
called, "The death

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.560
song of the toadfishes."

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.150
"I'm not sure why,
but leopard sharks--"

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.830
leopard sharks are very common
mud-dwelling, bottom-dwelling

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.220
sand shark type of thing
that lives out in the Bay.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.850
They're not like a piscivorous
shark with big teeth.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.180
They're a sluggish
bottom dweller.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.770
"I'm not sure why, but leopard
sharks really like midshipman.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.180
And for a halibut or anything
else to take your offering

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.920
of one, it's going
to have to get

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.250
in line behind every leopard
shark inhabiting the spot

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.170
where you're fishing.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.610
My last time out on
my kayak, I caught

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.881
about a half a dozen sharks
on a single plainfin.

00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:37.130
He couldn't seem to stay in
the water for five minutes

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.588
before a leopard shark would
slam him and start dragging me

00:23:39.588 --> 00:23:40.876
into the shipping lanes.

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:42.500
And they seemed to
like him better dead

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.370
and chewed than
alive and squirming.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.980
As anyone who kayak fishes
can confirm however--

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.660
as anyone who kayak
fishes can confirm,

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.590
however fun leopard
sharks are to fight,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.930
they are a royal pain
in the arse to unhook,

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.960
especially the big
ones on a windy day

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.830
with a strong outgoing tide
on a 10 foot sit on top kayak.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.670
But the strange thing
was, everywhere I

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.680
went that day it was the
same-- along rocky shoreline,

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.940
under the peers, out
in the open water,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.550
leopard shark after leopard
shark after leopard shark.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.550
It was as if they
were following me.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.370
They were.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.540
After fishing for two hours
with that one midshipman,

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.610
I pulled in my live bait bucket,
which usually trails behind me

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.470
on a rope as I
drift, and decided

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.720
to swap out my wildly
popular shredded bait fish

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.130
for a new live one.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.420
I placed the bucket
on the kayak,

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.340
cleaned the grim remnants
of the first midshipman off

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:52.490
of my hook, and suddenly noticed
that the boat was buzzing.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:58.680
The midshipman, their nests
destroyed, their eggs uprooted,

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.680
their lives about to be
forfeit to the uncaring

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.750
jaws of a sluggish bottom
dweller, were singing.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.770
I held the bucket to my ear.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.060
What was this song?

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.260
How often had they sung it?

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.540
In the depths of the sea,
in the polluted sluices

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.100
of Stege Marsh, in the
yuppie flats of Tiburon,

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.900
was it their national anthem,
their rembetika, their blues?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.380
After a few moments, I realized
what I was listening to.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:35.700
It was the death song
of the toadfishes.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.480
I sat there for a while staring
out at the container ships,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.100
listening to this melancholy,
monotonous death song, feeling,

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.490
I suppose, not unlike the
Grinch staring down on Whoville

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.680
before his yuletide
transformation.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.800
After a few gut
wrenching moments,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.340
my callous fisherman's
heart swelled

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.730
into thrice its usual size.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.010
I paddled to shore and dumped
the remaining midshipman

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:02.100
back into the turbid waters
from whence they came.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.180
I have little doubt
that a sizable school

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.410
of leopard sharks had been
following my kayak all day.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.700
It was not a bait bucket but
a leopard shark dinner bell

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.980
that I'd been
dragging behind me.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.180
I guess every fisherman
has his weakness,

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.620
his figurative kryptonite.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.440
But how can one justify
destroying their nests

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.800
and skewering their
remarkable little bodies just

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.850
to waste them on leopard sharks?

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.330
If you find that they're a great
halibut bait or good for lings

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.980
or stripers or sea bass, maybe.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.000
But leopard sharks?

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.360
Thanks.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.870
I'll stick to squid.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.270
Honestly I think
the problem here

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.353
is that I know too much
about these little buggers

00:26:40.353 --> 00:26:41.730
to use them for bait.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:46.800
And now, with any luck, so you."

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.740
And then I wrote a haiku,
because as you can tell,

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.090
I'm kind of into this fish.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.280
And there's a footnote here.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.970
I should read the footnote.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:27:00.710
You know there's a great
masterpiece of fiction

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.250
called "The Third Policeman."

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.345
I don't expect anyone other than
me and like 16 other people who

00:27:07.345 --> 00:27:08.760
have read this book.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.580
It's called "The
Third Policeman."

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.038
It's by an Irish
writer by the name

00:27:11.038 --> 00:27:15.960
of Flann O'Brien who wrote
under the pseudonym Myles

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.390
na gCopaleen, if you want
to look up his other work.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.560
But this Irish
writer, Flann O'Brien,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.110
wrote a brilliant thing
called "The Third Policeman,"

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.810
absolutely insane book.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:33.289
And one of the characters in the
book talks through footnotes.

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:35.580
And it's so insane that you'll
have these moments where

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.800
there's a sentence, and
then nine pages of footnote

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.680
as this character sort
of expresses himself.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.610
And I found it to be such
a brilliant and humorous

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.527
little thing in a book to
have these crazy footnotes.

00:27:50.527 --> 00:27:52.360
So I put a lot of crazy
footnotes in my book

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.830
because I'm sort of
a disciple-- well,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.500
I'm a worshipper of that writer.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.520
And so for people who are like,
what's with all the footnotes

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.020
here?

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.590
And I'm, well, I like footnotes.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.230
I find them funny.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.150
In any case, my haiku is-- and
please, count the syllables.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.420
Last time I did this,
somebody counted the syllables

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.810
while I was doing it.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.550
Haiku number 214.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.630
That doesn't mean there's
214 haikus in this book,

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.220
God forbid.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.920
That's just the number that
this was for me personally.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.040
Haiku number 214.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.870
"Plainfin midshipman,
most talented of fishes.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.490
Why not leave them be?"

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:36.820
And then I wrote
here under where--

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.570
I have the sentence
where I said, "Thanks,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.380
I'll stick to
squid," in reference

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.210
to not using
midshipman for bait.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:49.636
I just thought
this was relevant.

00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:51.510
Oh what did I say--
stripers, leopard sharks.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.170
"Thanks, I'll stick to squid.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.790
I'm sure someone
out there is going

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.180
to point out the remarkable
life story of the squid.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.240
But alas, every species on
our fair planet is remarkable.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.590
One has to pick and
choose I suppose.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.590
For me, the midshipman
gets a pass.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.900
For you, it might be octopus
or anchovies or, I don't know,

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.140
fat innkeeper worms."

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.040
That's the penis fish
I referred to earlier.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.330
"In any case, the
important thing

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.550
is to remember that
they're all remarkable,

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.170
even the ones we use for bait."

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.420
And you'll notice, for those of
you who actually have the book,

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.770
on page 66-- and this
will be the last thing

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.110
I say about this lovely fish.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.970
On page 66, my buddy
Leighton-- years ago,

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:41.600
I wanted to do a "Toxic
Avenger" style comic book.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.950
It was my idea to write
it and have Leighton

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.000
do all the illustrations.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.140
And so we planned it out.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.330
And you know how
like With Spider-Man

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:56.110
and I think Fantastic Four,
and most of these early '60s

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.470
superheroes, early
'70s, early '60s,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.120
because like Thor I think-- well
maybe not so much with Thor.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.620
But I'm really geeking
myself right now with this.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.490
But have you noticed
that all of those guys

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:14.110
got their superpowers
because of gamma rays?

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.120
Spider-Man got it
because a gamma

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:21.260
ray infected spider bit him,
transferred the power, right?

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.740
I thought, well, the
plainfin midshipman,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.930
if there was nuclear
residue in the mud,

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:34.400
it might have become some
kind of crazy superhero,

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.320
Toxic Avenger style superhero.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.240
So the idea was that
he would flash people

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.126
with his photophores
and then buzz them

00:30:43.126 --> 00:30:44.750
to death with his
singing, because they

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.958
seem kind of like [GRUNTING].

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.724
It's like it's like the
Mongolian tuvan throat singing.

00:30:52.724 --> 00:30:54.140
I was supposed to
do that earlier.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.172
I didn't do that.

00:30:56.172 --> 00:30:57.084
And so there it is.

00:30:57.084 --> 00:30:58.500
And you can see
that picture there

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.710
on page 66, a good number
for the midshipman.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:07.850
Anyway, I could go
on and on and on,

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.496
but are there any questions?

00:31:10.496 --> 00:31:11.870
You don't have to
have questions.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:16.300
You can ask me anything, really.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.780
But that's OK if
you don't want to.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.655
I'll just keep going.

00:31:19.655 --> 00:31:22.071
And please, if it's getting
to the end of your lunch break

00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:23.330
or whatever, don't feel shy.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.320
If you have to go,
you have to go.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.819
Yes?

00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:27.320
AUDIENCE: Song you sang earlier,
why does it have to be sad?

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.610
KIRK LOMBARD: Why does it what?

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.575
AUDIENCE: Why does it
have to be a sad song?

00:31:30.575 --> 00:31:33.100
KIRK LOMBARD: Well,
because she died.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.700
But you know, she died, but
then she came back as a ghost.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.590
So it's not that bad I guess.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.070
There's some resurrection
involved, I guess.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.600
I don't think there's a
lost verse to that song.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.120
Do you know of a lost verse
where she comes back to life

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.620
and everybody's happy?

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.270
Well you know, Molly
Malone considered

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.870
to be-- so anyone
been to Dublin here?

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.690
Anyone seen the statue?

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.980
There's a Molly Malone
statue in Dublin.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.050
And unfortunately-- it's
a really nice statue

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.530
and she's very
well proportioned.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:11.250
But people take-- it's
like they rub her boobies.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.870
So she's got these two
bright brass boobs,

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:18.400
because everybody rubs them.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.410
At least that's how it
was when I was there.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:26.760
But oh, Molly Malone
was supposedly

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.750
not just a fishmonger,
she was a streetwalker.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.950
AUDIENCE: I thought that
was a fictitious character.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.300
KIRK LOMBARD: No, I
think-- it is probably

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.740
a fictitious character.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:44.850
But the legend goes that she
also had ulterior-- well,

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:49.810
not ulterior, but rather
alternative sources of income,

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:55.780
as many young lasses had
to do in those bleak times.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.190
I think that the idea was
that that's what killed her,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.622
some disease.

00:33:00.622 --> 00:33:01.580
Now I don't know where.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.835
You'll have to google this.

00:33:05.422 --> 00:33:06.880
It's so refreshing
that none of you

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.120
are doing that to
me while I speak,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.380
because there's always
that fear, right,

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.260
especially for somebody like
me who lives in tall tales.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:16.902
In any case--

00:33:16.902 --> 00:33:18.110
AUDIENCE: What about herring?

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.276
KIRK LOMBARD: What about it?

00:33:19.276 --> 00:33:21.022
AUDIENCE: Can we
catch it around here.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.980
KIRK LOMBARD: OK, now who
was listening earlier?

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.460
Can we catch
herring around here?

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.374
Raise your hand if you say yes.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:34.050
And raise your hand if you say
no, because there are no nos.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.840
There's just some neutrals.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.709
OK, what time of year-- I
mentioned it several times--

00:33:38.709 --> 00:33:40.750
will you be able to look
for herring in the water

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.450
right across the street?

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.360
AUDIENCE: Winter.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.193
KIRK LOMBARD: Right.

00:33:43.193 --> 00:33:45.730
So for those of you
who-- raise your hand

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.880
if you weren't even aware that
there is herring in the bay?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.010
Right, actually most
people are that way.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.204
It's very strange
to someone like me

00:33:56.204 --> 00:33:58.620
who spends so much time around
the water and in the water.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.260
But the general populace of San
Francisco is unaware of this.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.760
And it's not your fault. It's
that herring-- there is really

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.320
very little demand for small
fish in mainstream American

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.790
seafood consumption.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.580
So you go to a market,
you're very rarely

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.250
going to see herring unless you
go at the beginning of herring

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.855
season to Chinatown.

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.230
In some of the
live markets there

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.646
you'll see herring
on the shelves.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.480
And that's about it as
far as getting them.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.630
So you have to catch them
if you want to eat them.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.070
And it's so much fun.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.925
In fact, I've brought a lot
of people out to do this.

00:34:34.925 --> 00:34:37.300
And they go and they get their
license and they come out,

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.980
and most of them are people
who have never fished before.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.170
And they get into the
process of catching herring.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.711
And then before they
know it, they've

00:34:43.711 --> 00:34:45.210
got 65 pounds of herring.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:51.889
Now it takes maybe five
hours to clean 25 pounds.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.840
So 65 pounds, you're looking
at like, 12-- my math is off.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.450
But you're looking at a
full day of scaling fish

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.780
and gutting them and
cutting their heads off.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.100
So I always tell people,
if you do get into this,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.570
just be advised,
it's a lot of fun

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.190
and you're going to want to keep
going, and there's no limit.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.481
There's no sport limit on them.

00:35:11.481 --> 00:35:14.100
You can catch as
many as you want.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.650
So just be advised, you've
got a lot of work ahead of you

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.260
if you take more
than five pounds.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.240
But it's so much fun.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.080
I wish I had my little video.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.410
I would show you, right there,
me standing right there.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.035
You know that little
pier that goes out

00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.630
and it's got the silver
swivel seats, right next

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.410
to the metal pier?

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.440
It's right in that
corner, right there,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.500
between that and the
old bus station there.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:45.900
Anyway, the herring is--
what can I say really?

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.070
It's a miracle
that it's even here

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.540
when we consider that 2/3
of the original shoreline--

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.490
well, 2/3, it's more 2/3
of the original shoreline

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.380
of the entire San Francisco
Bay has been filled in.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.490
And this is the fish that
spawns on the shoreline.

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:07.690
Most of the eelgrass beds
where they spawn traditionally

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:08.810
are gone.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:09.859
They're totally gone.

00:36:09.859 --> 00:36:11.900
So what did this little
guy do, this little fish?

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.920
I say guy.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.900
I keep male-izing the fish,
but that's not really true.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.780
The males and the
females, what did they

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.150
do in order to survive?

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:25.630
Instead of going and seeing
the loss of their eelgrass beds

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.300
and then dying out,
they just decided

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.130
to lay their eggs
in other places.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.460
And that's an incredible
ability to adapt.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.250
So in the old days where they
used to spawn only on eelgrass,

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.470
now they spawn underneath boats
and along rocks and on seaweed,

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.820
anywhere.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.957
I think that in their
little herring brains,

00:36:44.957 --> 00:36:46.790
the thing they would
love more than anything

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.076
is an entire shoreline
filled with the eelgrass,

00:36:49.076 --> 00:36:50.450
but they don't
have that anymore.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.720
And they adapted.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.850
And so like last year,
the spawning biomass

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.750
of little Pacific herring
inside San Francisco Bay

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:04.020
was estimated somewhere
around 15,000 tons-- 15, yeah.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.130
So that's a lot of fish.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.915
And that's the lowest
it's been in many years.

00:37:07.915 --> 00:37:09.540
In the last 10 years,
it's gone as high

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.170
as 60,000 to 70,000 tons,
inside San Francisco Bay.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:17.060
That's how many are in there.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.460
Really, even if you're not
going to go out and get

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.390
all excited about
eating a little fish--

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.056
I think you should
get excited about it.

00:37:24.056 --> 00:37:26.650
But even if you're
not going to, what

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:30.570
goes on along the shoreline when
there's a herring spawn-- it's

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:34.480
so bizarre to me to walk
down the Embarcadero

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.810
when the herring are lighting
up the whole shoreline,

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:43.340
and you'll see like
25 seals in the water.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.990
And you'll see a
flock of cormorants

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:51.160
that's got at least 8,000 birds
in it going through the water.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.086
And you'll see pelican after
pelican through, foo, foo, foo,

00:37:55.086 --> 00:37:57.340
foo, just dropping
out of the sky.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.790
I've even seen, in San
Francisco Bay, an osprey,

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.950
in the bay, grabbing
herring out the water.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:12.444
I mean, whales will come
in as far as Alcatraz,

00:38:12.444 --> 00:38:14.610
because they smell it and
they want to get in on it.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.735
But then they start moving
in towards the shoreline

00:38:16.735 --> 00:38:20.920
and, eh, there's cables
and sewer lines and ships.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.660
I'm out here.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:29.170
But the abundance of animal
life, of nature-- and this

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.080
is in the middle of a city.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.990
In my experience,
I've not experienced--

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.380
I've never really
seen anything quite

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.320
like-- in an urban context.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.640
I grew up in New York.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.970
And we have eels under the
peers and bluefish and stuff

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:43.470
like that.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:50.484
But a Herring spawn in the
middle of a major urban center,

00:38:50.484 --> 00:38:51.400
I can't think of that.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.700
I mean, maybe in Vancouver or
something-- not even there.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.060
And so even if you're not
interested in eating them

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.930
or using them for bait-- they're
great bait for everything--

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:04.780
just to go down to the bay
when it's happening and stand

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.620
there--

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.370
I mean, last year
or two years ago

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.630
I did a tour for
the Audubon people.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.295
And there's a whole contingent.

00:39:14.295 --> 00:39:19.510
So the Audubon people who
are like insane bird nerds,

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.240
like out of control.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.650
That's their life is
like looking at birds.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.530
Maybe some of you are birders
or amateur ornithologists,

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.920
I don't know.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:36.450
But then there's the bird nerds
that can identify seagulls.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:40.450
Now this is like bordering
on some kind of a psychosis,

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:45.260
because to the average
eye, seagulls really

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.090
look a lot alike.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.067
But you'll see like a little bit
of different type of grayness

00:39:50.067 --> 00:39:52.400
in some of the wings and the
size is a little different.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.817
And sometimes they
have a red bill

00:39:53.817 --> 00:39:55.399
and sometimes they
have a yellow bill.

00:39:55.399 --> 00:39:56.870
But they really
look a lot alike.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:00.050
But the variety of
seagulls, if this

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.580
is some kind of
enticement to you,

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.960
is supposedly
insane during-- it's

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.050
really hard to get people
excited about this.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.650
But just to go down and
see 85,000 seagulls--

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.590
that's what they estimated.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:17.890
There were 85,000 seagulls
along the shoreline in Tiburon

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:18.539
last year.

00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:20.330
But it's the same thing
on the Embarcadero.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:23.330
And it's just gorgeous
and beautiful.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:26.560
We have a commercial
fishery for them in the bay.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.610
One of my good buddies is a
commercial herring fisherman.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.830
And they use gill nets.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.435
And they set the gill nets
up next to the shoreline

00:40:34.435 --> 00:40:36.810
where they think the herring
are about to move in and lay

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.260
their eggs.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.392
So when the herring move
in to lay their eggs,

00:40:40.392 --> 00:40:42.100
they hit the gill net
and they get stuck.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.340
And then the guys pull
them out by the thousands.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:50.710
A good day, they'll
get 20 tons in one day.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.760
And the reason we're not
so concerned about that

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.820
is that they're
only fishing a total

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.930
of 5% of the total
biomass of the species.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.100
So last year the biomass
was 15-- what did I say,

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.490
15,000 tons?

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.180
So they're only
fishing 5% of that,

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.780
which is not considered to
have a great toll on the fish.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.450
Is that enough on
the herring bit?

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.040
AUDIENCE: That was great.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:14.884
Makes me hungry.

00:41:14.884 --> 00:41:18.750
What about, for the
book, is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.840
KIRK LOMBARD: So the
question is-- and thanks

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.360
for asking that-- if somebody
has never really gone

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.420
out fishing or foraging
before, what are

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.410
the most basic things in here?

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:32.210
Well I go over the
nuances of clamming.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:36.374
And you've got some great
potential spots for clams

00:41:36.374 --> 00:41:37.540
in our region of California.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.020
You have to drive to some of
them to get to the clean ones.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.020
I mean there's hella clams
in San Francisco Bay,

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.940
but no one in their right
mind would eat them,

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.724
because clams live a relatively
long time and they don't move.

00:41:46.724 --> 00:41:48.140
So whatever's in
the water in that

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:53.010
spot is going to be in
you if you eat that clam.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.742
So you want to go up the coast.

00:41:54.742 --> 00:41:56.950
There's a couple places down
the coast you can go to.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.460
I try not to burn
locations, but it's

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:05.750
a Google search away finding
the good locations for clamming

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.730
and picking mussels.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.000
So that's one place
that all you need

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.926
is a recreational
sport fishing license.

00:42:13.926 --> 00:42:16.720
And you can take this book
and it will really help you.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.490
And then seaweed, I cover
all the basic seaweeds

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:20.850
along our shoreline.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.610
Again, you should
get a fishing license

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.942
if you're going to do seaweed.

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.650
A lot of people think
they don't need it,

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.340
but you should have that.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.280
It's like $50, and it's good for
the year in which you buy it.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.760
So if you buy it now, it's
only good till December 31.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.450
Well I feel like
I'm back in my day.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:39.866
I used to work for the fish
and game department explaining

00:42:39.866 --> 00:42:41.230
all the rules and regulations.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.780
And I'm back there now.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:47.800
But in any case, yes, and so
the seaweeds and the clams.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:54.130
Some of the fishing stuff, if
you have some basis in fishing,

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:58.730
I think you'll be fine.

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:01.140
But if you have no basis
at all in catching fish,

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.810
like you've never gone
like this, if you've never

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:12.780
done that before, then there's
a whole chapter on poke poling.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.740
Poke poling is a
technique that was

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.240
used by Native Americans
along this coast for thousands

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.190
of years, I think, at least.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:26.810
And you can catch a lot of
fish by just taking a stick.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.580
Now the modern
adaptation of this stick

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.220
is you take the stick, you take
a wire hanger from your closet.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.780
You unravel it, put a
little loop in the end,

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.250
tie some line onto it,
put a hook on the line.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.970
So you've got a stick.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:44.900
Bamboo is great, a bamboo
stick, wire hanger,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.630
loop in the wire
hanger at the bottom.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.070
Wire hanger is taped.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:55.540
So stick, tape, wire
hanger, loop, line, hook.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.150
Onto that hook, put a
little piece of squid.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.890
Go to any fish market in the Bay
Area and buy a pound of squid

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:05.080
for $2.69.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.690
And then walk out at low tide.

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:10.060
And everywhere you see a
rock that comes together

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.900
with another rock or a
hole or a crack, stick

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.970
that gently into the--
the sexual innuendo here

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.510
is through the roof.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:24.730
You stick your
stick into the hole,

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:30.080
and then as you go like this
and you kind of, like, do this,

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.390
the fish that live in the
holes between the rocks

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.820
will come up and bite the
hook and you pull them out

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.680
of the hole.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.385
And that requires none
of this, [WHOOSH].

00:44:38.385 --> 00:44:40.760
And it's a very good way to
go along the California coast

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.320
and get your own fish.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.050
So hopefully that
answers your question.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.550
And that's a very
wonderful technique

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.631
for beginning fishermen to use,
because you'll catch stuff.

00:44:52.631 --> 00:44:54.630
And all you have to do
is tie a couple of knots.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.860
And that's it.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.665
Yes?

00:44:56.665 --> 00:44:57.790
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:59.904
So this will cover what
you do with the fish

00:44:59.904 --> 00:45:02.070
after you catch it if you've
never gutted or cleaned

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:02.480
or anything.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.563
KIRK LOMBARD: So there's
a little bit on cleaning.

00:45:04.563 --> 00:45:07.650
And there's a lot on fish prep.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:11.600
And there's a whole section
on how to prep small fish.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.720
And I mean as far
as cleaning a fish,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.760
there's like 5 million videos.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.970
And I really felt that
those are so much more

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.180
useful than anything
I'm going to write.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.840
And also like writing
that, it's so simple,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.860
and yet it's just not the
kind of writing I like to do.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:38.720
So I would refer you to YouTube
for actually cleaning big fish.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.060
For cleaning small fish, I
have all kinds of techniques

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.410
that I wrote in here,
which is probably

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.350
where you're going to be anyway
if you're just starting out.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.340
Also the thing is full recipes.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.800
So every little section has
recipes, most of them written

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.740
by the lady in the corner.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.230
AUDIENCE: Another question.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.797
you and me

00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:00.880
KIRK LOMBARD: Well you
know, we don't have lobster

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.225
in this area of California.

00:46:02.225 --> 00:46:04.600
And this is the "Guide to the
Northern California Coast."

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.360
The only lobster--

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.860
AUDIENCE: I've seen
lobster diving.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.570
KIRK LOMBARD: You've seen them
because-- because of El Nino,

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.400
we had a few lobsters
that were caught off

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.230
of Pacifica last year.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.020
And sometimes they'll see them.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:24.190
But if you're to be a lobster
diver in Northern California,

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:26.010
you're in for a lot
of empty buckets.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.286
AUDIENCE: More Southern
California though.

00:46:27.286 --> 00:46:29.619
KIRK LOMBARD: Oh, Southern
California's where they live.

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:31.960
They only came up here
over the last two years.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.780
There's been a few stragglers.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.550
There was a guy on one of the
big fishing websites who posted

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:40.700
a picture of himself with two.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.830
But I mean, that's insane.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:44.690
And he got them at Lindamar.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.510
I mean, everybody-- so that
just went around all the fishing

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.339
circles, and everybody
was like, what?

00:46:50.339 --> 00:46:51.630
There's a few things like that.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:54.436
Like lately last couple years
there's been bonito up here,

00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:56.060
and that's not
typically a fish we get.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:00.070
But that's because
of El Nino, we

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.460
got a lot of these warm
water animals up here.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.826
Our water is really cold.

00:47:03.826 --> 00:47:05.700
Spearfishing I didn't
get into too much here,

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:10.640
but I did get into
diving for rock scallops.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.320
So if there's one thing
that's really, really

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.764
awesome to go risk your
life for, is rock scallops.

00:47:18.764 --> 00:47:20.680
I mean, they're just the
most delicious thing.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.320
AUDIENCE: Is that
the same as abalone?

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:22.605
KIRK LOMBARD: No.

00:47:22.605 --> 00:47:24.580
Well, I got into the
diving a little bit

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.000
on the abalone section
too, more about

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.010
how easy it is to kill
yourself when you do it,

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.520
which almost happened to me.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.620
I wrote a whole thing about-- my
first abalone dive, I was new.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.690
My buddy took me out.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.410
And we went in and the
whole time I'm out there,

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.340
I'm just like, man,
this is just sketchy.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.730
I just know this is sketchy.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:46.800
There's seals everywhere.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.280
And he's like, "You
don't have to worry

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.260
about seals everywhere.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.480
What you got to worry about is
when they're out of the water."

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.370
Literally 15 minutes later,
he's got his abalones,

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:57.490
I'm still half drowning
trying to get the abalone

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:58.680
to come up to the surface.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.930
All the seals are sitting on
the rocks, every one of them.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.780
There wasn't a single
one in the water.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.970
And his boat has
drifted 100 yards away.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.224
And I'm stuck in the
middle of this cove.

00:48:09.224 --> 00:48:11.420
And I start going like
this and he's waving back.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.350
He's not moving the boat.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.990
So I just-- I was like, OK.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.200
I got a flash.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.090
An abalone iron's
made out of steel,

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.570
and it's flashing in the water.

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:24.736
I got my big rubber thing.

00:48:24.736 --> 00:48:26.110
I got the thing
that measures it.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:27.318
That's flashing in the water.

00:48:27.318 --> 00:48:30.783
So flashing is something
that sharks really like.

00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:33.342
I had to start swimming.

00:48:33.342 --> 00:48:35.550
I'm like fuck this, I'm
going to do a Michael Phelps.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.130
I'm going to beat all
the known records man.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:39.150
I'm like, joosh, joosh.

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:40.340
I get all the way
back to the boat.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.299
I'm like totally tired.

00:48:41.299 --> 00:48:42.256
I'm like, "You asshole.

00:48:42.256 --> 00:48:43.100
I can't believe you.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:43.800
Couldn't you come over?"

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.490
And he's like, "I don't know.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:45.781
There's some fish biting here."

00:48:45.781 --> 00:48:47.240
He's fishing.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.850
I put my arm over the side
of the-- it's a Zodiac.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.350
We're in a 10 foot
inflatable Zodiac,

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.600
which those are pretty rugged
boats, but 10 feet or 12 feet

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.360
or something.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.027
And I put my arm over.

00:48:58.027 --> 00:48:59.110
I'm like trying to get up.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:48:59.962
I'm like ugh.

00:48:59.962 --> 00:49:01.920
I'm like, this is the
moment right here, right,

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.360
because I got all
this stuff dangling.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.650
I have all my gear
dangling around my belt,

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.470
you know, my legs
flapping in the water.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.150
It was like, this is where
he's going to freaking get me.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:13.500
Finally I get out of the water.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.520
I'm like OK.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.370
Finally I'm in the boat.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:20.560
And I look over at my
friend, and he's got his rod.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.610
And he's like, "Oh
man, I got one on,"

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:26.850
because he was fishing
while I was swimming.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:29.350
And I looked kind of over,
and the water's very clear.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:30.180
And it's a lingcod.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.005
I can see that, and it's small.

00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:34.380
We call those shakers because
you shake them off the hook

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.421
because they're so small.

00:49:35.421 --> 00:49:37.190
But he's bringing it up.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:40.910
And I'm kind of looking
at it in the water.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.830
And all of a sudden, underneath
the fish, there's just this,

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:44.900
whoosh.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.905
Like the whole color of
the water just changed.

00:49:46.905 --> 00:49:48.880
And it went, whoosh.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.900
And we both went, "What
the fuck was that?"

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.360
And he's like--
he's looking down.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.382
He's like, huh?

00:49:56.382 --> 00:49:57.840
And he starts
reeling up like this.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.310
And then just out
of nowhere, man, I

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.101
don't even know where
this thing came from.

00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:02.840
There's a 12 foot
great white shark

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.566
coming up underneath this
fish with its mouth like this.

00:50:05.566 --> 00:50:07.190
And we're in this
little fricking boat.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:10.630
Dude, I'm sitting like
this, and it's there.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.660
Like if I wanted to put
my arm down its mouth

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:16.020
for some insane reason,
I could have done that.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.840
I just kind of
looked over the side.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.900
I still had one of
my flippers on man.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.100
I'm like one flipper
on, one flipper off.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.890
And then I just
started screaming.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:31.160
And my friend, you know, he's
sort of an unorthodox guy.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.901
So my feeling, at that
moment, the thing's

00:50:33.901 --> 00:50:35.400
coming up after the
fish that you're

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.890
reeling in, just get the
fucking thing out of the water.

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:39.513
Let's get out of here, you know?

00:50:39.513 --> 00:50:41.596
But he's kind of like,
just kind of sitting there.

00:50:41.596 --> 00:50:42.860
He's like oh.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.440
He would have the fish on
the surface, like lingering

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.746
to sort of tease the animal.

00:50:50.746 --> 00:50:52.370
And I was like, "Get
it out the water!"

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:55.220
And he goes OK, and vroom,
vroom, and we took off

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.580
and we left it.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:01.230
And I often regret, actually--
because it was so close to us

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:02.890
and it circled us.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:06.856
And I regret that my instinct
was to grab for my phone

00:51:06.856 --> 00:51:08.730
and get some video
footage of this thing that

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.660
was right next to us.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:14.410
And in doing that-- I mean,
how often you going to be that

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:15.630
close to a great white shark?

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:18.550
I mean, I've seen them in
fishing boats where they're

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:20.820
like over there or over there.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:24.130
But in a little Zodiac
where it's right-- like,

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:27.630
you could grab its dorsal fin.

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:30.020
And instead of
experiencing the moment,

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.370
I was looking for my phone.

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:33.310
So I really wish that
I hadn't done that.

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:35.560
I really wish that I had
just been present and watched

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.770
that thing all the
way around the boat.

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.350
But I mean, I saw
it close enough.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:41.910
But the upshot of this
was, of course, it

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:46.445
didn't encourage me to continue
my abalone diving career.

00:51:46.445 --> 00:51:49.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.360
So I'm sort of a wimp
when it comes to that.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.600
When I go get abalones, I do
a thing called shore picking,

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.100
which is also really dangerous.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.558
A lot of people
drown short picking

00:52:00.558 --> 00:52:04.590
because you're in water up to
here, so you dive down to go,

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:06.790
and you're kind of under a rock.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.620
And you can get stuck.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.200
And you can drown
in that much water

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.740
as easily as you can in 20 feet.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:19.080
So in any case, that story's in
there, a longer version of it.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.235
PAIGE: Thank you Kirk.

00:52:20.235 --> 00:52:21.460
This was really awesome.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.710
KIRK LOMBARD: All right Paige.

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:24.810
And here's my book.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.840
And if you didn't
get one-- also,

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.141
I do a monthly
update, if you want

00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:32.640
to be on it, where I talk about
when the herring are running

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.220
and what fish are happening
in the bay and seafood

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.690
and where to get seaweeds
and this kind of stuff.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:41.290
And if you want to get
on that email list,

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.780
it's the door with my lovely
fish wife Camilla over there.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.363
PAIGE: I also have a Sharpie if
you guys want Kirk to sign you

00:52:47.363 --> 00:52:47.970
book afterwards too.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:49.210
KIRK LOMBARD: Yes, I'll
sign your book if you want.

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:50.918
PAIGE: Thank you so
much for [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:51.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:53.760
KIRK LOMBARD: Thank you.
