neighborhood that people used in to go
 

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:32.030
neighborhood that people used in to go
out Union Square soma and so we would go

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040
out Union Square soma and so we would go
 

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.650
out Union Square soma and so we would go
through and we would visit all of the

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660

bars every every quarter and we would

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:35.910
bars every every quarter and we would

00:22:20.469 --> 00:22:22.589
sixty 1980 and 2015 you can see the
difference so that surge in the nineteen

so I kind of had to do this project was
a bit of a reconciling for me so I could

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.030
a bit of a reconciling for me so I could
 

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.659
a bit of a reconciling for me so I could
understand better what exactly they saw

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:13.669
understand better what exactly they saw
 

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:17.020

helped me understand it and we already
talked about that and everyone should be

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:23.210
talked about that and everyone should be
 

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.260

the hours of midnight and 5am and looked
 

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.550
the hours of midnight and 5am and looked
at where they went so you can see the

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560
at where they went so you can see the
 

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.290
at where they went so you can see the
distribution of how people go to and

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:26.300
distribution of how people go to and

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.240
 
did this and he's this is actually the

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:39.250
did this and he's this is actually the
 

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.700
did this and he's this is actually the
more profound work that this is better

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:41.710
more profound work that this is better
 

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.760
more profound work that this is better
than how it going for sure he took the

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:44.770
than how it going for sure he took the
 

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.700
than how it going for sure he took the
database that I made and I don't know if

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:47.710
database that I made and I don't know if
 

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:50.640
database that I made and I don't know if
he took it holy I think he probably

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:50.650
he took it holy I think he probably
 

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.220
he took it holy I think he probably
added a little bit and then looked at

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.230
added a little bit and then looked at
 

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.810
added a little bit and then looked at
taxi origins and destinations and then

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:54.820
taxi origins and destinations and then
 

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.490
taxi origins and destinations and then
constructed this neighborhood map of

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:56.500

going up really fast and not having any
problems at all so there's a little bit

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:11.470
problems at all so there's a little bit
 

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.730
problems at all so there's a little bit
of corruption which adds to the cost but

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:14.740
of corruption which adds to the cost but
 

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.010
