00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.068
I like getting cupcakes.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.536
What's embarrassing
about a cupcake?

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:04.837
I don't know,
'cause I just feel like I'm-

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:06.272
The word. The cupcake guy.
It's the word.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.740
And,you know, and I can't be
with my boys be like,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.175
"What do you guys wanna do?"
They be like, "Oh, beer,

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.610
strippers." I'm like,
"What about cupcakes? Anybody?"

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.512
It's the way you say cupcakes.
Are you a cupcake guy?

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.081
Hell yeah bro.
Absolutely?Ah I'd [bleep]

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.282
with a cupcake or two.
Vegan or you go regs?

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:22.756
Reg. Regs you said?
What's up everybody?

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.324
Welcome to Stupid Questions.
We're in Los Angeles.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:28.194
So we got Justin Long.
That's why you got me.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.097
I like your energy so far.
You have very good vibes.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.464
Oh yeah? Absolutely.
Thanks Chris.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.133
I really believe that.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.202
This is a stupid question.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.605
What do you think is something
everybody looks stupid doing?

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:44.610
Selfies. Dumb. A few occasions
I've done it [inaudible]

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.714
I always feel like
I'm masturbating or something.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.982
Yeah. I always feel kinda
like embarrassed by it.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.984
And you know what I think
everyone looks stupid doing

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:53.520
and I know we have to.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.922
But the flight attendant who has
to demonstrate the safety rules.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:58.657
Yes, yes.
You look like such an idiot.

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:01.327
What would you prefer,
that a flight attendant commit

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.230
to the whole thing like this,
in a very severe like ...

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.133
or sometimes they try
to be funny with it.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.201
Yeah. Which would you prefer?
I always want commitment.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.103
'Cause when you try to be funny
with that it's like stupid.

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.338
That's true.
I want you to commit.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.006
I want you to blow up
the inflatable raft.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.308
Why don't you open up this door
and show me how to slide down

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:17.943
'Cause it's also serious
stuff to talk about.

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:19.645
Absolutely.
But you don't need to do this.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.849
Here's a flight attendant.
Sorry, he's my friend.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.385
That guy has full blown
FAF flight attendant face.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.423
You have to pick one.
Boat shoes or khakis?

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:34.227
Boat shoes or khakis pants?
Khaki pants or boat shoes.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.794
Boat shoes are the ones
with no laces?

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.497
You know what boat shoes are.
You're from Connecticut.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.897
Am I naked without the pants?
Yeah.

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:40.967
You can be naked with boat shoes
showing off your

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.436
Connecticut piece
or you're with khakis

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.038
showing off your man feet.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:47.840
Well I don't wanna walk around
with my stuff outside.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.942
Why not dude? Be proud of it.
You're from Connecticut. Yeah.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.477
Show off that
Connecticut [bleep]

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.112
I guess that is a Connecticut
thing, you're right. Yes.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.381
The people in Connecticut really
love to show off their penises.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.483
Why not dude?
Beautiful white dick.

00:01:57.483 --> 00:01:59.719
Yeah.
I'm gonna say boat shoes now.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.054
What I wanted the great people
of America to envision,

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.390
Justin Long just boat shoes
and that's what we got

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.727
and now my mom is probably happy
and horny.Congratulations.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.467
Would you rather be able
to only whisper or only shout?

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.102
I'm talking like every time
you say a word,

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.138
it's a whisper, it's a shout.
That is a really good question.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.439
I think I'd rather whisper.Well

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.974
I feel like L.A.'s
more of a whisper city

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.375
and New York's more
of a shout city.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:25.111
Here's why I think
you might be wrong.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.079
Because there's a lot
of shouting in cars and,

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.015
"[bleep] Driver,"
all of that in a car.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.483
But also another thing
I noticed in L.A.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:34.286
I noticed people being way
to demonstrative and exuberant

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:37.189
when they see one another.Yeah.
Everything's [bleep] mono.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:39.425
Hey you. Yeah, yeah,yeah.
And like ...

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.761
I asked somebody
that I saw embrace this way-

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.062
Right. Big hugs.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.097
I mean, they screamed
from across the block.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.399
And I said,

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.734
"Just out of curiosity,
how long has it been?"

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.603
"Oh, how long has it been
since I've seen you?"

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.738
They said,
"About a week I guess."

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.974
'Cause they were in ...
Yeah. A week. A week.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.411
First of all, I'm being
dead serious right now.

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.714
Huge fan. Thanks dude.
You know what favorite movie.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.349
The Break-Up, when you play-
Yes.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.150
The assistant in
the Break-Up, number one.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.286
I also loved you in Waiting.

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.987
But now I like to give you
a stupid gift.

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:11.757
It's a dodge ball 'cause you
were in the movie Dodgeball.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:13.660
It was a big movie,
blockbuster movie.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.795
People know you from it.
You know, you would be shocked

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.331
how many times people
yell stuff like,

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.466
"Hey, you wanna see my goat
or you wanna see-

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.501
Yeah. Which is a weird thing
to yell. Strangers.

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:25.237
So I did this movie called
Zack and Miri Make A Porno.

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:28.107
Sure. And I had a line in it
where I said,

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.942
"You better shut your mouth
or I'm gonna [bleep]"

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:32.578
and TSA guy once said to me,
"No ...

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:35.047
but you better shut your mouth
or I'm gonna [bleep] it."

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:37.950
Wow. Yeah.
In what way is that no [bleep]?

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
Absolutely dude. That's gotta be
at least a modicum of [bleep]

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.656
I agree. Stupid questions,
thank you for playing Justin

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.924
Long.
Thanks Chris.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.258
No seriously,
it was great to meet you.

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:47.827
It was really fun.
Thank you yeahNo a little

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.029
[bleep] Yeah. A little [bleep]
Absolutely. Actually

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.698
Plenty of [bleep].
Yeah.
