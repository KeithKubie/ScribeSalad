00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
At this point our program is supposed to be complete, but it still has a bug.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If we put in foo in bold, in quotes as input, what would we expect is an output of foo?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
However, what we get is a completely different output.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What we get is an output where the quotes are stripped but the HTML tags are still there

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and obviously, the output does not match what we actually expect it--we do have a bug in here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
When I was a student, I never got any formal training in debugging.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I had to figure out how to do the debugging myself. What I learned was how to use debugging output.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That is I would go and scatter output statements everywhere in my program.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In Python, this would be the infamous print statement.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So here again, here is our program and here's the one single input that goes wrong.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If you press on run, what we get is the quotes removed but the HTML markup is still there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When I was a student, I never got any formal training in debugging,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so I had now to figure out myself what went wrong.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The only thing I knew was how to use debugging output, so I would use the print statement in Python

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in order to figure out what had gone wrong.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Essentially, I would go and scatter print statements everywhere.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
For instance, I can go and print all the local variables in here. Cool.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So I know what the character is, I know what the status of tag and quote is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, we'll click on run--oh yeah, and here comes my big output.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, I can scroll down here and say, "Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Obviously, of course now you can immediately see what's going on in here.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
No, I'm afraid I can't because this is just a long, long list.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Think of a 1000 character input at this time.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If you have a 1000 character input, you didn't have to go through 3000 lines of logs.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This may help you but it's a total time waster.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You have to enter these statements, use them for debugging and then remove them again.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It is a total maintenance nightmare.
