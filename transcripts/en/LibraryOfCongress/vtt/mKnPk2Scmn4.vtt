&gt;&gt; Female: From the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.140
[Music]

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.030 position:98%
&gt;&gt; Gary Sinise: My mother has always talked about the Library of Congress

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.350 position:88%
to me, and I have never, never been here, and I'm just -

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.810 position:94%
I'm overwhelmed by what I've seen today, and sharing the day

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.150 position:61%
with my daughter has been very special,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.190 position:64%
wonderful, surprising, and awe-inspiring.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.200 position:98%
&gt;&gt; James Billington: You can see this has got wood carving _____.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.570 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Gary Sinise: Today, I was made aware

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.780 position:69%
that there actually is this archival project

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.210 position:64%
to record personal histories of veterans.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.200
I had no idea.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: Well, the Library

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.600 position:97%
of Congress Veterans History Project has been an ongoing effort here

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.940
since 2000.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.210 position:97%
The purpose of this project is to get the human experience of war,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.100 position:66%
what veterans feel about - the experience,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.460 position:72%
what it meant to them, how it's affected them.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.080 position:98%
Everybody's story's important, from machine gunners to musicians.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.310 position:95%
And that's what we've been trying to create with this project

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.090 position:97%
of having people - every solder, every airman, Marine, sailor,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.620 position:98%
tell their story and become a part of what has become a very rich

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.070 position:63%
and used collection here at the Library.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.560 position:97%
It's gonna be able to capture those from World War I all the way

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.110
up to the current conflict.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.850 position:97%
And we do it primarily through oral histories and the collection

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.230 position:70%
of materials that veterans have sent into us.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.220 position:80%
&gt;&gt; Gary Sinise: How do you decide who to interview,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.040 position:58%
or is it can anybody - any veteran -?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.540 position:97%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: There's 17 million living wartime veterans.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.150
Any veteran -

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.810 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Gary Sinise: They just contact you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.120 position:64%
and say they're coming, or how's it work?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.410 position:77%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: Well, it's done by volunteers.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.000 position:64%
We have volunteer organizations doing it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.660 position:98%
And then we had this document, which is a field kit that we use

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.520 position:72%
that anybody can sit down with a family member

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.050 position:69%
and actually record one of these interviews.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.800 position:72%
It's as simple as pulling out the video camera

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.170
or the cassette tape recorder -

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.040 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Gary Sinise: And just send it into you?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.170 position:97%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: - and send it into us, and they become a part

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.120
of the Library of Congress.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.350 position:77%
I know your family has a rich veterans tradition.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.640 position:89%
Your personal and professional involvement with veterans,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.380
I know they're clear to your heart.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.210 position:92%
So I'd like to show you a couple of the collections we have

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.510 position:73%
so you can get kind of a feel for what we have.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.090 position:98%
The first I'd like to start with is a short clip of a veteran -

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.990 position:61%
a Vietnam veteran named Artie Guerrero.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.950 position:88%
Artie was drafted in 1967, was thrown right into combat,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.040 position:66%
and was very seriously wounded in Vietnam.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.840 position:69%
&gt;&gt; Artie Guerrero: I never thought of myself

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.920 position:64%
as being courageous, but self-sustaining.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.740 position:98%
That's the part of the animalistic instinct that comes out of you

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.510 position:77%
when you're put in a barbaric situation like war.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.710 position:97%
You're not the same civilized mind that you're once taught to be

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.580
or the person that you are.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.990 position:58%
And I've suffered these consequences,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.620 position:59%
and you just don't come back the same.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.140 position:75%
You suffered the post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.040
It never leaves you.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.440 position:97%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: Artie is wheelchair-bound, but is an advocate

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.340
for veterans out in California.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.220 position:64%
The project has about 78,000 collections.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.740 position:67%
We're told to get the older veterans first.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.880 position:75%
We have about 48,000 of those from World War II,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.160 position:86%
but we're really starting to focus on Vietnam veterans.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.210 position:97%
They're not getting any younger, either, and we're really hoping

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.070
to bring in more and more.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.570 position:80%
We have about 10,000 of those collections here now.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.940 position:67%
Now let talk about entertaining the troops,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.310
which I know you're involved with.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.960
This is Robert Sidney.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.270 position:94%
Robert Sidney is a World War II veteran, and he was enlisted

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.950 position:98%
into the Army to be a part of a show called "This is the Army."

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.370 position:64%
I don't know if you've heard about this -

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.070
&gt;&gt; Gary Sinise: Sure, yeah.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.270 position:83%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: Well, he was their first sergeant,

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.970 position:95%
and Irving Berlin, who set up that show, enlisted him to kind

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.070 position:61%
of be the first sergeant for the troop.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.490 position:70%
When the show was set up, it was on Broadway.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.610
It was hit on Broadway.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.590 position:88%
Then they took it over to England, and it was hit there.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.000 position:72%
Played at the Palladium and everyone loved it,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.190 position:66%
but then they were gonna disband the show,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.460
until General Eisenhower showed up.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.710 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Robert Sidney: Eisenhower got wind of that,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.520 position:63%
and that's when he came to see the show.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.520 position:61%
And after the show, he came back stage.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.730 position:88%
We were called to attention, and he said, "At ease, men.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:28.510 position:92%
At ease." And he said, "I want to tell you, I sat out there

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.100 position:97%
in that audience, and if you can do for the GIs what you did for me,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.920 position:72%
brought up so many wonderful memories of home,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.240 position:97%
you're the biggest morale factor we have to offer these men in arms"

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.010 position:97%
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: What went on then, the show was reconfigured,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.480
sent literally around the world.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.060 position:98%
And what Robert has done here is this is the itinerary for the shows.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.920 position:92%
Also, in his collection, there's some very touching letters

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.510
from Irving Berlin to him.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.990 position:61%
This is Irving Berlin at a medical ward

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.070 position:67%
out in the Pacific - singing to the troops.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.310 position:64%
This is him in front of a poster in Rome.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.050 position:88%
An interesting part about this troop, it was integrated.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.050 position:78%
Most of the units in World War II were segregated.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.910 position:95%
I don't know if you have these backstage at any of your shows

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.290 position:66%
of guys dressing up for their performance.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.860
And, in fact, your story

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.560 position:94%
of what you've been doing can become a part of this project.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.280 position:89%
&gt;&gt; Gary Sinise: I think there's probably several veterans

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.670 position:97%
that don't have any idea that that's even available or needed or wanted,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.110 position:94%
but I know others that would be grateful for the opportunity

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.040
to have something preserved,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.520 position:97%
some part of their history that's important to them preserved here

00:05:50.520 --> 00:06:03.040
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.830 position:97%
Female: This has been a presentation of the Library of Congress.
