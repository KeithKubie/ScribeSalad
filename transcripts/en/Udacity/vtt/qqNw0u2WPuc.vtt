00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.674
Now, I think it's important to stop and ask ourselves just why our

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:09.075
neurotransmitters so important?. Many medicines, as well as drugs of abuse,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:14.700
affect neurotransmitters. For example, we learned that SSRIs, Selective

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.980
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, prevent serotonin from being taken back up by

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.856
that neuron. Neurotransmitters are also important when we're looking at drugs

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:31.280
of abuse. For example, both cocaine and methamphetamine are drugs that increase

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.510
the amount of dopamine that's available in the synaptic cleft. Again, that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.221
means dopamine can attach to those dopaminergic receptors.
