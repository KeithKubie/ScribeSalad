00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.150
MARTIN OMANDER: Welcome
to "Google Root Access,"

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.560
the show featuring
actionable startup advice.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.251
My guest today is Alex
Haro, co-founder of Life360.

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.984
Alex, tell us
about your startup.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:15.650
ALEX HARO: Sure.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.149
Well, first of all, thank you
so much for having me onboard.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:19.470
I'm super excited.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.710
Life360 is an app
for families that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.340
lets them see where everyone
is, communicate, coordinate,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.460
keep in touch, and get automated
alerts when their family

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.880
members leave work,
arrive home, get

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.476
to school, that kind of stuff.

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:34.850
And by focusing
in on that, we've

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.109
been able to amass a huge user
base of 44 million families

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.150
and growing very quickly.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.210
We're adding an additional
one to two million families

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.150
every single month.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.233
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:45.120
And you should add one
to that one million.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.203
I signed up the other day.

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:47.120
ALEX HARO: Awesome.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.035
Always great to be
talking to a user.

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:49.868
MARTIN OMANDER: Yes.

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:52.380
And so this can actually-- I
haven't started using it yet,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.530
but this app can
actually tell me,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.890
when I'm at work, when my son
leaves school and comes home

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.999
to our house?

00:00:58.999 --> 00:00:59.790
ALEX HARO: Exactly.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.120
And what we've seen
is those interactions,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.080
a lot of the important
family interactions,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.474
are when they're apart.

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:07.140
The number-one text
message in the world

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.230
is still, "Where are you?"

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.490
And it's kind of crazy in the
day of smartphones, especially

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.740
around families, that they're
still sending those text

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.100
messages, "Hey, where are
you?", back and forth.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.910
So we focused in on what are
the really cool interactions

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.450
around location?

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.190
Automated alerts are one.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.260
We've had some others, like
you can get into your BMW car,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.940
and say, "Drive to my wife," and
it will route you right there.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.024
We can automatically arm
your home security system

00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:30.690
when your whole family
leaves the house.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.130
So instead of being this
thing that no one ever uses,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.060
it's this thing you're
using every single day,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.947
thanks to location.

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:37.030
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.460
So I have one concern, though.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.900
Won't this run down the battery
on my phone, my son's phone,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.920
if it keeps running
that GPS chip?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.354
That's a fairly
power-hungry chip, right?

00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:49.020
ALEX HARO: Sure.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.500
And I think you're
absolutely right on that.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.240
A lot of apps have tried to
do this, and what they've done

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.010
is they've woken the GPS
chip every 10 minutes.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.740
And that absolutely does
kill your battery life.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.510
And what we focused on-- I
mean, we launched back in 2008.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.550
We've really been focused on
how do we get location out

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.785
of the phones without
impacting battery?

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:08.660
And luckily, there are
many different sensors

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.800
on the phone that give you
location-- things like Wi-Fi,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.360
things like the
cellular networks,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.080
even things like
the accelerometer

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.710
and Bluetooth and audio.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.810
All various different
ways to get location

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.680
and confirm where people are.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.040
And so we've spent a
lot of time figuring out

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.010
what are the right
sensors to turn?

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.760
What are the right
tradeoffs to make?

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.062
GPS is obviously more
accurate, but more battery.

00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:31.020
How do you make those
tradeoffs, and how do you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.610
get awesome location
without killing the battery?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.740
And we've been very
successful doing that.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.656
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.795
So I'm an engineer.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.020
I've written a lot of code.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.580
ALEX HARO: Awesome.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.900
MARTIN OMANDER: You have an
engineering background, too.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.290
ALEX HARO: Yes.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.520
MARTIN OMANDER: I can just
imagine massive amounts

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.940
of code dealing with various
sensors and various devices,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.670
with various tradeoffs
with battery and accuracy.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.950
How-- that must be a nightmare
to deal with all that.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.449
ALEX HARO: It is a
nightmare, and it

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.030
is a lot of tech we've
really had to build.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.940
And as an engineer, I
love the hard stuff.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.420
But we didn't want to be
a location app, right?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.260
We want to provide
awesome stuff to families.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.890
And so you are right.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.190
We've had to deal with
chipset-level bugs

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.500
that we've fixed ourselves.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.050
But luckily, Google
has provided a new API

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.544
that they call Fused Location.

00:03:13.544 --> 00:03:16.210
And what it does is a lot of the
stuff we've been talking about,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.240
where they take all
the various sensors in.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.430
You can tell it, hey, I
care more about accuracy,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.130
or hey, I care
more about battery.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.982
And it just provides you one
interface to get location.

00:03:24.982 --> 00:03:27.190
And they've built this on
top of Play Services, which

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.430
is really awesome.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.484
And they've also added
things like good geofencing.

00:03:31.484 --> 00:03:33.150
The first version of
Android geofencing?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.800
Not very good.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.850
This new version of geofencing,
especially providing

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.980
the fused location,
is really good.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.719
And activity
tracking-- so they know

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.260
if you're walking,
if you're running,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.724
if you're sitting at home,
if you're driving your car,

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.390
or going faster than
the speed of light.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.290
MARTIN OMANDER: Mhm.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.320
How many of your users go
faster than the speed of light?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.460
ALEX HARO: None, too much.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.180
But you know,
let's hope one day.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.600
MARTIN OMANDER: One day.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.891
ALEX HARO: Especially if Elon
Musk gets his way, right?

00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:57.440
MARTIN OMANDER: That's right.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.770
So this allows your
developers to work

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.780
on sort of higher
abstraction layer level?

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.760
They don't have to deal with
the various different chipsets

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.370
and such.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.161
ALEX HARO: Exactly.

00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.550
And one of the
really cool things

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.550
is because it's built on
top of the Play Services,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.399
it gets updated when the
Play Services are updated.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.100
So a big debate, especially
in the Android world,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.240
has been fragmentation.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.560
A lot of people have
gone back and forth on

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.150
is Android fragmented or not?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.300
And when you're dealing
with the chipsets that

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.310
are in specific phones, it
absolutely is fragmented.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.720
But luckily with this
new Fused Location API,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.960
they've been able
abstract around that.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.060
And now, instead of waiting
for Android to be updated,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.590
you just have to tell the
user, update your Google Play

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.180
Services, and they automatically
get all the benefits.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.220
When new chipsets come out, that
code is automatically shipped.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.530
When new bugs are found
or new things are fixed,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.770
the API is
automatically upgraded

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.627
as part of Google Play
Services instead of

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:53.960
as part of the Android platform.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.460
And that's an awesome
win for users,

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.360
and an ingenious move by Google.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.526
MARTIN OMANDER: Right, yeah.

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:00.660
Because my son has had his
phone for a year or two,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.740
and I don't think it's been
upgraded by the carrier once.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.220
ALEX HARO: Exactly.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.947
But with Google
Play Services, he'll

00:05:04.947 --> 00:05:06.280
definitely have the newest code.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.230
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.690
So Alex, what is your
advice to other startups who

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.510
are doing mobile
location-based computing?

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.220
ALEX HARO: Sure,
my advice is really

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.080
focus in on what you can
build on top of location.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.890
I really would not advise you
to become a location company,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.700
and worry about all
the sensors, and do

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.480
a lot of the hard
stuff and heavy lifting

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.620
that we had to do.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.530
With these new APIs
around location

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.916
that Google has
provided, you can

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:30.290
start to build on
top of location

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.720
and offer really cool new
user experiences on top of it.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.210
And that's really what you
should dedicate your time to.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.230
Build on top of these
APIs that exist.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.215
Let Google worry about
the really hard details

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.590
around location, and you worry
about the awesome products

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.067
that your users want to use.

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:45.150
MARTIN OMANDER: Very good.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.460
Thank you for sharing your
experiences with us, Alex.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.990
ALEX HARO: Absolutely.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.739
Thank you so much.

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:50.290
I had a ton of fun.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.360
MARTIN OMANDER: And
thank you for watching.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.970
We hope you found something
you can use in your startup.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.270
Your input matters.
