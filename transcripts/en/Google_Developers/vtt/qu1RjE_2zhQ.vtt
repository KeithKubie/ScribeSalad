LAURENCE MORONEY: Hey guys.

00:00:01.245 --> 00:00:03.267
Can we get a photo
just for the scrapbook?

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:05.350
I mean, we just found this
lovely picnic table out

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.724
beside a parking lot, and I
really want to get a picture.

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:08.460
So OK.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.250
Everybody, just show
me the pearly whites

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.530
on the count of three.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.540
One, two, three.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.721
Brian, you blinked.

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.220
LIZ: Man.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.345
LAURENCE MORONEY: Come on
guys, it's not that hard.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:22.290
You ready?

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.350
One, two, three.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.199
Everybody looking good, and Liz.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:30.865
You're frowning.

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:32.369
LIZ: What?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.240
That was my smile.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.160
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Just give us a smile.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.368
You've got a beautiful smile.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.870
OK everybody, and set.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.925
Ready.

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:40.045
And one, two, three.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.550
Yeah.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.600
Thank you.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.320
It can be hard to get
pictures of people right.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.100
And the more you try, the
more frustrating it can be.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.420
Now, being able to detect
faces and their activity

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.410
can make that much easier, and
it opens up a whole new realm

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.635
of possibilities.

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:02.460
I'm Laurence Moroney
and I'm here today

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.489
to talk about the Vision APIs
that ship with Google Play

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.060
Services and how
you can use them.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.100
Now using these, you
have access to some

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.980
of the great features that can
turn your pictures from this

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.410
to this, and maybe even this.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.290
Now of course, you're not
just limited to pictures.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.390
This API will allow
you to build apps

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.260
that can do all
kinds of fun things

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.560
with detected faces
and facial activities.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.200
Think about the things that
this could do for your app.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.660
Maybe you can create awesome
avatars from your users' faces,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.200
or you can do silly
things to their faces.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.939
Or maybe you can
create games that

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.730
are controlled by the
expression on a face,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.390
like smiling to shoot.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080
Now the Vision APIs
make facial detection

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.950
in a picture, a video, or a live
camera preview really simple.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.860
But one thing to note is that
it's facial detection and not

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.380
facial recognition.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.760
The APIs will detect
the areas in the image

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.950
where there are faces, but
not who those faces belong to.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.420
You might see some
familiar faces here.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.780
And the app has no
idea who they are.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.530
How many can you recognize?

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.290
I can tell you it's a
lot more than the API.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.870
Now one thing is
that it's really

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.120
good at detecting human faces.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.510
So sorry, Bucky, no hat for you.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.190
In addition to
that, it will also

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.590
detect various parts of the
face that it calls landmarks.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.610
No, not that kind of landmark.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.600
Landmarks are well known
parts of the human face.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.670
And here you can
see some examples.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.230
Where a face is
detected, the coordinates

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.190
for things such as the
bottom of the mouth,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.250
the base of the nose, or the
centers and tips of the eyes

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.840
will become available.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.270
So for example, if I wanted to
give this nice lady a mustache,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.530
it would be easy to plot the
center of the tache using

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.260
the edges of her mouth, the
base of her nose, and her lips.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.040
Something like this.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.840
Yep, that's tachetastic.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.770
Now beyond just seeing
the landmarks on the face,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.680
the Vision APIs also detect
activity on the face.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.690
So maybe your
subject is blinking,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.120
or maybe they're winking,
or maybe they're smiling.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.370
Well, there's an API for that.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.290
Almost.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.210
Now the face doesn't have to
be directly facing the camera.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.810
The API is smart enough
to detect a face even

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.070
at different angles
and inclinations.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.630
Now think about the things
you could do by turning

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.520
your face into a controller.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.460
Maybe wink your
left and right eyes

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.320
to move a spaceship left or
right, and smile to shoot.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.800
The possibilities are limited
only by your imagination.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.900
You can learn more
about the Vision APIs

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.480
and the great types
of apps that you

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.730
can build with them on
the Google Developer

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.250
site at these links.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.850
Thank you, and don't forget
to build better apps.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.800
