00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:02.492
- [Voiceover] All right,
cellular respiration

00:00:02.492 --> 00:00:05.320
includes the metabolic
pathways of glycolysis,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.408
the Krebs cycle, and the
electron transport chain,

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.489
as represented in the figures.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:12.927
So we have the figures here of,

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:15.398
glycolysis, the Krebs cycle,

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:17.315
and the electron transport chain.

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:19.396
If all of this looks
completely foreign to you,

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:21.574
I encourage you to watch
the videos on Khan Academy

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:23.362
on glycolysis, the Krebs cycle,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.117
and the electron transport chain,

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:28.367
and on cellular respiration in general.

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:31.066
All right, but let's tackle this problem.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.984
It's a nice review of all of those things.

00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:34.870
In cellular respiration, carbohydrates

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.023
and other metabolites are oxidized,

00:00:38.023 --> 00:00:40.754
meaning electrons are
taken away from them,

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:43.809
and the resulting
energy-transfer reactions

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.226
support the synthesis of ATP.

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:51.644
All right, using the information above,

00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:55.740
describe one contribution
of each of the following

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.157
in ATP synthesis.

00:00:58.893 --> 00:00:59.966
All right, the first one.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:04.875
Catabolism of glucose in
glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:06.542
The second was oxidation of intermediates

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:07.777
in the Krebs cycle.

00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:10.085
And the third one is
formation of a proton gradient

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:11.971
by the electron transport chain.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.246
Now, each of these statements
seem kind of intimidating,

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:16.522
but they're really just
saying, describe how

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.667
glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.390
contribute to ATP synthesis.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.833
Describe how the Krebs cycle,
because the Krebs cycle

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.172
is essentially nothing but the oxidation

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.090
of these intermediates to produce things

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.007
that are useful for ATP synthesis.

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.510
And then the formation
of the proton gradient

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.583
by the electron transport chain.

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:34.441
Well that's what the
electron trans-prit (laughs),

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.911
that's what the electron
transport chain does.

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:41.072
It takes high energy
electrons from NADH or FADH2,

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:42.828
and then as those high energy electrons

00:01:42.828 --> 00:01:44.616
go to lower and lower energy states,

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:48.191
it's pumping these hydrogen
protons across the membrane

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:52.190
and when they come back in,
that's used to synthesize ATP.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.230
So let's just answer.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.018
We have to describe one
contribution of each.

00:01:55.018 --> 00:01:57.489
So, let's first focus on glycolysis.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.805
So if we look here, there's
more than one contribution.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:03.113
You see that it can phosphorylate

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:05.363
these two ADPs to two ATPs.

00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:08.908
So that's one contribution we could list.

00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:12.658
We could say that it's
producing these NADHs.

00:02:13.557 --> 00:02:17.263
It's producing these
NADHs, which can provide

00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:19.924
both the hydrogen proton
and, more importantly,

00:02:19.924 --> 00:02:21.646
the high-energy electrons

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:24.735
for the electron transport chain later on.

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:26.783
You see that right over here.

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:28.576
Or you could say that, well, look,

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:30.428
it's producing the Acetyl-CoA,

00:02:30.428 --> 00:02:32.834
which can enter the Krebs cycle,

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.250
which is used to produce GTP

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:38.359
or more NADHs or FADH2.

00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:41.286
So all of these are contributions,

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.554
and since we only have to list one,

00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:44.569
I'll list the most direct and obvious one,

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.162
although you could list any of these,

00:02:46.162 --> 00:02:49.912
is, I will list, so this
is one contribution.

00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:53.253
I'll say the phosphorylation,

00:02:53.253 --> 00:02:54.503
phosphorylation

00:02:57.707 --> 00:02:59.540
of two ADPs, two ADPs,

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:03.114
to two ATPs,

00:03:04.891 --> 00:03:05.891
to two ATPs.

00:03:08.142 --> 00:03:09.475
And I could list several more,

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.393
but that's a good one right over there,

00:03:11.393 --> 00:03:13.480
we just have to have one contribution.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.856
All right, oxidation of
intermediates in the Krebs cycle.

00:03:16.856 --> 00:03:18.643
So, the oxidation of the intermediates,

00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:20.822
that's just talking about
each of these things

00:03:20.822 --> 00:03:24.137
keep getting oxidized,
and as they get oxidized,

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.673
we can use that to reduce other things,

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.923
including NAD plus to NADH.

00:03:31.387 --> 00:03:34.215
So, when you reduce it,
it's gaining electrons.

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:35.775
Notice, NAD plus is positive

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:38.538
and then it becomes
NADH, which is neutral.

00:03:38.538 --> 00:03:41.106
And these NADHs are used later on

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:42.862
in the electron transport chain

00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:46.958
to pump hydrogen protons
across the membrane

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.884
which are then used in
oxidative phosphorylation

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:53.297
to produce the ATP as they
go back through the membrane.

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:56.710
So, you could talk about
the NADHs or FADH2s,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.576
or you could talk about
the direct creation of GTPs

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:02.111
which could be used to create ATPs.

00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:03.574
So any of that is fine.

00:04:03.574 --> 00:04:05.947
So I'll just list one of them.

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:07.114
So, I'll write

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:11.159
reduction of

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:14.986
NAD plus

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:18.129
to NAD, NADH,

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.206
which is used in

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:27.836
electron transport chain,

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:28.752
in electron

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:32.572
transport chain

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.701
to pump hydrogen protons to get,

00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.868
to create proton gradient,

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.466
to create proton

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:49.072
gradient, gradient.

00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:53.145
And once again, I could
talk about the GDP,

00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:55.778
the GT (laughs), the GTPs being created.

00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:58.801
I could talk about the
FADH2 being created.

00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:00.984
Formation of a proton gradient by

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:02.614
the electron transport chain.

00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:06.781
Well, as the protons flow
with the gradient back into,

00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:14.012
back across the membrane,
they power ATP synthase

00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:17.554
which creates ATP from ADP.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:19.935
So, as protons

00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:25.797
flow

00:05:27.402 --> 00:05:28.819
across membrane,

00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:32.381
flow with gradient across membrane,

00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:33.881
flow with gradient

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:38.654
across membrane,

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:40.117
and if you're actually taking the AP test,

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:41.557
you might want to just do it below,

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:42.727
so you might have more space,

00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:43.800
but I'll just fill it in here.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.633
As protons flow with
gradient across membrane,

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:49.983
they drive,

00:05:51.147 --> 00:05:53.147
they drive ATP synthase,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.334
ATP synthase,

00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.514
which,

00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:05.304
which takes,

00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:08.685
we can say oxidatively phosphorylates,

00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:11.091
so I'll just write phosphorylates,

00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:12.341
phosphorylates

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.208
ADP,

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:18.333
ADP to ATP.

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:23.707
And once again, if
everything I'm saying here

00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:25.397
sounds foreign, and if these diagrams

00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:26.762
don't make a lot of sense to you.

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:29.038
If they don't trigger a pleasurable memory

00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:30.603
in your head (laughs),

00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:31.717
I encourage you to watch
the videos (laughs)

00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:32.962
on Khan Academy, where
hopefully you'll get

00:06:32.962 --> 00:06:35.010
a little bit more intuition for the things

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.383
that I am talking about.

00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:40.764
All right, now let's see
if we can tackle part b.

00:06:40.764 --> 00:06:43.072
Use each of the following observations

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:44.795
to justify the claim that glycolysis

00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:48.956
first occurred in a common
ancestor of all living organisms.

00:06:48.956 --> 00:06:53.182
So, nearly all existing
organisms perform glycolysis.

00:06:53.182 --> 00:06:55.880
So, it's much more likely,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.066
so much more likely that this,

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:00.301
in order for this to happen,

00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:02.349
maybe I'll write this.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.860
In order, so for this one right over here,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.693
in order

00:07:08.984 --> 00:07:10.984
for this to be the case,

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:15.099
to be the case,

00:07:17.064 --> 00:07:18.981
it is much more likely,

00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:21.648
much more likely

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:26.256
that this

00:07:28.984 --> 00:07:31.401
evolved in a common ancestor,

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.036
in common ancestor

00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:41.212
and was passed down,

00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:44.463
and was passed down, or you could say

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:46.316
selected for, even,

00:07:46.316 --> 00:07:47.732
and selected for,

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:50.292
selected for,

00:07:51.452 --> 00:07:53.535
rather than independently

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.666
coming about multiple times,

00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:59.332
than independently,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.794
independently

00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:09.772
arising in multiple branches
of the evolutionary change,

00:08:09.772 --> 00:08:12.022
than independently arising

00:08:14.752 --> 00:08:16.502
in multiple branches,

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:19.771
branches,

00:08:21.904 --> 00:08:23.237
of tree of life.

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:28.207
Or let me say, multiple
branches of evolutionary tree.

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:29.290
Evolutionary,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.600
evolutionary tree.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.001
The fact that all, nearly,

00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:36.826
or they're saying nearly all,

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:40.272
nearly all existing
organisms perform glycolysis.

00:08:40.272 --> 00:08:43.262
In theory, it could have
happened independently,

00:08:43.262 --> 00:08:46.058
just because it gets
selected so for strongly,

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:49.516
but if something happens
in nearly all organisms,

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:51.347
it's very likely that it
evolved at a very, very

00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:54.918
early stage, at a kind of a
primitive ancestor organism,

00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:56.349
and that was selected for,

00:08:56.349 --> 00:08:57.844
and it continues to be selected for

00:08:57.844 --> 00:09:00.027
and that's why we continue to see it.

00:09:00.027 --> 00:09:04.225
All right, glycolysis occurs
under anaerobic conditions.

00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:06.435
So actually, let me create some space here

00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:09.134
so things don't get too jumbled up.

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:12.839
So glycolysis occurs under
anaerobic conditions.

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:14.339
Well, early Earth,

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:16.101
early Earth

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:19.807
had little,

00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:22.847
had little oxygen

00:09:25.072 --> 00:09:26.156
little oxygen

00:09:28.838 --> 00:09:30.005
in atmosphere.

00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:34.924
Early life.

00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:36.257
So, early life,

00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:40.376
had to perform,

00:09:42.117 --> 00:09:43.873
had to, I guess you could say,

00:09:43.873 --> 00:09:46.718
produce ATP, or you could,

00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:49.134
early life had to metabolize,

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.724
tab-ol-ize sugars or carbohydrates

00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:58.976
in anaerobic environment.

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:04.367
In anaerobic, so an environment
that doesn't have oxygen.

00:10:05.252 --> 00:10:06.085
Anaerobic,

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:08.919
anareobic environment.

00:10:11.107 --> 00:10:13.711
So that seems to, once
again, justify the claim

00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:15.040
that glycolysis first
occurred in a common ancestor

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.040
of all living organisms.

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:23.251
Glycolysis only occurs in cytosol.

00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:25.418
So, so most, so, earliest,

00:10:29.287 --> 00:10:30.370
earliest life

00:10:33.619 --> 00:10:34.619
didn't have

00:10:37.698 --> 00:10:40.445
membrane-bound organelles,

00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:41.695
membrane-bound

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:45.540
organelles,

00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:52.381
so the fact that it
only occurs in cytosol,

00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.048
so fact that occurs

00:10:58.733 --> 00:10:59.566
in cytosol

00:11:01.842 --> 00:11:05.132
consistent with it be, that it's possible

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:07.589
that early life did it.

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:08.673
Is consistent

00:11:12.828 --> 00:11:15.738
that earl, with early life

00:11:15.738 --> 00:11:17.738
with it first occurring,

00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:22.862
occurring in common ancestor.

00:11:22.862 --> 00:11:25.362
First, with it first occurring

00:11:30.749 --> 00:11:31.666
in common,

00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:35.171
early ancestor.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.744
I'll then tackle parts c
and d in the next video.
