00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.910
The question isn’t, are we alone in the
universe it’s are we alone in these universes?

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.719
According to a bit of the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation we might have a neighbor…

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.719
right…

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:14.719
THERE.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.359
This is the cosmic microwave background radiation
or CMB.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.529
It’s the leftover light from the Big Bang
itself.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.339
It’s the furthest light from us in the visible
universe.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.250
In fact it’s everywhere you look.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.550
If you could see it (which you can’t because
it’s in the microwave spectrum), it would

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.230
glow everywhere!

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.100
It’s all around us constantly, but it’s
super low-energy, because, again, it’s been

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.190
around since the beginning of the universe.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.399
Over time, we’ve taken the CMB’s temperature,
mapped it in increasing detail and in doing

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.930
so we found something… curious…

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.090
See, usually the CMB is pretty uniform in
temperature about 2.73 Kelvin -- Only deviating

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.410
a few micro-Kelvin across the whole CMB...
except in one place: ‘The Cold Spot.’

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.699
For some reason there it skews colder than
the average temperature by a few microkelvin.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.580
No big deal for a tiny area, but this is consistent
across a huge region!

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.159
It’s a billion light-years across!

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.640
This spot challenges what we know about the
universe.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640
What is this thing?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.890
How did it get there?

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.600
Astronomers have been fighting about The Cold
Spot for years, and they’ve come up with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.110
a few theories…

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.510
The cosmic texture hypothesis says if you
analyze the CMB a certain way, it’s just

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.450
a bumpy part of the cosmos.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.600
The cluster hypothesis says there are clusters
of galaxies that may affect the CMB as we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.060
perceive it.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.810
Which is similar to the supervoid hypothesis,
which states that it was only cold from our

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.840
perspective, because in between the CMB and
Earth is a “supervoid” a cooler, less

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.969
galaxy-dense region of space.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.770
The most banal theory is that it exists because
the satellite instruments or analysis has

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.340
some math error.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.200
But the most fantastical could also be one
of the most likely: that the spot is cold

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.930
because it’s where the edge of our universe
touched the edge of another universe!

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.670
The reason it’s gained some ground is because
the supervoid theory was strongly refuted

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.230
in May 2017.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.280
Apparently, astronomers don’t think voids
that super exist!

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.180
Either way, none of these theories are 100%...

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.000
So, let’s get back to the crazy exotic physics
answer: that at some point our universe may

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.390
have bumped into another universe, leaving
a bruise.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.440
This is based on ideas of the multiverse theory.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720
In the 1920s, famous physicists Niels Bohr
and Werner Heisenberg kicked us into the quantum

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.070
physics theory of “superposition.”

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.950
The idea that an infinite number of universes
are possible... all overlapping on each other.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.770
But because we’re observing the universe,
we can only see one.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.350
So think of Schrodinger's Cat -- a cat, in
a box with a vial of poison that could break

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.780
at any time.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.890
This thought experiment wouldn’t be an issue,
because of superposition.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.140
There’s no observer, so the cat is both
alive and dead in two separate universes!

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.300
Not a huge deal for quantum mechanics -- but
earth-shattering for regular physics in the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.300
observable universe.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.310
Obviously, I’m simplifying a lot for sake
of time, but it’s all very confusing.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.050
Suffice it to say, the math works.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.090
But, if infinite universes are out there,
how could one universe even physically touch

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.990
another anyway?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.680
There are a lot of questions, and no answers.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.170
Some even say it’s impossible to prove others
say it’s unprovable period.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.090
And still others say it’s just an unlikely
natural event.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.920
If it’s not a supervoid, or a multiverse
bruise, say physicists, then our assumptions

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.780
of the universe based on our standard model
of physics might just be… wrong by a bit!

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.890
According to the newest study author, “The
craziest-sounding of the exotic models for

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.700
the explanation of the Cold Spot… [the multiverse]
is actually the most standard in terms of

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.590
[our current] model [of the universe].”

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.900
In the end, we can’t 100-percent say it’s
not another universe…

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.850
I for one welcome our universe-neighbors,
who are also ourselves.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.390
I know that’s mind-blowing, but we’re
not done yet.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.160
The universe is expanding in all directions
at once, we can tell by watch the CMB… but

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.510
what’s on the other side?

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.290
What’s outside the universe?

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.430
We’ve got a video about that here.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.310
What do you think the cold spot is?
