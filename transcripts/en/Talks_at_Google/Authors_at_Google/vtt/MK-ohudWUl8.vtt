00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.860
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Hi, my name is [unintelligible].

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.660
I have been a Googler for about four years
now.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.180
Welcome, everyone, to this Authors at Google
talk.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.570
Today is August 16, 2012.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.360
This is for the video.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.830
We are excited to present one of the most
forward-looking writers and thinkers of our

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.830
time.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.320
Charles Eisenstein writes and speaks on the
topics of civilization, consciousness, money,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.660
and human-concerned evolution.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.690
I first heard him on the radio a few months
back, and then I read his book, called The

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.409
Ascent of Humanity.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.679
And I was really impressed by how well he
explained the reasons and causes behind so

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.190
many of the issues we face today, individually
as well as collectively.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.190
[microphone adjustment sounds] You can think
about all the problems that humanity faces

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.150
today as different threads of strings.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.920
Charles shows us how they all got tied together
into this kind of a knot.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.300
In his newest book, Sacred Economics, he proposes
a way to unravel this knot, and move forward

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.660
with a new mindset.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.370
[microphone adjustment sounds] All right.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.060
Allow me to introduce to you Charles Eisenstein.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580
[applause]

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.160
&gt;&gt;Charles Eisenstein: Yeah, thanks [unintelligible].

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.590
So there's only about, maybe, 20, 30 people
here.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.200
And I think I'm going to do things a little
bit backwards.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.480
I'd like to solicit three questions from the
audience.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.002
I'm not even necessarily going to answer those
questions, at least, not right away.

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:54.100
But I want to kinda try to suss out what kind
of listening and what kind of curiosity, and

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100
why people are here.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.650
Anyone who has a pretty strong question on
their mind, you don't actually have to make

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.600
one up right now, but if you came here with
a question or with something that you're carrying,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.030
let me know what it is.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.030
Yeah.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.330
&gt;&gt;male #1: How do we get from here to there?

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.330
[light laughter]

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.330
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: All right.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.080
How do we get from here to there?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080
Beautiful.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.330
Yeah, yeah, good.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.950
[pause] Yes.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:28.319
&gt;&gt;male #2: Are there parallels between the
way our economy is evolving now and the transition

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.319
from [inaudible]

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.319
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Okay.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.319
Yeah.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.319
Transition in general.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.319
It's probably making good video, because they
can't hear you.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.319
But whatever.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.319
Yeah.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.319
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Can money be spiritual?

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.319
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Can money be spiritual?

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.319
Mmm.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.319
All right, good.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.319
Yeah, so now I know where to start.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.319
Thank you.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.500
How do we get from here to there?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.849
Like, that presupposes that there is a there.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.580
And this is something that I think everybody
can intuit.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.290
[man clears his throat] Everybody has a sense
that a more beautiful world is possible.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.810
And has a sense, especially strong in-- Most
of you are pretty young.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.859
But especially strong among young people,
teenagers, that the world is supposed to be

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.720
a lot more beautiful than what has been offered
to us as normal.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.650
And life is supposed to be a lot more authentic,
a lot more intimate, a lot more joyous than

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.970
the lives that are offered to us as the standard
life in our society.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:34.510
And so we have this indwelling knowledge that
there's something wrong around here.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.969
But I don't know what it is.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:44.030
And this feeling, for me at least, growing
up in the '70s and '80s, this feeling kinda

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:53.519
made it impossible for me to fully participate
in the life that had been offered to me.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.689
And I kinda halfheartedly went along with
it and did it in fits and starts, went to

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:08.400
an Ivy League school but then left and got
a job at a bar, then ended up doing translation

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:17.290
in Taiwan, and then bagging that and just
skating in and out of this life that would

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.930
have been expected to me, for me, and had
been handed to me.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.190
And occasionally, getting glimpses of what
it's supposed to be like to be human, and

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.650
what the world is supposed to be like.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.950
Little glimpses of the future, kinda like
the hippies got in the 1960s, where they had

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:49.030
these experiences of working together, living
together, psychedelic experiences maybe, that

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.310
showed them what the world is supposed to
be.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.930
And I don't know if any of you have had experiences
like that.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.900
For some people, it's a near death experience,
or if you're a long time in danger, or playing

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.240
music, or making love, or by the bedside of
a dying person, or a psychedelic experience

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:17.880
sometimes, or just being maybe at Burning
Man, and there's this feeling that this isn't

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.290
just some temporary excursion from the normalcy,
but that this is a glimpse of something real,

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.810
something possible that can actually happen.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.750
Okay, so yeah.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:38.840
So we get these glimpses of the more beautiful
world that our hearts know is possible, and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.280
that our minds have a million reasons to doubt.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.980
And I'm getting a little feeling of that here
on the Google campus, just having been here

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.680
for a few hours.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.430
Like, there's something [pause] there's something
right about it.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.430
Somewhere.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.620
Like there's such a thing as the soul of Google.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.720
There's something that exists kinda in this
incipient form that wants to be born, that

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720
wants to happen.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.540
It's kinda being carried here.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.460
Maybe it was really obvious in the early days,
but it's-- and maybe sometimes it goes dormant

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.940
or sometimes it's harder to see, but it's
still kinda waiting there underneath.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.810
I'm getting a sense that there's something
here also.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:38.290
So [pause] there's a lot of different ways
I can take this, and this was supposed to

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:48.220
be about money, so I think maybe I will talk
a little bit about the source of the wrongness

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:55.890
that we experience in our lower moments.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:02.480
I think is eternal and inevitable and just
the way things are.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.370
And that maybe our intuitions that life is
supposed to be more beautiful were just immaturity,

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.980
and now we have to put up with the way things
are.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:21.420
[pause]
I spent years trying to find, trying to figure

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.740
out, trying to understand.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:34.550
A, Am I crazy? and B, if I'm not crazy, then
what is wrong here?

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:44.420
Why have we not fulfilled the promise of technology,
for example, to create a more beautiful world?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.630
Futures have been promising us that for hundreds
of years.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.630
We were--.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:54.990
The invention of the steam engine was supposed
to usher in the age of mechanized comfort

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.670
and leisure.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.980
Futurists were predicting that in 1790.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.230
They were predicting it again and again and
again.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.980
In 1984, Alvin Toffler said, "By the year
2000, the greatest problem facing society

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.540
will be what to do with all our leisure time."

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.200
And in a way, that's kinda true.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.460
It's called unemployment.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.920
[laughter] But somehow, it really hasn't come
to pass.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.840
All along, we've chosen to consume more rather
than to work less with every new advanced

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.030
labor-saving technology.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.400
The computer was supposed to do it, right?

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.670
Finally, that was the solution.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:36.390
It'll do for mental drudgery what a machine
did for physical drudgery.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.940
And it didn't happen.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.640
[pause]
We're starting to get a little bit [pause]

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.910
cynical about the promise of technology.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.230
In the social realm, too.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:52.980
I was reading about how when the first railway
was established between Europe and India--

00:08:52.980 --> 00:09:02.190
this was in the 19th century-- people were
predicting that this means the end of war.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.600
There can absolutely be no more wars because
now people could go to India.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.260
They could go to all these other countries
and they can see how other people live, and

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.640
they'll know that they're not really enemies,
they're not really different from me.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.430
And so they'll be no more war.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:22.210
This was shortly before the most horrific
century that humanity has ever experienced.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.490
So today, people make kinda the same predictions
about the internet, that's it's going to create

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:35.710
oneness and a global mind, and it'll make
the effects, the consequences of our actions,

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.190
come back to us faster.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:46.279
It'll tighten the circle of karma and make
it impossible to pretend that we are separate

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.620
from each other.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:53.400
I'm a little skeptical about that, simply
because-- I mean, even if it is-- even if

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.800
the internet is the emergence of a global
mind, I mean, gee, my own mind has a lot of

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.070
shadows, a lot of unconscious pain.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.550
Dark areas.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.550
So anyway.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.089
[several voice in background]
So I was looking for the origin of the wrongness.

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:27.050
And [pause] one of the stopping points, one
of the base camps, as I traced back and tried

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.529
to understand it, was money.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:37.200
Because when you look into why anything horrible
is happening on earth, whatever your particular

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.000
area of passion is.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.680
Look into, why are we cutting down the rainforests?

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:51.500
Why has the Aral Sea shrank by 90%?

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.760
Why are we spoiling the aquifers with fracking?

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.620
Why are we doing all these things?

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.839
Why are the deserts spreading?

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:01.060
Why are people doing this?

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.560
You ask a couple levels of why, and very soon,
you get to money.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.790
Somebody's making money from it.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:16.620
And that's puzzling that it should be this
way, because money is simply a social creation.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.830
It's an agreement among people about what's
valuable.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.090
It's an agreement that to use something as
a medium of exchange.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.130
[woman's voice in background] It's not something
that exists in physical reality, but it's

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.530
something that we agree on.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:36.710
So the question is: why have we agreed to
give value to the things that are destroying

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:43.710
the planet, making people all around the earth
miserable, and tearing apart society?

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.710
Why?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.320
Why can't we make other agreements?

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:54.370
And certainly, a lot of people come up with
brilliant ideas about "Here's how the money

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.410
system should be."

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.390
Lots of smart people have lots of smart ideas.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.339
And then they unveil them, hoping that their
self-evident brilliance and logic will sway

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:10.000
everybody to adopt them, but they never get
adopted.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.510
The reason for that is that the money system
rests on a deeper foundation.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.690
The problem isn't just money.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:25.080
The problem is deeper than that.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.540
And I would say that the origin of the wrongness--.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:36.430
And I don't want to be sounding really negative
here, because one thing I learned in writing

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:43.649
my first book, The Ascent of Humanity, was
that everything that we see around us today

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:46.030
is part of a larger process.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.170
But I won't get too metaphysical right now
about that.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:13:01.620
But here's something that probably everybody
can sense in our current crisis, or I would

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.820
say, our current convergence of awful crises.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:13.820
We can sense that the crisis, in some way,
goes all the way down to the bottom.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:22.710
That whether it's the geological crisis, the
soil crisis, water crisis, energy crisis,

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:30.360
health crisis, educational crisis, money crisis,
that it's not a matter of making a few technical

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.240
tweaks to restore normality.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.140
But that, in some sense, everything is at
stake.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.500
That-- And what is everything?

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:51.430
[pause]
So let me just actually point out one of the

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.800
things that's part of the wrongness, which
would be this model right now, where I'm standing

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.290
up in front of everybody and you guys are
all facing me, looking at the back of each

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.130
other's heads, being a passive audience.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.320
There's something not quite right about that.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:16.570
This is a very unusual model, maybe only used
if a great storyteller or something came to

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.380
the tribe, a long time ago.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.800
And it's kinda inconsistent with the network
world.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.990
This is more a broadcast model.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.870
I just wanted to acknowledge that.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:34.100
I will continue doing that for a little while,
but I want to acknowledge that.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:41.410
[laughter] And say, also, [pause] you know,
because everywhere I go, I meet such brilliant

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:46.870
people who could pretty much-- I'm sure half
of you in this room could be occupied in this

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.570
role, and saying something really enlightening.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:56.089
So there's almost no reason, anymore, for
this model.

00:14:56.089 --> 00:14:57.089
So anyway.

00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:04.690
As an example of how all encompassing this
change is, we understand that the change that

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:12.220
is being invited by the monetary crisis--
which is dormant right now, but it could flare

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.320
up at any time.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.620
It's just been postponed a little to the future.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:24.959
The change offered by that is related somehow
to the movement toward less hierarchical structures

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.910
in corporate management.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.220
But what is that connection?

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:36.000
And it's somehow related to the transformation
of a health-care system toward [man coughs]

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.880
all of the things we call holistic and alternative.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.560
Somehow there's a connection here to recognize.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:52.529
We recognize that somehow, everybody who's
engaged in that is somehow on the same team

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:59.870
with people who are exploring different ways
to mediate conflict or who are working in

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:08.180
permaculture or non-hierarchical modes of
cooperation.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.690
There's something unifying all of these things.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.990
And what is it?

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.990
Really what--.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:24.589
The way I understand our current historical
moment is that we are in a transition in our

00:16:24.589 --> 00:16:26.529
most basic mythology.

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:33.840
And the answers to the deepest questions a
human being can ask, such as "Who am I?",

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.650
"Why am I here?", "Where have I come from?",
[several voices in background] or "Where have

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.260
we come from as a species?" and "Where are
we going?" and "What's important and what's

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.850
valuable in life?"

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.440
Every culture has a different set of answers
to these questions.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:54.550
And upon these answers, a civilization is
built.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:17:02.170
When these answers begin to change, the structures
built on top of them become obsolete.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.540
That's what's happening today.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:10.380
The answers to those questions are changing,
but we still live among institutions, systems,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.730
that are built on the old answers.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:19.980
So just to give you a quick overview, the
old answer to the question "Who am I?"

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.010
That's the most basic one.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.240
What is it to exist?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.089
And the old answer is, "Ah!

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:34.100
What you are is a discrete, separate self,
a bubble of psychology, a Cartesian moat of

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:40.490
consciousness, inside of a flesh robot, in
an external universe, among other separate

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.530
individuals that are all separate from you."

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.830
And every field agreed on this, psychology,
religion.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.130
Right, you're a separate soul encased in flesh.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:56.890
I'm talking about the dominant institutions
of religion, not the esoteric corners.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:05.640
Biology, you are a flesh robot basically programmed
by your genes to maximize reproductive self-interest.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:13.260
You might recognize this as obsolete biology,
but it still dominates our institutions, for

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.630
example in the medical institution.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:23.240
Physics, you're a collocation of particles
interacting according to deterministic forces.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.370
Again, obsolete physics, but still very influential.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:32.260
And so everyone agreed on what "self" is.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.260
Separate.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:40.260
And if you're separate in an external universe,
then everything outside of you is, at best,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.670
indifferent to you, and, at worst, hostile
to you.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.250
Everyone else is maximizing their own self-interest.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:57.240
So you need to exercise control and master
forces, bring the hardest forces, and on the

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:03.260
species level, you need to become, as Descartes
said, "The lords and masters of nature."

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:14.550
So you might recognize that our money system
is an outgrowth, or a reflection, of this

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:19.350
basic mythology , which says, essentially,
"More for you is less for me."

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.410
It says we're all in competition with each
other.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:31.230
And it enforces that and creates that, even
if you don't want to be competitive.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:39.410
And that has to do with the way that money
is created and circulated in our system, starting

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:45.930
from how it originates as interest-bearing
debt, which is about a ten minute detour from

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:46.930
this story.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:47.930
Maybe fifteen.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.150
And I'm not going to quite go there yet.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.480
I might end up going there.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.230
[pause]
But that's what Sacred Economics is about.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:06.110
Really what it's about is how to align money
with the new answers to these basic questions.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.900
How to align money with what is becoming sacred
to us.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:18.190
So the new answer, which is also a very ancient
answer, to "Who are you?" is that, "Well,

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.820
actually, you're not a separate self.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.990
You're a connected self.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.240
You are the sum total of all your relationships.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.010
You are everything."

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:39.381
[pause] You might have experienced this sometime
when you look at somebody and you get that

00:20:39.381 --> 00:20:43.460
feeling that this is the same being looking
out from different eyes.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:49.680
Or when you read about something awful happening
in the world, like maybe you see that plume

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:56.419
of radiation, those graphics, coming from
Fukushima, and it's really painful what's

00:20:56.419 --> 00:21:00.299
happening to the ocean, what's happening to
the dolphins, what's happening to the fish,

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:01.299
what's happening on this planet.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:02.299
It hurts, you know.

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:03.970
Watching it hurt.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:09.890
It hurts because it's actually happening to
you.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:15.590
Because none of us are separate from any other
being.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:23.320
And this contradicts our old logic, the logic
of separation, which really would say, "Well,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.559
why should that matter?

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:35.730
Why should it matter if the rainforest in
[pause] Ecuador is being cut down for mining?

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.020
That's not going to affect me.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.440
And even if it does, that's generations in
the future, and technology will come up with

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.440
some solution.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.730
So why should I care?"

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.330
It just hurts, though.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.460
And that's the sign of our connected being.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.780
[pause]
So the new story of the self, you could say,

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.840
is the connected self.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:12.191
And from that, [pause] from that understanding,
what is rational is different than what it

00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:14.090
is for a separate self.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:21.870
And the things that we all aspire to, we long
to be passionate about, from the heart, become

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.120
no longer crazy.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:30.530
[pause] Do you understand that?

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.010
It's a different logic.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:41.370
So today, though, we've inherited this way
of thinking that conflicts with the desires

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.929
of the heart.

00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:47.840
And, that's also being institutionalized.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:23:00.360
[pause] In our consciousness, we are already
moving toward I call it the age of reunion,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:11.780
a culmination and turning of separation.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:17.120
So our consciousness is moving on already,
and we're experiencing ourselves as connected

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.419
in various ways.

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:22.540
And we're wanting to live from that experience
of connection.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:28.540
But we still live in a society that's full
of structures like the money system, for example,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.820
that are built on separation, and that enforce
separation.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.250
Which is why, so often, you might experience
conflict between what's the most profitable

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.390
and what you really yearn to do.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:50.830
[pause] Which isn't to say that there are
not things that you yearn to do that will

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.030
bring you money.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.040
But often, you feel that there's a compromise.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:05.929
And why is it that, so often, that the choice
that doesn't feel as good is the choice where

00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:06.970
there's more money?

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:07.970
Why is that?

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:15.470
It's because money is not yet aligned with
the understanding of connection.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:23.500
[pause]
Another aspect of this transition on the species

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:33.070
level [pause] [several voices in background]
is--.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.990
It's a transition in what you could call the
story of the people.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.980
The answers to the questions "Why are we here
as a species?

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.140
What's the purpose of human beings on earth?

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.730
What kind of animal are we, anyway?"

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:52.350
The old answer was that we are here to conquer
nature, to rise above nature, to transcend

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.760
nature, to become "as lords and masters."

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:04.840
So, for example, we would say that we started
off as these naked and helpless animals having

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:12.100
only superstition instead of science, having
ritual instead of technology.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:19.420
But thanks to our big brains, we transcended
that and progressively became the masters

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.460
of nature, harnessed natural forces, transcended
one limitation after another, changed the

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:31.610
course of rivers, built skyscrapers, off into
space, and conquered all of these diseases.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:37.919
And some day, according to this story, our
conquest will be complete.

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:41.160
In physics, we will call it the theory of
everything.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:47.410
That will enable us to manipulate the material
world without [inaudible].

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:53.150
In technology, it'll be whatever the latest
thing is.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.760
Nanotechnology that will extend our control
down to the molecular level, and we'll go

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.330
off into space at the same time.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.740
And, you know, live in this Jetsons' world.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.450
And this is, again, there's a future that's
becoming obsolete.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:11.100
And we're understanding that our domination
of nature has been an illusion the whole time,

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:18.510
that we're actually dependent on nature, that
we cannot rise above nature, and that there's

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:24.039
something that's really not working about
this vision of, "We're going to have synthetic

00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:30.110
food and machine body parts and upload our
consciousness into computers and become immortal,

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.260
even transcend death."

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.780
Like, that feels a bit obsolete now.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:39.790
We want to reconnect to nature, and we're
seeing the damage that our technological program

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.820
has caused.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.890
And we understand, now.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:49.970
It's not that we want to abandon technology,
but we want to turn it toward a different

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:50.970
purpose.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:55.900
So I'm going to just, I'm going to have to
give a really abbreviated version of this.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:01.059
[women laugh in background] But we're moving
toward a new story of people which is, you

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:07.720
could say, it's co-creative partnership and
love with the planet.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:17.480
And I'd like,OK, so I've read about what money
would look like if it reflected these new

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.320
understandings.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:25.179
And I'm not going to go into the details too
much, but some of the basic pieces include

00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:29.260
internalizing costs.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.790
And I'm not even sure how many of you are
economic geeks and things like that.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.860
Some of you are and some of you aren't.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.950
So really quick.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.000
Internalizing external costs.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.730
Creating a money system based on negative
interest, decaying money.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:50.150
No longer creating interest-bearing debt.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.150
Localization.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.890
Reclaiming the commons.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.640
Disintermediation.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.130
Gift economics.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:06.480
And a lot of this is happening on the internet
in various ways, especially gift economics.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.380
And certainly, Google is part of that.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:19.340
Because internet search and internet generally
facilitate ways that people can do things

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:25.070
for themselves and each other that used to
be mediated by money, but are no longer.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:31.320
[pause] [voices in background]
I suppose I should probably give examples

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.450
of that.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:37.580
Stuff like-- Nah, examples are tiring, and
you guys know about this stuff.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.580
Disintermediation.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.580
Does that ring a bell?

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.580
Right?

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.470
And collaborative creation.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:48.299
And the dissemination of culture.

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:51.409
Stuff that people once paid for and don't
pay for anymore.

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:54.370
YouTube content, for example.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:29:05.500
[pause] [people talking, bell dinging in background]
Let me think what the other questions were.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:16.170
[pause] Really, what I want to speak to is
the sense that there is a "there" there.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:33.610
[pause] And [pause] I wonder how long I'd
have to be quiet before people get uncomfortable.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:41.559
[laughter] [pause] Okay. [pause] I'll talk
about--.

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:47.481
Actually, you know what I'm going to do?

00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:50.270
I'm just going to pause and bring in a question
right now.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.410
So someone, yeah.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.100
Let's have a little Q&amp;A.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.400
&gt;&gt;Female #2: So what does "there" look like?

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.620
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: What does "there" look like?

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.310
[sighs] Okay. [chuckles] All right.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:10.220
So I look around, I study all kinds of things,
from permaculture to holistic medicine to

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:21.960
alternative economics, alternative currency
systems, and [clinking sound] also technology

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:30.750
things, collaborative [pause] co-creation,
cloud computing even.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:38.480
And they all bear something in common, which
is that they're all coming from a new story

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.350
of people and a new story of itself.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:49.010
They're all somehow partaking in an understanding
of our connectedness.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:56.950
So, for example, traditional, technological
medicine is about command and control.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:02.610
[woman coughs] It's about killing viruses,
killing bacteria, cutting out body parts,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.320
controlling hormone levels.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:11.160
And it works by controlling, posing our real
conquering nature.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:23.740
Whereas a lot of the holistic modalities are
about liberating the body's self-healing mechanisms,

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.350
cooperating with the natural tendency toward
wholeness.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:32.360
Or, say something like homeopathy, finding
a material substance in the universe that

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:39.260
mirrors the internal condition, and establishing
a communication with something in the universe.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.620
Or something about some of these new water
technologies, which might be a little bit

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:52.070
"woowoo", but, you know, they're about how
water remembers everything that's happened

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.330
to it.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:32:02.570
People don't quite understand how, but it's
this universal solvent, not just for materials,

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:06.200
but for every kind of influence.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.900
And the body's made of water, and so.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:15.350
Right, so it's all based on this interconnectedness.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:26.450
[pause]
In, I'd say, you can map that onto what is

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.730
happening with the internet, too.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:35.330
Which, [bell dings] on the one hand, it's
kinda like the very pinnacle of separation.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:39.960
Can you imagine people being more separate
than everybody sitting in their own little

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:47.220
box, never actually touching another person,
never actually hearing another person's breath,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.919
or only hearing a representation of it.

00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:53.580
Like, on the one hand, it takes separation
to its extreme.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:00.900
But on the other hand, it's creating connections
again.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:11.840
And so it's part of the expansion of our separate
selves to include more and more and more other

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.870
beings.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:22.140
[pause] Or even non-hierarchical ways of management.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:27.300
Like, again, the old model is command and
control from the center.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.650
The new model is emergence.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:40.200
It's something that you cannot even predict
emerges from the interactions of the parts.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.840
So that's a link.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.190
So what does it look like?

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.679
Okay, let me just mention permaculture, too.

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:57.000
You know, where traditional agriculture is
that you impose a design onto this inert substrate

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.220
and standardize the inputs, standardize the
outputs, and eliminate as many variables as

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.220
possible.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:14.399
Whereas permaculture seeks out what wants
to happen and cooperates with that.

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:19.369
So it's not a separate external agency.

00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:24.450
So I'm trying to link all of these things
together.

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.040
So what looks like--.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:34.700
You know, [pause] on the one hand [pause]--
I don't know if-- How many of you are familiar

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:40.830
with this idea of technological utopianism,
that says technology is going to deliver us

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.460
from all of our problems?

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:48.710
Of course, all our problems were created by
technology in the first place, so it's an

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:55.669
indicative process where you use technology
to fix the problems that were caused by previous

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:56.669
technology.

00:34:56.669 --> 00:35:01.060
And, of course, we've always had all of the
technology that we need to live really beautifully

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.060
on this planet.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.620
We're just not using it that way.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:15.830
[pause] But that technology to live beautifully
on the planet, it exists.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.700
And it's waiting for us to choose it.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:27.080
So when I envision what could be, when I envision
a more beautiful world, it includes all of

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:33.510
these technologies that are just waiting in
the wings, like permaculture, like holistic

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.670
medicine, like clean energy technologies,
and social technologies as well.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.950
Things like nonviolent communication, direct
democracy.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:44.420
I almost hesitate to list them all because
they become almost a cliché.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:51.359
[background noise of voices and thumps] And
they trigger this frustration and almost a

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:55.359
sense of helplessness because the solutions
have been around for decades, now, some of

00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:56.359
them.

00:35:56.359 --> 00:35:57.450
But the global--.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.480
Like, climate change was becoming apparent
in 1972.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.150
This was going to happen.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.680
And the environmental crisis was apparent
in the '60s.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.160
And we're still going full steam ahead.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.070
Why is that?

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:19.570
[pause]
Someone ask me something else.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:22.730
[pause] Yeah.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:31.420
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Is there an overall definition
of what "there" is, encompass some sort of

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.220
base level of material plenty?

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.220
That's a sorta universal.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:40.251
Yeah, and what if that material, at that base
level isn't something that can be sustainable

00:36:40.251 --> 00:36:41.251
[inaudible], I don't get that.

00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:42.251
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Yeah.

00:36:42.251 --> 00:36:43.251
Yeah, this is a key issue: abundance.

00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:44.680
Right?

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:53.770
[sighs] One of the important realizations
that I had is that our current scarcity is

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.880
not inherent in the world, but it's an artifact
of our system.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:03.850
So, for example, there are several billion
people now who go to bed hungry.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:08.900
A billion or two every night of people in
this world are going to bed hungry.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.010
Is that because there's not enough food?

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.010
It's not.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.810
It's because of the way food is distributed.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.880
Half the world wastes enough to feed the other
half.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.970
And even our agricultural system is incredibly
wasteful.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:29.420
Like, people say sometimes, "Well, peak oil
is going to mean food crisis because you can't

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.339
possibly grow this much food without petrol
chemical influence."

00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:40.800
But in fact, permaculture farming-- even just
normal organic agriculture, but especially

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:48.760
permaculture-- can produce way, way, way more
food per acre of cultivation, but less food

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.690
per unit of labor.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:57.030
But fundamentally, we could grow easily twice
the amount of food that we do today in a way

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.849
that we generate soil and not mine the soil.

00:38:00.849 --> 00:38:03.910
So our scarcity--.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:08.000
That's one example of this artificial scarcity.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.410
The prime example, of course, is the artificial
scarcity of money, because when it's created

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.482
as interest-bearing debt, in any moment in
time, there's always more debt than there

00:38:18.482 --> 00:38:22.190
is money, because it's created as lending.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.190
And people--.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:28.730
I don't know how people understand exactly
how this works, but when a bank makes a loan,

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:30.990
it lends money into existence by doing that.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.710
It doesn't transfer money from somewhere else,
but it creates, essentially, new money.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.910
But it creates even more debt [woman coughs]
than it created money.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:40.780
Because money's created as debt.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.310
There's interest on that loan.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:48.860
So because all money is created like this,
everybody, on some level, is always in competition

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.990
with each other for never enough money.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:58.980
The only way that the debts can get paid is
if even more money is created as they come

00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.980
due.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.120
But that even more money comes with even more
debt.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.960
And how does that get paid?

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.010
More money has to get created.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.380
So there's never enough money, so we're always
in competition with each other.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:18.260
And that competition drives us to create goods
and services that we sell to get that money

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.750
to pay the debts.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:24.140
And it works okay as long as there's new goods
and services to constantly create.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.430
But today, we're running into a limit to that.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.190
The end of growth, you could call it.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:39.320
And it's not only because the ecosphere can't
support more, you know, more clear cuts, more

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:46.320
fishing, more oil drilling, more fracking,
more everything, more discharge of waste.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.390
It's not only because of that.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:54.400
It's also because our society can't sustain
a whole lot more of converting relationships

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.400
into paid services.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:07.869
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Do you think that's why it seems
like [inaudible] will get Farmville and games

00:40:07.869 --> 00:40:11.060
where you actually pay money for things that
don't even exist?

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.060
[inaudible]

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.060
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Yeah.

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.060
Yeah.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.849
[pause] See, Farmville is interesting.

00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:21.540
I mean, that's another example of artificial
scarcity.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:31.339
[chair scraping] When you buy these virtual
goods, it doesn't cost anything to make them.

00:40:31.339 --> 00:40:32.339
Right?

00:40:32.339 --> 00:40:36.010
The only way to have a price for them is to
make them artificially scarce.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:40.290
The same thing is true of all virtual content,
all digital content.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:50.160
Like it wouldn't cost Microsoft any more to
make a billion copies of Office than it costs

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.800
them to make one copy.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.510
The marginal cost is zero.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:59.610
Which, if you plug it into an economics equation,
it will drive the natural price point down

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:00.610
to zero, too.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:07.170
So this is another good example of artificial
scarcity in the midst of fundamental abundance.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.570
And this is a real--.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:14.130
This is, I think, the biggest issue around
the economics of the internet.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:20.510
How do you monetize something that is fundamentally
abundant?

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.040
[pause] Yes.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:32.400
So basically, one thing the internet is showing
us and inducing in our consciousness is the

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:38.800
reality of abundance, because--.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.800
And it's kinda like--.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:47.170
It's doing it for digital goods, but it's
showing us something that's true more broadly,

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:48.170
too.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:52.140
That we live on an incredibly abundant planet,
and that--.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:57.800
Like, yeah, there is a physical limit, of
course, to how much oil [clicks in background]

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:05.609
we can burn or something like that, but fundamentally,
there is no reason to have the experience

00:42:05.609 --> 00:42:09.030
of scarcity that most of the planet has.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.880
Even millionaires have the experience of scarcity.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:19.200
They did this study where they took several
hundred people with a net worth of $25 million

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.360
or more.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.630
And they polled them: do you have financial
security?

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:29.180
And the majority said no.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:34.310
Pretty much the same percentage said no as
people who make $50,000 a year.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.160
They said no.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:42.230
And they said, "Well, how much would you have
to have to really have financial security?"

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:48.720
And on average, they named a number 25% more
than their current net worth.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:54.660
[pause]
The scarcity that we experience is a matter

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.450
of our perceptions.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:01.670
And our perceptions are, in part, created
by the money system.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:06.640
Because at bottom, in our money system, there
is never enough.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:14.140
But this is changing, because the money system
is falling apart [elevator dings] and because

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.820
we're getting signals, experiences of abundance
from many corners.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:25.369
And the internet would be one, where things
that we had to pay for a generation ago, we

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.940
don't have to pay for anymore.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.220
Music, for example.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:39.910
It may be somewhat illegal to download my
music from YouTube with one of those semi-official

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:44.300
programs, but you know, you don't have to
pay.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:50.400
People don't spend nearly as much on "content",
as it's called.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.510
And this is only accelerating, this trend.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.130
We're having experiences.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.380
That would be a technological experience of
abundance, but we're also having spiritual

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.790
experiences of abundance.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:04.970
And they happen more and more as things fall
apart.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.830
As the economy falls apart, people lose their
jobs.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:12.390
As people's health falls apart, as people's
relationships fall apart.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:22.099
And we enter this [pause] in between space,
this crisis space and then this in between

00:44:22.099 --> 00:44:33.310
space, where all of the old belief systems
that carried us don't make sense anymore.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:42.510
And we don't have, really, as much of a filter,
that much of a map.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.600
And we get an experience, a more direct experience,
of reality.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:57.070
I'm not sure if you know what I'm talking
about, but in various ways, the reality of

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:58.070
abundance--.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.730
And this coexists with scarcity like we've
never seen it.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.041
A whole society, the richest society in the
world, and everybody's anxious.

00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:06.041
Not even with good reason.

00:45:06.041 --> 00:45:11.190
And then you go to Third World countries,
and people are anxious for good reasons.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:15.560
And strangely enough, often less anxious than
we are here.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:19.810
[pause]
Yeah.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:36.823
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So how do you move from a [inaudible]
type of commission to a, let's say [inaudible]type

00:45:36.823 --> 00:45:37.823
of commission without doing a whole bunch
of-- [inaudible]Because you can make 400 bucks

00:45:37.823 --> 00:45:38.823
out of 100, pretty much without any consequences,
without [inaudible].

00:45:38.823 --> 00:45:39.823
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Right.

00:45:39.823 --> 00:45:40.829
So how does a transition happen when there
are certain-- there's a certain of very, very

00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:44.420
small minority of people who are profiting
off the way things are.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:50.480
I don't think it happens without a systemic
collapse, really.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.200
Which is usually how major change happens.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.560
On a personal level, it's how it happens.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.390
It's how it happens in my life.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:01.859
I don't usually make any big changes until
I hit a wall.

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:02.859
Right?

00:46:02.859 --> 00:46:11.590
I burn out or have a health crisis or a marital
crisis or a teenager crisis or an employment,

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.010
a money crisis.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:20.020
Something happens and no matter how hard I've
tried to hold on, I can't do it anymore.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:26.050
So I think that that has to happen on a systemic
level before we're ready for something really

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.060
new.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:34.840
And so you mentioned Silvio Gesell, and practically
speaking, I think that what'll have to happen

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.310
is there'll have to be a major, major financial
breakdown, like almost happened in 2008.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.310
And a need for massive bailouts.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:49.480
And then the massive bailouts can be done
with negative interest currency.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.480
But yeah.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.320
It's going to take something pretty profound.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.750
[pause] How profound?

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.950
That's an open question.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:04.770
You know, it's kinda like asking, "How far
down does the alcoholic have to go before

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.790
he's hit bottom and stops drinking?"

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:12.680
For some people, they have to go all the way
to the bottom and be on their deathbed.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.530
For others, it's not quite as--.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:21.230
You know, maybe the first time they go to
jail, or when their wife runs off, or when

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:22.230
they--

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.790
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Some people just die.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.790
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Yeah, and some people die.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.940
And I like to think that on their deathbed,
they finally give up drinking.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.570
[laughter] Or that moment of transition.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:34.250
That couldn't happen to us.

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:39.260
I think that we have three chances to make
this transition.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:43.050
The first chance was in the 1960s, and we
could have made it very smoothly then, because

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:48.240
that's when we first caught that glimpse of
the more beautiful world that is possible.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.210
Hippies got it, you know.

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.210
They saw something real.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.410
The second chance is right now.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.730
And we can still make this transition.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.460
But it's not going to be easy.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.980
[elevator dings in background] It's going
to be bumpy.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:09.140
But still, it doesn't require billions of
casualties, because even--.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:18.250
And I say this [pause] knowing very well how
severe the crisis is, how bad it is, how many

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:22.370
undocumented nuclear waste burial sites [dings
in background] there are that are so secret

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.890
that not even the government knows where they
are.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:26.690
And they're all just about to start leaking.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.220
Stuff like that, you know.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.690
Acidification of the oceans.

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:39.300
I mean, there's some really, really serious
problems that are barely talked about.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:44.360
Or just the legacy of violence that is endemic
to our society.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.100
One out of three children having suffered
abuse.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:57.280
Or all the people in the Middle East who have
witnessed their loved ones dying by violence.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.480
And how realistic is it to expect that they're
not going to want revenge?

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:10.740
On every level, though, the amount of pain
that's in this world is so great that, on

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:18.210
every level, social, ecological, that it's
according to our conventional understanding

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.210
of what's possible.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.540
The transition is almost impossible.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:31.050
But fortunately, a lot more is possible than
we recognize today.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:34.109
So anyway, this is our second chance.

00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:39.119
Our third chance will come in about 30 or
40 years if we don't take this chance.

00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:44.670
And the third chance would accompany billions
of casualties, I think.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:48.390
Even today, we kinda need a miracle.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:49.920
But they exist.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.319
One topic I've been looking into is reversing
desertification.

00:49:53.319 --> 00:50:02.240
Like, there are people who have projects in
various deserts, even the Sahara, where they're

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:11.590
healing the land and growing things again
where there's been a desert for decades or

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:12.590
centuries.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:14.020
Or there's technologies that neutralize radioactive
waste, too.

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:20.810
They don't have to cart it off somewhere and
bury anything for the future.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:26.270
And there's technologies to heal pretty much
every curable disease you've ever heard of.

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:29.869
But they don't fit into the current medical
paradigm and they don't fit into the financial

00:50:29.869 --> 00:50:33.210
model that's built around the medical paradigm.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:35.930
[pause] [ coughs]
Excuse me.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:36.930
Yeah.

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:39.329
Anyone have another question?

00:50:39.329 --> 00:50:40.329
Yeah.

00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:46.130
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Why is it so hard to [inaudible]?

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:50.220
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: I'm sorry, why did what?

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:58.380
&gt;&gt;[Male #7]: To understand the idea of connectedness
and to experience it..

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:04.510
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Why is it so hard to experience
it.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:05.510
Yeah.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:12.380
I mean, we just [pause] we just internalized
so much of the logic of separation that it

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:22.120
takes a lot of time to develop new habits
of thought and new habits of being.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:27.170
And, you know, we're embedded in a society
that's built on separation, that pulls us

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:28.320
back into separation.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:34.500
Say you go to Burning Man or something like
that, or you have an experience of connection,

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.500
you know?

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.619
And you get it.

00:51:36.619 --> 00:51:37.619
Right?

00:51:37.619 --> 00:51:39.420
You understand, and it's so clear.

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:44.569
And maybe you even say, "Yeah, I'm going to
live without fear now.

00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:50.720
I'm going to be generous and not worry about
getting enough for me because I know it will

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.650
come back to me because of the interconnected
nature of reality."

00:51:54.650 --> 00:52:00.980
You might have that realization, but then
you go back into the quote "real world" that

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:06.050
contradicts that knowledge at every turn.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:12.030
And that connected state is not a place that
anybody can stay in by themselves.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:16.450
It's a place we can only stay in if we have
help from other people who stay there.

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:20.950
You could even say that enlightenment is a
group effort.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:25.849
So you go back there by yourself, and it pulls
you back.

00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:30.569
You take on the mindset of your environment.

00:52:30.569 --> 00:52:34.069
You start thinking in a certain way wherever
you are.

00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:40.900
Being in an office with cubicles, for example,
induces you to think in a certain way.

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:47.540
Being in a company with certain incentive
structures and certain expectations and ways

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:54.359
to do things-- You become a create of that,
inevitably.

00:52:54.359 --> 00:53:00.230
Fortunately, all of those institutions and
structures that pull us back into that mindset

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.230
fall apart.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:04.260
They don't feel quite as permanent anymore.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.520
They don't feel quite as real anymore.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.560
And we have this sense that, yeah, the world
is falling apart, so-- . And, at the same

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.960
time, we have more and more people who are
in various ways living from a connected state,

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:23.250
and so they can pull us the other way.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:28.550
And we can help each other remember what's
true.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:29.550
Does that answer?

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.550
Sorta.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:31.550
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Yeah.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:33.900
On a day to day level, how do you teach your
children to [inaudible]?

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:38.200
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: On a day to day level, the best
thing to do is to give people an experience

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:43.010
that doesn't fit into the logic of separation.

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:51.990
For example, I don't know if you've experienced
receiving generosity, receiving forgiveness,

00:53:51.990 --> 00:54:03.339
and it kinda softens, for me, it softens my
protective shell, and softens my suspicion.

00:54:03.339 --> 00:54:08.869
And it makes me willing to be more generous
and more forgiving as well.

00:54:08.869 --> 00:54:17.430
So whether it's my children or a complete
stranger, I'd like to say that to remember

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:22.839
to act in a way that doesn't fit into the
logic of separation.

00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:27.730
[keys jingle]
Last night, I was at [inaudible] in Venice.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:31.710
I don't know if any of you guys know him.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:37.640
He's created this organization called ServiceSpace
and they have these Smile Cards.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:46.190
And so the way you use the Smile Cards is
you go and you do some act of generosity or

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:53.930
you could go to, I don't know, McDonalds,
and pay for the next ten people.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:55:00.540
And so instead of getting charged money, they
get a Smile Card that says basically, "A stranger

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.800
has paid for your meal.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:07.339
Take this card, and when you do something
like this, pass the card on."

00:55:07.339 --> 00:55:13.230
So you receive something like that, and if
you're living in a world where it's dog eat

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:18.490
dog, and everybody's out for themselves and
you're in a bubble of suspicion and "I'm going

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:24.579
to have to protect me and mine" and something
like that happens to you, that doesn't fit.

00:55:24.579 --> 00:55:31.730
And it's basically an event that says, "The
universe isn't the way you thought it was."

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:36.990
[man coughs] So that's something that we can
all do for each other.

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:39.309
[pause] It could be anything.

00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:43.570
It could even be a little bit of connection.

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:50.050
Like at the airport the other day, it was
as simple as--.

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:58.790
There are theses kiosks, you know, where you
buy the $9 sandwiches and stuff.

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:09.230
And there's some poor lady with a wooden expression
on her face, handing out, collecting people's

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:16.460
money, standing at this cash register, collecting
people's money all day.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:23.000
So I just said, "Wow, you must be tired standing
here all day, huh?"

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
You know.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.920
Just like that little--.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.079
It's a tiny, tiny thing.

00:56:27.079 --> 00:56:30.410
I'm not saying I did a great thing or anything.

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:39.180
But that interaction gives a mini experience
of connection that doesn't fit into normalcy.

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:54.420
So that's the kind of thing that we can do
all the time.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.420
[pause]
Yeah.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:07.990
&gt;&gt;Male #8: You just mentioned that we need
to be able to sustain this minimum, correct?

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:10.780
This theory that there are not people which
[inaudible] is feeling hypocritical of us[inaudible].

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.040
They're so critical of us [inaudible].

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.089
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Yeah, I think so.

00:57:13.089 --> 00:57:14.140
And that's what I'm experiencing.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:23.809
You know, for a long time, it was a very lonely
thing to live in a way that violated the rules

00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:26.359
of the separate self.

00:57:26.359 --> 00:57:33.069
So, for example, to major in something that
was not practical but that you were really

00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:34.830
passionate about.

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:42.700
Or to quit a job that had a lot of security
and to take a leap into something that you

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:47.369
really care about that had no security, and
your parents were really worried about you.

00:57:47.369 --> 00:57:49.859
You know.

00:57:49.859 --> 00:57:52.349
Or--.

00:57:52.349 --> 00:58:01.859
[pause] You know, I think anything that violated
the rule of maximizing your [someone sneezes]

00:58:01.859 --> 00:58:06.369
financial self-interest seemed a little crazy.

00:58:06.369 --> 00:58:07.369
But--.

00:58:07.369 --> 00:58:12.099
And everybody around you, they weren't doing
that.

00:58:12.099 --> 00:58:18.780
But today, it no longer seems so crazy, for
me, because there's so many people around

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:23.130
me who are doing the same thing, and thinking
in the same way.

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.480
And I do feel like it's reached critical mass,
actually.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:33.440
But it's still a slow process.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:44.200
There's still, it still needs to unfold more.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.200
[pause] It's probably 2 ish now.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.200
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Yeah.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200
&gt;&gt;Male #9: One more question?

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.200
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: One more question?

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.200
Yeah.

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:54.010
&gt;&gt;Male #9: You said a little while ago that
the world was falling apart.

00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:55.010
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Yeah.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:58.970
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Evidently, it's been falling apart
since it began.

00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:59.970
&gt;&gt;Eisenstein: Right.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.859
Yeah, the world's falling apart.

00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:07.069
Really, what's accurate to say is that it's
becoming impossible to pretend that it isn't

00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:08.069
falling apart.

00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:13.160
Like, up until recently, you could still pretend
that things were fine, with just a little

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.930
bit of self-deception.

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:21.280
You live in your little enclave, you know,
you read just the right mainstream media,

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:28.670
you know, and you categorize various environmental
problems as a little glitch in the machine

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:31.390
that's going to be fixed with a technical
solution.

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:37.859
And social problems, well, you know, the Great
Society of Lyndon Johnson is going to fix

00:59:37.859 --> 00:59:38.859
that.

00:59:38.859 --> 00:59:40.960
We're working on that, and better education.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:46.840
You can still pretend that humanity or our
society is on the right track.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:52.590
But today, the amount of self-delusion required
to do that is becoming unsupportable for more

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:53.590
and more people.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:57.700
So it's a subjective thing, I guess, the world
falling apart.

00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.790
All right.

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:00.830
Yes.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.390
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So thank you.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:08.770
I want to thank Charles for bringing some
of his wisdom and insights to the Google campus

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:09.770
today.

01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.771
[applause]
