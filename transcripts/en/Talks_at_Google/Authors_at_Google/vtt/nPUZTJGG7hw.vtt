00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.030
JAMIE JONES: Hi, everyone.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.970
I'm Jamie, Jamie Jones and I'm
a professor in Earth System

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.800
Science at Stanford.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
I'm actually trained
as an anthropologist,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.824
but I sit in the School
of Earth, Energy,

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:23.865
and the Environment at
Stanford in the Department

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:25.650
of Earth System Science.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.450
So today I'm going to talk to
you about some recent interest

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.200
I've had in applying
evolutionary and ecological

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
ideas to economics
and decision theory.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.500
This interest was
piqued by my attempt

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.410
to understand the peculiarities
of the human life cycle,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.320
and our life cycles are really
peculiar, I can assure you.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.540
In a broad, comparative context,
they're really kind of weird.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.200
And to understand the reason
people in subsistence economies

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.260
pursue particular
types of resources--

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.810
prey and forage food
and that sort of thing.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.569
And so I'm going to guide
you through a big picture

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.140
view of some fairly
technical fields today

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
that include population
biology, decision theory,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.850
a bit of economics, both
classical and behavioral.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.490
But I think the ultimate message
is pretty straightforward,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.520
and the thing that's sort of
broad picture that motivates me

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.330
is understanding how
something like this, which

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
is an artist's reconstruction
of "Australopithecus

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.120
afarensis," which is
essentially a one-meter tall

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.000
chimpanzee-like thing
that walked upright.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.660
It's got a 300-cubic
centimeter brain,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.310
so about a quarter
of the size of--

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.710
maybe a little less than
a contemporary human.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.720
Very sexually
dimorphic-- the males

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.790
are much bigger
than the females.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.450
They had enormous cheek teeth
from eating a very tough diet,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.160
and as I said,
they're really tiny.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.790
These guys lived about 3
and 1/2 million years ago

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.730
in East Africa, and
transition in this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.412
probably doesn't look that
different, I guess, but it is.

00:02:11.412 --> 00:02:12.620
It's fundamentally different.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.740
In about 1 and 1/2,
1.8 million years ago.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.020
And this critter, called "Homo
regaster," for my purposes,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.310
is effectively modern.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.150
You've got a large body size,
so within the normal range

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.060
of contemporary human variation.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.390
You've got body proportions that
looked very much like people

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.070
living in the tropics today.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.280
You've got a great reduction
in sexual size dimorphism,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.550
so that males and females are
similarly proportioned to how

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.590
they are today
relative to each other,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.750
and you've got big brains.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.500
They're not-- they're
smaller than modern,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.920
but they're actually within
the range of variation--

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.990
on the low end of variation
of contemporary humans.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.810
"Homo regaster," sometimes
called "African Homo erectus,"

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.650
is the first of our
family to leave Africa

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.830
and to colonize the
rest of the world.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.960
And it did so around
1.8 million years ago,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.330
give or take a little bit.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.730
And so my question is, how is
it that a population of bipedal

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.230
apes-- you know, they're not
very impressive looking, right?

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.360
Kind of like we aren't, right?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.900
We don't have big weapons.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.540
We don't have antlers or horns.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.720
We don't have big teeth.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.500
We don't have this sort
of ferocity built into us.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.600
We have some cleverness, maybe.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.800
But how is it that in
less than 2 million years,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.870
which is a very rapid period
of time in the broader span

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.830
of evolution-- how is it that we
went from this small population

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.810
of African apes--

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.970
bipedal apes-- and have grown
to a size of 7 billion souls

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.530
in, as I say less than
1.8 million years?

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.060
And we've colonized and
come to dominate nearly

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.755
every terrestrial biomome.

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:03.430
This is just a picture of making
the desert green in the Arabian

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.760
Peninsula as a sort of indicator
of the extent to which we

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.150
really dominate the world.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.030
30% to 40% of net
primary productivity

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.700
is captured by human
actions, right?

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.339
So the phenomenal
growth of our species

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.800
in this very short
period of time

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.510
suggests that our
ancestors on average

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.610
must have made pretty
good decisions, right?

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.490
Because the decisions
they made led

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.320
them to increase in
pretty great numbers.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.240
But there's a torrent
of work in psychology

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.080
and economics, represented by
just a few sample publications

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.580
here of semi-popular
trade books,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.680
suggest that the decision-making
software that our brains run,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.060
which is presumably essential
to our ecological domination,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.430
is profoundly flawed.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.500
That in a word,
we're irrational.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.760
How is it possible that a
species apparently so defective

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.200
in its ability to
generate sound decisions

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.840
can be so incredibly
evolutionarily successful?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.190
I'll just say as a
relative outsider,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.800
I'll make this observation about
this particular body of work

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.530
that I'm discussing
here in this slide.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.510
There are lots of
anomalies, like we

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.910
see these things
that don't make sense

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.220
from the way we sort of
think about the way people

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.140
should make decisions, and you
can write whole books on this--

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.650
lots of books on this.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.110
But they're generally
unconnected,

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.990
and the whole area seems
to lack a unifying theory.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.750
I'm going to humbly submit that
I think that evolution can help

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.050
us provide some of the
theory that brings together

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.480
some of these anomalies.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.500
There's a tendency, in
particular, like in the Ted

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.840
Talks where there's
real selection for being

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.306
provocative, to
suggest that people

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.680
are irrational
because they don't

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.270
follow the rules of formal or
axiomatic rationality theory.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.670
However, every economic
decision entails an optimization

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.460
problem, and I feel
like I'm on safe ground

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.650
when I'm at Google talking
about optimization problems.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.572
That if you want to solve
an optimization problem,

00:06:05.572 --> 00:06:06.280
what do you need?

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.080
Well, you need to know
who's doing the optimizing.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.538
You need to know
the actor, but you

00:06:09.538 --> 00:06:11.790
need to know the
objective function, right?

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.400
And if you get the
objective function wrong,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.860
you're going to get
the solution wrong.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.610
And it doesn't matter what
your optimization problem is.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.310
It could be an
engineering problem,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.030
it could be a portfolio design--
an investment portfolio design.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.390
It could be about getting the
best mixture of wild foods

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.460
to ensure growth and survival.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.830
But you need to get the
objective function right,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.130
and I'm going to suggest
that in general, we

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.460
don't have a very solid
understanding of what

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.500
the objective function
is that people

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.020
are using when they're making
economic decisions broadly.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.340
OK, and their results
appear anomalous.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.560
When you use the wrong
objective function,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.570
you get the wrong
answer, and I think

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.790
that evolution helps weave
together theoretically

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.115
what are otherwise a series
of unconnected anomalies.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.624
So we lack this
coherence, and I think

00:07:06.624 --> 00:07:08.540
these may be brought
together if we understand

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.240
what sort of problems the
human brain is actually

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.110
designed to solve.

00:07:14.632 --> 00:07:16.965
Get the right objective
function and you have a chance--

00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:17.830
a chance.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.680
I'm not 100% convinced of this.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.370
This is fairly new
for me, but I feel

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.240
like there's a real chance
that we can begin to understand

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.060
the broader theory of choice.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.810
So the two things that
we really need, I think,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.720
are evolutionary theory, which
guides our choice of what's

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.560
being optimized.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.650
It gives us a clue as to what
the likely objective function

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.580
that our brains are designed
to solve, or to optimize.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.650
And secondly, it's
really important

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.122
that we get broad
comparative data

00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:51.830
to help us understand
the conditions that

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.060
favor your decision-making.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.150
It turns out that
different groups of people

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.880
make more or less
good decisions, right?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.220
It's not everybody
who's a complete idiot

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:06.200
and behaves irrationally,
and we sort of

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.840
limit ourselves a lot
in the sort of people

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.590
that we inquire about
decision-making.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.040
I'm going to focus primarily
on the evolutionary theory

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.960
and give you just some
hints of some work

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.120
that we've done
without getting bogged

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.250
down in the technical
details, but I

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.570
think that the comparative data
is really important, as well.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.250
I'm going to use
this word "fitness."

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.909
I'm going to use it a lot,
and evolutionary success

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:34.159
is determined by fitness,
and the problem with fitness

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.370
is it's one of these
super-fraught terms that

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.960
has lots of
colloquial meanings--

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.630
that can kind of interfere
with our rigorous understanding

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.169
and analysis of it.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.216
So when I talk
about fitness, I'm

00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:47.840
talking about the
relative contribution

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.200
that an individual makes
to future populations.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.180
So if you have some
heritable trait,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.859
whether it's anatomical or
physiological or behavioral,

00:08:56.859 --> 00:08:59.150
marginally increasing the
representation of its bearers

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.890
and future generations,
the population

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.140
is going to evolve
towards that trait.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.090
This is the fundamental
logic of selection,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.930
and fitness is the evolutionary
objective function.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.020
It is the subject of
evolutionary optimization,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.330
so just wanted to get
that out of the way.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:22.370
I'm going to give you a
quick preview of the approach

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:28.130
that we use in thinking
about this more formally.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.210
The organs that make
our economic decisions--

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.320
they're organs, just
like our liver is, just

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320
like our heart is.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.130
Presumably these have been
under intense selection,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.130
and part of the reason--
just as an aside-- part

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.120
of the reason we think
that brains should

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.160
be under intense
selection is not just

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.310
because they're useful, but
because they're super costly,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.060
right?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.850
The brain is an incredibly
costly thing to carry around.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.870
It entails mortality
costs for mothers,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.090
because if we've got the
cephalopelvic disproportion,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.080
big brains have to come
through a limited pelvic cavity

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.390
when they're born.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.670
Brains use 20% of
oxygen at rest.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.262
They're super costly.

00:10:06.262 --> 00:10:07.970
The fact that they
exist and that they've

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.920
gotten bigger over time
suggests that there's

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.190
a reason they're there, right?

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.960
So people with good
decision-making capabilities

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.835
presumably, in
the past, resulted

00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:23.210
in leaving more descendants
and became disproportionately

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.280
represented in the population.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.180
To the extent that economic
decisions affect fitness,

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.150
we should expect outcomes to
track fitness interests more

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:37.940
than some arbitrarily defined
standard of formal rationality.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.822
So let me just walk you through
a little bit of the logic here

00:10:41.822 --> 00:10:44.030
of the model, and then I'm
going to move away from it

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.870
and go onto talking
about some features

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.300
of the human
evolutionary environment.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.380
So it's a hierarchical model.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.450
At the bottom, we have
economic decisions.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.109
These are about the sort
of things you hunt for,

00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:02.150
the sort of things you
put in your market basket,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.820
the decisions you're making
on a day-to-day basis

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.550
about your livelihood, and these
feed into what we think of as

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.680
like proximate motivators.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.590
These are the things that
you're sort of striving

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.860
for in a proximate way--

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.150
happiness or sexual
gratification or satiety--

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.790
the things that motivate
you to eat or to have sex

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.040
or to do things that are
meaningful in your life.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.920
But these, then presumably
have an impact on fitness,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.160
and we can think of fitness
here as an aggregator--

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.250
something that aggregates and
averages over these different--

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.500
uh, my pointer doesn't work--

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.990
these different
goals which are fed

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.290
into by these
economic decisions.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.820
So that's a preview of the type
of reasoning that we're using.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.920
I'll come back to
this in a little bit,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.420
but I do want to
mention-- you know,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.010
I said that the two
things that we need--

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.510
I think we need
evolutionary theory.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.940
I think we also need
broad comparative data

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.670
on the decision-making of actual
people, and particularly people

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.990
who are good at making decisions
under tremendous constraints,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.390
and this is just a selection
of a bunch of people.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.780
They've written some
books, and it turns out

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.330
that, somewhat to
the surprise of much

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:26.150
of the institution of studying
economic decision-making,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.290
that poor people often make
incredibly savvy decisions.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.050
They face enormous constraints,
but when you adjust for that--

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.870
when you control for the fact
that their constraint set is

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.190
very limited--

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.930
that their strategy
set is very limited

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.420
and they're under
tremendous constraint--

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.510
poor people tend to make
very good decisions, in part

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.809
because it really
matters to them.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.350
And so I'm going to
leave that-- this

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.190
is another big part of the
broader work that I'm doing,

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:58.640
but I want to focus on
more of the evolution part.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.800
The economic decisions I'm
going to talk about and show

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.460
you some pictures of typically
center on subsistence

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.090
populations, and the things
look a little exotic.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.790
But the sorts of decisions
that people make in subsistence

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.520
economies are fundamentally
no different than the types

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.540
of decisions that we
make on a regular basis.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.027
How do you fill your market
basket, given a fixed budget?

00:13:23.027 --> 00:13:23.860
It may not be money.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.230
It may be time.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.940
It may be political capital,
but you're doing very much

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.540
the same sort of thing.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.490
And basically, my
argument is that we

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.190
have to think about humans
as biological entities.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.430
We've been shaped
by selection, and

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.000
that our decision-making
capabilities have fundamentally

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.740
been shaped by this
evolutionary heritage.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.110
To a biological entity,
economic decisions

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.420
are not arbitrary
preference orderings,

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.070
which is sort of the
way you typically

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.530
will learn about them in
a microeconomics class,

00:13:58.530 --> 00:13:59.820
for example.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.314
It turns out that the rules
for a living organism--

00:14:02.314 --> 00:14:04.230
anchored in the present
and subject to a force

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.550
of selection-- that really
doesn't like extinction, right?

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.860
Fitness is a
multiplicative process.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.900
In order for your
lineage to persist,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.890
it has to persist
every generation.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:20.070
You can't get a zero in there
or it's an absorbing boundary,

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.849
so you really want
to avoid those zeros.

00:14:22.849 --> 00:14:24.390
I'll show that the
all-important need

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.870
to avoid extinction in a world
that's incompletely known

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.960
at best has profound
implications for preferences,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.100
utility, and rationality.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.770
And one of the key things I
think that comes out of this

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:42.090
is that ignoring the condition
of existential uncertainty--

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.940
by doing that, the theory
of rational decision-making

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.000
has developed a
distorted expectation

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.730
of how organisms working
in their own interest

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.440
should behave.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.410
OK, so a bunch of the
work I've done on this

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.170
is in collaboration
with my colleagues

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.270
Rebecca and Doug Bird.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.460
And just to give you a
sampling of the types

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.370
of economic decisions we
tend to think about, do you

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.044
hunt for goanna, which are
these monitor lizards that

00:15:09.044 --> 00:15:10.710
live in the desert
of Western Australia,

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.604
or do you a hunt
for hill kangaroo?

00:15:12.604 --> 00:15:13.770
There are different payoffs.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.870
There are different risks
associated with this.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.430
If you're a
subsistence farmer in--

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.100
this is in Uganda, another
place where I work,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.860
do you plant maize,
do you plant yams,

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.150
or do you forego subsistence
crops altogether and take

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.080
a stab at the cash economy?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.690
This is coffee.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.520
Working with a post-doc, Ashley
Hazel, in southern Africa

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.700
in Namibia, we're asking
the sort of questions--

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.040
how do people,
particularly women, manage

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.910
social relationships to
manage the extreme uncertainty

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.640
of living in
essentially a desert

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.460
and trying to raise cattle,
trying to raise crops,

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.210
trying to raise children,
trying to keep yourself going

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.620
in a very difficult environment.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.980
So these are the types
of economic decisions

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.830
that I tend to think
about, but as I say,

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.590
they're fundamentally no
different than going shopping,

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.450
buying a house-- doing
the sort of things

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.970
that economists tend to look at.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:17.640
The history of this for me goes
back to my former PhD student

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.490
Mike Price, who is now a
post-doc at the Santa Fe

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.940
Institute, and Mike was
interested in understanding

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.360
the origins of sago palm
farming in Southeast Asia.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.930
Sago palm-- it's
an amazing crop.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.460
It's one of the centers
of agricultural innovation

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.420
around New Guinea in
the South Pacific--

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.170
Southeast Asia.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.300
A single sago palm tree
will net literally millions

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.300
of calories in
starchy flour that you

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.630
can make into a gruel that's
very calorically dense.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.640
The catch is it takes
25 years for a sago palm

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.340
to develop to maturity
and to the point where

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.320
it can be harvested,
and trying to understand

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.900
the evolution of this
remarkable horticultural system

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.040
led us to think hard about
economic topics, such as time

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.540
and risk preferences and
economic decisions generally.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.020
It's hard to make a
standard economic model that

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.160
says, OK, forego the immediate
reward activities you're

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.730
pursuing right now and
go plant some sago palm,

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.970
and wait 25 years.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.370
That's a hard problem
to solve, but clearly it

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.970
happened at some point.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.092
So that's where all this
really started thinking,

00:17:35.092 --> 00:17:36.800
and Mike and I have
been working together

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.960
for a few years on this stuff.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.990
So a theme that
emerged in our work

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.170
is that a biological entity
trying to maximize fitness

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.520
will behave in ways
that often really mimic

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.610
the anomalies that you see
in this behavioral economics

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.500
and psychology literature.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.750
We weren't looking to show
that, but we found how--

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.640
people said hey, that kind
of looks like [INAUDIBLE] I

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.775
thought, really?

00:18:00.775 --> 00:18:02.210
That surprises me.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:07.580
So they'll do things like
use non-expected utility.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.800
I won't get into what
that necessarily means.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.420
After we'll talk about it later.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.890
They'll frequently violate
the axioms of rational choice.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:20.830
They'll seemingly have
inconsistent time preferences.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.310
And from the perspective
of an economic decision,

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.580
these may appear irrational,
but these behaviors

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.080
are the sort of
things that keep you

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.610
alive in a variable and
uncertain environment.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.190
So rather than the
mathematicians'

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.400
formal axiomatic
rationality, people

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.140
seem to use a
procedural rationality,

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.530
and this is a point that
the great polymath economist

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.410
Herbert Simon suggested
in his scissors metaphor,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.830
that trying to understand
decision-making

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.040
is like trying to understand
the way a pair of scissors work.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.870
You've got on the one hand,
the computational capacities,

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.700
but on the other hand, you've
got the task environment.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.950
Trying to understand the
computational capacities,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.297
like the logical
rules of cognition,

00:19:03.297 --> 00:19:04.880
without understanding
the environment,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.160
is like trying to understand
half a pair of scissors--

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.210
doesn't work very well.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.190
I said that there's selection
in Ted Talk-like environments

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.940
for saying provocative
things, and this is

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.750
a slightly provocative thing.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.230
Darwin's saying it.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.760
Economics isn't
actually a science.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.960
And this isn't
meant as a put-down.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.230
It's a statement
of fact, and it's

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.540
because the preferred
and overwhelmingly--

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.370
the dominant mode of economic
theory generation is axiomatic,

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.450
and that's not the way the
natural sciences proceed.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.540
Behavioral economics
and this great field

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.370
of experimental
developmental economics

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.060
has changed this by actually
measuring the way people behave

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.400
rather than specifying
the way that they're

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.950
expected to behave, but
I think there's still

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.230
a decent amount of baggage.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.930
What do I mean when
I say "axiomatic?"

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.060
Standard economic
theory generation

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.955
starts from a series of axioms--

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:03.080
primitive assumptions are
taken to be self-evident.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.790
Things like, you shouldn't
reverse your preferences.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.670
If you prefer A to
B and B to C, you

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.450
should prefer A to C. That's
an axiom of transitivity,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.920
and that makes total sense.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.170
But there's nothing that
guarantees that that's right.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.961
There's nothing that
guarantees that that's

00:20:16.961 --> 00:20:18.240
the way the universe works.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.220
It's just a logical rule that
we say, I can live with that.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.130
And so you take
these axioms, you

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.370
derive out the way you expect
a rational agent to behave,

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.390
and this is what economic
theory really is all about.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.300
It's normative.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.440
It describes how
actors should behave.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.280
Science, on the other
hand, is positive.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.780
It starts from observations
about the world

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.000
and attempts to explain them as
inferred through observed data.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.620
It's inductive.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.200
The theory plays the role
of generating hypotheses

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.440
which can then be confronted
with additional data.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.180
And so it's a common and
it's a well-stated critique

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.040
that neoclassical
economic theory describes

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.040
the behavior of a species
other than humans,

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.870
and it's referred
to tongue-in-cheek

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.527
by the fake Latin binomial,
"Homo oeconomicus."

00:21:07.527 --> 00:21:09.110
And while it's true
that humans do not

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.780
behave according to the
classical expectations,

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.970
or these neoclassical
expectations,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.890
the expectations weren't
designed to actually explain

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.590
observed behavior, so we
shouldn't be that surprised

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.850
by it, I think.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.440
So I'm going to
talk to you about--

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.900
right now for a
little bit about what

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.880
I think the really
important bits

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.220
of our human evolutionary legacy
are for understanding the way

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.500
we make decisions
about things, and I'm

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.850
going to dive down fairly deep
into my specialty area, which

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.440
is called life history theory.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.110
So I'm going to suggest
that humans are adapted

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:50.670
to environmental uncertainty,
and this is, I think,

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.780
a pretty telling graphic.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.500
So what I've got here is--
it's temperature proxy data,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.050
so this is inferred
temperature by a million years

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.120
before present, so we're
going from more ancient

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.941
to more recent.

00:22:01.941 --> 00:22:04.440
Humans are a product of what's
called the Pleistocene, which

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.800
is a geological epoch
that spans from about 1.8

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.334
million years ago to
about 10,000 years ago,

00:22:10.334 --> 00:22:12.000
and the two things
that should be really

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.544
obvious from this
plot are that one,

00:22:14.544 --> 00:22:16.710
the earth has cooled in the
last five million years.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.293
It's actually cooled
considerably more

00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:19.950
in the last 25 million years.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.120
It's cooled and it's
gotten more variable,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.110
and you can't actually
see it on here.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.310
We know that in places,
particularly in Africa

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.429
where there's been a
lot of interest in this,

00:22:32.429 --> 00:22:34.470
there's actually a decadal
scale variation here--

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.690
like enormous
environmental variation

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.620
going on that really gets
amplified in this period where

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.520
our genus emerged, which
is this pink line here.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.520
And just while I'm on the
subject of temperature--

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.440
global temperature--
you'll sometimes

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.420
see people say, well,
you know, the Earth

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.892
used to be much warmer.

00:22:52.892 --> 00:22:53.850
We can let it get warm.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.960
It will be fine.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.040
Maybe, sure.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.860
But we're a cold
planet species, right?

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.610
We are adapted to
a cooler planet.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.570
Just something to bear in mind.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.090
The origin story of
the human lineage,

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.010
and the genus "Homo"
in particular,

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:17.370
is a story of moving from a
primarily arboreal lifestyle

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.880
in tropical ever-moist forests--
this is a chimpanzee foraging

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.300
for-- you can see the fruits
up in the top of the picture

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.720
there in the Nyungwe
Forest in Rwanda.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.740
We moved from these
forests onto this sort

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.166
of mixed scrub savanna.

00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:35.040
This is a picture from
the Serengeti National

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.380
Park in Tanzania.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.590
And moving onto the
savanna entailed

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.560
a bunch of new challenges.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.120
There are big predators there.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.800
There are a lot of them.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.050
They're big and they're scary.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:56.140
But it also changes the
way food is distributed.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.000
Here's a picture of a chimpanzee
who was in the Kibale National

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.030
Park, and he's
looking down at me,

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.930
and he's got an enormous
pile of figs here.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.150
And this tree--

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.960
I don't want to exaggerate,
but it certainly

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.780
had tens of thousands of figs,
possibly hundreds of thousands,

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.500
possibly well into the
hundreds of thousands of figs.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.757
These tropical figs are
incredibly productive.

00:24:20.757 --> 00:24:22.340
They're asynchronous
breeders, so they

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.380
breed throughout the year.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.060
They fruit throughout the year.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.920
They're not really high quality.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.360
You wouldn't want to make
a Newton out of them.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.030
You're not going to
make figgy pudding

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.580
with these, because they
taste like crap, I assure you.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.450
But when there's no good
fruit in the forest,

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.230
chimps will happily
eat this, and this

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.550
is in general what
the great apes do.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.470
They fall back when their
preferred foods aren't there,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.250
onto this lower quality stuff,
and figs are a great thing

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.220
in any tropical forest.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.150
When you go out
into the savanna,

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.950
there isn't much fruit.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.070
What there are are
underground storage organs.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.100
So these are a bunch
of Hadza tubers

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.290
that my former post-doc
Brian Wood took a picture of,

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.050
and they look like
sticks, don't they?

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.540
Doesn't that look delicious?

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.630
Try to eat that and you're going
to spend like 12 hours just

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.410
chewing on it.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.470
Your jaws are going
to be so tired.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.490
You have to have fire,
basically, in order to--

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.490
you scorch them.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.500
You burn them and you
make them chewable.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.590
There's a lot of
stored starch in there,

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.450
and it makes for a
great fallback food,

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.120
but they're very
different than figs.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.140
They're widely distributed.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.660
They're not at all clumped.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.220
You're never going
to find a patch--

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.720
you know, just start digging.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.830
Oh, yeah, and you've
got to dig for them,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.580
because they're underground.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.320
But you've got to start digging.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.900
You're not going to find
100,000 tubers there, right,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.090
like you're going to find
100,000 figs in a tree.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.300
So you have to spread
out your effort.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:54.590
It changes the economics
of forging tremendously.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.000
And here's Brian, who
is one of the world

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.120
authorities on the Hadza
hunter-gatherers in Tanzania,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.930
and his hair really
is fascinating,

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.230
so he gets that a lot.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.370
He's now a professor
down at UCLA.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.620
So moving from the forests
to the savanna and beyond

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.400
increases the variability
in food intake,

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.470
because it's a
drier environment.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.257
It's a less-productive
environment.

00:26:19.257 --> 00:26:21.340
There are lots of opportunities
but there are also

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.870
lots of challenges.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.230
And while there's certainly
more meat on the hoof,

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.740
your ability to manage
your downside, I think,

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.040
is much harder on the savanna.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.230
And so this is why
adaptation to uncertainty

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.300
is a central part
of being human.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.000
Humans move out of the
forest onto the savanna

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.240
and it's a much
more variable place,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.170
and this variability
is not just--

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:52.110
you don't just like
set up an experiment,

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.110
measure the variability, and
get your nice distribution

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.170
that you fit to it, and say OK.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.010
14% of the time,
I'm going to have

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.050
to do this, and 27%
of time, I'm going

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.750
to have to do this the way
a risk manager would do it.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.000
There's real uncertainty here.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.990
You really don't know
what the probabilities

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.297
are, in part because
the environment very

00:27:09.297 --> 00:27:10.005
rapidly changing.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.864
So when I say uncertainty, I
mean uncertainty and not risk.

00:27:16.864 --> 00:27:19.030
Adaptation to uncertainty
is central to being human.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.610
There all these things that
we do that are very unusual.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.000
We have an expanded
diet, as I've mentioned,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.840
that typically requires
technology to extract,

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.630
like these underground
storage organs.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.000
We are the mobile primate.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.720
Our home ranges, for
like a hunter-gatherer,

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.610
is on the order
of 10 to 100 times

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.930
bigger than a comparable-sized
chimpanzee group, OK?

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.860
So like the Hadza range over
about 2,500-square kilometers,

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.830
whereas a chimpanzee group
will range over about 20.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.970
Now the chimps live in a forest,
so there is that difference,

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.120
but that's part of moving
out onto the savanna where

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.410
the Hadza live.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.710
Humans are so mobile, when
things get really bad,

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.980
we get up and we
move continents.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.750
This is very much a
timely issue, right?

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.210
The 21st century and the
latter part of the 21st century

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:14.360
is going to be dominated
by human mobility.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.350
We see that it's breaking
lots of international systems

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.730
right now and possibly leading
to the rise of right wing

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.560
extremism.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.960
Migration is part of our
story from the outset.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.000
The other really big
thing that we do,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.330
that we're really known for
and that's very unusual,

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.330
is we share food.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.000
And it's so unusual-- we don't
even think about how weird is.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.220
That a bunch of
unrelated males--

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.020
it doesn't matter--
males, females--

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.650
can sit in a room and
share food together and not

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.755
want to kill each other.

00:28:49.755 --> 00:28:50.630
I mean, I don't know.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.890
I don't want speak
for you, but I

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.140
can sit in a room with people.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:54.890
People are eating.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.180
I don't feel like I need to go
get all dominant or something.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.320
This is weird, right?

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.990
You talk about your dog
and, oh, the unconditional

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.070
love of a dog.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.130
I've got an idea.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.951
Why don't you try pulling your
dog's food bowl away and eating

00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:08.450
from it?

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.180
See if that love is so
unconditional, right?

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.160
It's a weird thing
that people do.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.490
We share food all the time,
and hunter-gatherers-- it

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.790
turns out to be a super
risky and uncertain endeavor

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.930
to go hunting.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:26.780
Those hill kangaroos-- 85% of
all hunting bouts end with zero

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.220
calories netted--

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.260
85%.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:34.250
So these are mixed
hunter-gatherers

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.955
in the Canadian Arctic.

00:29:35.955 --> 00:29:39.860
My student Elspeth Ready
gathered these data heroically

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.830
over two years.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.270
It's an incredible,
incredible story,

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.530
and it's just to show you--

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.600
I mean, she also makes
really pretty graphics,

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.970
but it's just to show
you that by having

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.000
these networks of
food sharing, you

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.630
ensure against you
failing on any given day.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:59.640
You can count on getting
food from someone else.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.090
So this is also a
very unusual thing

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:06.470
that people do, and this
is part of the argument

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.402
for this embodiment of-- yeah.

00:30:08.402 --> 00:30:11.354
AUDIENCE: What do
the colors mean?

00:30:11.354 --> 00:30:16.190
JAMIE JONES: So the red
houses are food insecure,

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.796
and the blue ones
are food secure.

00:30:18.796 --> 00:30:19.920
It's actually-- yeah, yeah.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.800
It's actually a very
complicated graphic.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.660
I just show it
because it's nice.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.190
So those are a few ways
we manage uncertainty,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.550
but my main focus is on the
evolution of our life cycles.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.380
How long we live.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.390
Why we reproduce when we do.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.920
The patterns of reproduction--

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.270
that sort of thing.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.890
And I would suggest
that uncertainty

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.840
is embodied fundamentally
in our reproductive biology.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.040
Humans are really unusual.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.040
I mentioned that we are
peculiar in our life cycles.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.190
We have probably the latest
age at first reproduction

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.230
of any mammal.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.970
It's very late.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.144
We've got high
fertility, given how--

00:31:01.144 --> 00:31:02.810
we've got low fertility
when you compare

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.810
us to like a pig, right?

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.690
We have singletons and we
spread them out pretty well,

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.860
whereas pigs will have a litter
of 13 piglets or whatever.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.880
But for our body size and for
how late we begin reproducing,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.250
we are very fecund.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.377
We have a fertility
rate that's about 50%

00:31:20.377 --> 00:31:21.960
higher than chimpanzees,
for instance,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.190
in natural fertility
populations.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.290
We have a super long
reproductive span.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.875
You start reproducing
at around age 20 or so.

00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:31.750
You end 45, 50.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.770
That's a long time to be
reproducing for any mammal.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.740
And we've got extensive periods
of overlap of dependence,

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.130
and this is another picture
from Brian Wood among the Hadza.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.210
This beautiful Hadza family
with a mother with her four

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.820
dependent children
and her mother

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.960
who allows her to keep these
four beautiful children

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.190
alive by subsidizing her
foraging effort and her time,

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.190
and providing this babysitting.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.890
I think this picture embodies
a lot of the peculiarities

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.600
of the human life cycle.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.790
Among them include substantial
post-reproductive lifespan,

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.860
which is something that
most animals don't have.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.980
So let's look at a little data.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.570
I've got a database of about
1,400 mammal species here,

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:23.620
and I've just plotted things
out as a function of body size.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.050
Biological things tend
to scale with body size,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:32.242
and the modal mammal
weighs about 50 grams,

00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:33.700
so there are lots
of little things.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.824
There are fewer big things.

00:32:34.824 --> 00:32:37.550
That's one of those things
that scales with body size.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.850
So you put these on
double logarithmic axes,

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:45.160
and the red points are
primates, the black points

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.390
are all other mammals,
and the green are humans.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:52.030
And so we can see that
for our body mass,

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:56.710
we have a very late age
at first reproduction.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:02.880
We have a very long lifespan,
and we have low fertility,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.380
but we're not quite
the same outlier

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.744
that we are in age at first
reproduction and lifespan.

00:33:07.744 --> 00:33:09.660
We're kind of in with
all the other great apes

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.430
in terms of our fertility.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.490
You don't really see
how freakishly different

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:17.790
we are-- how weird we
are until you start

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.650
to combine the parameters,
and this is also

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.734
a sort of engineering idea.

00:33:21.734 --> 00:33:23.400
You have these different
parameters that

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.560
have different units on them.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.980
Let's combine them and make some
dimensionless numbers and try

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.190
to get at the design
features of the organism,

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:37.020
and this life history theorist,
[INAUDIBLE] Chernov showed that

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.001
what I'm calling--

00:33:39.001 --> 00:33:41.580
it's the ratio of age
at first reproduction

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.100
to total reproductive
lifespan, and I'm calling

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.980
that relative lifespan--

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.040
is constant across mammals,
and we can see for--

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.810
I've got the four
great apes here.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.390
For the three
non-human great apes,

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.410
we can see it's
remarkably constant.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.110
The same thing is
true for the-- it's

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.000
the product of age
at first reproduction

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.160
and annual fertilities.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.680
I've called it
reproductive power here,

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.150
and it's a little more variable,
but it's constant enough

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.580
for comparative biology,
considering these things are

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.110
measured with a lot of slop.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.489
How do humans fit in?

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:18.630
So our relative lifespan is
really right in the ballpark

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.783
of the other great apes.

00:34:20.783 --> 00:34:22.199
What about our
reproductive power?

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:22.699
[WHISTLING]

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:23.889
Ooh.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.350
Two, right?

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.530
So way more than
double what pretty much

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.389
all of the other mammals are.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.540
This is the thing that's
really peculiar about humans.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.030
So we live a long
time, but we actually

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.719
also make a lot of babies,
and those things typically

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:42.489
don't go together.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.940
I suggested that--
a few years back,

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.800
that this pattern of
very long life and very

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.091
high reproductive power is
consistent with the strategy

00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:51.730
known as bet hedging.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.190
Humans are bet hedgers.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.090
The long generation
length that comes

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.130
from a late age at
first reproduction

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.140
and a long reproductive
span, coupled

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.150
with relatively high
fertility, means

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.520
that we get to sample
multiple environments.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.380
Think back to that plot
of temperature over time,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:12.250
and zoom into a more
local time scale.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.986
It's varying quite a bit, right?

00:35:13.986 --> 00:35:15.610
There's decadal scale
variation that we

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.220
know is going on in the
Pleistocene in Africa,

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.530
and if you had great
information, you could say,

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.620
oh, I know that this is going
to be a great year to reproduce,

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.800
and you could pile all
your reproduction into it.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.860
But if you're wrong,
you're completely hosed,

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.710
because you've put all
your eggs in one basket.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:39.040
Bet hedging is all about
spreading out your risk,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.470
doing it a lot, and trying to
sample a broad temporal series

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.480
of environments.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.850
The essence of bet
hedging is trading off

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.680
the mean for a
reduction in variance,

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.640
and I should mention the
term comes from the race

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.620
track betting
strategy where you bet

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.394
at least a little money on
every single horse in a race.

00:36:00.394 --> 00:36:01.810
And what that means
is that you're

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.300
guaranteed to lose
money every race,

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.820
but you're also guaranteed
not to lose it all,

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.390
because some horse has to win.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.965
And you know, you don't
just lay it out at random.

00:36:11.965 --> 00:36:13.590
Presumably you have
an idea about which

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.600
horse is going to win, but
you hedge yourself, right?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.976
And so hedging, of course, is--

00:36:20.976 --> 00:36:23.730
diversification in general
is the fundamental strategy

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.500
for risk management.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.760
But why hedge bets and why
should humans, in particular,

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.420
need to hedge?

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.910
Why hedge?

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.000
Humans inherited the
legacy of slow reproduction

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.230
from the great apes.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.780
We come from this
great ape stock,

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.770
and we have very low, in the
broader scheme of things,

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.360
reproductive capacity.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.100
So under the best
of circumstances,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.000
a chimpanzee population is
going to grow at about 1%

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.570
annually, if everything comes
together just perfectly.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.600
And the higher the growth
rate, the less likely

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.950
a population will go extinct.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.920
As humans moved into more
variable savanna woodland

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.860
environments, they
experienced greater variance,

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.600
and you can show that your
long run expectation is

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.950
essentially-- it's a
function of your mean,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.230
but it's also a function
of your variance.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.370
Variance pushes you
symmetrically around a mean,

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.830
and when you have an absorbing
boundary, that's a bad thing.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:26.330
You want to avoid getting
pushed around that mean.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.540
So prolific reproduction is sort
of the other way you do this.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.352
Like if you're a
muscle or a sea urchin

00:37:31.352 --> 00:37:32.810
or something that
lives in a highly

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.930
variable coastal
intertidal, what do you do?

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.050
You just produce
millions of gametes.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.120
That's not an option for
humans, because we inherit

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.370
this legacy of the great apes.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.710
So we're trying to
avoid extinction

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.970
given these enormous constraints
on our reproductive biology.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.130
And again, another photo
that I think really

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:56.180
encapsulates so many of these
challenges that humans have,

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.430
and the embodiment of
uncertainty in our life

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:03.050
histories, is this incredible
portrait by Dorothea Lange--

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.709
this iconic photograph of
Oklahoma dust bowl refugees.

00:38:06.709 --> 00:38:08.750
And here's a mother in
California with her infant

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.820
son--

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:15.520
her infant and her
young school-aged son.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.590
This is weird.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.840
We take it for granted,
because it's humans, you know.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.454
You expect a young mother
has a bunch of young kids,

00:38:23.454 --> 00:38:24.370
but it's really weird.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:28.450
A chimpanzee mother-- birth
intervals of about 5 and 1/2

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.730
years in Gambia national
park in Tanzania--

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.840
another place where I've worked.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.470
And she will wean her infant.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.250
That starts that interval
right at about age five--

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.520
four or five--

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.310
and she will then never
invest in that child again

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.060
economically.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.400
She will never share food
with that child again.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.470
She will never nurse
that child again.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.300
Could you imagine
doing that to this kid?

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.690
Sorry, five-year-old.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.400
We've got a new baby.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.050
You've got to make
it on your own.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.780
That's not an
option for a human.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.240
Even those of you who haven't
had kids probably know that,

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.567
right?

00:39:05.567 --> 00:39:07.400
Sometimes you wonder
with Stanford students.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.610
You have to explain that that
won't work, but you know.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.940
I assume you guys know.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.800
So adaptation to
uncertainty is embodied

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.602
in our very
reproductive biology.

00:39:16.602 --> 00:39:18.310
Given its central
importance, it probably

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.780
comes into our economic
decision-making as well.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.080
Now I'm going to--

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.220
I don't have much time left.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.870
I'm going to talk about
two specific applications

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:31.880
very quickly.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.200
So here is a schematic
model, and I just

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.880
put in the types of
economic decisions

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.110
that I tend to think
about as a reminder.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.400
We've got these four
economic decisions

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.110
that are lotteries in
the sense that they

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.570
have variable payoffs.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.210
These are decisions that
have variable payoffs

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:52.900
and we call them lotteries,
and in the standard economic

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.300
analysis, you have these
different lotteries

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:59.290
and they get aggregated
by a thing called utility.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.770
The utility aggregates-- it
averages over these things,

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.910
and you're trying
to maximize that.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.360
And when people start
thinking about well,

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.480
how do we mix economics
and evolutionary biology?

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.010
It's tempting to first simply
substitute fitness for utility,

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.520
but that's wrong
for two reasons.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.580
First, no one but
sociopaths thinks

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.110
about maximizing their fitness.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.530
You know, you say, oh, I must
have more babies and they--

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.205
and I must compete with--

00:40:26.205 --> 00:40:28.730
people don't think that way.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.850
That's not something,
and that's about

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.700
fitting into the
observations again.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.370
But second and more
importantly, it

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.740
would be a terrible control
variable for your behavior,

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.150
because fitness is measured at
a time scale that's basically

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.460
greater than a human lifespan.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.160
It's about your contribution
to future generations.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.990
You can't sit there and have a
real-time feed of your fitness.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:58.190
You need something
more proximate to use.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.640
Fitness ends up being the
arbiter of what things work

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.170
and what things
don't, but you want

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.090
to have something
proximate that you

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:11.480
can use as a control variable
to respond adaptively

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.550
to a changing environment.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:18.350
All right, so utility in
the standard economic model

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.250
aggregates and averages
over different lotteries.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.290
In our model that I've
already shown you,

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.650
the lotteries are still there.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.200
We've got these aggregators
at approximate level.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:36.030
These are these proximate
motivational systems--

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:39.730
satiety, sexual satisfaction,
love of your children--

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.240
you know, whatever they are.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.090
But what matters
is that they are

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:48.700
things that you can use to
guide your decisions over how

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.720
you decide to mix your
market basket, for example.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.060
And then fitness is the
thing that aggregates

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.480
over the top of this.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.130
This is a hierarchical
model that Mike Price and I

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.397
put together, and we've done
a bunch of things with it.

00:42:03.397 --> 00:42:05.230
It turns out there are
a system of equations

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.021
that underlie this.

00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:08.470
We can put some
constraints on there,

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.120
and there's actually
a whole talk

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.578
where I talk about
the constraints,

00:42:11.578 --> 00:42:14.200
because it's sort of surprising
and interesting where

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.400
they come from.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.710
And we have results.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.140
Here are three, very quickly.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.970
Distortion of decision weights,
kind of like prospect theory.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:26.320
If the standard
economic analysis,

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.110
when you have a risky
decision to make,

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.820
is that you're trying to
maximize the expected value

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.140
of your utility--

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.280
and think about what
expected value means.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.690
It means that you have a linear
combination of some weights.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.330
They happen to be probabilities,
but they're decision weights

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.860
and some outcomes, right?

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.300
It's a linear combination.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.120
It looks like people
aren't putting together

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:49.960
linear combinations of
weights and outcomes.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.660
They're using some sort
of weird curvilinear thing

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.730
that Kahneman and
Tversky have suggested

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.460
looks kind of like that.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.050
When we use fitness
as a criterion--

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:05.140
as an objective
function, what we get

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.840
is decision weights
that curve like that.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.460
So that was cool.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.959
Another thing is
high risk aversion

00:43:11.959 --> 00:43:13.000
among the poorest people.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.090
There is this idea--

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.880
it's kind of this
folklore, I think,

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.600
that poor people have nothing
to lose somehow, in the sense

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.610
that they're very
resource-poor and so they

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.010
should be willing-- they're
natural entrepreneurs.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.590
They should be willing to take
risks because what have they

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:27.460
got to lose?

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:28.990
Well, what they
have to lose, when

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.600
you think of us as
biological entities,

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.410
is they have everything
to lose, right?

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:39.220
They're poor and so if
their financial decisions--

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.980
if their economic
decisions have an impact

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.280
on their survivability,
then we should expect them

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.680
to be actually risk averse,
and in this framework

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.490
it turns out that they're
extremely risk averse.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.590
And then finally, we can
recover without any sort

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.800
of active choice these--

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.550
what look like
preference reversal.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.420
Some of the classic
paradoxes of choice

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.080
that came about in the 1950s.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.580
That's a little more technical,
but it's a cool result, too.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.640
Just want to remind you,
as I get to my last point

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.500
here, about the diversity of
habitats that humans live in.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.710
We come out onto the savanna,
we can live in these mixed rain

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.630
forests-- agricultural lands.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.740
This is in Uganda again.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.270
We live in the tundra,
inside the Arctic Circle.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:36.920
Here's some Venezuelan Llanos,
home of swamps and big snakes.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.007
This is where anacondas live.

00:44:39.007 --> 00:44:41.590
People are very-- they're very
successful hunter-gatherers who

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:42.089
live there.

00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:46.870
We live on the coastal
shore as fisherfolk.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:50.140
We live on temperate prairies.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.170
We have a wide
variety of habitats,

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:56.590
and presumably,
our choice calculus

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.870
should be a little different,
depending on where we're

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.384
actually making our decisions.

00:45:01.384 --> 00:45:03.550
So as generalists with
tremendous capacity to learn,

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.130
it seems reasonable to suppose
that the human capacity

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.770
to make rational
decisions has an ontogeny,

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.630
meaning it has a development.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:13.660
You have to learn a
little bit about it,

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.580
and I've developed
a simple model

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.010
of learning about one's
uncertain environment that

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.130
helps understand one of
the most vexing results

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.860
in this irrationality
literature, which is

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.050
inconsistent time preferences.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:31.060
The fact that we value
waiting a day differently,

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.660
whether it's today or
whether it's next year.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.480
We care a lot about waiting
from today till tomorrow,

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.080
but we don't care that much at
all a year, or a year and a day

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:41.870
from now.

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:42.370
Whatever.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:43.940
It's a year from now.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.910
This drives economists crazy.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.450
It may seem common
sense to people.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.942
I think that that's an
interesting insight,

00:45:50.942 --> 00:45:52.400
but it does drive
economists crazy,

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.370
and it's one of the
fundamental anomalies.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:46:01.362
So I have a simple model that
has basically four parts.

00:46:01.362 --> 00:46:03.070
The first is that your
time preferences--

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.190
why do we care about the
present more than the future?

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:07.990
Well, a reasonable way
to think about that

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.450
is because there's
the chance that you

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:14.280
might die before you recover
a reward that you delay.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.190
Or less dramatically,
that reward might go away.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.250
Your friend might forget,
or it might be a resource

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:24.010
that gets swooped on.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:29.110
So there's a hazard of
failure of this resource,

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:34.000
and you can then have a
time consistent prior, which

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.760
is like an exponential
distribution,

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:42.790
that you value all the
delays of the same amount

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.630
by the same amount.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:47.950
That's your prior distribution,
consistent with the prior.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.620
You can then go out and
learn about the environment,

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.110
but a lot of these important
economic decisions--

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:58.540
things about how what you
plant this year yields--

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.710
your yield nine months
from now, a year from now--

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.270
you don't have a
lot of opportunities

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.478
as a kid to learn about that.

00:47:05.478 --> 00:47:07.005
You have a few,
so you're probably

00:47:07.005 --> 00:47:09.100
at best going to learn
about it with uncertainty.

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.500
When you integrate
the uncertainty

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.320
of-- so the posterior looks
pretty good here, right?

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.150
I figure, again, I'm
on fairly safe ground.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.850
Google Days, right?

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.300
Your posterior
looks pretty good,

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.060
but in fact, when
you integrate it

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.060
to give your posterior
predictive distribution,

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.040
all of a sudden you've got
all that uncertainty that

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.670
causes this big plateau
here, and it essentially

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:36.730
turns into what's known
as hyperbolic discounting.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.830
So it's an inconsistency
in time preference,

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.660
because you've got
this fat tail that you

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.170
have to integrate over.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:47.280
So uncertainly and discount
rate leads to inconsistent time

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:47.780
preferences.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.990
There is the
exponential prediction.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:53.750
The discount rate with no
uncertainty is exponential.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.970
You add uncertainty,
and what you get

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:59.540
is essentially this
hyperbolic function.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.040
I was really excited
when I read it,

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.750
because it's a
really simple model.

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:04.910
It's just a simple
little Bayesian model,

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.280
and it's like, wow, I've
really nailed it this time.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.320
Turns out-- I then went
back to the literature.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.770
It turns out a bunch
of people have said it,

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:13.670
which is always a
bittersweet moment.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:15.350
On the one hand,
you're like, damn.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.859
I thought I was so original.

00:48:16.859 --> 00:48:19.400
But on the other hand, it means
that I had the same good idea

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.132
that Partha Dasgupta had, and
that's always a good thing.

00:48:23.132 --> 00:48:25.790
So, you know-- you win
some, you lose some.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:28.340
So I'm going to give
you three takeaways.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.290
Maximizing fitness
distorts economic choices.

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:36.070
We've seen this repeatedly,
but it maximizes fitness,

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.770
and that's the direction
that selection is

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.300
going to push the population.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.920
Uncertainty changes optimality
predictions qualitatively.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.900
When you put uncertainty
into the game,

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.590
you get different answers,
and that evolutionary theory

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.620
has promise for providing a
comprehensive theory of choice.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.900
It's very much a
work in progress.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.500
I'm excited about
the potential here.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.375
I'm excited about trying
to recruit some more

00:48:59.375 --> 00:49:02.930
people to work on this, and I've
got to thank you for your time,

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:05.090
and I'm happy are
to entertain-- yeah.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:12.530
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:17.637
So I have basically a question
about the role of social

00:49:17.637 --> 00:49:20.220
signaling in economic decisions,
and I'm thinking particularly

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.820
there's that game economists
like to point to as irrational,

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.840
where two people can
split a pile of money,

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.310
[INAUDIBLE] accepts or rejects--

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.310
JAMIE JONES: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:32.935
AUDIENCE: Typically
if it's asymmetric,

00:49:32.935 --> 00:49:35.020
second one will reject
and no one wins anything.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.240
JAMIE JONES: Yeah.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.990
AUDIENCE: Which to me
it seems like that's

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.595
because like in a
tribal environment,

00:49:40.595 --> 00:49:43.119
you're trying to teach
other people don't try to--

00:49:43.119 --> 00:49:44.410
JAMIE JONES: Costly punishment.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:45.090
Absolutely.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.360
Yeah.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.390
So this is another
area that has actually

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:53.050
gotten a lot more attention from
evolutionary anthropologists

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.960
and evolutionary biologists,
is what's sometimes

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.030
called our prosociality--

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:00.880
this intense sociality
that we have that's

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.310
reflected in these
food sharing networks,

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:08.110
but that we have the psychology
of, we don't like unfairness.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.920
And when you play
the dictator game,

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.810
you punish people who don't
give what you perceive

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.180
to be fair offers,
and presumably this

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:23.350
relates to this
need for ensuring

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:25.720
cooperation in small
scale societies

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.956
and punishing cheaters.

00:50:27.956 --> 00:50:29.420
Yeah.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.396
Thanks for that.

00:50:35.764 --> 00:50:37.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, a
related question.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.600
So if we're really concerned
about comfort and survival

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.380
and things like
that, it's amazing

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.110
that humans will migrate
to some of the most

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.320
uncomfortable places, and we
will willingly venture out.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.915
Why would a rational creature
go to the South Pole,

00:50:50.915 --> 00:50:52.600
go to the moon, go to Mars?

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.350
JAMIE JONES: Yeah.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:54.391
AUDIENCE: It's dangerous.

00:50:54.391 --> 00:50:55.910
They're not very pleasant.

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:56.539
And--

00:50:56.539 --> 00:50:57.330
JAMIE JONES: Well--

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:58.788
AUDIENCE: Do we as
creatures-- is--

00:50:58.788 --> 00:51:01.850
we tend to be rather curious,
and does that makes us somewhat

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.244
different from other animals?

00:51:03.244 --> 00:51:04.910
JAMIE JONES: You know,
there are a lot--

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:09.080
I think that anything that
makes its living as a generalist

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.640
is going to be curious.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.490
Lots of primates are
super curious, right?

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:18.260
I mean, if you live around
here and you have French doors,

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.930
you've possibly seen
raccoons at your door,

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:22.740
just sort of like
looking in, like, hey,

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.530
what's going on in there?

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.510
So I don't know if curiosity--

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:28.970
we certainly take
curiosity to another level.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.490
All of those things--

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.560
you know, if you go to
Mars and you come back,

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.740
that's a pretty high
status thing to do, right?

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.422
You have a social
signaling going on--

00:51:39.422 --> 00:51:40.130
if you come back.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.600
No, right.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.900
And if you think about
my Bayesian model,

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.180
how many opportunities do
you have to learn about what

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.890
the actual hazard is?

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:52.540
Suppose you have like
a really flat prior.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.610
You've never seen anyone
go to Mars, so you know,

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.670
it could be anything, right?

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:00.680
So I think that that
sort of explains

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:06.050
some of the unusual decisions
that people seem to make.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:10.670
Moving into the Arctic to live--

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.030
it may seem uncomfortable to us,
but you know, if you're Inuit,

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.790
you do pretty well, in general.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.450
And there's a living
to be made there,

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.860
and people are
incredibly adaptable.

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.100
AUDIENCE: Question--
thanks for the talk.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:31.500
Do you see any other species
that have environment--

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.390
that evolved in uncertain
environments that share

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.984
a similar pattern in
reproductive power or other

00:52:36.984 --> 00:52:37.900
characteristics that--

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.887
JAMIE JONES: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:52:40.887 --> 00:52:41.720
I don't really know.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.170
There is a-- so the
classic bet hedgers are--

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.120
there are a bunch of birds.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.790
Again, local environment,
red-tailed hawks, right?

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.610
So a lot of the raptors
will do this thing

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:56.180
that's really kind of
perplexing at face value.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.700
They'll lay clutches
of two eggs,

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:02.480
but only one will
ever fledge, and it

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.820
seems incredibly wasteful.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.200
And it's a classic
bet hedging thing.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.740
If that first one fails,
then the second one

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.280
is there, and the cost--

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.110
you're paying a little
bit of your mean.

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:19.460
You're paying out a
little insurance policy

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.780
to insure against
catastrophic failure.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.720
So there are lots
of birds that engage

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.570
in this type of bet hedging.

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:29.030
Reproductive power,
as I've called it,

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:31.310
I have not seen
it in any mammal.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:32.900
It's possible it
exists in other--

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:36.210
but you know, the way
the Chernov model works,

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:39.020
you have to-- for this model,
you have to be a mammal.

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:42.980
You could come up with these
sort of dimensionless design

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.380
features of different
life histories,

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.360
but it only works
for if you have

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.026
the same kind of general
reproductive biology.

00:53:51.026 --> 00:53:51.870
Yeah.

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:54.699
AUDIENCE: So in light
of your research, maybe

00:53:54.699 --> 00:53:57.240
academically you wouldn't make
any recommendations like this,

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.150
but personally, do you
have recommendations

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:03.810
on how to motivate
people psychologically

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:06.900
and collectively to address
issues like climate change

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.470
that we're feeling
in the present now,

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:12.680
but we'll be feeling a
lot more in the future.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.680
JAMIE JONES: Well, I have
pretty strong opinions

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.070
about the way we
value the future,

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:25.350
and I think that it seems like
it's a bit of a moral argument.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:29.940
But when we say we want to take
some steps to mitigate climate

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.061
change now, whenever we do a
cost benefit analysis, what's

00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:34.560
going to happen is
that you're going

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:41.790
to take a discount rate of the
value of an investment today

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.500
a couple hundred
years in the future.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.780
And that's the real rub.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:49.320
It's both the fact
that you're valuing

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.840
the present more than the
future, but you're also--

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.330
all these things play out
at very long time scales.

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.960
So you throw in a
4% discount rate,

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.410
and it's very difficult to
come up with a cost benefit

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.620
analysis that favors mitigation
now with a 4% discount

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.560
rate that pays out its
benefits in 200 years.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.690
So I think, and I'm
not alone in this--

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:13.890
there are a bunch of
environmental economists who

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.590
are engaged in a very
vigorous debate on this--

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:19.470
that we should use much
lower discount rates

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:21.600
for thinking about
cost benefit analysis

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.360
with these long payoffs.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.400
Martin Weitzman at
Harvard has suggested

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.250
using the absolute
lowest discount

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:34.980
rate that you can imagine
that makes it tenable, because

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:40.410
of this problem, and because
the tail risk of these outcomes

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.145
are so huge.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.740
So that's something I take away
from this, like don't overvalue

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.160
the present.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.530
But it's easy for me to do that.

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:55.760
I live in Palo Alto, right?

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.460
We all live in pretty
predictable environments.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.750
We're quite privileged
people, and it's easy to say,

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:04.275
well, you know, we should
really value the future.

00:56:04.275 --> 00:56:06.900
And this is some of the
work that my colleagues

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.150
who I showed you
briefly have done,

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:11.660
showing that if you're poor--

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.730
So like they're the classic
marshmallow experiments that

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:16.890
were done here at Stanford.

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.350
Give a kid a marshmallow
and walk away.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:20.750
Say, "Don't eat that, all right?

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:23.560
Because if you do, that's
all you're getting.

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.940
But if it's still there when
I come back, you get two."

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.300
You walk away and it turns out
that these kids who struggle,

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.725
they're looking at this
marshmallow, and they're going,

00:56:31.725 --> 00:56:32.225
"Oh god.

00:56:32.225 --> 00:56:34.110
I want to eat the
marshmallow so bad."

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:36.300
It turns out that it
correlates very well--

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.250
your ability to
put off that reward

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.740
and get the larger reward
after a little delay--

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.040
predicts a lot of things
about your success in life.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.040
It's really hard--
anthropologists have found it

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.090
really hard to go into places
and replicate these types

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:55.930
of economic games that
we play all the time,

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.440
including the dictator games--

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:01.920
these things that we
talked about before--

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.690
in part because
people are like, how

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:07.140
do I know you're going to be
back with your two marshmallows

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.430
that you talk about?

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:11.250
I've got to take that one
right now, thank you very much.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:14.550
And so that's just a cautionary
tale, that it's easy for me

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:16.740
to say, we should
value the future more,

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:21.180
because I have a pretty
low discount rate because I

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.820
live in Palo Alto.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:30.770
As a society, I think we
should be modeling the future--

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:34.020
valuing the future
more than we do.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.760
That's a really long answer
to a pretty straightforward

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.070
question.

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:40.610
Yeah, OK.

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:44.680
AUDIENCE: How does
our evolution history

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.070
play out when we are not
200 people in a small band?

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:53.470
But we have 7 billion people
[INAUDIBLE] that we construct?

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.690
JAMIE JONES: Yeah.

00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:01.690
That's a vexing problem, that
we sort of develop these ingroup

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:03.910
and outgroup identities,
and that they probably

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.610
are very functional when you
live in a band-like society,

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.690
because your ingroup is
really your everything.

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:13.690
It's maybe not so
functional when

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:18.340
you make the rest of
the world your outgroup,

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.640
and the same sort
of rules of morality

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.790
don't apply to them
and that sort of thing.

00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:28.280
That's a real problem,
and solving that--

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.990
there's a prize for someone,
is if we can figure out

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:36.200
how to really begin
to address that.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.120
Equally importantly,
in the world

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:43.180
we live in, when
you're a peasant farmer

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:47.750
and you plant yams
and some maize

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:53.150
and whatever, you place your
bet and then you tend it

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:56.090
and you hopefully get
a big payoff, right?

00:58:56.090 --> 00:59:01.010
There is a direct causal
interpretation of what you do

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:02.600
and what you get.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.810
In the world we live in, we
have all this complexity,

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:08.930
and we don't necessarily pay
the costs for bad decisions

00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:11.300
right away, and I think that
makes it very hard to learn

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.420
about good decision-making.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.730
And so there are
a number of people

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:19.760
who've developed sort of the
curricula for teaching kids

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.590
how to make risky decisions.

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:26.217
I think that giving
kids some responsibility

00:59:26.217 --> 00:59:27.800
and getting them
some skin in the game

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.010
is a really important thing.

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:31.070
So that's a little
off of your question,

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:33.800
but I think that that's another
real challenge to thinking

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.202
about how our brains were
designed to make decisions

00:59:36.202 --> 00:59:37.910
and the types of
environments in which we

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:41.090
have to do it now-- many of us.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:42.830
Yeah.

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:45.530
AUDIENCE: If we predict
greatly increased variability

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.145
in the near future,
what would you predict

00:59:48.145 --> 00:59:51.729
with those functions, e.g.

00:59:51.729 --> 00:59:54.730
more longevity or things
like that in this?

00:59:57.234 --> 00:59:58.650
JAMIE JONES: Well
first of all, we

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:04.460
have to get through this
possible bottleneck, right?

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.050
And I say that flippantly
because otherwise I'd just

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:12.010
descend into depression, right?

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:14.680
Sure, it's
conceivable that there

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:20.279
could be more selection on even
more spread-out reproduction.

01:00:20.279 --> 01:00:21.070
The thing is that--

01:00:24.534 --> 01:00:26.200
a really interesting
observation that we

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.840
make in development
economics and demography

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.090
is that as soon
as you can ensure

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.540
the more-or-less certain
survival of your kids

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.000
to reproductive age,
people voluntarily

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.580
reduce their fertility.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:45.460
And so we had this model called
the Demographic Transition

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.910
model and it predicted the time
scale over which has happened,

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.800
and it seemed to explain the
historical data very well.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.090
And then late in the 20th
century, these places--

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:58.070
a lot of places in the
Middle East and North Africa

01:00:58.070 --> 01:00:59.770
and in Asia--

01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:01.990
in the tiger
economies, fertility

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:06.775
fell like that as soon as kids
could be counted on to survive.

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:13.812
And so-- yeah.

01:01:13.812 --> 01:01:18.040
If our technological
and social technologies

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.910
can keep up with ensuring
the child survivorship

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:28.090
and keeping it favoring
economic investment,

01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:30.220
then that sort of relaxes
the selection pressure

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.960
to spread everything
out, for sure.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.000
And I think that that should
be a goal that we have.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.910
If we want to avoid negative
population consequences,

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:43.930
make sure that kids
survive to adulthood,

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:47.800
because that changes everything
about people's investments,

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.470
and that's really what this--

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:54.580
given that you can't
affect that as a hominin

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.390
a million years ago, you
don't have the technology

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:00.430
to really mitigate that.

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:03.680
So what you do is you
spread everything out.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.850
But if we have the chance
to actually solve it, then

01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:08.530
that's the better
solution probably,

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:14.389
and that also reduces the
selective pressure, I think.

01:02:14.389 --> 01:02:14.888
Yeah.

01:02:14.888 --> 01:02:16.240
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:16.899
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:17.440
Thanks a lot.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.340
Thanks a lot.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.190
It was fun.
