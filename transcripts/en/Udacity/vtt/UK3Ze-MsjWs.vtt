00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.483
So we already talked about the general
version of the distributive property is

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:09.280
that if you have some variable, or number,
or expression, or really anything in the

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:13.762
slot where a is and you want to multiply
that by some set of terms that are added

00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:18.883
together Inside parentheses. They could
also, of course, be subtracted. Then the

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:22.737
factor that you want to multiply
everything by distributes its

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.718
multiplication to each term that's inside
the parentheses. So we end up with a * b,

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:32.051
or ab over here, + a * c, ac over here.
Now, we already saw how we use the

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:36.295
distributive property when we want to
subtract polynomials from one another. But

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:40.540
in those situations, we let a = -1, and
clearly, a could equal many other things

00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:44.304
besides -1. So, let's try something out,
where a is a different number.
