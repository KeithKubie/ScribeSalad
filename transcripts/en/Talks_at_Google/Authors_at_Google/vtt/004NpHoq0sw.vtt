JESSICA: Sean has a
really amazing bio.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.210
We're lucky to have
him here with us today

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.010
for the Authors
[INAUDIBLE] series.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.990
He is a UCLA Medical
School professor,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.730
and the founder and
executive director

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.280
of the UCLA Center
for Digital Behavior

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.980
and the UC Institute for
Prediction Technology.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.850
He has a PhD in psychology and
a master's in health services

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.004
research from
Stanford University.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:27.420
And the work he
will present today

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.660
is on behavior change based
on his research with patients

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.580
and consulting with businesses.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.310
He's tackled challenges ranging
from getting people to stick

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.680
with New Year's resolutions--
which we all would love

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.090
to learn more about, I'm sure--

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.295
to keeping healthier
and addressing

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:43.170
some of the most important
would-be problems,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.240
like preventing
the spread of HIV.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.650
His book, "Stick With It,"
is available from Harper

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.020
as of June 20th.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.154
Thank you for being here.

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:53.118
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.310
SEAN YOUNG: Thanks
so much, Jessica.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.320
I wrote this book
because, on a daily basis,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.720
I was hearing
stories from people

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.300
who were having trouble
sticking with things

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.160
that they wanted to do.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.980
For those of you who've
ever tried to do something

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.800
and had a difficult time
sticking with things,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.100
it can be really, really tough.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.980
If you've tried doing
something, and you fail at it,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.847
and you really want to do
it, people can really suffer.

00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:26.680
Whether we're trying
to do it for ourselves,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.750
to get ourselves to
stick with things,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.840
or we're trying to get other
people who we really care about

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.960
to stick with things
that they want to do

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.690
or that are good for them.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.150
So when hearing these stories,
I really empathize with people.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.200
And at the same time,
half the time, I'd

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.420
be empathizing with them,
and half the time, I'd

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.610
be really frustrated
hearing their answers.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.090
Because their reasoning
behind why they couldn't stick

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.240
with things or why other people
couldn't stick with things

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.920
were often because someone
wasn't dedicated enough.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.140
They were lazy.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.090
There were problems
with the individual.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.700
They weren't motivated enough.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.500
And this not only makes us feel
bad about ourselves or about

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.380
people to pin that
on the individual,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.610
but it's actually not
the correct science.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.080
It's not backed by science.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.260
So what I had learned
is that the reason why

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.570
we don't stick
with things is not

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.820
because of a problem
with the person,

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.930
not because of a problem with
ourselves or other people.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.770
It's because we're not
following the right process.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.510
So in this talk, I'm going
to talk about that process.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.390
And that's what led
me to write this book.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.300
And this same process can be
used for small, mundane things,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.420
just like getting ourself
to stick with a hobby

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.220
that we want to take on.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.850
But it can also be used for
really serious, important

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.120
things, like getting
ourselves or others to stick

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.210
with medication that's
been prescribed,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.580
or getting ourselves or others
to stay free from diseases.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.440
So that's why I wrote this book.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.500
Now as a social and
behavioral psychologist,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.760
I love that I get
to meet and help

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920
so many different
types of people.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.560
I get to meet with
entrepreneurs,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.510
with public health experts, with
engineers, and our own research

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.670
participants.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.830
And on the way over here, for
example, on the flight over,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.600
I got into a conversation
with the person

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.150
in the seat next to me.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.000
And he reminds me of my
Uncle Sid from New York.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.410
He has this strong
New York accent.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.750
And so he says to me,
[FAKE NEW YORK ACCENT] Dr.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.190
Young, every month, I pay
for my gym membership.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.570
I try to do something
good for myself.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.530
I know I should go to the gym,
but I don't go to the gym.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.360
Why don't I go?

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.820
I'm paying for my
gym membership.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.862
Can you give me some drugs or
analyze my dreams to help me?

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:18.320
{?_{?_[SPEAKING NORMALLY]_?}_?}
But I have to tell him, no,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.350
I can't, because
that's not what I do.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.330
I help people change
their behavior.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.530
But his problem is one
that I think a lot of us

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.360
can relate to, the problem
of, how do we stick to things?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.160
A few years ago, by
the end of the summer,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.930
I planned to learn basics
of speaking Chinese.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.050
But at the end of the
summer, all I could say

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.300
was, yeah, I'll have the
Kung Pao chicken, please.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.180
Now problems like this are not
just about personal behaviors,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.680
like wanting to learn a new
language or stick with things.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.410
They also apply to business.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.170
So a team in your organization
may have plans to complete work

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.940
by a deadline.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.070
But then they keep
missing their deadlines.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.860
But they plan their
own deadlines.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.780
Now the typical solution
to things like this,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.660
or the reasoning
behind it, is to say

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.310
that the person is flawed,
that the person doesn't have

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.430
enough willpower, the person
isn't motivated enough,

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.220
and we need to
change the person.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.280
But that not only makes us
feel badly about ourselves

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.030
as people with putting
blame like that,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.230
but it's not the
correct science.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.260
So what I've learned
is that we just

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.050
need to know that
there are three

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.990
different types of behaviors.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.150
Once we know those three
different types of behaviors,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.510
there are a set of
tools for changing

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.280
those three types of behaviors.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.030
So that's what we're going
to go over in this talk.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.710
Now when you walked
in, you should have

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.630
received a card, hopefully.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.540
Raise your hand right now
if you didn't get a card,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.371
and we can get someone to
get you a card right now.

00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:16.870
Great.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.340
Thanks so much.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.380
So on the card, I want to ask
you to write down a behavior

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.400
that you want to change.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.870
This can be a personal
behavior, like getting

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.450
yourself to read more books
or to be more engaged in work.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.570
It can be a business
type behavior,

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.430
like getting your
employees to take

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.870
better care of their health.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.320
Make sure to write it down,
because toward the end,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.300
I'm going to call on some of
you to talk about your behavior.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.790
And we'll call someone
up here, actually.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:56.600
All right, how many of you
have had the situation where

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.680
you are trying to get something
out, you're trying to talk,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.720
and someone keeps
interrupting you?

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.750
I think probably all of us have.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.120
Yep, all of us have
experienced that.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.790
Now how many of you
get frustrated when

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.510
you're trying to talk, and the
person keeps frustrating you?

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.290
Well, it may not be
that person's fault.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:26.190
So that person may be doing what
I call an automatic behavior.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.650
So an automatic behavior is
something where we're not

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.020
even aware of what we're doing.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.340
It just happens unconsciously.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.300
And knowing that something
is an automatic behavior

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.130
allows us to know
how to address it.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.360
So other examples of
an automatic behavior

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.650
are forgetting that we're
not standing up straight,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.960
eating food that's just
sitting in front of us

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.780
without even being aware
of what we're doing.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.520
Those are automatic behaviors.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.040
But once we know
that something's

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.860
an automatic behavior, there are
a set of tools and strategies

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.904
that we can use to change it.

00:08:03.904 --> 00:08:05.320
But before we get
into that, let's

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.270
talk about the second
type of behavior.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.580
So while waiting at a
stoplight to cross the street,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:22.160
I'd often pull out my phone,
check email to burn some time.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.400
And sometimes, I'd
even cross the street

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.640
while I'm still
reading the email.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.750
That's not always the best idea.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.169
It can lead to accidents.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.870
It can lead me tripping in
the middle of the street.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.549
I shouldn't be doing that.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:43.250
But I feel like I
wasn't able to stop.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.770
I felt like I had to just
finish reading this email,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.510
and then I'll put
the phone away.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.320
So this is an example of what
I call a burning behavior.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.890
While automatic
behaviors are things

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.890
that happen unconsciously,
automatically,

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.100
burning behaviors
are behaviors where

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.200
we're aware of what we're doing,
but we feel powerless to stop.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.870
We feel like we just can't stop.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.420
So in my case, knowing that
it was a burning behavior,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.140
I was able to stop it.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.490
And part of that solution
comes from, every week now,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.220
I take a digital day of rest.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.660
So from Friday to Saturday,
I don't use any apps.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.850
I don't check email.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.290
I don't even talk about work.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.930
It's just time for
friends and family.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:39.390
And I was able to
address that and to stop

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.410
what could be a growing digital
addiction, because I knew

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.090
this was a burning behavior.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.880
But before we get
into that, let me

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.480
tell you about the
last type of behavior

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:58.460
and also go into the background
of how I came to study this.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.660
So this is my brother up here.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.970
And when I was in
graduate school,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.250
just down the street
here at Stanford,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.430
my brother came up to visit.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.360
Now he had been suffering from
an intestinal disorder called

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.420
Crohn's disease.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.830
And he came up to visit, and
he was just in too much pain

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.110
to go back home.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.390
So we brought him to
the emergency room.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.150
And they looked at
him, and it turns out

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.440
his intestines had burst.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.860
So he was rushed into
emergency surgery,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.500
and they saved his life.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.300
He was minutes away
from dying, they said.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.620
They saved his life.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.690
So he spent two weeks
recovering at Stanford Hospital.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.930
Then he was prescribed
daily medication,

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:55.450
advised to change his lifestyle,
and then he was released.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.940
Now try to put yourself in my
brother's situation the way

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.860
that I did.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.260
You just almost
died, and you've been

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.155
told, change your lifestyle.

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:12.020
Now how likely do you guys
think you would be to do that?

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.270
If you're like my brother,
if you're like most people,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.910
you'd say, I'm going to change.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.830
I'm going to eat differently.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.047
I'm going to exercise.

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.380
I'm going to take my medication.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.160
I'm going to do everything
that I'm supposed to do.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.688
And my brother said
he'd do that 100%.

00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:29.185
But he didn't.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.000
I didn't understand why.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.710
I-- my family and I
were really close.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.370
I love my brother.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:48.260
So I was on the phone with
my mom for hours every day.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.350
And we were trying
to figure out,

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:56.610
what could we do to get him to
follow these recommendations?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.700
Why wasn't he doing it?

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.230
I was scared for him.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.940
I was worried.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.740
I was confused.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.890
And I was frustrated.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.680
And so I started
searching for answers.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.980
I started talking to all
different types of people,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.880
experts in education, in
medicine, in business,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.400
and I was trying
to find answers.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.030
But I kept finding the same
one size fits all solution

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.645
and answers.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.330
People were saying he needed
to have more willpower.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.030
People were saying he needed to
be more educated about Crohn's

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.250
and how to change it.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:38.312
They were saying that he
wasn't motivated enough

00:12:38.312 --> 00:12:39.020
about his health.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.720
But my brother's smart.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.634
He's motivated.

00:12:42.634 --> 00:12:43.550
He's health conscious.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.900
He's educated.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.010
So these answers didn't
make sense to me.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:52.100
And so that's why I
started studying this area.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.740
And after 15 years
of studying it,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.390
I've come up with some answers.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.360
So what I figured
out is it's not

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.910
about a one size
fits all solution,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.640
and it's not about
blaming the individual.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.350
What we need to know is that
not all behaviors are the same.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:13.210
There are three
types of behaviors.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.230
While I was questioning why
my brother wasn't changing,

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.320
other things were happening
at the same time in my life.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.810
I was in a band and
trying to figure out,

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.180
how do we get the
fans of our band

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.720
to keep coming back to our
shows, to keep buying albums?

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.790
I was teaching
classes at Stanford

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.140
and wondering, why was it that
the students in our classes

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.020
would wait until the
day a paper was due,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.090
and then they'd
ask for more time?

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.730
Or I was wondering,
how could I get myself,

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.770
where I was working on
so many different things,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:50.090
to stay engaged and motivated
in doing all of them?

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.600
Now all these seem like
really different things,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.640
but if you look deeper,
they're actually

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.800
united by one common thread.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.380
And that's, how do we get
people to stick with things?

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.640
So people often
were even planning

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.326
what they were going to do,
but they still kept failing.

00:14:12.326 --> 00:14:14.200
So how do we get people
to stick with things?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.020
Well, what I found
is that we need

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.110
to know the three
types of behaviors.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.740
So the three types
of behaviors are

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.050
automatic, burning,
and common behaviors,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.880
or what I call the
ABCs of behavior.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.300
So I'll do a quick
recap about that.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.130
Automatic behaviors,
are behaviors

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:40.570
that happen unconsciously, like
the example of the interrupter.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.870
Burning behaviors,
burning behaviors.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.230
are behaviors that are not
happening unconsciously,

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.110
but we feel powerless to stop.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:54.090
Addictions are often
burning behaviors.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.750
And then third are
common behaviors.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.890
Common behaviors are the
most common of all behaviors.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.320
Common behaviors are
often due to motivation.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.580
So a common behavior
is something

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.360
where we're aware
of what we're doing,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.500
but the risks of doing
it, or the energy

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.730
that it takes for us to do
it, isn't worth the benefits

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.980
we think we might
get from doing it.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.210
So let me say that again.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.110
I'll repeat that.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.330
Common behavior
is something where

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.610
the energy that it takes
for us to do something,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.580
or the risk that it
takes for us to do it,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.680
isn't worth the benefit we think
we might get from doing it.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.750
So let me give an example,
because that's a lot.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.140
So my brothers lifestyle
change was an example

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.860
of a common behavior.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.030
Because despite being told that
he should change his lifestyle,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.790
and that may keep him out of
the hospital, he didn't think

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.600
it was worth it to change.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.550
Why should he give up
things that he loved doing?

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.560
Why should he change
the way he eats?

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.730
Why should he exercise more,
meditate, take medication?

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.190
Why should he do these
things if there wasn't even

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.550
a guarantee that it would work?

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.420
That's a common behavior.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.670
But knowing that something is
a common behavior, or an A or B

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.460
behavior, allows us
to know how to fix it.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.740
We just need to know
the set of tools

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.600
for fixing those
types of behaviors.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.830
So the set of tools
are what I call

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.780
the forces of behavior change.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.970
Now you guys may have
learned in physics that there

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.370
are forces that move objects--

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.080
that move objects--
can't move this.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.110
There are forces that move
objects in certain directions.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:56.310
Well, there are behavioral
forces that move people.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.410
They get us to behave
in certain ways.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.690
Now just as a flight crew, or
a pilot, or aerospace engineers

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.869
need to know the physical forces
that move a plane in order

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:14.040
to fly it safely, all of us need
to know the behavioral forces

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.819
that move people so we can
behave the way we want.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.169
There are seven of these forces.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.540
So what I did, I came up with
a framework called SCIENCE,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.890
where each one of the
letters of SCIENCE

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.360
represents a different
one of the seven forces.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.010
And it's called
SCIENCE, not because you

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.130
need a scientist to know it, but
because it's based on decades

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.460
of scientific research.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:47.090
So S stands for "Stepladders."

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.210
We know we're supposed to
do things in small steps,

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.250
but we often don't.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.480
We often don't plan small
steps to change our behavior.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.540
A few weeks ago, I ran
into someone at the market.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.870
And he was a cross-country
runner in high school.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.200
And he decided that he
wanted to run a marathon.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.010
He ran cross-country in high
school, so he knew how to run,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.680
but he hadn't run since then.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.389
It had been 20 years since then.

00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:15.680
And he decides, I'm just
going to go run this marathon,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.638
and I'm going to do it.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:17.937
I've got the motivation.

00:18:17.937 --> 00:18:18.770
I've got the energy.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.090
I can do this.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.250
And he actually did pretty well.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.600
He got to mile 19,
but then he collapsed.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.040
And he said, I didn't
finish that marathon,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.810
and I'm probably not going to
run another marathon again.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.360
Now that story, I don't
know about for you guys,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.260
but there's no way I could run
a marathon without training

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.460
for it.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.800
So this makes a lot of sense.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.020
If we want to be
able to do something,

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.940
if we want to
stick to things, we

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.080
need to start in small,
incremental steps.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.190
But just like the
marathon example,

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.120
we often make the same
mistakes in our own life.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.590
If we want to be able to
make a New Year's resolution

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.370
to go to the gym, we'll say,
I'm going to go to the gym.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.040
I haven't really been at
all before this past year,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.400
but I'm going to go five days
a week for the next year.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.900
And that's a pretty tall order.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.040
So we need to think about
things in small steps.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.400
But the question is, how do
you know what a small step is?

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.600
How do you know how
small a step should be?

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.760
So I created this figure
here called Steps, Goals,

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.350
and Dreams.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.600
The marathon example, if I was
going to try to run a marathon,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.660
I've never run one
before, I'm not going

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.010
to be able to do it in a week.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.575
I'm not going to be able to
do it in a month, probably.

00:19:42.575 --> 00:19:44.750
It'll probably take
me a few months

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.260
of training to run a marathon.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.770
So that's what I call a dream.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:54.170
It's attainable, but it
takes some time to get there.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.060
If I want something
now to do, a first step

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.460
would be something that
takes less than a week.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.360
So getting a pair of running
shoes may be a first step.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.790
Or if I haven't run before
much, running for 10,

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.010
15, 20 minutes, just something
small would be a first step.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:12.510
So.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.770
this figure will
teach us how we can

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.040
plan steps that are the right
size so that we don't give up.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.850
So that's Stepladders.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.640
C stands for "Community."

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.710
We all want to be
different from the crowd.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.870
We want to be different
than other individuals.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.060
But our social
environment matters.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.080
It matters a lot more than
we even think it does.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.270
And there's a science
how to leverage

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.535
social to create change.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.750
One of the studies that
we do in our research--

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.350
I created what's called
the Hope Intervention.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.200
Hope Intervention is
an online community

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.870
where it's designed
to motivate people

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.940
to change their behavior.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.870
We invite people to a
12-week intervention.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.630
And we have found that
these interventions

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.230
to change people's behavior
across different areas--

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.130
drug use, HIV, different
types of behaviors--

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.470
we find that within 12
weeks, we can get people

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.650
to change their behavior.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.320
And it leverages the
force of community

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.040
through these
online communities.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.740
We find that people in
our Hope Interventions

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.140
are about two to three
times as likely to change

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.650
their behavior.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.980
Now I stands for "Important."

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.590
People won't do things
unless they want to do it,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.700
unless they're motivated, right?

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.150
Yes, but no, not necessarily.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.280
Motivation definitely
matters, and that's

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.800
why it's up here as one
of these seven forces.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.610
But people actually don't
need to be motivated

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.780
in order to stick with things.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.290
So I'll give an example
from the Hope Intervention

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.890
that I was mentioning.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.150
We did a Hope
Intervention on trying

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:11.280
to get people at high risk
for HIV to get an HIV test.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.070
They weren't interested
in getting an HIV test.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.640
We had them sign
up for our group.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.320
They took a survey.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.580
We paid them to take a survey.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.788
And then we said, all right,
you guys are free to go.

00:22:22.788 --> 00:22:25.500
You don't need to be in
this community anymore.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.340
It was up to us to keep them
engaged, keep them motivated.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:35.320
Well, by the end of the study,
people in our Hope group

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.830
were much more likely, two
to three times as likely,

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.070
as people who weren't
to test for HIV.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.180
They still weren't interested,
necessarily, in testing,

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.800
but we got them to test.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.540
So the point is important
and motivation matters,

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.720
but if we're using
the other forces,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.440
we can often get
people to do things,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.625
even if they're not motivated
to do that thing themselves.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.070
Now E stands for "Easy."

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.920
If we can make something
easier for people

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.650
to do than for
them not to do it,

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.900
or easier for ourselves
to do than to not do,

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.230
people will do it.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.960
It's that simple.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:26.650
Just like we can get
people to do easy things

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.470
by changing around
our environment,

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.270
we can do that with behaviors.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:36.850
In this chapter on easy, I talk
about some business examples

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.360
of how businesses were
able to make things easy.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.300
So who's heard the
story of Joe Coulombe?

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:53.450
So if you guys ask someone
about the story of--

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:57.140
let's see, what time is it?

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.932
OK, we've got time.

00:23:57.932 --> 00:23:59.056
Let me tell you this story.

00:23:59.056 --> 00:23:59.900
It's a good story.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:05.330
So Joe Coulombe-- and
this took place in 1958,

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.070
in the late 1950s--

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.830
he had graduated from
Stanford School of Business,

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.300
from the GSB.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.150
And he went to go work for
a company called Owl Rexall.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:19.340
Owl Rexall was a grocery
chain, grocery store chain.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.590
And what they told
him is, hey, Joe,

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.330
we want you to go
off on your own

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.320
and start this new chain
of stores called Pronto.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.030
So he starts Pronto.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.620
But Pronto is struggling.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.420
He wasn't doing well.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.590
The reason is there was this
other competitor grocery

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.450
store that had just
come out, and they

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.730
were doing really well.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.350
They were called 7-Eleven.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.550
So 7-Eleven was open
at unprecedented hours.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.470
They were open 7:00
AM to 11:00 PM.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.480
They were offering
all kinds of products.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.330
Joe and Pronto couldn't compete.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.900
So Owl Rexall said,
it's not working.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.960
Let's axe Pronto, and we'll
do something else, Joe.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.100
But Joe didn't want to do that.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.650
He left work from Owl Rexall,
and he mortgaged his house,

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.750
and decides he's going to go
on his own and save Pronto.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.590
But he didn't know how to do it.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.650
So he says, OK, I'm going to
take a vacation, meanwhile.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.250
I'm going to go to the
Caribbean and think this over.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.650
While he's in the
Caribbean, he's relaxing,

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.440
he's laying by the beach.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.090
People are bringing
him Mai Tais.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.410
He's drinking.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.970
They're bringing him food.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.350
He's listening to calypso
and reggae music there.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.640
And he realizes, this is a
pretty sweet setup for someone

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.020
who's on vacation.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.300
They're making it pretty
easy for tourists to be here.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.950
Maybe there's something that
I can do with this lifestyle,

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.480
with this making it easy, and I
can bring this back to Pronto.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.190
So that's what he does.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.510
So he goes back home.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.540
And compared to
competitor stores,

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:03.250
which were offering 10
different types of mayonnaise,

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.750
13 types of bread, a ton of
different product choices, Joe

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.961
decides, I'm going
to have just one.

00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:12.460
I'm going to make it easy for
people when they come in here.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.720
They're going to know
what they can purchase.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.970
And it worked.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:16.690
It worked.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.810
People started not only
coming into his stores,

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.170
but they kept on buying,
and it kept on working.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.080
And Pronto stores, which
ultimately changed their name,

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.790
became a huge lasting success.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.090
They're still around today.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:35.591
Anyone have an idea of
what the store chain is?

00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:36.090
You got it.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.440
Say it louder.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.550
Trader Joe's.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.120
Exactly.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.327
So his name was Joe,
they're inspired by the trip

00:26:42.327 --> 00:26:43.035
to the Caribbean.

00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:45.940
So now, when you see
the Hawaiian shirts,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.960
it's from the story of Joe.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.610
Now Trader Joe's
isn't the only one

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.470
to leverage this force of easy.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.670
Think about Amazon.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.600
Amazon Prime, Amazon
Dash, makes shopping easy.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.885
You don't have to
leave your home.

00:27:03.885 --> 00:27:05.970
I don't go shopping
anywhere anymore,

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.830
just everything on Amazon.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.990
They can deliver to
you before you even

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.790
know what you want to order.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.380
That's pretty easy.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.240
Google, you guys have
actually done it too.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.770
And with some of
you in the group,

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.670
you may have been
involved in this.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.620
So Google, as you guys know,
one of the founding tenets,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.210
one of the benefits
of Google, is

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.820
that there's food everywhere.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:35.760
Well, that also can lead to
the Google 15 or the Google 20.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.900
And so Google found that their
employees were not as healthy

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.720
as they would like.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.070
So they decided, we're going to
change around the dining halls,

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.460
and make it so that we're going
to take the unhealthier foods

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.850
and put it in the back and
make them in containers

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.330
that aren't clear anymore.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.280
Had a big effect on
employee behavior,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.710
and on health, and on eating.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.770
So the force of easy
is a powerful way

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.960
to change people's behavior.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.516
Next, N stands for "Neurohacks."

00:28:08.516 --> 00:28:11.750
Neurohacks are quick
mental shortcuts

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.270
that can get us to
change our behavior.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:18.350
So just like hitting
Control-Alt-Delete on a PC

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.130
can allow us to use a
program that was jammed up

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.420
or reset things, neurohacks
allow us to reset our brain,

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.230
and allow us to think and
behave in ways that we

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.490
couldn't before.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.990
I'll give an example
of a neurohack.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.380
In the chapter on
neurohacks, I mention a story

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.810
by a man named Mauricio.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.860
So Mauricio was a designer.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.450
He was in a funk though.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.490
He had just gotten a divorce.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:50.500
He didn't feel motivated
to be a designer anymore.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.230
He didn't feel
like going to work.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.330
But he didn't know what to do.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.850
But he got an idea while
he was at work one day.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.070
He came across the
familiar screen

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.350
of it's flashing in
front of him, saying,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.390
you need to change
your password.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.660
And he says, I'm going to use
my password to change my life

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.999
and get me out of this funk.

00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:09.790
So what does he do?

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.780
So he says, I'm going to change
my password to the number

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.060
"4 get her."

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.820
"4get her."

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.360
Forget her.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.760
Or sorry, not--

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.770
"4give her."

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.630
"4give her."

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.220
So forgive her.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:34.490
So he decides, I'm going to,
every day, have to type "4give

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:39.410
her," and that'll get me
to be able to forgive her

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.670
for what's happened.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.170
And when he first started doing
it, it was pretty difficult.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.480
You can imagine, he's
going through this divorce,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.460
he's having a tough time, and
now he has to type "4give her."

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.980
So the first few times, it was
difficult. But what he found

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:59.920
is that as he kept typing "4give
her," it became easier to do.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.210
He didn't have these
terrible feelings

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:04.307
that he thought he would.

00:30:04.307 --> 00:30:06.640
He didn't have to change his
password to something else.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.120
He could continue doing this.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.240
And it just reset his
brain and made him think,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.260
I'm getting over her.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.240
I'm forgiving her.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.370
I'm forgetting.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.580
And I'm moving on.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.770
And he has moved on since.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.250
It was a neurohack that
allowed him to move on.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.450
But he didn't just stop there.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.670
He also was smoking, and
he changed his password

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.610
to "quit smoking."

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.730
And he told me that he
quit smoking overnight.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.670
Five years later, he
hasn't been smoking since.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.706
That's the power of neurohacks.

00:30:43.706 --> 00:30:47.670
C stands for "Captivating."

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.100
We know that we should
reward ourselves,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.820
we should reward people
for doing things in order

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.340
to create lasting change.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.680
But rewards don't always work.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.590
Think about the
gamification fad,

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.320
which has kind of fizzled out.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.240
So rewards work, but not
always, because not all types

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.980
of rewards work.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.040
Not everyone's motivated
by points, and badges,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.930
and leaderboards.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:22.200
Now we need not just any
reward, but we need a reward

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.690
that's truly captivating.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.730
It's got to be
important to people.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.860
Different things are
motivating to different people.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.699
So this chapter will
talk about the history,

00:31:32.699 --> 00:31:34.240
and there's a long
history going back

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.090
about 100 years, of
how to motivate change

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.770
and how to create rewards.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.710
This chapter will talk about it.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.540
Finally, "E" stands
for "Engrained."

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.980
Barack Obama was
known for making

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.070
a routine out of the
clothes that he wore,

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.140
the food that he ate, so
that he could save time

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.080
for making important
decisions about our country.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:04.890
Mark Zuckerberg, he has 20
versions of the same shirt.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.730
Writer Ernest
Hemingway, he was known

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.750
for writing every day at the
same time in the morning.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.390
If you make something a routine,
it becomes easier to do,

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.450
and it gets engrained
in our brain.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:21.980
So those are the seven forces.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.280
That's the SCIENCE framework.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.730
And now, all need to do is--

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.460
now that we know the ABCs,
we know that three types

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.750
of behaviors, and we
know the seven forces,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:42.230
we just need to know which
of the seven forces do we use

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.730
and when.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:51.460
So I created a
simple 2-step model.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.720
It's pretty easy.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.140
Step one, identify
whether something

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.340
is an A, B, or C behavior.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.360
And second, apply the
forces needed to change

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.290
that type of behavior.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:13.540
So this is what I call the
Science of Lasting Change.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.400
And here's the figure.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.320
You can see that, first, there's
automatic behaviors, burning

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.540
behaviors, and common behaviors.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.630
Automatic behaviors, we're
not aware of what we're doing,

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.020
so there's no brain in
the stick figure's head.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.170
Burning behaviors, we're
a little bit more aware.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.860
And then common behaviors,
we're fully aware.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.560
And as you can see,
the seven forces

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.840
are listed down at the bottom.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.190
And the more stars next to
that force, the more important

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.910
it is for changing
that type of behavior.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:53.650
In general, as we get more
complicated types of behaviors,

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:58.180
as we get more aware of it,
we need a larger set of tools

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.790
to change those
types of behaviors.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.740
We need more forces.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:09.310
Now this framework is something
that I've put together

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.550
based on decades of
scientific research

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.639
from other scientists,
and psychologists,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.790
and from our own work.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:22.310
I found that this works across
a number of different areas.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.940
We've used them in
the medical school.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.670
And we've used it and
applied it to people at risk

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:29.250
for diseases where we
need to change health.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.260
I've found that it
works in my own life

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.400
for personal behaviors.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.810
And it works in business
work that I do too.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.260
So this gives you a
high level overview.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.460
And if there are more
questions, the book

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.075
goes into a lot more detail
about this framework.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.320
But what I want to do now,
the purpose of this talk,

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.400
I want to leave you guys with
understanding the difference

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.050
between A, B, and C behaviors.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.310
So what I'd like to do
now as a type of Q&amp;A

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.820
is have someone come
up here, and we'll

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.260
talk about whether your behavior
is an A, B, or C behavior.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.600
But first, everyone
pull out your cards

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.560
that we had at the beginning,
and raise your hand if you

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.670
wrote down an A behavior.

00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:25.010
OK.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.375
Raise your hand if you
wrote down a B behavior.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.225
Half of you have hands halfway.

00:35:32.225 --> 00:35:33.400
Yeah, I think so.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.820
Good.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.542
What's the B behavior?

00:35:37.542 --> 00:35:39.510
AUDIENCE: [COUGH]

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.426
SEAN YOUNG: Coughing.

00:35:40.426 --> 00:35:42.210
AUDIENCE: Brushing
teeth at lunchtime.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.630
SEAN YOUNG: Brushing your
teeth at lunchtime, OK.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:49.260
And C behavior.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:49.770
Great.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.490
So what's the C
behavior you had?

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.379
AUDIENCE: Making music.

00:35:55.379 --> 00:35:56.420
SEAN YOUNG: Making music.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:56.920
Excellent.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.080
That's one after my own heart.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:05.630
All right, so just to
settle it in and make

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.050
sure we understand
the difference,

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.390
let's call someone up.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.180
Can I get a brave
volunteer to come up

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.947
here and walk through it?

00:36:12.947 --> 00:36:14.780
All right, thanks for
coming up here, Chris.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.280
CHRIS: Sure.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.680
SEAN YOUNG: So tell us
about your behavior.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.590
CHRIS: Well, I'm really
into dark chocolate,

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:25.100
and unfortunately, I'm
into it at nighttime.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.800
And the darker the
better, so I tend

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.080
to eat it before I
go to bed, and then I

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.080
fall asleep until 3:00
o'clock, and then I'm up.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.480
So it's a pretty
common behavior,

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.790
but sometimes, it feels burning,
like I just have to have it,

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.050
because I get a lift.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.314
Sometimes, I can get
a little work done.

00:36:44.314 --> 00:36:45.230
SEAN YOUNG: Excellent.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.450
So you're already
thinking about it.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.270
So here's a chart.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:54.770
I was going to ask, do we think
it's an A, B, or C behavior?

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.920
So if it's done without
awareness-- so the behavior

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.470
he mentioned was
late night snacks

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.290
and eating chocolate
at nighttime.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.080
If it's done without awareness--

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.930
I'm with you, my guess is
that it's a C behavior.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.790
But let's just go
through for example.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.370
So it would be an A behavior
if you're not even aware.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.480
You're almost
either sleepwalking,

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.210
or you're just going in
there, grabbing chocolate.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.720
Sounds like you're aware
of what you're doing.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.391
CHRIS: Oh, I always
know what I'm doing.

00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:25.890
SEAN YOUNG: You
want that chocolate.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.473
Don't keep me away
from the chocolate.

00:37:27.473 --> 00:37:28.200
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.500
SEAN YOUNG: It would
be a B behavior--

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.150
does it feel almost
like an addiction?

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.580
Does it feel like you
can't stop yourself?

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.080
CHRIS: When I'm
really stressed out,

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.119
it feels like I
can't stop myself.

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:41.660
SEAN YOUNG: When you're really
stressed out, you can't do it.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.920
And in general,
it's something where

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.840
you're aware of
what you're doing,

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.500
but it's just there
are other things that

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.570
are driving you toward it.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.070
You're aware of
what you're doing,

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:56.450
but you really
want the chocolate

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:57.980
and feel like you should eat it.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.170
CHRIS: Well, it tastes
good, and I get a lift.

00:38:02.462 --> 00:38:03.170
SEAN YOUNG: Good.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.140
I would call that a
common behavior too.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:11.570
But this is a good example,
because some behaviors,

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.840
based on the person or
based on the behavior,

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.260
it can be in
different categories.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.480
And we'll use different
solutions to address it.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.240
So let's talk about
how to address it.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.820
Let's go back here.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.900
So as you'll see,
common behaviors,

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.030
Community has three stars.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.580
So that makes it
really important

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.270
if we can include community,
that will help out a lot.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.820
So the question is, do
you live with anyone?

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.450
CHRIS: I do.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.408
SEAN YOUNG: You do, OK.

00:38:41.408 --> 00:38:42.370
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.520
SEAN YOUNG: So the
person who you live with,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.424
do they also eat chocolate?

00:38:48.424 --> 00:38:50.090
CHRIS: She eats a lot
of sugar at night.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.980
I feel like I'm a little
more disciplined than she is,

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.470
but she doesn't have
any issues with it.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:03.310
She can just have her sweet
stuff, and she'll go to sleep.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:07.750
SEAN YOUNG: So you guys see the
challenge that's confronted?

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.730
That's one of the
difficult parts.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:14.560
If you're living with someone,
and that person has no problem

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.270
with the behavior
that they're doing,

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.220
and you have a problem
when you're doing it,

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.970
it can make it difficult.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:27.610
So one, this is where
discussions come in.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.210
Would she be willing to change?

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.970
Could you have this discussion
with her where both of you guys

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:38.280
could slow down or stop
eating late night chocolate?

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.720
And if not, it's fine
if the answer is no.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.430
But that's a first solution.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.970
CHRIS: Well, she tends to
stay up later and watch TV,

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:51.550
so we could have hours where she
eats her stuff, and I eat mine.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.920
SEAN YOUNG: Got it, OK.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.310
So that's a more difficult one.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:04.600
But what we can do is
Easy is very important.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.850
Is there a way for
you to be able-- it

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.760
sounds like she eats her sweets,
but for you, it's chocolate.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.510
Is there a way for
you to either just get

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.270
the chocolate out of the house,
not have chocolate around?

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.730
CHRIS: Well, I've moved
it out of the office

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.577
and into the pantry.

00:40:19.577 --> 00:40:20.410
SEAN YOUNG: Perfect.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.430
CHRIS: So I have to go
downstairs to do it.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.460
So it's further away.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.640
SEAN YOUNG: Excellent.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.290
So that's an example of,
if it's further away,

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.720
then it's going to
be harder to do,

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.520
it's not going to be
as easy, and you'll

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.990
be less likely to do it.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.050
And how has that
worked out for you?

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.970
CHRIS: It's lessened the intake.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.880
SEAN YOUNG: Great.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.340
So the next step would be, can
you get it out of the house

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.860
completely?

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.290
CHRIS: Uh, that--

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.110
SEAN YOUNG: I don't
want to do that?

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:59.830
CHRIS: I don't really want to,
but I can for periods of time.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.910
And then I feel like
I have to sort of--

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.430
I just have to have some.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.230
SEAN YOUNG: So if
you can make it

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.180
where you have to
go to the store

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.319
in order to get
the chocolate, that

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:14.610
will lessen the amount of
chocolate that you're eating.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.170
That's a simple one that
definitely makes it easy.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.120
Also, are there
other kinds of foods

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.670
that you would like that you
can put, other than chocolate,

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.794
you can make closer to you?

00:41:25.794 --> 00:41:27.610
So when you're sitting
around, watching TV,

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.047
can you put food in front of
you, other than chocolate,

00:41:30.047 --> 00:41:32.130
that you would eat, and
it would just fill you up?

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.480
CHRIS: Yeah, I like fruit,
and that won't keep me awake.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.050
SEAN YOUNG: Great, great.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.910
So that's another example
of how we can use Easy.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.300
We can do this in
a gradual process,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.872
like don't just necessarily
throw all the chocolate out

00:41:45.872 --> 00:41:47.830
of the house if you don't
think that will work.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.560
But you can start with just
putting fruit in front of you,

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.510
and eating the
fruit or other food.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.830
And what you'll find is that
as that becomes a routine,

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.170
it will become
engrained in your brain.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.970
Every day, you'll
start doing it.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.830
And it'll become a neurohack.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:05.950
So you might think, I'm not
capable of stopping myself

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:07.300
from eating chocolate.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.540
But as you see, day after
day, that you're eating fruit

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.910
instead, you'll realize,
there's nothing wrong with me.

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.290
It's not like I'm just wired
to have to have this chocolate.

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.740
But you're capable of doing it.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.180
And it will reset your brain
and reset your behavior.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:27.070
So these are the
ways of incorporating

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:36.010
the Science of Lasting Change,
and this is a quick example

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.230
of a Stick With It session.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:44.070
So let's all give Chris a hand
for coming up here, being brave

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.100
for doing that.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.030
Thanks so much, Chris.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.972
CHRIS: Thank you.

00:42:52.144 --> 00:42:53.060
SEAN YOUNG: All right.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:02.980
Now before we end off,
after all, I'm a teacher,

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.520
so I can't have you guys
leave here without giving you

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.590
an assignment.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.780
Now just for showing
up here today,

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.760
you guys have already activated
some of the important forces

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.540
for lasting change in being able
to change the behavior that you

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.560
wrote down.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.460
And what we want to do is
keep that energy going,

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.840
keep the motivation going,
and keep the forces.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.680
So with this take
home assignment,

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.310
this is something to do
immediately, to do today.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.950
What I want you to do
is take the behavior

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.260
that you wrote down
on the card, and I

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.005
want you to tell someone else.

00:43:45.005 --> 00:43:48.170
It could be a coworker,
could be a friend,

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.830
could be a romantic partner,
could be a stranger.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.230
I want you to tell
them, do you think

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:57.830
the behavior is an A, B,
or C behavior, and why?

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.210
Why do you think that?

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.580
And just by going through
this process of discussing it

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.890
with them, it helps to
reinforce in your head--

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:08.090
it will teach you how
to know the difference

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.280
and will keep the energy going.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.510
Second, please email
me and let me know.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:19.356
You can reach me at
seanyoungphd.com,

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:22.760
or on Twitter, @SeanYoungPhD.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.480
Tell me whether you think
it's an A, B, or C behavior,

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.890
and why.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:31.820
Now I went into this
area because I really

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.420
wanted to be able to have
an impact on the world

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.830
and to help people, so
please reach out to me.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.780
I really want to be able
to try to help with this.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:49.490
Now before I finish off,
I have good news to share,

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.170
going back to the
story of my brother.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.330
In the years since
then, my brother

00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:01.010
has changed his behavior.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.370
Really healthy
eating, he exercises,

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:07.230
he takes his medication.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.780
He does everything that
he's supposed to do.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.580
And best of all,
he's really healthy.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.980
He's been feeling great, and
he's been doing really well.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.740
And since he's my
brother, I can pretend

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.330
to take some credit for that.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:28.460
So I'm going to leave you guys,
and if the information in here,

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.209
if this was helpful, if
you like this, hopefully,

00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:33.750
you learned something
and enjoyed it.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.110
If you did, there's
this great book

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:39.110
out here that you guys can
all read that will give you

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.060
more info about it.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.820
You're laughing at this pic.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.040
I think my favorite
thing about this picture

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.580
is that it makes me wonder
if the other photographer was

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.870
a cat wearing a
GoPro and taking it.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:59.440
This quote at the top, often,
when we're trying to do things,

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.470
we think that if we can't do
it, it's because we're not

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:05.529
motivated enough, because
we're not inspired,

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:06.820
we don't have enough willpower.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.880
But those are
temporary feelings.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.410
They come, and they go.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:18.830
So we can't have behaviors
last just based on inspiration.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:24.110
What we need is to have a
process that, doesn't matter

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:25.940
how we're feeling
at the time, we'll

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.280
be able to follow that process.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:34.600
So that's where I say,
motivation, inspiration,

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:39.040
and willpower are
temporary feelings.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.350
The secret to sticking
with something

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:47.260
is to use a process that you can
follow, no matter how you feel.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.640
You guys have been
a great audience.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.430
Thank you so much
for inviting me here.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.530
And I look forward
to hearing from you.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.880
[APPLAUSE]
