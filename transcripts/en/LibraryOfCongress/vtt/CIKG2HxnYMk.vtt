&gt;&gt;VOICEOVER: From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.270
RUTH: When I lost my sight,
the only thing I had was

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.130
reading. And it was like therapy
to me.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.400
JOY: BARD is this beautiful
web-based program for searching

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.200
for books and for the ability to
download them.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.000
EDDIE: I just can't recommend
it enough. It's a free service.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.670
It's amazing how much
you can get.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.800
HERB: They'll list different
kinds of fiction, like

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.130
historical fiction, gothic
novels, popular fiction,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.700
classical fiction.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.100
EDDIE: Now, this next step with
BARD Mobile has just been a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.570
tremendous innovation.
Smartphone technology has just

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.570
been a godsend.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.130
MARY: It's actually very simple.
You open the app and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.670
it's completely accessible with
voiceover and magnification and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.670
all of that.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.400
RUTH: I can just independently
go and choose the books,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.100
download it, and start reading.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.200
MELANIE: I generally have a
cell phone with me, so to me

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.600
it's really nice to be able to
have the books on my phone.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.270
TERIANA: I'm a big reader, but
I don't sit still. I'd rather

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.200
take the book with me and read
it when I'm going somewhere.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.800
RUTH: BARD Mobile is one of
the best things that the library

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.200
could have ever done.
