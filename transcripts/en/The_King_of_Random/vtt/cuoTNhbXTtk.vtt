In today's video,

00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:03.300
we are taking a look at
how to make frozen bubbles

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.600
in the super chilled
environment indoors.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.120
[Music]

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.900
Guys, you may have seen
videos on YouTube

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.226
where people have been able
to freeze bubbles outdoors

00:00:16.226 --> 00:00:17.500
in extremely cold conditions.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
Well, I want to try that today.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.800
Only problem is,
it's not that cold outside.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.963
So we're going to try

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:25.400
it indoors using
a few different ingredients.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.800
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:30.300
Using liquid nitrogen, dry ice,
and regular bubble solution,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.372
we are going to see if we
can freeze bubbles indoors.

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:34.200
If that works,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.800
we're going to scale it up with
some different kinds of bubbles.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.600
To start off,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.200
we have to make
our bubble solution.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.700
So I have seen different recipes

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
online of how to make
the best bubbles for freezing.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.200
Now, what I'm going to start out
with is dish soap, glycerin,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.697
and some actual bubble mixture,
and see if we can get something

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:50.800
that's going to actually
hold its shape and freeze.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.155
As you may have seen
in the past,

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.463
we are just making a solution
starting out with water.

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:57.300
We're going to add a little bit
of actual bubble solution,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840
some glycerin to help with
surface tension of the bubbles,

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:00.866
and Dawn dish soap.

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.800
You don't really need more
than a few drops of glycerin.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.990
It'll go a long way.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.720
As for Dawn dish soap,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300
I've got about a half a cup
of water here so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.360
I'm going to add maybe
a tablespoon and a half.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.420
[Music]

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.700
All right. Well, that part's easy.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.450
So in the past,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.332
you may have seen that Grant
is actually floated bubbles

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:21.800
on top of dry ice in a bowl.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.000
So we're going to start out
with that concept.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.660
We can get the bubbles
to float over the surface,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.400
but I need them to actually
touch down and freeze.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.568
They may freeze
to dry ice sometimes,

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:35.160
but it's not necessarily
as cold as we need it to be,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.700
so we're going to add
some liquid nitrogen.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.600
So I only needed
a little bit of dry ice.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.680
I really like dry ice.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.260
So just to start out with,
add a little bit of water,

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:49.000
and I just want to get
those vapors a little thicker.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.840
[Music]

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.500
That's what they're
supposed to do.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.400
Perfect.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.310
We've had a few little
floating bubbles now.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.900
Now, a couple of bubbles
that are actually

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.000
trying to settle on the surface
of the solidified dry ice here.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.700
So we can get those bubbles
to more or less hover in place,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.200
resting on the carbon dioxide.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800
Now, what we want is actually
to get them to freeze.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
So there's a few things
that I want to take into account

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.400
if I want to try and freeze
the bubbles in this bowl.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.713
Now, they are floating
on top of the carbon dioxide,

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:18.800
and some of them are even
touching the dry ice,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.700
but they're not getting cold
enough to freeze.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.900
So if I want to add
liquid nitrogen to this,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.700
we're still going
to have a slight problem.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.900
They may touch things,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.100
and they may pop,
and I don't want that to happen.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
Bubbles actually
like soft fabric.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.436
They'll land on it,
and they won't necessarily pop.

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:34.400
So we're going to pour
some liquid nitrogen

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.500
into the bowl with the dry ice,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.693
put a towel over the top
to create a super

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:41.068
chilled ambient environment
for these bubbles,

00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:42.940
and hopefully freeze
them on contact.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.500
See if we can make this work.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.000
[Music]

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.500
Okay.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.200
Well first off,
that just makes me happy.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.440
[Music]

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.300
Perfect.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.400
Already, this towel is too cold
for me to comfortably touch,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.620
which is awesome.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.278
I can't leave there
for more than a few seconds.

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:07.500
So that should be cold enough

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.200
for us to freeze
some bubbles in.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.500
Let's find out.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.200
We've got a few.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.900
We've got one, stayed.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.050
Oh, it froze!

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.722
It froze!

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:21.491
It broke, but it froze.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.040
It's sort of froze
as it was breaking.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.020
That's a frozen bubble
in the kitchen.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.900
So we're going
to try that again.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.191
I want to get this down
to a perfect art form.

00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:33.100
I want these bubbles
to land in there,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.461
to freeze without popping.

00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:35.300
So we're gonna need more

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.800
liquid nitrogen, and I'm going
to need some more dry ice.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.920
[Music]

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.200
That's very cold.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.580
[Music]

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.800
Wow, even up there,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.500
it's already freezing
a little bit.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.660
[Music]

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.300
Okay, don't float
away that fast.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.480
[Music]

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.620
Holy cow!

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.560
Even around the edges,
like a full half bubble here.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.240
This bubble's actually
holding the vapor

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.240
from the dry ice inside it.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.400
As the surface of the towel
is getting covered in soap,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.568
and as it's freezing,

00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:20.900
it's no longer that soft surface
that bubbles want to stick to.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.100
I'm not really sure
what to do about that.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.561
So I'm going to
try something else.

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:26.660
I want to blow a bubble,
see if I can catch it,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.000
and actually lower it down.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.700
This is going to be very cold,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.200
but I think I
can make it work,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.800
because I've got
some fleece-lined gloves.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.460
So those should be
pretty good perfect.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.780
[Music]

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.800
Guys, if this works,
I'm going to be thrilled.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.840
I had a frozen bubble
in my hand.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.900
That was the coolest.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.120
I'm doing that again.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.880
[Music]

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.780
All right, right off the bat,
it's not cold enough,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.000
because I've got
my hand resting on the towel.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.300
It did freeze.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.680
You just see it's just
sort of shrinking apart.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.000
If you've ever blown
a bubble, you know,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.500
that's not normally
what they do.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.000
They don't do
this awesome cracking thing.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.960
[Music]

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.200
As much as we love
our nitrile black gloves,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.000
they do not mix well
with the bubbles.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.720
[Music]

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.800
Froze my fingers
through the glove.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.700
Oh, that was fun.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.400
Okay.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.680
Moving on.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.260
[Music]

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.680
That bubble froze
while floating.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.380
It's still floating,
and it's frozen.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.100
So I have to blow a bubble,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.300
catch it, lower my hand
into liquid nitrogen,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.700
and then grab the light
so we can see it.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.700
It's not a stressful
thing at all,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.200
as I hold the
bubble one backwards.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.200
All right.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.040
Tiny bubble.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.780
[Music]

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.960
It froze.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.840
Awesome.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.120
So you can freeze
bubbles in your hand.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.300
Oh, and as soon as I take it out
of that really cold environment,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.500
down it goes.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.520
Nice.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:34.300
[Music]

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.060
Hey guys, so I steal Nate.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.899
So we have this idea

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:39.300
where we're actually making
the air super chilled

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.950
as it's blowing
into the bubbles.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.500
That way, the gases inside
aren't going to contract.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.012
So that way,

00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:46.400
when they hit the carbon dioxide
and the liquid nitrogen,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.700
they're less likely
to pop in the bowl.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:07:09.140
[Music]

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.140
As soon as it touches,
just just my fingertip,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.400
is enough to warm it up
and break that shell.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.600
That was awesome.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.600
We are able to freeze bubbles
in a bowl in the kitchen.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.894
I want to try a few
other types of bubbles.

00:07:20.894 --> 00:07:21.600
In the past,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.700
we have made bubbles filled
with carbon dioxide.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.229
I want to see if we can make
those bubbles full of the vapor.

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.000
See if we can freeze those two.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.800
All right.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.600
So we have a few obstacles

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.891
that are going to make this
a little bit more difficult.

00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:36.100
Normally, when you have dry ice
in a closed container,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.450
to build up enough pressure

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.600
for it to actually blow bubbles
through the tubing,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600
you need to put hot water
in the dry ice.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.619
As we've already seen,

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:44.399
our bubbles are
lasting a lot better

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:47.200
when we are blowing super
chilled air into the bubble

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.300
itself before it lands
in the container.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.000
So I don't want to use
hot air to cause the vapor

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.670
that's going to make the bubble.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.400
I'm hoping if I
add enough dry ice,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.000
we can still build up
enough pressure with cold water,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.520
makes them decently chilled

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.100
bubbles before they ever even
touch the liquid nitrogen.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.440
So just with that amount
of dry ice and dry ice powder,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.400
we're actually already
getting a nice sublimation.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.100
So this should actually work.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:15.800
[Music]

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.593
Let's get more liquid
nitrogen in here.

00:08:17.593 --> 00:08:19.430
See if we can free
some boo bubbles.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.800
All right.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.400
I'm going to try something
different this time.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.600
I'm not going to put the towel
down to try and catch it.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.800
I'm going to try and just
hold one of the boo bubbles,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.680
lower my hand down,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.300
not touch the surface
of the liquid nitrogen,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.500
and see if I can get it
to freeze in my hand.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:38.480
[Music]

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.920
Oh my gosh, you guys.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.160
It worked!

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.210
It worked!

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.120
I mean, it broke really quickly,
but it worked.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.900
So we're going to do it again
until we get it right.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.860
[Music]

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.220
That was awesome.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.000
So interestingly, enough,
these ones are hissing

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.800
when they hit.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.881
All right, we're going to try
and cover this up, and see

00:08:57.881 --> 00:09:00.000
if we can see it on the black
fabric a little bit better.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.800
Now, these aren't going
to necessarily float,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.877
because this is you know,

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.300
carbon dioxide
and carbon dioxide.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.200
I'm just hoping

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.500
that they won't break
on contact with a fabric.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:21.740
[Music]

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.800
I got one.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.780
That was amazing.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.380
[Music]

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.500
This is like the strangest type,
real fact of making sure

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.974
that this water is hot enough
to actually make enough vapor,

00:09:36.974 --> 00:09:38.343
make sure that this
is cold enough,

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:38.917
and make sure

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.500
that the two are actually going
to work together.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.600
But we can do it.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.820
There, got one.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:52.200
[Music]

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.000
All right.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.877
My favorite part about
these bubbles that are full

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:56.077
of the carbon dioxide is

00:09:56.077 --> 00:09:57.700
that they are hissing
is they break.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.580
I wasn't hearing that sound
from the last ones,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.340
and that's just awesome.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.220
[Music]

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.600
That's just cool.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.180
So now, I have just an entire
pile of frozen bubbles.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.500
And when I try
and lift them out,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.600
and they're just going
to melt apart in my hands

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.500
when I pull them out of
this super chilled environment.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:21.800
[Music]

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.580
Bubble Glass.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.580
[Music]

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:25.776
That's awesome.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.120
[Music]

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.800
Can you freeze bubbles
in your kitchen?

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.700
Yes, you can,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.880
if you have access
to liquid nitrogen.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.110
So I was able to get this
to work with just dry ice too.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.200
You don't have nearly as high
of a success rate,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200
but you can get some

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.114
of those bubbles
to freeze on impact.

00:10:42.114 --> 00:10:42.700
If you try,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.600
if you managed to snag
a photo of that,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.106
we want to see.

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:48.620
Make sure to send us a photo
on Instagram, #THEKINGOFRANDOM.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.210
Guys, that's not all.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.890
You know we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.076
This box up here at the top will
take you to our latest video,

00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:56.191
and that box at the bottom is

00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.000
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.900
Hit that bomb the middle
to subscribe to the club.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.997
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:02.052
so you never miss
out on the fun,

00:11:02.052 --> 00:11:03.139
and we'll see you
