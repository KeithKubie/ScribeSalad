and we have to acknowledge like at what

concerted effort to really mark the
 

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.700
concerted effort to really mark the

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:02.710
pathways into the system and what's
 

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:04.380
pathways into the system and what's
happening with people once they perhaps

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:04.390
happening with people once they perhaps
 

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:06.540
