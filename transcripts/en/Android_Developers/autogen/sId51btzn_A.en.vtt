00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.035
 <i>Performance patterns</i> 

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.770
 From common sources of inconvenience 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.720
 For novice programmers and experts alike: threads. 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.120
 I'm Joanna Smith. 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.220
 Threads may be one of the biggest performance improvements 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.090
 Which you can do but it will also drive you crazy. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.340
 Tom Sawyer explained the threads an ideal explanation in the past 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.920
 When I needed to paint the fence. 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.780
 Because when you have to do a whole bunch of things over and over again, 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.360
 You call some friends to get it done quickly. 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.430
 So in the case of accounts that take a long time, 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.510
 Think about asking for reinforcements with threads. 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.690
 It is enabled by running many execution threads 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.850
 In your data set at the same time, 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.960
 Reduces the total time required to complete the task. 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.560
 With Android, threads become very important 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.180
 Because the entire application runs on the main thread 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.440
 Which is also called the User Interface Thread because it occurs. 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.090
 When the user interface stops responding, 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.940
 Users stop using your app. 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.470
 So when you want to perform a complex procedure 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.710
 In response to pressing a button, for example, 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.750
 You will need to stay away from the main thread 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 Until the procedure ends 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.140
 So the user can continue to interact with your application 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.740
 Few things are worse than the terrible application response dialog box. 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.540
 But integrate the threads into your system 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.890
 Something that weak-hearted people do not do. 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.320
 Because they will have to change their approach 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.160
 With computational complexity and memory model 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.260
 To be able to integrate the threads correctly. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.270
 So to avoid problems, 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.740
 Use the Android window 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.600
 Which is designed to help you. 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.900
 You will be able to think carefully and carefully plan your application structure and flow 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.690
 Determine if the thread should affect 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.020
 On the user interface or completely hidden. 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.280
 Helps APIs such as AsyncTask and Thread 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.171
 On the management of work and prevent the suspension of your application. 

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.682
 But AsyncTask will also let you influence the user interface 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.792
 When you want, for example, to display the progress dialog box. 

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:37.250
 So lose your own application 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.608
 Find out if there are places where it stops responding 

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:42.010
 Or its response to user actions is much slower. 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.040
 Then, separate all these additional actions from the main thread 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.690
 But thoughtfully. 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.510
 Changes are not made in an unplanned manner. 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.260
 Because while threads may be scary, 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.424
 It should not scare you. 

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.410
 What should really frighten is bad performance; 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.720
 So you'll lose the rest of your Android Performance Patterns 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.750
 Think about joining the G + forum for tips and help. 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.760
 But above all, bother and gather your code instructions 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.440
 Always remember that performance is important.
