00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:20.936
&gt;&gt;Nicole: So, we're getting to the end
of our festivals of light unit.

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:26.216
&gt;&gt;In this project, the students
explore different cultures

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:27.776
and world religions.

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:32.866
&gt;&gt;All of you have chosen a festival
to learn about, to research.

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:35.566
And now that we're getting
to the end of this unit,

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.626
we're going to do a
little bit of reflection.

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.946
&gt;&gt;All along, we do talk about things,

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:44.866
but I don't necessarily say
why exactly we're doing this

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.996
because I want it to
come together for them.

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.646
&gt;&gt;And so, your question to think

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:54.786
about in your journal is why
do you think we are learning

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.756
about different festivals
of light and people

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:00.876
of different religious backgrounds?

00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:05.576
&gt;&gt;For me, teaching tolerance
with kids is really important

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:08.636
and building empathy along the way...

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:11.516
yeah, it's part of being a
global citizen and how might

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:13.086
that affect the decisions we make.

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:18.726
&gt;&gt;If you're done, can you share with
us why do you think it's important

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:21.356
to learn about different cultures,

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:24.386
different religions
and things like that?

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:28.316
&gt;&gt;Student: I think we're learning
about different festivals of light

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:31.616
and different religious backgrounds
because if we ever met somebody

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:35.456
of that religion, not only do
you know some of their religions,

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:38.346
you would also know a
little about that somebody.

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:41.526
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Okay so, when you
have interactions with people,

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:44.636
you'll be able to know more about
them and be more comfortable.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.166
&gt;&gt;Student: I think that it
might be because if you go

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.406
to a different country, you don't
know what will might offend them

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:51.016
or something.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:53.026
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Right, that's...

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:55.126
you guys are getting really close.

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.726
You're really figuring this out.

00:01:56.976 --> 00:02:01.776
We talked about this a little bit
the other day, about this phrase.

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:06.716
I want to see if you remember this,
that it was global competence.

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:07.256
Can you say that?

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.866
&gt;&gt;All: Global competence.

00:02:10.136 --> 00:02:12.846
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Like any
kind of vocabulary,

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:16.196
if they have the experience,
the point of reference,

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.596
then they're able to
make that connection.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:22.176
Because they've been in a
school that's really emphasizing

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:22.946
global competence.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:27.896
&gt;&gt;What it means to be globally aware,

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.786
aware of what's happening
in the world.

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:35.086
&gt;&gt;When we worked on defining it
and putting terminology to it,

00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:36.636
they made the connection right away.

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:41.596
A globally competent person is
something that's very important,

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:46.956
but taking action is a piece
of that, is how do you go out

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:50.086
and help other people
be globally competent.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:54.206
&gt;&gt;And so, now it's our time
in this unit to take action.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:57.386
And the way that you are
going to take action is

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:59.216
through your presentations.

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:03.336
You are doing PowerPoint
presentations to teach others.

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:06.916
&gt;&gt;They present their
festivals of light.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:10.706
And they compare and contrast
it to their own culture

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.696
and whatever they celebrate.

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.256
We take action by teaching others.

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:16.416
We have a certain knowledge.

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:19.746
And now it's our responsibility to go
out and share that with other people

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:23.706
so that they can be exposed to the
things that we've learned about.
