Carl Lyman who is the 2001 Nobel
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.330
Carl Lyman who is the 2001 Nobel
laureate in physics and he has also

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
laureate in physics and he has also
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.070
laureate in physics and he has also
spent a quarter of a century thinking

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
spent a quarter of a century thinking
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.630
spent a quarter of a century thinking
about science education and how that

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
about science education and how that
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.250
about science education and how that
should proceed in the future so Carl

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
should proceed in the future so Carl
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:31.310
should proceed in the future so Carl
Wyman okay well I'm just going to to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
Wyman okay well I'm just going to to
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340
Wyman okay well I'm just going to to
talk a little bit about rethinking what

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
talk a little bit about rethinking what
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.530
talk a little bit about rethinking what
we really mean by intelligence and I'm

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
we really mean by intelligence and I'm
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.240
we really mean by intelligence and I'm
focusing on the the human aspect and my

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
focusing on the the human aspect and my
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.459
focusing on the the human aspect and my
main point is to think of it is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
main point is to think of it is
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440
main point is to think of it is
something that's really created rather

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
something that's really created rather
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.459
something that's really created rather
than some inherent characteristic and

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469
than some inherent characteristic and
 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.180
than some inherent characteristic and
I'm gonna start with a definition that

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190
I'm gonna start with a definition that
 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.580
I'm gonna start with a definition that
that I use which is really the ability

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
that I use which is really the ability
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.479
that I use which is really the ability
to do complex worthwhile cognitive tasks

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
to do complex worthwhile cognitive tasks
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.569
to do complex worthwhile cognitive tasks
worthwhile is judged by what people see

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
worthwhile is judged by what people see
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240
worthwhile is judged by what people see
as important so I have to say I don't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
as important so I have to say I don't
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.039
as important so I have to say I don't
rank jeopardy as very high on the

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049
rank jeopardy as very high on the
 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.300
rank jeopardy as very high on the
intelligence scale but looking at the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
intelligence scale but looking at the
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.710
intelligence scale but looking at the
human brain I mean it's been

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
human brain I mean it's been
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350
human brain I mean it's been
biologically it's been the same for you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
biologically it's been the same for you
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.410
biologically it's been the same for you
know many thousands of years and so that

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
know many thousands of years and so that
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359
know many thousands of years and so that
raises the question of can its

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
raises the question of can its
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.200
raises the question of can its
intelligent really be enhanced and the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
intelligent really be enhanced and the
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600
intelligent really be enhanced and the
argument I'm gonna make very briefly and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
argument I'm gonna make very briefly and
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.980
argument I'm gonna make very briefly and
not much nuance today is that yes it can

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
not much nuance today is that yes it can
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.450
not much nuance today is that yes it can
be by by enhancing the learning of it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
be by by enhancing the learning of it
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700
be by by enhancing the learning of it
and as we understand how the brain

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
and as we understand how the brain
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.530
and as we understand how the brain
functions and learns we can really

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
functions and learns we can really
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260
functions and learns we can really
enhance its learning and thereby its

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
enhance its learning and thereby its
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.340
enhance its learning and thereby its
ultimate intelligence so start with that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
ultimate intelligence so start with that
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.120
ultimate intelligence so start with that
there's a long history of people working

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
there's a long history of people working
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.630
there's a long history of people working
on developing ways to measure sort of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
on developing ways to measure sort of
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.270
on developing ways to measure sort of
basic ability and they're thinking

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
basic ability and they're thinking
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.999
basic ability and they're thinking
better is that natural ability or

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009
better is that natural ability or
 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.359
better is that natural ability or
intelligence IQ at some reason and then

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369
intelligence IQ at some reason and then
 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.469
intelligence IQ at some reason and then
establish from that what the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
establish from that what the
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.080
establish from that what the
corresponding limits are on people's

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
corresponding limits are on people's
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.070
corresponding limits are on people's
cognitive capacity and the idea that you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
cognitive capacity and the idea that you
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.820
cognitive capacity and the idea that you
can do this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
can do this
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130
can do this
frankly is mostly supported by a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
frankly is mostly supported by a
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.190
frankly is mostly supported by a
combination of myth and a mixing up a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
combination of myth and a mixing up a
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.710
combination of myth and a mixing up a
prediction with cause so you give a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
prediction with cause so you give a
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.160
prediction with cause so you give a
bunch of kids IQ tests and then the ones

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
bunch of kids IQ tests and then the ones
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.800
bunch of kids IQ tests and then the ones
that get a score high you give them

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
that get a score high you give them
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.900
that get a score high you give them
special teachers the ones low you give

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
special teachers the ones low you give
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.030
special teachers the ones low you give
them crummy teachers and then lo and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
them crummy teachers and then lo and
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.300
them crummy teachers and then lo and
behold later on the ones who scored low

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
behold later on the ones who scored low
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.000
behold later on the ones who scored low
in an IQ test do worse in school so you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010
in an IQ test do worse in school so you
 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.010
in an IQ test do worse in school so you
decide you have predictive ability

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
decide you have predictive ability
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.100
decide you have predictive ability
that's not of course that's cause not

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
that's not of course that's cause not
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.920
that's not of course that's cause not
really prediction effect and so the the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
really prediction effect and so the the
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.630
really prediction effect and so the the
overall evidence is that you can do this

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
overall evidence is that you can do this
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.440
overall evidence is that you can do this
is really basically weak and the reason

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
is really basically weak and the reason
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.300
is really basically weak and the reason
it's hard to do these kind of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310
it's hard to do these kind of
 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.000
it's hard to do these kind of
predictions is two reasons and I'm

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
predictions is two reasons and I'm
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.949
predictions is two reasons and I'm
coming at those as really the the basic

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
coming at those as really the the basic
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.390
coming at those as really the the basic
justification for my whole rethinking

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
justification for my whole rethinking
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.580
justification for my whole rethinking
about this problem is the the first

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590
about this problem is the the first
 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.620
about this problem is the the first
problem is that the results from your

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
problem is that the results from your
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.240
problem is that the results from your
tests they should correlate with

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
tests they should correlate with
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.190
tests they should correlate with
recognized worthwhile accomplishments

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
recognized worthwhile accomplishments
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.190
recognized worthwhile accomplishments
people can ultimately do and you'd like

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
people can ultimately do and you'd like
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.530
people can ultimately do and you'd like
them to correlate strongly these days

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
them to correlate strongly these days
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.540
them to correlate strongly these days
they're people who work in this they're

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550
they're people who work in this they're
 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.729
they're people who work in this they're
happy to get kind of any modest

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739
happy to get kind of any modest
 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.840
happy to get kind of any modest
predictive statistical capability but

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850
predictive statistical capability but
 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.479
predictive statistical capability but
secondly if the these IQ tests are going

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489
secondly if the these IQ tests are going
 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.790
secondly if the these IQ tests are going
to be measuring something fundamental

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800
to be measuring something fundamental
 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.180
to be measuring something fundamental
they they shouldn't be easy to improve

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190
they they shouldn't be easy to improve
 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.699
they they shouldn't be easy to improve
on just by practiced at the test and

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709
on just by practiced at the test and
 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.830
on just by practiced at the test and
both of these are quite hard to achieve

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
both of these are quite hard to achieve
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.979
both of these are quite hard to achieve
particularly the latter one and so this

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989
particularly the latter one and so this
 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.890
particularly the latter one and so this
is an example of what sort of I'd say

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
is an example of what sort of I'd say
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.440
is an example of what sort of I'd say
good or among the best results in this

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450
good or among the best results in this
 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.170
good or among the best results in this
field of person looking at people's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180
field of person looking at people's
 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.110
field of person looking at people's
performance on this complex video game

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
performance on this complex video game
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.140
performance on this complex video game
this is a air traffic controller

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
this is a air traffic controller
 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.320
this is a air traffic controller
simulation having people practice this

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330
simulation having people practice this
 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.660
simulation having people practice this
over time and seeing how much this a

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670
over time and seeing how much this a
 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.850
over time and seeing how much this a
collection people how much better they

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860
collection people how much better they
 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.220
collection people how much better they
get here and having given a whole bunch

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
get here and having given a whole bunch
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.890
get here and having given a whole bunch
of tests of ability and IQ that seem

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900
of tests of ability and IQ that seem
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.100
of tests of ability and IQ that seem
related to this and you know this is the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110
related to this and you know this is the
 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.620
related to this and you know this is the
average but with in here there's plus my

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630
average but with in here there's plus my
 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.380
average but with in here there's plus my
is 10% or so fluctuation and these

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390
is 10% or so fluctuation and these
 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.690
is 10% or so fluctuation and these
initial tests can predict about 25

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
initial tests can predict about 25
 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.510
initial tests can predict about 25
percent of that variation so in this

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520
percent of that variation so in this
 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.400
percent of that variation so in this
field so that sounds good

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410
field so that sounds good
 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.330
field so that sounds good
but then you think about

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340
but then you think about
 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.420
but then you think about
the effect of practice here is far more

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430
the effect of practice here is far more
 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.500
the effect of practice here is far more
than that amount of variation and so the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510
than that amount of variation and so the
 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.190
than that amount of variation and so the
the whole point I'm getting at is really

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200
the whole point I'm getting at is really
 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.740
the whole point I'm getting at is really
practice always and as as it does in

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750

and it gets the and it gets even worse

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050
and it gets the and it gets even worse
 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.890
and it gets the and it gets even worse
in terms of how poorly the predictions

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900
in terms of how poorly the predictions
 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.810
in terms of how poorly the predictions
are compared the impact of practice as

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820
are compared the impact of practice as
 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.020
are compared the impact of practice as
the tasks get more complex and as the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030
the tasks get more complex and as the
 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.670
the tasks get more complex and as the
learning takes longer and so the the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680
learning takes longer and so the the
 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.420
learning takes longer and so the the
basic point I want to make is that

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430
basic point I want to make is that
 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.980
basic point I want to make is that
really there may be other things that

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.250
skills that we can reach higher levels
 

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.280
skills that we can reach higher levels
more rapidly

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.290
more rapidly
 

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.890
more rapidly
make this much more widespread above a

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:55.900
make this much more widespread above a
 

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.790
make this much more widespread above a
population ultimately really reaching

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800
population ultimately really reaching
 

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.850
population ultimately really reaching
higher levels than of expertise than we

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:02.860
higher levels than of expertise than we
 

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.760
higher levels than of expertise than we
have now and then ultimately this really

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:05.770
have now and then ultimately this really
 

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.570
have now and then ultimately this really
does mean increased human intelligence

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580
does mean increased human intelligence
 

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.700
does mean increased human intelligence
thank you
