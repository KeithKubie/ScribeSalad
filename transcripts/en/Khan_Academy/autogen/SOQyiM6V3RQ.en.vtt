00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.950
 In the video about dehydration 

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.590
 we saw that we could start with a glucose molecule 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.820
 and by dehydration 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.990
 it can be linked to another glucose molecule. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.020
 In this way we get the disaccharide maltose, 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.460
 consisting of two molecules of glucose. 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.340
 If we continue to add, 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.700
 we can form longer chains of glucose molecules. 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.660
 In the process where we associate monosaccharides, 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.200
 glucose is the most common example, 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.900
 &amp; lt; / RTI &amp; gt; 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.760
 polysaccharides. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 Polysaccharides. It's a polysaccharide. 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.990
 There are many different and interesting examples 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.190
 for polysaccharides around us. 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.920
 Most notably polysaccharides of glucose, 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.220
 based on glucose. 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.650
 Here is a bowl of mashed potatoes, 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.550
 which consists mainly of starch. 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.400
 A starch consists of glucose. 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.470
 This is starchy here. 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.850
 The shell of many insects and animals such as lobsters, 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 and the wings of these insects 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.540
 is made from chitin. 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.500
 The chitin is also a polysaccharide. 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.480
 It is made of glucose modification chains. 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.440
 This is chitin here. 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.450
 Strongly like starch, it's glycogen in our muscles. 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.920
 It stores energy in the muscles. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700
 There is also cellulose, 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.420
 which is probably anywhere around you. 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.720
 Cellulose builds things like - 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.450
 as they are all around you, 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.480
 you may not be aware. 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.090
 But cellulose is in the composition of 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.720
 paper and wood. 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.350
 It builds the cell walls of the plants. 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.990
 Here's a picture of cotton 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.685
 in its natural form. 

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:58.785
 Cotton is actually one of the purest forms of cellulose, 

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.675
 it is composed of 90% cellulose. 

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.600
 If we increase a cotton thread, 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.085
 or a single strand of cellulose 

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:11.285
 we will see glucose molecules. 

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:16.385
 You see this here is a glucose molecule. 

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:20.245
 Then you see another molecule of glucose. 

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:21.825
 This circuit has formed 

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:23.985
 in dehydration. 

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:25.985
 And the difference between starch and cellulose, 

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:26.885
 the main difference is how 

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.585
 the connections between their monomers have formed. 

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:30.825
 In starch, the molecules glucose 

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.655
 connect, as we saw in the video on dehydration. 

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:36.255
 While in cellulose, they turn. 

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:40.985
 We see that oxygen here points in this direction, 

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:42.385
 oxygen points in that direction, 

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:43.755
 oxygen points in that direction. 

00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:45.755
 You can search for more information about cellulose. 

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:47.885
 Interestingly, its structure is due 

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:50.185
 of the hydrogen bonds that are formed 

00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.455
 between the partially negative, 

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:56.355
 strongly electronegative oxygen atoms in the chain 

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:59.985
 and the partially positive hydrogen atoms of another chain. 

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.985
 These bonds give the structure of the cellulose. 

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:05.525
 Polysaccharides are many, very interesting things. 

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:06.985
 The question is - 

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.055
 how are they degraded? 

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.855
 If we eat this potato puree, 

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:14.425
 how we will turn it into glucose, 

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.485
 to extract energy from it? 

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:23.075
 This is done by hydrolysis. 

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:25.925
 We can divide the word into parts. 

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:29.985
 If we have the prefix "hydro" 

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:33.165
 this suggests that it is something related to water. 

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.025
 Then, if we see "lysis," then we're breaking down something. 

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:37.245
 Something is broken down. 

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:40.285
 It means something is broken down by water. 

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.955
 This is exactly what happens during hydrolysis. 

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:44.915
 We have this polysaccharide, 

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:48.785
 to pour in and the water molecule in it, 

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:51.955
 the water molecule will be able to 

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:55.245
 to break down one of these links. 

00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:59.075
 We can get something like - 

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:01.955
 This circuit can continue in both directions, 

00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:04.435
 but we will get something like this. 

00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:10.335
 Something that looks like this. 

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.285
 This half of the water molecule is separated, 

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:14.825
 to break this link. 

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:17.485
 Hydrolysis is the opposite of dehydration. 

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:18.855
 Let's see if we can 

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:22.325
 to understand what is happening. 

00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:28.515
 This is maltose here. 

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:30.485
 It is disaccharide, it consists of only two, connected 

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:31.525
 glucose molecules. 

00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:34.005
 If we add 

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.855
 another molecule of glucose here 

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:39.625
 and one more here, 

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.655
 we will have starch work. 

00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:43.385
 Or with glycogen. 

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:44.455
 If this was turned, 

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:46.185
 and all were turned, 

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.755
 we would talk about pulp. 

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:51.055
 But let us think about the mechanism, 

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:55.125
 by which the connection is destroyed. 

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:59.835
 It's just hydrolysis upside down. 

00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:02.655
 It will be like a revision. 

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:07.845
 The oxygen atom here is two free electronic pairs. 

00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:10.355
 There is always a chance if you hit something, 

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:14.525
 immediately bind to a hydrogen proton, 

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:17.046
 who just stays in the solution. 

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:20.355
 Suppose this happens 

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.585
 in aqueous solution. It happens in water. 

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:25.115
 You can just catch a hydrogen proton 

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:28.485
 of a passing hydroxone ion. 

00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:34.985
 If this happens, a covalent bond will be formed 

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:36.685
 and will get a positive charge. 

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:39.480
 And about these two carbon atoms - 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.420
 But let's focus on the carbon atom here. 

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:43.760
 This will be the so-called organic chemistry, 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.620
 good leaving group. 

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:49.855
 These electrons, 

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:51.985
 oxygen may want to take them back, 

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:53.825
 because it has a positive charge. 

00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:55.425
 Oxygen is highly electronegative 

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:58.525
 and the atoms can meet in the right way. 

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.025
 If they interact in the right way, 

00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:02.485
 we may have another water molecule. 

00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:05.085
 Here too, the additional molecule of water is very important 

00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:06.825
 for our hydrology. 

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:09.025
 Let's say this is another water molecule, 

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:11.285
 just passing at the right moment. 

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:19.255
 It can be connected to this carbon atom 

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:20.605
 right here. 

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.655
 By forming a bond with the carbon atom, 

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:24.525
 he says, "Okay, they'll share with me" 

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:28.175
 "a little more electrons, let me release these electrons." 

00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:30.245
 He releases these electrons. 

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:33.785
 What is left? 

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:36.040
 Move here. 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.455
 I will use different colors. 

00:06:40.455 --> 00:06:42.455
 This relationship, which has just been created, 

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:46.005
 is this link here. 

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:52.095
 This oxygen atom is here. 

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.425
 He actually has another hydrogen atom attached to it, 

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:55.555
 I will mark it. 

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:56.945
 When joining 

00:06:56.945 --> 00:06:58.715
 will have a positive charge. 

00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:04.155
 Then this bond here returns to this oxygen atom. 

00:07:04.155 --> 00:07:05.955
 This oxygen here 

00:07:05.955 --> 00:07:08.905
 is here. 

00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:11.335
 When it all began, this atom - 

00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:17.525
 This hydrogen proton, which I grabbed and stained in orange 

00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:18.705
 is this one. 

00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:20.935
 This is here. 

00:07:24.085 --> 00:07:25.925
 This atom has taken a hydrogen proton 

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:27.485
 and now this can yield 

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:28.855
 hydrogen proton in the solution. 

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:31.955
 If a molecule of water passes, it can 

00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:36.125
 to connect this hydrogen proton and become a hydroxone ion. 

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:39.165
 So he took a water proton and returns it, 

00:07:39.165 --> 00:07:40.585
 it gets - 

00:07:41.285 --> 00:07:45.555
 Uses this water molecule here, 

00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:46.905
 to break the connection. 

00:07:47.355 --> 00:07:49.455
 That's why it has a positive charge. 

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:50.985
 It may be, passing a hydroxone ion, 

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:54.635
 who will just betray him. 

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:56.155
 Here, we have 

00:07:56.155 --> 00:08:00.585
 two distinct glucose molecules. 

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:01.725
 We have broken the relationship. 

00:08:01.725 --> 00:08:05.260
 If these were parts of a chain, then we've broken down the chain. 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.085
 If we deal with maltose, 

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:08.315
 we degraded it on 

00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:13.215
 its constituent molecules of glucose. 

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:14.285
 The example here is with glucose 

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.655
 or maltose, 

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:17.925
 but it could have been sucrose, 

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:20.655
 in this case, we would have degraded sucrose by hydrolysis 

00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:23.038
 a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. 

00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:27.087
 This is a very important reaction in biology.
