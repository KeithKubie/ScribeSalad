00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.090
We've already seen
that fractions

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.581
could be used to
represent parts of wholes.

00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:06.580
Now we're going to extend
that idea a little bit

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.200
to think about them as actual
numbers on the number line.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.380
So let me draw a number
line right over here.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.100
So that's my number line.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.260
Let's say that this
is 0, this is 1,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.360
and let's say that this is 2.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.655
And let's say I wanted to
represent the fraction 3/4.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.700
So one way to think about it
is let's go between 0 and 1.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.920
So this fraction,
the numerator here

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.180
is less than the denominator.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.580
So the value of this is
going to be less than 1.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.927
So this is going to be
someplace between 0 and 1.

00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:47.385
And one way we
could think about it

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:50.770
is divide this section
into 4 equal spaces.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.380
So that would be dividing
it into 2 equal spaces.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.790
So if I divide those again,
now I've divided the space.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.420
Let me draw that a
little bit neater.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.960
Now I'm dividing the
space between 0 and 1

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.170
into 4 equal spaces.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, 3/4 means that I've gone 3
out of the 4 spaces towards 1.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.370
So I've gone 1, 2, 3.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.305
So this point right over here
on the number line, this is 3/4.

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:18.930
This point right over
here, what do you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.280
think this is going to be?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.890
Well, we've moved 1, 2
of the spaces towards 4,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.860
so this is 2/4.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.719
And this space right over
here, or this mark right

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.010
over here on the number line,
what is that going to be?

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.510
Well, we've moved 1 of
the 4 spaces towards 1.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.810
So this is 1/4.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.170
What about this one?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.390
Well, you could call this 0/4,
which is the same thing as 0.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.140
So you normally wouldn't
call that just 0/4.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.250
And now we have another
interesting question.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.364
What could you also
call this space?

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:54.530
Well, we already know based
on how we already marked

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.260
the number line that this is 1.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.201
But using the 4's
in the denominator,

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.200
we could say, hey, look.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.900
We've moved 1, 2, 3,
4 out of 4 spaces.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.889
We could call that 4/4/

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.979
And that also makes sense.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.730
So let me make this clear.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.240
4 parts out of 4 total
parts equals 1 whole.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.700
But this also makes sense
from what we know of division.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.300
This little fraction
symbol that we keep using,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.050
this is the same
thing as divided by.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.210
This is 4 divided by 4.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.320
And we know that any
number divided by itself--

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.180
except for 0.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.050
0 is a little bit strange.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.680
But any non-zero number divided
by itself is going to be 1.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.730
So this could be viewed as 4/4.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.290
So let's do a few exercises
with our newfound knowledge

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.560
of fractions on the number line.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.090
So let me get a
little exercise going.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.610
So here we have move the orange
dot to 3/6 on the number line.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.820
So we already see that
they've divided up

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.210
the space between 0 and
1 into 6 equal sections.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.440
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.940
So we need to move it to
3 of those 4 sections.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.370
1, 2, 3.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.720
Let's check our answer.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.460
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.820
Move the orange dot to
2/4 on the number line.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.750
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4 equal sections.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.900
We need to move it
to 1, 2 of them.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.310
If they didn't divide it
into 4 equal sections for us,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.060
then it wouldn't have been
so easy to just count 2.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.900
The number of sections has to be
the number in the denominator.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.233
And then the number in the
numerator's how many of those

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:37.907
we move the dot to.

00:03:37.907 --> 00:03:38.990
Let's do one more of this.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.900
This is a lot of fun.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.850
Move the orange dot to
1/4 on the number line.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.099
Well, we already did that
when we were drawing it out.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.090
There's 1, 2, 3,
4 equal sections.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.070
And we are going to move to 1/4.
