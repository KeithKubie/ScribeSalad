00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.210
&gt;&gt; From the Congress
in Washington DC.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
&gt;&gt; Please join me in welcoming
the author of "Girls Who Code;

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.050
Learn to Code and Change the
World" Reshma Saujani [applause].

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.350
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Thank you.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.950
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Thank
you so much [applause].

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.250
I'm a little short, so I've
got to make this smaller.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.110
How are you guys?

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.560
Good. Yeah, you feeling good?

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.480
All right, I'm going to tell
you a little bit about my story

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.590
and about why I spend my
life teaching girls how

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.680
to computer program.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.040
So, that's me.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.850
I am a weird person to
have started Girls Who Code

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.820
because I didn't know how to code,
until I started the organization.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.470
I was terrified of math
and science growing up.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.120
My parents came here as
refugees from Uganda.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.570
And when we came to this country,
every nighty father would sit

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.460
at the dinner table and
he'd ask me what's 2 plus 2.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.040
And I would immediately say five.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.390 position:56%
You know, those dinner conversations
made me really nervous.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.210
Because, the answer didn't
come to me immediately.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.980
And it made me feel like I
wasn't good at math or science.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.310
I knew as a little girl, what
I wanted to do when I grow up.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.040
Because my parents came here as
refugees, I love this country.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.860
And my father would also, in
addition to those math questions,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.370
every night he would read to me.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.500
And he would read to
me about Dr. King,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.650
and Mahatma Gandhi,
and Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.040
And I knew at a young age that
I wanted to change the world.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.090
I woke up at age 33,
which is a long time

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.610
from where you guys
are at right now.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.460
And I wasn't happy with what
I was doing professionally.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.260
It was 2008, and I was watching
my mentor Hillary Clinton give her

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.560
first concession speech.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440
And she had this line
where she said, you know,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.230
just because I failed doesn't
mean you shouldn't try too.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.110
And I literally felt like
she was speaking to me.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.720
So, at age 33, I decided to
run for United States Congress,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.510
against someone who had been
there for a really long time.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.070
I probably had like less
than a 1% chance of winning.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.360
I had a thousand-page policy book.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.560
I remember, the only thing
my friends and I knew how

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.360
to do was build a website,
and we built one.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.480
And we raised like $50,000 from
Indian aunties that were just

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.380
so happy an Indian girl
was running for office.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.640
But it was the best
10 months of my life.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.620 position:56%
And on election day, in my victory
party that never ended up happening,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.770
I was holding my father's hand,
watching the returns come in.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.940
And that little ticker was not
moving past 19% of the vote.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.780
I had lost.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.290
I was broke.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.850
I was humiliated and I
had no contingency plan.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.340
But as I went to bed that night
the faces that I kept seeing over,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.400
and over, and over again
were actually the ones

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.240
that I had never met.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.950 position:56%
Because when you run for office, you
end up going into a lot of schools.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.570
And I'd go into computer science
classes and robotics classes

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.400
and I'd see a lot of boys.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.670
But I didn't see any girls.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.040
And I kept asking myself,
where are the girls?

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.970
And this question of where are
the girls started as a question

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.020
and then I became really
obsessed with it.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.840
Because I knew that young
women made up the majority

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.470
of college graduates, the
majority of our labor force.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.030
But we weren't in this
industry called technology

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.090
that was literally
shaping everything

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.540
about the way we live and work.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.190
My father, when I was growing up,
my father would always say to me,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.490
Reshma you have three choices,

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.380
you can be a doctor, a
lawyer or an engineer.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.430
Because he wanted me
to have a career

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.040 position:56%
where I could buy a house, you know.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.420
Maybe get a dog, have a
family, be economically secure.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.780 position:56%
And the thing is, we don't have this
conversation with our young folks,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.910
especially our young women.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.750
You know there's 500,000
open jobs right now

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.860
in computing and technology.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.080
Last year, we graduated 40,000
computer science graduates.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.970
China, for example,
graduated 350,000 graduates.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.450
And these jobs aren't just in
New York City, where I'm from,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.810
or Silicon Valley, which
I know you hear about.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.900
They are everywhere.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.600
Ninety-one percent of
these open jobs are outside

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.990
of our traditional tech ecosystem.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.160
The problem is, is that we're
not graduating enough people.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.360
And people always ask me well,
what's the solution to that.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.540
And I think it's women power.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.740
You know, I told you as many of
you know, women are the majority

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.630
in college, where they're
also, today they are 45%

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.150
of America's breadwinners.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.610
And the thing is, is that
when it comes to technology,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.340
we've had this tremendous
decline of women in technology.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.430
In the 1980s, if you walked
into any gaming camp in America,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.430
it would have been
half boys, half girls.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.050
Today you walk into any computer
science classroom in America

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.000
and less than 1 out
of 5 will be girls.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.530 position:56%
For the girls in the room right now,

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.600
how many of you are taking
a computer science class,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.210
raise your hand.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.630
And how many of you are one of
the few girls in your classroom?

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.930
Keep your hand up.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.630
Yeah. And the thing is, is you guys
are lucky because studies will show

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.930
that if you are a young
girl like you

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.850
and you haven't taken computer
science in high school,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.570
you're unlikely to
take it in college.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.990
Those powerful jobs that are open
and available are no longer open

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.760
to our girls if we don't
provide them education

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.560
in those formative years.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.690
And so, people always
ask me like why?

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.280
Why have you seen this
dramatic decline of women?

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.710
Well, the first thing is culture.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.010
Let's be honest.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.420
We had a Barbie doll
that says, "I hate math."

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.940
"Let's go shopping instead."

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.840
We can walk into Forever 21
and buy a T-shirt that says

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.880
"I'm allergic to algebra."

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.380
When you turn on the
television and you look

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.950
at what a computer programmer
looks like, it's normally a dude

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.750
in a hoodie, sitting in
a basement somewhere.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.010
He's drinking a red bull, and
he hasn't showered, right?

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.490 position:56%
And little girls look at that image
and they say, not only do I not want

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.460
to be him, I don't even
want to be friends with him.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.580
You cannot be what you cannot see.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.990
And what our girls
see is this image.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.370
And it has to change.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.800
The second thing is and I don't
know how or when this started,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.090
but how many girls in this room
have ever said, I hate math?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.390
Or I hate science?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.830
Raise your hand.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.060
Now, how many of you ever said, I
hate to read or I hate to write.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.010
All right, just there's
always like one.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.050
Here's the thing.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.950
It is culturally acceptable for
our girls and some of the moms

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.340
in this room to say I hate math.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.640
I hate science.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.400
I'm sure most of the moms in
this room have probably said

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.330
that before too, raise your hand.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.810
And you might even feel comfortable
going into dinner party and be ugh,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.390
I can't stand working with numbers.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.610
Or maybe even at an interview.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.960
Just, so you know, I'm not
that great with spreadsheets.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.480
You would never walk
into a dinner party,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.310
and certainly not an interview and
just say, I don't write that well.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.960 position:56%
It would not be socially acceptable.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.500
So, we have a culture, and listen,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.470
I love "Mean Girls,"
I watch it on repeat.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.670
And you know the scene where she
crosses off the A and puts a D just

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.000
to get the affections of a
boy, we live in a culture

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.190
that celebrates this myth that
girls hate math and science.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.620 position:56%
And that they hate a skill that they
need to survive in the 21st century.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.720
And it's got a change.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.350
The second thing is, I've been
thinking about this a lot,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.100
is I believe that we raise
our girls to be perfect,

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.410
and we raise our boys to be brave.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.590
You know at a young age we
tell our girls to smile pretty,

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.880
play it safe, get all As.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.800
And we teach our boys to crawl
to the top of the monkey bars

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.920
and just jump off headfirst.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.020
I have a 2 1/2-year-old son,
which is very off-brand,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.580
but I think about his
swimming class.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.340
So, his swim class is like
half boys and half girls.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.740
And when the girls are
learning how to swim,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.750
all the parents are
like it's okay honey.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.760 position:56%
You don't have to get your face wet.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.250
Don't be scared.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.870
And with the boys,
they're like pushing them

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.680
into the deep end at six months.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.310
The dads and the moms.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.360
Because they're trying to
teach their sons how to be men.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.710
How to be fearless.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.420
How to be risk takers.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.770
And as these young men grow up,
they raise their hands for jobs

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.340
that they know nothing about.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.400
They're comfortable with
rejection and failure.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.910
We live, in Silicon Valley they say
you can't even get funded unless

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.710
you've had two failed startups.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.180
But for our girls, this coddling,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.830
this protectionism has created
this generation of young women

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.170
that can handle critical feedback.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.760
That gravitate towards things
that they're only good at.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.900
That don't know how to be brave.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.620
And it makes sense.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.750
If from the time you are 16, if
you meet my son too, you will also;

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.680
I call him my little pig pen.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.560
He's got a booger in his nose.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.210
Yesterday's T-shirt.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.870
His diaper should've been
changed six hours ago.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.170
He's a mess.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.470
But he's my mess.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.660
And when I think about the girl,
the young girls in his life

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.840
and I watch their mothers
and their caretakers,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.510
and I see them straighten
their dresses, fix their bows.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.340
If something drops on their
shirt they run to go fix it.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.150
Imagine if from 16 months
you are picked and plucked

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:15.060
and fixed how you feel by the
time you are 16 years old.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:20.170
We have to change the way
we are raising our girls.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.640
And I believe that coding
is a big part of that.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.280
Because for those of you
who know how to code,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.320
you know it is frustrating
process of imperfection.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.640
That annoying semicolon
is in the wrong place,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.420
you've got to do it over,
and over, and over again.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.200
It teaches you how to fail.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.850
It teaches you how to be imperfect.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:48.420
So, in 2012, the failed
politician, the non-coder decided

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.130
to do something about it.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.940
And I started an organization
called Girls Who Code.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.790
And you know, when I
launched Girls Who Code,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.300
I hand-picked my first 20 girls.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.520
I borrowed a friend's
conference room.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.520
I said to myself, Girls Who
Code, that's a great name.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.240
I went on GoDaddy.com.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.540
It was there.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.930
I bought it for $1.99, and
I just tried something.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.050
And we started with
20 girls in 2012,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.550
less than five years later
we've taught 40,000 girls how

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.080
to code in all 50 states.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.510
Don't, [applause] thank you.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.050
[ Applause ]

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.420
And I want to put that into
perspective, remember I told you,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.940
last year as a country we graduated
40,000 computer science graduates.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.750
And Girls Who Code alone,
taught 40,000 girls.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.850
Don't ever let anyone tell you
that a problem is not solvable.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.730
Because it absolutely is.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.830
And this is an example of that.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.760
And what we do is two things.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.390
We have free summer programs.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.140
We basically embed classrooms
in technology companies.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.420
We have 80 of those
programs in 11 cities,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.590
1600 girls went through
that program.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.390
And they're at Facebook, and
Twitter, and AT&amp;T, Adobe, Pixar,

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.020
Disney, Sephora, Prudential,
Microsoft.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.920
Every single major
technology company

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.820
in the country is building
a pipeline

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.910 position:56%
of future technical workers on site.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.250
The second thing we do is
we have afterschool clubs.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.050 position:56%
We have 1500 clubs in all 50 states.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.230
And these clubs are at libraries,
schools; private schools,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.600
public school, charter schools,
they're at homeless shelters.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.690
NPR did a story of the first
ever club in a homeless shelter

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:37.170
where my girls would leave their
bedrooms at the top of the house,

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:43.060
and go downstairs to learn
how to computer program.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.430
People always ask me, you
know, as you grow this program,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.040
like how have you, how has
continued to make a difference.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.130
And there's three major things.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.710
One is capabilities.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.310
We don't just tinker with code.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.990
We teach girls to code.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.170 position:56%
And not only do we teach them how to
code, we teach them how to be brave.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.640
How to be resilient.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.500
How to be risk takers.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.260
And it's that combination of
soft skills and hard skills.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.340
The same things that we teach
in our book that will lead

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.190
to this generation
of powerful leaders.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.150
The second thing we
teach are careers.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.690 position:56%
You know, my father was an engineer.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.900
And I thought he fixed
choo-choo trains.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:30.540
I had no idea what he did because
I never went to work with him.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.800
And by building classrooms
in technology companies

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.690
and exposing our girls you know

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.800
to these amazing tech
leaders like Cheryl Samberg.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.240
You know every year Cheryl Samberg
does a townhall with our girls.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.590
And when the girls, when Cheryl
comes out, I remember at one

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.890
of our programs, she came

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.790
out wearing her cool leather
pants, and her cool shirt.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.240
And the girls started
screaming like she was Beyoncé.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.990
Because, for them, she is.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.860
Role models are huge.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.240
The third thing is community.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.790
You know, our hashtag at Girls
Who Code is hashtag sisterhood.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.780
For the girls in this room, and
for those of you who are still

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.410 position:56%
in middle school, you know sometimes
we're not very nice to each other.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.460
But at Girls Who Code,
we are sisters.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:23.380
And we have girls from all walks
of life; black, Latino, trans, gay,

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.300 position:56%
straight, Muslim, Christian, Jewish,
all walks of life that come together

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.600
and become friends and build
products and learn together.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.000
It's this sense of
community that I believe

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.930
that these young women will build
the products of today and tomorrow.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:44.440
And it's working, 93% of our
graduates are going on to major

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.240
or minor in computer science.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.200
And the thing is, is 77% of them
walked into one of our programs,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.760
maybe mom made them sign up.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.060
Maybe dad did.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.360
Maybe grandma.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.880
And they went to Girls Who Code,
and they said, this is awesome.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.200
Like I want to do this.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.870
We can solve this problem.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.930
It's fixable.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:12.900
I am a feminist, with a capital,
capital F. I am [applause].

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.890 position:56%
But I don't believe in gender parity
for the sake of gender parity.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.930
I believe that there are so many
innovations that are sitting

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.940
on the sidelines because we're
not teaching girls to code.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.040
And I think about my
students, I think about Cora

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.700
who was five years old when her
daddy got diagnosed with cancer.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.500
And she decided at that moment
that she was to be a doctor,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.430
because she wanted to
save her father's life.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.680
And it wasn't until Girls Who
Code that she saw the connection

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.820
between medicine and coding.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.120
Where she built an algorithm

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.770
to help detect whether a
cancer is benign or malignant.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.040
I think about Jasmine, a single
mom, works at Burger King,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.380
has four brothers and sisters.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.790
Every day Jasmine would leave her
home in Oakland, take two buses

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.200
and two trains to Facebook to
learn how to computer program.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.110
Until Girls Who Code she
had never met anybody

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.250
who was Latina that worked in tech.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.550
And at Girls Who Code,

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.400
in our program you can
build whatever you want.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.010
And Jasmine decided that she wanted
to build an app called Wacky Words.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.210
Because too many kids in her
community, they wanted to march

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.250
up into the middle class too.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.150
But they didn't have access to
fancy SAT tutors, and SAT classes.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:32.180
So, she built an app to
help teach them SAT words.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.370
She decided to not build
something for herself,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.890
but to build something for others.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.680
I think about Tricia
Probo [assumed spelling].

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:46.040
Tricia 16 years old,
Naperville, Illinois every day

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.490
of her life she was cyber bullied.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.850
And on one day she was reading a
story about a girl in her community

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.170
that was 12 years old, that
climbed to the top of a building,

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.980
and jumped because she was
being bullied at school.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:05.110
And Tricia said you know
how can, at 12 it be so bad.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.340
So, she came home and she
built an app called rethink.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.360
So, every time you're about to
set something that's not very nice

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.000
on text, and asks you are you
sure you want to send this?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.300
Sixteen years old.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:24.030 position:56%
I would say if we want to find a
cure to cancer, teach girls to code.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.520
We want to solve homelessness,
teach girls to code.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.370 position:56%
We want to do something about
climate change, teach girls to code.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.430
Girls are change the ages.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.460
They are our future leaders
and we must invest in them.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.280
And we invested in them by
teaching them a skill set

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.300
that will allow them to
solve our world's biggest

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.830
and smallest problems.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.820 position:56%
And if you don't believe me, the
amazing things our girls have built,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.590
go to our website and look
at our project gallery.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.060
You will be amazed.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.750
And you will agree that I do, that
our future, it's in good hands.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.050
So, how can you help?

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.350
We've got to change culture.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:07.010 position:56%
I got a lot of parents in this
room, I know you're on social media.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.030
You can get angry like me.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.610
Let's do it.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.300
This is a book that Mattel put out,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.330
called "I Can be a
Computer Science Engineer."

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.260
So, the point of this
book was to inspire girls

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.890
to go into computer science.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.850
I'm going to read it to you
real quick, for those of you

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.130
who can't see, that's Barbie
and that's her friend Skipper.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:32.010
And Skipper says, "Your
robot puppy is so sweet.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.210
Can I play your game?"

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:38.460
"I'm only creating
the design ideas."

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.090
Barbie says laughing.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:45.700
"I need Steven and Brian's help
to turn it into a real game."

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.040
Boo is right.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.000
In three sentences, Barbie
told millions of her fans

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.280
that you're not smart enough,
that you are not good enough,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.320
that computers are for boys.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.420
This stuff happens all the time.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.940
And we got to shut it down.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.550
We got to shut it down
because these images,

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.440
these words have a huge
effect on our girls.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.350
Which leads me to why
I'm here today.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:17.780
I grew up loving, loving
"Sweet Valley High."

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.580
The thing is, is I never saw
myself in those characters.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.800
And so, I would go to audiences
like this all across the country

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.340
and invariably an amazing
teacher or a parent,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.090 position:56%
or a grandparent would come up to me
and she'd say, I'm with you Reshma.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.890 position:56%
I want to give my girl, my daughter,
my granddaughter, my niece,

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.240
my sister, I want to expose her

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.750
to this incredible
language what do I do?

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.360
Is there a book?

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.080
And I went online and
I went to bookstores,

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.530
and I realized there was no book.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.470
And also, year, after year, after
year of growing our program,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.370
we've had to turn girls away.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:05.320
For our summer program, 7000
girls applied for 1600 spots.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.740
I'm not running a competitive
coding program.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.940
I just want to teach
all girls to code.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.400
So, in partnership with
Penguin, we are coming out,

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.280
we came out last week with
two books and we have 13.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.470
And these are books for all ages.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.230
Our first two books "Learn
the Code, Change the World,"

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:30.010
and "The Friendship Code"
are for girls 8 to 12.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.890
And "Learn to Code," you know,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.500
it's about the pioneers
of computer science.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.960
How many of you knew that the
world's first programmer was

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.260
a woman?

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.250 position:56%
Great. And her name is Ada Lovelace.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:51.280
And there's Ada and Grace
Hopper, and the ENIAC women;

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.710
Margaret Hamilton and
Catherine Johnson.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.080
So many amazing, amazing
women that our girls

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.280
and boys need to hear about.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.790
This book also kind of
tells you about the basics

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.090
of computational thinking.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.020
Like algorithms, and
variables, and conditionals.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.320
Tells you about some

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.340
of the incredible stories
that I shared with you.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.840
And the book, it's not broccoli.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.140
It's like M&amp;Ms.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.170
It's fun. And it's interesting.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.820
And it's awesome.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.510 position:56%
And when you read it for the young
girls in this room, you're not going

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.650
to feel like we're
making you do something.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.340
You're going to finish it
and be like, tell me more.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.500
The next book that we have coming
out is "The Friendship Code."

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.450 position:56%
It's kind of like our version of
"The Babysitting Club" meets coders.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:39.710
And at the center of both of
these books are five girls.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.550
Lelah, who wears a hijab.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.060
Lucy who loves video games.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.690
Sophia, who hasn't an Abuela.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.830
Erin, who's the girl next door.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.930
And Maia who loves fashion,
who's kind of like the cool kid.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:22:01.300
These girls look like every single
one of the girls in this room.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.540
Every single one of you are going
to identify with these characters

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.530
and see yourself in them.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.790
This book is for each
and every one of you.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.150
And I know you're going
to love them.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.930
After you read these
books, or maybe before,

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.100
we want you to either join one
of our Girls Who Code clubs,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.540
we're in all 50 states,
go on our website.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.990
And if there's not a
club in your community,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.470
I promise you, I will start one.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.590
We want to get to 5000 clubs,
100,000 girls this year.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.680
And we can do it.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.090
Again, this problem is solvable.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.820
I want to leave you with one
story for the dads in this room.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.540
I was giving this talk
a couple years ago

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.570
and I got an email
from this guy Ken.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.330
And Ken said, you know Reshma,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.470
your story had an immediate
impact on my family.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.770
I was at home and I
was telling my wife

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.890
about what you were talking about.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.450
And that week, my grandparents;

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.720
my parents had sent my
son a Kano Computer Kit.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.260
And my son was not
interested in it at all.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.250
And as I was talking to
my wife about your story,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:25.720
I realize that I had never asked
my daughter Sophie if she wanted

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.070
to play with the Kano Computer Kit.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.380
And I looked at my daughter I
said, Sophie, honey you want

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.710
to play with the computer kit?

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.510
And she said daddy, I'd love to.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.880
And he said Reshma, I
can't get her away from it.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.350
Last message.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.790
Let your girls get dirty.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.260
Let them tinker.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.350
Let them take things apart.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.910
Put a drill in their hand
when they're 12 years old.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.830
If the toilet's broken,
take them to go fix it.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.290
Stop protecting and
coddling our girls.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.970
Let's teach them how to be brave.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.920
And it starts, as weird
as it's going to sound,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.020
by teaching them how to code.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.820
Thank you.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.290
[ Applause ]

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.590
Thank you.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.190
I think I have a couple
of minutes for questions.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.500
If anybody has them.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.340
&gt;&gt; Where can you get the books

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.330
and how do you sign
up for Girls Who Code?

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.630
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Amazing.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.310
So, you can get the
books everywhere.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.470
I'm doing a little book
signing after this.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.440
And you can sign up for Girls
Who Code on our website.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.210
Girlswhocode.com.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.860
You got one more question?

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.160
No?

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.890
&gt;&gt; How many books do you have?

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.240
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: How
many books do I have?

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.940
Right now, we have two
books that have come out.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.550
"Girls Who Code" and
"The Friendship Code."

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.160
And then we have another 11 coming
out over the next couple of years.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.900
&gt;&gt; Have you been to
the US Territories?

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.320
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Have I been to
the US Territories, I think so.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.350
&gt;&gt; Excuse me?

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.530
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Yes, hi.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.830
&gt;&gt; Pretty much.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:16.430
Did you know that I actually
went to a coding club at my age,

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.780
even though everyone else was
pretty much older than me?

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.080
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.930
Let's give her a big
round of applause.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.660
I am so proud of you and
you keep doing that okay?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.140
Did you like it?

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.740
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: You did?

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.040
&gt;&gt; Except all the other
ones are for older kids.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.570
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Well,
seems like you are going

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.870
to be a trailblazer then.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.230
You need to tell all your friends

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.290
about it too, maybe
get them to join?

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.590
Okay.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.700
&gt;&gt; What made you get the idea?

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.620
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: What
made me get the idea?

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.150
All the amazing girls
that I've taught.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:54.120
I have the best job in the world
because I get to work with girls.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.850
And they inspire me.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.840
And so, I wanted to
tell their stories,

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.730
and I wanted to share
all the awesome things

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.370
that I've learned from
teaching them.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.630
Thank you.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:12.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm inspired in your programs, so
how do you get to the website again?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.860
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI:
It's girlswhocode.com.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.300
Okay? And anybody can send me,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.420
I probably shouldn't
do this but I will.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.120
Anyone can send an email
at Reshma@girlswhocode.com

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.550
if you have any questions.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.580
&gt;&gt; How many languages
of code is there?

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.650
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Well,
that's a great question.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.450 position:56%
How many languages of code is there?

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:40.140
A lot. But the thing is, is what
we teach is computational thinking

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.570
because a lot of languages change.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:43.870
I'm sure there are
people in this room

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.840 position:56%
that did basic right, way back when.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:52.560
And now there's languages like
HTML and C+, so by the time you get

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.430
to be my age I don't even know
what the languages will be.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.730
But that's what's awesome

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.870
because you can learn
computational thinking,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.570 position:56%
and then you can learn any language.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.080
Thank you.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.380
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:12.290
&gt;&gt; So, I read your book and I
like it, how do I get started?

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.300
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI:
Did you read the book?

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.000
And you liked it?

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.300
How old are you?

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.600
&gt;&gt; Ten.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.900
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: Ten?

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.200
That's great.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.500
So, I want you to go
on our website and see

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.490
if your school already
has a Girls Who Code club,

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.240
and if not we'll start one.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.390
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.230
&gt;&gt; Did you write the
Girls Who Code books?

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.960
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI:
So, great question.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.640
So, the Girls Who Code, I'm the
author of the "Girls Who Code;

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.610 position:56%
Learn to Code and Change the World."

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.540
And I had an amazing team.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.430
I had a great illustrator.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.580
I had a technical partner.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.520
I had a writing partner.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.750
And we have this amazing
partnership with Penguin.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.360
So, on the fiction book.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.930
This author Stacia wrote
"The Friendship Code."

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.970
And we worked together
with our team to make sure

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.760
that she could also tell,
kind of the computing concepts

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.510
that were really important.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.650
So, what we do is get
amazing authors

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.780
that are writing board books, or
coloring books, or fiction series

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:17.060
and we partner with them.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.760
&gt;&gt; I do scratch.com and I
do like HTML on Khan Academy

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.520
and I was wondering what
kind of language teach?

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.480
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI: So, we teach,
that's awesome first of all.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.730
For all the parents, scratch is
a great place to kind of start.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.030
It's drag and drop.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.570
So, it's probably the first thing
that, right, that you learned.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.190
And I'm proud that
you're on Kahn Academy

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.840 position:56%
because they have an amazing website
where you can actually watch videos

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.830
and have a coding platform
there at the same time.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.480
You know the way that we teach
our Girls Who Code is the question

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.230
that we ask ourselves is
what do you want to build?

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.180
So, like if you want to
build an app, we often teach,

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.550
whether it's App Inventor or
Swift, if it's a website it's HTML.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.800
And you know we teach C++ and Java.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.630
But it's all about trying to first
decide what do you want to build

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.840
and then what's the
right language for that?

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.140
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.490
&gt;&gt; Why does it start at?

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:20.810
Why do you have to
be in sixth grade?

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.110
&gt;&gt; RESHMA SAUJANI:
It's a great question.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.410
So, you don't have
to be in sixth grade,

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.720
so our clubs first started
off being for high school.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.390
And then we went a little
bit younger in middle school.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.690
And then we wanted to serve girls
as young as we possibly can,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.050
which is why we wrote these books.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:42.390
I have a feeling that these books
are probably going to inspire a lot

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.770
of amazing young girls who
are going to probably push us

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:53.270
to start our clubs a little bit
younger, so more to come on that.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.520

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.250
Thank you.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.120
Awesome, well I hope you
come to our book signing.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.580
And I think, I want to say one
more thing, all the proceeds

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.650
of the book go to Girls Who Code.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.320
So, you're not just buying a book,

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.920
but you are helping
support a movement.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.720
Thank you.
