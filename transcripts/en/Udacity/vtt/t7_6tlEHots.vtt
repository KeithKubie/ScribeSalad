00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.592
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0. That is the number that we're looking for. Now, we think about either a or

00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:08.951
b or really any real number. There are three options in terms of their value.

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:13.359
They can either be positive, they can be negative, or they could be neither

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:18.152
positive nor negative, in other words, 0. Now if we multiply two positive things

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:22.405
together, we get a positive number. So a and b can't both be positive or else we

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:26.254
wouldn't get zero. Two negative numbers multiplied together also gives us a

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:30.152
positive number. So a and b can't both be negative either. A positive number

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:33.812
times a negative number, or, the reverse order, a negative number times a

00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:38.047
positive number, both equal negative numbers. That's also not what we're looking

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:43.445
for. The only way to end up with a 0 as the product of two numbers is for one of

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:49.021
those two numbers that are being multiplied together to equal 0 itself. So

00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:52.125
either a or b or both a and b must equal 0.
