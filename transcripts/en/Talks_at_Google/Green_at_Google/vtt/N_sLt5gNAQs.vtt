00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Thanks for joining us
for today's Green at Google Talk. My name

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.150
is Alice Mount and I work on data center environmental
health and safety. It's with great pleasure

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
and excitement that I introduce our three
speakers. Although each has a very different

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.670
background, they're here today with something
in common. The desire to address climate change,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.210
environmental pollution and energy security
through the promise of renewable energy.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.699
Going in alphabetical order, Mark Jacobson
is the Director of Atmosphere/Energy Program

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.879
and Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering
at Stanford University. He is also a Senior

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.260
Fellow of the Woods Institute for the Environment.
And a Senior Fellow of the Precourt Institute

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.969
for Energy. He is on the Energy Efficiency
and Renewable Environment committee for the

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.949
US Secretary of Energy. And he was my advisor
at Stanford. [laughter]

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.609
Marco Krapels is the Executive Vice President
of Rabobank North America, where he runs the

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.100
commercial banking product groups, including
its capital markets and renewable energy finance

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.050
divisions. He co-chairs the bank's Corporate
Social Responsibility committee where he's

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.579
initiated notable sustainability efforts including
a Rabobank solar/Tesla electric car project

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.840
featured in the New York Times. Marco is co-founder
and board member of Empowered by Light which

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.909
promotes renewable energy solutions for one
point six billion people living without electricity.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.759
And last, but certainly not least, Mark Ruffalo
is an Oscar-nominated actor and renewable

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.400
energy advocate. In March 2011, Marco founded
Water Defense to raise awareness about the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.719
impact of energy extraction on water and public
health. A regular contributor to the Guardian

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.340
and the Huffington Post, Mark is a recent
recipient of the Global Green Millennium Award

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.649
for Environmental Leadership. Most recently,
he played Dr. Banner and the Incredible Hulk

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.990
in the Avengers. I will hold back on making
any green puns. I wouldn't wanna make him

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.000
angry.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.020
[laughter]

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.600
Thanks for coming and welcome to Google. For
those of you who would like to ask questions,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.289
we have a Google moderator page set up at
'go wind water sun'. Thank you.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.159
[applause]

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:16.640
&gt;&gt;Mark Ruffalo: Thank you for that introduction.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.740
[laughter]

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.550
Wow. Thank you Google for having us here.
I'm more nervous about this than I am any

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:35.420
of that acting stuff I do. I wanna start by
how I got here. I really don't wanna be here

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.420
today.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.420
[laughter]

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.330
I'd rather be at home with my kids today.
Running in the sprinkler. It's the first day

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:52.070
of summer. But three years ago I made the,
I guess, fortunate or unfortunate decision

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.030
to move my family to upstate New York where
they can live with trees and flowers and chirping

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.060
birds and clean water and fresh air. And shortly
after moving there I found out that this incredible

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.780
thing called hydrofracking was going to happen
in my community. And when I first heard about

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.270
it, I thought it was the greatest thing since
sliced bread. It was gonna give us energy

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:30.340
independence. It was clean. It was cheap.
All it was was injecting a little sand and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:39.420
water into the ground and it was going to
free us from war, pestilence, viruses, the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.740
Plague, and Satan himself.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.010
[laughter]

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.650
That sounded great to me. So I'm the type
of person, I'm a very simple man and decided

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.460
that I would go online and check out what
exactly hydrofracking was. And as I started

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.630
looking into it, I started seeing there was
a lot of problems with it. Like people being

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.050
able to light their wells on fire. And coming
down with brain lesions. And their well caps

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.600
blowing 50, 60 feet into the air. And their
water becoming contaminated. And their children

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.720
developing asthma. And spills. And their pets
and livestock dying or going bald or becoming

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.210
ill. And those things didn't sound like white
bread to me.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.100
And I realized that maybe hydrofracking was
more relatable to asbestos, the greatest thing

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.990
since asbestos than white bread. If you remember
when we had our beginning love affair with

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.010
asbestos, it was the greatest thing that could
ever have happened to us. It was gonna change

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.760
our world. It was gonna make jobs for us.
And it was just this incredible thing. And

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.231
in time we've come to find out that it isn't
so incredible. So I began basically, I went

00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:07.360
to Dimick, PA with Robert Kennedy, Junior
and I saw a group of people, probably 40 people,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.280
who had their wells contaminated with natural
gas from hydrofracking. And there was no one

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.400
there to help them. And they literally looked
at Robert Kennedy Junior as if he was Jesus

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.740
Christ himself and walked across the water
to save them. Unfortunately at that time,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.760
Robert Kennedy Junior had been toking off
the natural gas pipe and was a big natural

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.960
gas advocate. It's taken us two years to turn
him around. But, by God, we have. Us and science

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.590
and a lot of compelling anecdotal evidence
that tell us that this is not the way to move

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.260
forward.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:02.620
But when I was there, I had family after family
come up to me and since I was the B-list celebrity

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.300
in the room, behind Robert Kennedy, Junior,
I was the next savior. Something on par to

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:18.830
probably Houdini more than Jesus Christ. But
I recognized an enormous need that they had

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.680
that wasn't being filled, neither by their
legislative body in the state of Pennsylvania

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.530
nor by the EPA which had been exempt, this
industry had been exempted from any federal

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:41.050
regulation. And they were asking for my help.
And I decided that I would run as far away

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.620
from them as I possibly could.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.830
But I couldn't run away from myself. And I
realized that I wouldn't be the human being

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.240
that I say I am, if I turned my back on them.
Essentially I'd be turning my back on my own

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.940
children and my own community just across
the Delaware River. And so I began fighting

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:13.070
hydrofracking in New York State. And at some
point that wasn't enough for me. I felt like

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:19.500
you can't really be effective at fighting
something unless you can come up with an alternative

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:29.820
to that thing, that was viable, and that was
credible. And so in my very, I like to model

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:36.510
myself after Percival the Fool, I went like
the fool into the world saying "I don't know

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.960
what the hell I'm doing or what I'm talking
about, but I'd like to go find some people

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:49.120
that do know what they're doing and what they're
talking about. And I was invited to go to

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.790
the Global Green Awards, which I didn't wanna
get an award for this work. I went kicking

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.580
and screaming. They wanted to honor me with
an environmental award. I didn't feel like

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:07.729
I deserved it. But I didn't wanna be an asshole,
so I went. And while I was there, shortly

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:15.270
after I gave my speech on natural gas to a
very large group of people who at that time

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:24.380
still believed that natural gas was the answer.
And I was there to say "No." Well, after it,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:30.740
this crazy Dutchman came up to me and he said
"Hi, I'm Marcellus. And I'm here to help you

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.969
fight Marcellus." Now Marcellus Shale is where
in New York where they wanna extract the gas

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:45.709
from. And Marco Krapels real name is Marcellus.
And I kinda, he said "You know, we have to

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:52.180
talk about the solutions." Like I kinda had
said well, I wanna do this crazy thing, I

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:58.480
wanna, why aren't we going to renewable, why
are we gonna go to natural gas and then renewable.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.040
I mean why not go directly to renewables.
Like why do we have to bridge to it? Like

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:10.949
why don't we hang-glide over it? And he said
"Come to California, I'm gonna put together

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:19.230
some meetings. We're doing this here and I
think you can do it in New York." And he brought

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:28.279
me to a dinner and at that dinner was Professor
Mark Jacobson. And a lot of other really influential

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:35.149
people in the renewable space. And what I
started to hear was what I believed in my

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:40.619
heart. Was that we actually could make this
transition. Without introducing an entire

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:48.749
new fossil fuel infrastructure to our nation
that would cost us 700 billion dollars to

00:09:48.749 --> 00:09:56.399
build out. And we actually could hang glide
over natural gas and move directly to renewable

00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:07.679
energy. And we could do it in my lifetime.
And that was the beginning of this journey.

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:13.760
And along this journey I only knew that the
only thing that I could offer to these brilliant

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:25.689
people was that I was a conduit of information
to my culture. To the culture. And we're in

00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:32.820
an information war. Really is what this is
about. It's about education. Because the truth

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:44.350
is that we can do this. We're technologically
poised to do it. But there's an enormous political

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:55.470
lobbying structure in place in this country
that is telling us that we can't do it. And

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:03.579
that we are bound to be a fossil fuel nation
for another 50, 60, 100 years. And that just

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:05.870
isn't the truth.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:17.769
And so I started to try and make myself knowledged
in what the truth was. By going to scientists.

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:25.600
Going to business leaders, going to bankers,
and asking "Is this possible? And how do we

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:34.779
do it?" And that was basically how I came
to be sitting here with these two extraordinary

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:41.119
gentlemen. There's another gentleman here
named Jon Wank from Skadaddle who is basically

00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:48.880
our media genius. And we figure that if you
can handle the science and the culture and

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.610
the banking and the economics and then have
a platform to get the message out, we actually

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:02.209
have a chance of making this thing happen.
And so the idea of solutions was born.

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:09.959
And none of us are on the payroll of anybody.
We all flew ourselves here today. We are only

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:16.230
compelled to move forward with this mission
because we have children. And we believe that

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:22.519
it's the right and responsible thing for each
of us to do. And that gives us an enormous

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:29.240
amount of credibility in the face of who our
opponent is and the enormous amount of political

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:36.139
and economic power that they wield against
us. And so, at this moment, I would gladly

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:37.850
like to shut up.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:38.850
[laughter]

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:44.989
And turn over this podium to the great Professor
Mark Jacobson from Stanford.

00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:45.989
[applause]

00:12:45.989 --> 00:12:54.220
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: This really came to fruition
in 2009 when Dr. Mark Delucchi of UC Davis

00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:00.480
and I published a paper in Scientific American
on how to power the world with renewable energy.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:07.029
Really the question was, was it technically
feasible to do this? And did we have enough

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:14.470
materials? Were there enough resources available?
What were the costs like? Was it really possible

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:20.500
to power the entire world? And by extension
of course the United States and individual

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:29.670
states. And it was by fortune that I met Mark
Ruffalo and Marco Krapels, and some others,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:35.749
Jon Wank and others in our group. It was very
fortunate because, and it's actually been

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:41.619
very exciting, because I, we, kind of working
as a scientist you're often working on your

00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:45.930
own and in a small group. And nobody really
wants to listen to the scientists who put

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:52.119
out reports. And then there are people who
put out things to try to discredit you. Or

00:13:52.119 --> 00:13:58.350
to try to minimize whatever you do. And so
this is actually an opportunity I think to

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:05.050
bring the information out. I mean, my job,
I feel, is to bring, to study a subject and

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:10.749
then bring that information out to the public
and to students and to the world, to clarify

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:18.699
it. And so that's what I want to do here today.
So really what I wanna talk about in the next

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:22.350
few minutes and it might take a little more
than a few minutes. But it's how to power

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.680
the world and the United States with renewable
energy. Is it really feasible? So first of

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:37.459
all, why do we wanna do that? And I'm gonna
try to [pause]. There we go. Oops. I think

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.420
we just went to the end. [laughs]

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.420
[laughter]

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:46.410
There we go. I think we're even, one more
back. There. OK. Well, anyway.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.850
So what is the problem? Why do we need to
do this first of all? From my point of view,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.139
it's from an air pollution and climate point
of view. Two and a half to three million people

00:14:55.139 --> 00:15:00.339
die every year from air pollution, from cardiovascular
disease, respiratory illness, complications

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:07.429
from asthma, disease, pneumonia, in fact,
about 15 to 20 percent of these are children

00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:15.089
under five years of age in developing countries.
And this number is growing. And global warming

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:20.839
is a significant problem whether or not you
believe it, it's true. It's happening. The

00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:25.259
temperature changes today are faster. The
rate of change of temperature today is faster

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:31.259
than any time since the deglaciation from
the last ice age. And this is a significant

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:36.360
issue because half of global warming is actually
being hidden or masked by what are called

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.929
cooling pollutant aerosol particles. The particles
that you actually see in the air from pollution

00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:46.170
are hiding half of global warming. So if we
actually clean up all of the air pollution

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.839
particles in the world which we want to do
because these are the ones that cause the

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:53.709
two and a half to three million deaths, most
of them, then we would actually double global

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:58.199
warming instantaneously. That's a scary problem.

00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:04.269
The Arctic sea ice is disappearing rapidly
as I'll show you. And this is also scary because

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:10.079
within 20 years, if it disappears, then there
will be possibly a rapid tipping point where

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:15.610
there'll be more rapid acceleration of warming.
And populations are increasingly quickly and

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:20.550
as a result, and there's rising energy demand.
And our current fossil fuel infrastructure,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:25.989
the fuels themselves are short-lived. They're
not gonna be here even if we used them all

00:16:25.989 --> 00:16:31.519
for the next 100, 150 years, they're eventually
gonna disappear. We're subject to significant

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:36.379
price fluctuations. If we go to clean renewable
energy there are no price fluctuations because

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:37.809
the fuel is free.

00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:43.949
Now, let's, I just wanna show you an example.
I mean, we look outside here in the Bay Area,

00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:49.089
especially near the Bay and it's extremely
clean looking most days. But you go most places

00:16:49.089 --> 00:16:56.480
in the world, and it looks like this. And
here's Norilsk, Russia. Sukinda, India. Linfen,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.989
China. It's like living here is like smoking
three packs of cigarettes every day. This

00:17:01.989 --> 00:17:07.220
is the real problem in the world. And this
pollution, it's not only creates health problems,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.220
but the darkness of the pollution means that
it's absorbing sunlight and heating the air

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:17.400
and this is why these pollutant particles,
the dark ones, are the second leading cause

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.559
of global warming after carbon dioxide. The
black carbon and brown carbon in these particles.

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:27.230
And they also cause health impacts. And they're
also very short lived. So if you control them,

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.690
they're actually a very fast method of slowing
global warming. In fact if, they're the only

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.860
method, by controlling those particles is
probably the only method of saving the arctic

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:40.299
sea ice, because they're short lived. Along
with methane which is number three in terms

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:45.740
of the leading causes of global warming. And
by the way methane, the main source of methane,

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:52.950
well one of the main sources, is from natural
gas mining. And this is a big issue because

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:59.950
the short lived impact of that methane over
the 20 year time frame is 80 times more significant

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.720
per unit mass than carbon dioxide. 80 to 100
times.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:10.610
Now this is the lungs of a teenager who died
in the Los Angeles in the 1970s and this is

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:16.179
what the lungs of most teenagers in polluted
cities of our world look like. So in the united

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:20.870
states there are 50,000 to 100,000 die every
year prematurely from air pollution. In California,

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:27.260
it's about 20,000 to 23,000. And this is a
problem that still needs to be solved. And

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.390
that doesn't count all the illnesses and lost
work days and school days. The higher taxes

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:37.210
we pay. And the higher insurance costs that
result.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:45.340
I talked about the sea ice. This shows from
1900 to 2010, or 2011, the Arctic sea ice

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.659
in different seasons. The green which is on
the bottom which is the most rapidly decreasing

00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:55.210
in the summer. But you can see that the sea
ice is decreasing in all seasons. But it's

00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:01.020
expected to entirely disappear within 20 to
30 years unless we do something.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.250
And as I mentioned the temperature of the
earth is increasing rapidly. It's the rate

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:12.130
of change of temperature that's so high today.
And it just hasn't been this high. We've had

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.580
higher temperatures on average. 100 million
years ago the earth was ice free. But nobody

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.149
lived back then. So we didn't have 7 billion
people on the earth. If we melt all the ice

00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:27.240
that's stored in the Antarctic mostly but
the Arctic and all the glaciers, we would

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.600
increase the sea levels, by, on the order
of 65 to 70 meters and we'd flood seven percent

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.029
of all the world's land, along the coast.
And that's where most people live. So this

00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:38.350
is an issue.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.280
So what's the solution?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:47.789
So the solution, we think, is based on scientific
analysis that was done in 2009 before the

00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:54.419
Scientific American article, was what we call
"wind, water, and sun." So what was recommended,

00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:59.429
based on just ignoring the costs at first,
we looked at a bunch of different technologies

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:03.720
and found that the best ones in terms of their
environmental benefits, in terms of health

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:12.860
and climate. In terms of catastrophic risk.
In terms of creating a reliable energy supply

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:21.110
as well, simultaneously reducing water pollution,
were wind, and concentrated solar power, geothermal

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:27.929
power, tidal power, wave power, solar photovoltaics,
hydroelectric power. And that's for electric

00:20:27.929 --> 00:20:33.750
power. For transportation it's using these
electricity sources to power battery electric

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.700
vehicles. And in some cases hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles. And the reason battery electrics

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.240
are so good is that they're four to five times
more efficient than internal combustion. So

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:51.330
in other words, for every gallon of gas you
put into your tank, only about 17 to 20 percent

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:56.240
of the energy in that gas goes to move your
care. The rest is waste heat. Of every unit

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.509
of electricity you plug into your car, about
80 to 86 percent actually goes to moving your

00:21:01.509 --> 00:21:06.010
car. The rest is waste heat. As a result,
electricity is so much more, it's four to

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.500
five times more efficient than gasoline.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:14.011
So the best way to reduce your energy consumption
is to use an electric vehicle. By far. Converting

00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:20.710
from a combustion vehicle to an electric vehicle.
In fact, as a result, the cost of the electricity

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.950
to run your car is equivalent to about 80
cents to a dollar a gallon, compared to four

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.320
dollars plus or whatever the price of gas
is right now.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.370
Now, I'll get back to that later. But what's
not recommended in our list, not because they're

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:40.130
not in some cases better than what we have
currently, in other cases it is not so good,

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:47.340
are nuclear, coal with carbon capture, any
kind of natural gas or biomass. Corn or cellulosic,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:53.850
or sugarcane ethanol, soy or algae biodiesel.
Or compressed natural gas. These are not recommended

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.900
options. And again I'm not trying to criticize
them, although some of these you can really

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:03.179
criticize a lot. But I'm just saying they're
not so good as what we call the wind, water,

00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:05.769
and sun options. Which I'll show you why.

00:22:05.769 --> 00:22:11.039
So for example, why not nuclear power? Everyone
thinks "Oh, it's clean power." Well, in fact,

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:15.659
because of the, you need to mind the uranium,
and refine it, continuously over the life

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:21.399
of the power plant, and then use it and then
you have to store the waste, it's, and that's

00:22:21.399 --> 00:22:25.120
half of the emissions are associated. There
are two coal fire power plants in the US whose

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:32.130
sole purpose is to refine uranium for nuclear
power plus weapons. But there's also the fact

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:41.120
it takes like 11 to 19 years to put up a nuclear
reactor. And due to, not only due to the construction

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:48.120
time but due to the permitting time and planning
time, it compared to like two to five years

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:54.659
for a wind or solar farm, generally. So in
the meantime you're running the current electric

00:22:54.659 --> 00:23:01.190
power grid which is 55 to 60 percent coal.
So there's an opportunity cost by going to

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:06.660
say nuclear versus wind due to this time lag
between planning and operation. That's huge.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:14.040
So between the two of those additional emissions
sources, you have nine to 25 times more carbon

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.750
equivalent emissions and air pollution per
kilowatt hour generated from nuclear than

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.259
you do from wind power. But that's not even
the major problem. There's the risk of meltdown.

00:23:23.259 --> 00:23:28.270
One and a half percent of all nuclear reactors
ever built, and there have been about 440,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.731
have melted down to some degree. And there's
nuclear weapons proliferation. There are five

00:23:32.731 --> 00:23:36.899
countries that have secretly developed nuclear
weapons capability under the guise of nuclear

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:41.220
energy facilities, that were supposed to be
used for civilian purposes.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:46.940
And there are unresolved waste issues. Why
not, what's called "clean coal?" Well, what

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:54.580
clean coal is, is you dump, you take the CO2
exhaust from the exhaust of the coal plant

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.760
and you pump it underground. And that reduced
about 85 to 90 percent of the CO2 from the

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.570
exhaust. However there is all this CO2 from
the mining and the transport of the coal,

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:11.279
which is about a third of the emissions. And
plus you need 25 percent more coal because

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:16.850
it requires 25 percent more energy to run
the carbon capture equipment. So as a result,

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:21.640
and the CO2 carbon capture does not reduce
any other pollutant aside from CO2. So you

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.760
actually increase all the other pollutants
like “socks” SO2, ammonia, knocks”,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.519
oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, particulate
matter by 25 percent increase in the air pollution

00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:37.150
from the coal. So it's nothing close to clean.
In fact, it's about 50 times more CO2 per

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.769
unit energy than wind and 150 times more pollution
per unit energy.

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:47.760
Why not ethanol? Well, they, you still have
to burn the ethanol like a combustion fuel.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.929
And so you produce a similar amount of air
pollution. In fact, we found in the US about

00:24:51.929 --> 00:24:57.039
four percent higher mortality due to converting
to ethanol. Compared with gasoline. Due to

00:24:57.039 --> 00:25:02.289
the, because you have a lot of aldehydes coming
out of the tank instead of aromatics. But

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:06.500
the aldehydes are more reactive at producing
ozone which causes health, significant health

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.500
problems.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:13.380
So there's on the order of the same air pollution.
But in terms of the CO2, which everybody has

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:19.379
pushed ethanol for. For corn ethanol it's
only 90, to, the best you can get 90 percent

00:25:19.379 --> 00:25:23.590
of the gasoline CO2 emissions. But you can
get even higher, 200 percent, you can double

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:31.559
the CO2 emissions, if, due to land use change,
that result from price changes from corn.

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:36.159
Cellulosic ethanol is a little bit better
but it's still 50 to 150 percent so you really

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:39.950
don't know if you're actually getting any
carbon benefit.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:45.279
Compared to wind energy, power and battery
electric vehicles. It's 99 percent CO2 reductions

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:50.879
and air pollution reductions. More than 99
percent. And I'll show you the land use required

00:25:50.879 --> 00:25:55.230
for the ethanol. And then you'll really see
why it's not so useful.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:02.020
Natural gas, in terms of air pollution and
CO2, it's at least 50 to 70 times more CO2

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:09.370
per kilowatt hour than wind energy. And hydrofracking,
as Mark mentioned, causes lots of water issues.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:17.649
Ground water contamination. And potential
leakage of methane into the atmosphere, which

00:26:17.649 --> 00:26:21.380
is dangerous especially for the Arctic sea
ice.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:27.409
And so now I wanna just focus then for a few
minutes on, so what are these options that

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:32.419
are wind, water and sun options? You're all
familiar with most of them. Wind turbines,

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:34.940
these are wave devices, there are actually
a lot of different types of wave devices,

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.640
and it's still pretty much in its infancy.
But there are several different types of wave

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.500
devices that have been tested and work. And
they take advantage of the up and down motions

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.740
of the wave. There's hydroelectric power which
could be from dams. Which nobody likes too

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:54.510
many dams. And we don't envision many more
dams. 70 percent are already in place that

00:26:54.510 --> 00:27:00.480
we need. In fact, if we can minimize them,
that's great. But we might have a few more.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.899
And there's also what's called "run of the
river" electricity where you don’t actually

00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:11.410
build a dam, you just extract the energy from
flowing water. Tidal power basically a wind

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.641
turbine under the water in tides. And the
presence of tides. Geothermal power. You're

00:27:15.641 --> 00:27:21.950
extracting heat from the rocks under the earth
and converting that into electricity. Then

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:27.820
there's concentrated solar on the top left.
Which you focus light from mirrors onto a

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:34.340
central tower receiver to heat a fluid that
then heats water and from the steam from the

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.649
water you can generate electricity through
a steam generator. Or you can store the hot

00:27:38.649 --> 00:27:42.940
fluid overnight and generate electricity at
night which is a nice thing about concentrated

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:48.169
solar, it's a nighttime source of electricity.
In fact, a plant in Spain ran their concentrated

00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:54.081
solar plant for 24 hours last summer. And
then there's also photovoltaics that can either

00:27:54.081 --> 00:27:59.580
be power plants or on rooftops and of course
at Google you know all about that.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.970
And of course there's the electric cars, which
are all existing and I don't have to say too

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:10.081
much about them. But I do wanna point out,
there are also hydrogen fuel cell buses. There

00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:14.530
are electric trucks that are existing, these
are existing technologies. A hybrid in fact,

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:20.929
there's a hydrogen fuel cell electric hybrid
bus. So these are all clean. Hydrogen is less

00:28:20.929 --> 00:28:26.990
efficient than electricity straight for vehicles,
but it's still more efficient than gasoline.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:31.340
And it's much cleaner. I mean it's still 99
percent clean in terms of carbon emissions

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.850
and air pollution but it's not quite so efficient
as electricity.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:42.950
Now in terms of boats, this is the wrong title,
but in terms of ships, this is a existing

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.799
hydrogen fuel cell ship. Tractors, this is
a hydrogen fuel cell tractor that's an electric

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:53.710
ship. These are existing technologies for
the most part. Of course they can be improved.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:59.289
And on the right is a cryogenic hydrogen aircraft,
which is run on liquefied hydrogen. The space

00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:05.190
shuttle runs on, or ran on, liquefied hydrogen.
And the Russians built the Tupolov in the

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:10.049
1980s that ran on this. But it's more mass,
more volumous. You need more volume to store

00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:14.659
the hydrogen. But it weighs less. Because
of the lightness of hydrogen.

00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:20.059
For heating and cooling, there's air source,
and ground source heat pumps. And also solar

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:25.590
hot water preheaters. OK. So let's jump then
to some statistics.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.809
The end-use power demand today is about 12
and a half terawatts. That's for all purposes.

00:29:29.809 --> 00:29:34.210
The whole, all of the world, society uses
12 and a half terawatts of end use power to

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:42.460
run devices, to drive cars, to heat and cool.
Everything. Now in 2030 with current fuels

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.309
we expect to go up to 17 terawatts. If we
convert to wind, water, and sun because of

00:29:47.309 --> 00:29:52.639
the efficiency of electricity and hydrogen
to some extent, you go down by about 32 percent.

00:29:52.639 --> 00:29:58.120
So you reduce energy demand, power demand,
worldwide by 32 percent by converting to wind,

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.149
water, and sun. In the US it's 37 percent
because we're so heavily dependent on combustion

00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:07.789
for vehicles that you get a even greater efficiency
there.

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:13.090
So we really need to shoot for 11 and a half
terawatts by 2030. So how do we do that? Well,

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:21.409
one way is this plan. It's not by no means
is it the only way. But 50 percent wind, 40

00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:25.899
percent solar, and 10 percent everything else.
And why those proportions? Well, wind and

00:30:25.899 --> 00:30:31.320
solar are the only technology, or the only
resources that you can power the entire world

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.881
on their own by many times. And I'll show
you that in a minute. But, and wind is a little

00:30:35.881 --> 00:30:39.290
less expensive, or it's less expensive right
now than solar. Although the cost of solar

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:44.820
prices has gone down significantly. So it's
becoming rapidly very competitive.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.419
But 50 percent wind. That's four million of
those five megawatt wind turbines. Now in

00:30:49.419 --> 00:30:55.200
World War II, the US produced 330,000 airplanes
in four years. And to power the entire world

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.899
with, or half the world with wind, you need
only four million wind turbines. It's really

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:06.500
nothing. And the space, the actual land required
for that physically on the ground to, for

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.030
the poles in the ground and a little concrete
around it is the size of Manhattan. Which

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:19.090
is 38 square kilometers. And to, but I'll
show you a map of this in a little bit.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:25.470
For solar it would be divided between concentrated
solar, solar PV, and rooftop PV. So 20 percent

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:31.320
concentrated solar, 14 percent PV, power plants,
and 6 percent rooftops. And that's assuming

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.840
huge amounts of rooftop solar. If we can do
more that's great.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.881
Then hydroelectric, four percent. But 70 percent
of this is already in place. And then four

00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:43.389
percent geothermal and one percent each tidal
and wave.

00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:48.379
Now, the area to power, this is just for the
US onroad vehicles. Now if we did this with

00:31:48.379 --> 00:31:55.129
cellulosic ethanol, we'd require on average
about 18 percent of the entire US, including

00:31:55.129 --> 00:32:00.080
Alaska. Now there's a range here. It's between
five and 35 percent. Five percent is the ethanol

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.169
industry estimate. And 35 percent is the scientific
estimate.

00:32:04.169 --> 00:32:05.169
[laughter]

00:32:05.169 --> 00:32:09.059
So this is being fair. Just cut it in half
and that's what this represents. There's less

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:14.389
certainty in corn ethanol but it's still on
the order of 14 percent of the entire US,

00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:19.549
to power the US vehicle fleet. Now nuclear,
that's not one of its main problems. It doesn't

00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:22.630
take up much space, unless you live in Rhode
Island. It's about the size of Rhode Island,

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.299
you need to power the US vehicle fleet. We
can sacrifice Rhode Island for nuclear.

00:32:26.299 --> 00:32:33.269
But you'd need about 16,000 850 megawatt nuclear
power plants to power the world with nuclear.

00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:38.299
We have 440 today. So even if you had 5 percent
of the world power by nuclear, you'd double

00:32:38.299 --> 00:32:42.380
the number of plants today. And there'd be
more countries where that can develop weapons

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.720
capabilities like they are right now.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.759
Now, with wind, the footprint on the ground
is that red dot in the middle of that black

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:54.240
space. And that's one to three square kilometers.
You'd need one to three square kilometers

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.809
of land to power the entire US vehicle fleet
with wind. Due to the footprint. Now spacing,

00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:03.570
you need spacing between the turbines. And
that's the black. That's about half a percent

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:08.100
of the United States. Still, it's they're
one thirtieth of corn ethanol. To do this

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.419
same thing with corn ethanol, you have pollution
and you have global warming. With wind you

00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:20.710
have no pollution, no warming, hardly any
space, doesn't take up water. And it turns,

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.639
a lot of it could go offshore. Like in the
east coast, for example which is the greatest

00:33:24.639 --> 00:33:27.399
offshore wind resource in the world, almost.

00:33:27.399 --> 00:33:34.520
Now, for solar, you need 1/3 the spacing area
as wind. But it takes more footprint. But

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.350
it still is not very much space. And geothermal
is even smaller spacing area than solar, but

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:45.090
still more footprint than wind. So these are
not large areas for the wind, geothermal and

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.889
solar. This is just to power the whole US
vehicle fleet.

00:33:47.889 --> 00:33:54.139
Now what about, how much wind is there? This
is a map that our group developed which is

00:33:54.139 --> 00:33:58.909
from modeling. But we also looked at data
analysis. Got a similar number. Shows you

00:33:58.909 --> 00:34:02.590
the wind resource of the world. The great
plains is referred to as the Saudi Arabia

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:06.929
of wind. And the east coast and the west coast,
we have a lot of wind. Although the west coast

00:34:06.929 --> 00:34:11.460
we have very, it's deep, the water is very
deep so it's harder to get to.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:17.560
Now this wind you can power the world, this
11 and a half terawatts. We can power it six

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.700
to seven times over, with wind over land and
high wind locations. High wind locations are

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:30.280
about 15 percent of the entire world,has high
wind locations. And you have enough to power

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.030
six or seven times of the world power. There's
even more solar than wind. There are 340 terawatts

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:40.050
that we can power the world about 30 times
over for that 11 and a half terawatts that

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.350
we need.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:46.590
Now, what about reliability? This is a study
that we did, looking at, can you match the

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:50.540
power supply with the demand. People complain
that the wind and the solar are intermittent.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.890
The sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't
always blow. That's true. But the demand also

00:34:55.890 --> 00:35:00.440
is variable as well. And it's not a question
of just looking at wind or solar. It's looking

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:06.140
at, can you match the power demand with the
supply? And by combining wind and solar, geothermal

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:12.100
and hydroelectric, you can actually match
power demand in California 99 point 8 percent

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:18.660
of the hours of the year. And this is a study
we did for 2005 and 2006 looking at increase,

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:23.040
with the constant geothermal load, which is
the red on the bottom. Increasing the amount

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.670
of wind and solar. But keeping the hydro the
same. The wind is the light blue. This is

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:34.760
two particular days. Every hour of two particular
days. The yellow, the light yellow is solar

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.880
PV. The orange is concentrated solar. The
dark blue is hydroelectric. Without increasing

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.020
the amount of hydroelectric in the state,
using the existing amount.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.040
So we were able, the black line is the power
demand for those two days. And we were able

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.340
to match the power demand with supply over
two years, every day for two years except

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:56.500
for zero point two percent of the hours over
two years. So we think it is possible to do

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:01.590
this. It's just that each location you have
to optimize your resources.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:08.450
And what about materials? Take neodymium which
is needed in permanent magnets and wind turbine

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:14.200
generators. We need about four teragrams of
neodymium for three point eight million turbines.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:20.000
But there are about 27, 28 teragrams available.
And so we have about seven times more than

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.790
we need. So we don’t think this is a limitation.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:27.910
What about lithium? Well, lithium, there's
enough lithium we know of in resources for

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.240
three point three billion vehicles. And there
are about eight hundred million vehicles right

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.650
now. So again, not all the resources have
been uncovered.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:41.650
What about costs? The costs of conventional
fuels are about seven cents a kilowatt hour

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:48.431
today. And they're gonna go up to about eight
to ten cents a kilowatt hour in, by 2020 to

00:36:48.431 --> 00:36:53.532
2030. This is forecasted from EIA, Energy
Information Administration. But there are

00:36:53.532 --> 00:36:57.850
also externality costs which are a minimum
of about five cents in kilowatt hours today.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:02.110
These are health and environmental cost. And
going up to at least six cents a kilowatt

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:07.201
hour in 2020 to 2030. So we're talking about
the real cost of conventional energy, today

00:37:07.201 --> 00:37:14.420
is about 12, over 12 cents a kilowatt hour.
And 13 to 15 cents in 2020 to 2030. And these

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.040
are conservative estimates for the externality
costs. Very conservative.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:24.160
Now wind. Geothermal. Onshore wind, geothermal
and hydroelectric are completely cost competitive

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.600
today. In fact, in the US wine has been the
second largest new source of electric power

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.280
on average for the last five years. In Europe,
wind and solar last year generated 68 percent

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.821
of all the new electricity. So they're very
cost competitive. Both of them. Even solar,

00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:45.400
although solar has been getting a lot more,
getting some subsidies. Now the other costs

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:50.830
are coming down for the rest of the technologies.
And we expect by 2020 to 2030 they'll all

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:56.400
be cost competitive especially when you account
for the externality costs of the fossil fuels.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:02.320
So just to summarize, we think that converting
to wind, water and sun will reduce world power

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.970
demands by about 32 percent. In the US about
37 percent. So eliminate two and half to three

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:14.760
million air pollution deaths including 100,000
in the US every year. Eliminate global warming.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:21.831
Provide energy stability. The cost of electricity
will be similar to what we have, four to ten

00:38:21.831 --> 00:38:27.400
cents a kilowatt hour for most technologies.
Eight to 13 for some. And be similar to or

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.730
less than conventional fuels. And additional,
long distance transmission to get, for example,

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:38.510
from the great plains to 2,000 kilometers
is about one cent a kilowatt hour on average.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:42.620
Although there is a big range between point
two and three cents a kilowatt hour. For long

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:48.170
distance transmission. And finally, the total
area required would be about point four percent

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:53.040
of the world's land. For the footprint. And
point six percent for the spacing. So one

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.010
percent of the world for energy to power the
whole world for all purposes forever. We'd

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.570
have to increase it a little bit over time.
Compared to 40 percent of the world's land

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.420
is used right now for grazing, farmland, and
agriculture.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:08.780
There are many methods of addressing variability.
And I already discussed one, but there are

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.040
others as well. Materials are not limits,
but recycling may be needed. There are barriers

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.130
such as upfront cost, transmission need, lobbying
and politics.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.130
[laughter]

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:23.660
And with that, I want to turn it over to Marco,
who's going to talk about the business and

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:29.850
more financial aspects of what we need to
do to get to clean energy.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.860
[applause]

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:41.820
&gt;&gt;Marco Krapels: So it's definitely downhill
from here. [laughs] after your listening to

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:49.050
the Hulk and most renowned professor on this
topic. You have to listen for five more minutes

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.770
to an evil banker.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.650
[laughter]

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:57.140
But we're doing good things, too. Because
we're financing a lot of renewable energy.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:07.740
So you know, what I wanted to do is talk a
little bit about your, how you turn all this

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:16.120
science really into relevancy for businesses.
So what can they do now?

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:23.740
Before I do that I want to share with you
some numbers and this is what bankers do.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:30.060
And some quotes, things that I think are relevant
to the discussion that I'm about to have.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.680
Businesses need price stability. I mean, we
have, I work for the largest agricultural

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:42.350
bank in the world. And we bank farmers. Lots
of them. In 34 countries. And farmers are

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:47.100
worried enough about commodity prices and
they understand that part. But in terms of

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:52.300
energy, which is a huge component of their
cost structure. They're really worried about

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:58.330
it. It's volatile. Gas is up, gas is down.
Oil is up, oil is down. And it's a concern.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:03.540
And rising energy costs, volatile energy costs,
is something that is really worried a lot

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:08.970
of our clients. And if you're a dairy farmer
in Hanford, Central Valley, California. Anyone

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:16.650
from Hanford? No. Didn't think so. But you
know, you are using a lot of water. Dairies

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:20.000
use an enormous amount of water. They use
an enormous amount of energy. As a matter

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.430
of fact, the movement of water is one of the
single largest sources of electric use in

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:30.660
this state. So that's an issue. It's an issue
for businesses. It's an issue for farmers.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.250
So price stability is extremely important.
And oil and gas we know for the last 50 years

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.420
have not provided that.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.800
Let me. Forward. Here.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:45.571
There is a lot of sun. an hour of sun can
power the planet for an entire year. You've

00:41:45.571 --> 00:41:54.640
seen those quotes. Mark and I had the fortunate
opportunity to have a chat with Elon, not

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.550
too long ago. And he made the perfect quote
there. He said, everything else already exists

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.890
because of the sun. what are we waiting for?

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:08.310
So I love of course the Google definition.
You Google fossils. And of course what pops

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:13.400
up is an antiquated or stubbornly unchanging
person or thing.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.400
[laughter]

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.630
Well, there you have it. Thank you Google
by the way.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:22.730
[laughter]
Because the truth rises to the top. Over the

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:29.330
last 100 years, trillions of dollars have
been invested in sustaining a fossil fuel

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:33.770
infrastructure. Which 50 years ago was a great
idea because we didn't have any other choices.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.870
Today we probably should slow that down a
little bit. More than, eventually we will

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:43.480
run out. This is, what we're talking about
is an inevitability. Probably in our lifetime.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:50.600
Most likely our children's. So in the history
of mankind, we have like a second left.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.220
[pause]

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:59.200
And of course, yeah, I had the opportunity
actually to be in the White House last week.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:07.220
And we discussed this topic and we sort of
reminded everyone that this is in congressional

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:13.100
research that the last 50 years, about 400
billion dollars in subsidies and tax breaks

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:19.490
have been going to oil and gas. And still
about four billion dollars a year. That's

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:24.910
a lot of money if you compare that to the
minuscule portion that's being invested in

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:30.480
actually developing a renewable energy infrastructure.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:36.570
This is very important to our clients. It's
what our clients have faced in the last 30,

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:41.910
40 years. It's rising and volatile energy
costs. Not good if you're trying to build

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.320
a sustainable business model.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:51.010
So tell you a little client story here. I
have two more stories and then we'll close

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:57.491
it. I think we're doing OK on time now. But
a lot of our clients are agricultural. They

00:43:57.491 --> 00:44:04.180
tend to be right-leaning. And a lot of them
are in California, they're mostly located

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:08.930
in the valley. All the way from Oregon to
the Mexican border. We have about 3,000 of

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.830
those clients.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:17.780
And so two years ago, when I decided we needed
to put a team on the ground, not just to invest

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:24.260
in utility scale solar projects, and multibillion
dollar syndicated bank deals, but also wanted

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.380
to make renewable energy solutions relevant
to our own client base. The people that have

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:33.410
been telling me "I'm worried about energy
costs." So I started visiting, after I hired

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:40.330
some people, we started visiting the clients.
And sit down. And this is Lakeside Dairy.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:45.040
It's a dairy farm in Hanford, California.
You'll see the size of the solar plant. It's

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.810
a one megawatt solar plant right next to the
farm. Which is by the way on fallow land.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:53.330
There's nothing else you could have done with
that land.

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:58.060
And I sat down with them. And I started to
talk renewable energy. And they looked at

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:03.500
me as if I'd literally just landed form a
spaceship. And they said "Marco, Marco, Marco."

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:09.150
And his name is Manny and Mike Monteiro. Two
brothers. Dairy farmers. And they said "Marco,

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:15.400
no, no, no, no, no, no. we know that you live
in San Francisco and we know that you're all

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:22.980
green, and tree huggerish. But the green that
we like, is this kinda green. This is the

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:33.970
green that we like." And I said "Fine. You
can have both. You can have both." And I showed

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:42.140
them the charts. And I made them show me their
energy bills. We spent an entire afternoon.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:47.010
And they agreed. They said "Yeah, it's really
frustrating the hell out of us. We need to

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:55.670
take control of these energy costs." And I
said "Well, we bank a few big solar companies.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:00.850
And why don't you talk to them? Because I
think this can do something for you." Well,

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:10.200
this is what happened. They ended up investing.
So creates jobs, spent capital, jobs that

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.210
needed desperately to be created. Because
there's a lot of unemployment in the central

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:23.220
valley. And they invested in a four million
dollar power plant. Solar power plant. And

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:27.100
they did a very simple math calculation. Which
every one of our clients is doing right now.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:35.210
They look at the acquisition costs of solar.
You deduct the local incentives, tax rebates,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:41.080
and whether that's an investment tax credit
or what used to be the cash grant. And that

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.820
is a net cost for solar and you divide that
by the expected amount of kilowatt hour of

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:53.400
output for the next 30 years 'cause these
things last. And that resulting number is

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:58.020
your per kilowatt hour cost. And if that number
compares favorably with the number that you

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:03.640
were paying last month, then it's an economically
sensible decision.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:10.140
And a lot of our clients are making this calculations
and this is actually well above our expectations.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:17.450
Is a constituency that you would expect natural
resistance from, is adopting this at a very,

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:23.620
very fast rate. We have many other clients
that have done the math, looked at it, and

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:28.160
said "Yeah, this gives us one, some energy
independence" and not energy independence

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.410
being beholden by five big oil and gas companies
or a utility telling you your rates are going

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:38.070
up. No, you're controlling your own power.
It happens to be green. Clean. And they do

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:42.970
care about that. They have children. They
don't want their children to have to suffer.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:52.120
So they do care. And it helps them most importantly,
it's fixed their energy costs. And this is

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.610
what this has done for our clients.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:48:00.100
The other one is a really interesting example
too. It's Castle Rock Vineyards. The owner

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:07.610
is Al Good. Al's a great guy. And he called
us up and said "Listen, let's talk. I heard

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:11.930
from these other farmers that you've been
doing this. What you've done." 'Cause farmers

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:17.200
talk. When you have a happy farmer, everyone
will know. When you have an angry farmer,

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.570
they'll know sooner.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.570
[laughter]

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:28.590
So we go to talk to Al. Al did the same thing.
He's a table grape grower. And is storing

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:34.500
all of his table grapes in a very, very large
cooling facility powered by a one megawatt

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:43.580
solar plant today. Now, when we did the numbers
for him, it turned out that the per kilowatt

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:50.840
cost of solar actually wasn't as attractive
compared to his traditional utility bill as

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:55.960
the other client example I gave you. Because
this guy is on an ag meter, and if you're

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.370
on an ag meter you pay probably a little bit
less than if you're on a regular commercial

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:07.180
meter. But he still did that. You know why?
He's selling table grapes to very, very large

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:16.060
retailers. Retailers in UK, retailers in United
States. And I, for, to respect the confidentiality,

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:22.400
I cannot disclose the names of those retailers.
But what are those retailers doing? They are

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.810
ranking the sustainability of their supply
chain. And according to the sustainability

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:31.610
of their supply chain, they're starting to
rank and create a sort of preferred provider

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:37.220
list. And so this actually, he did this, because
his clients wanted him to do it. And he's

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:42.160
selling more grapes today because of the decision
that he made. Which was by the way a cost-neutral

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.160
decision.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:50.640
So those I think are two examples of how the
science can be turned into an actual product,

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:57.850
with a financing product around it. Which
has been very very beneficial. Now, in closing,

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:04.440
what do we need? We need to make sure that
the tremendous amount of subsidies that are

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:11.710
still going into a fossil fuel based industry
start to be rerouted to sustain what is still

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:16.890
very much a developing industry. You can't
just say there's a tax credit one year for

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:20.500
solar. And we take it away the next year.
Because you can't build a business on that.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:25.660
You need sustainable policy to continue to
grow this sector. Which by the way deserves

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:30.770
equally as much, if not more support, from
our political leaders as these other industries

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:35.180
have. And that's something we feel very strongly
about. Something that we'll continue to help

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:39.100
advocate, and that's about all I have to say.
So. Thank you very much.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.140
[applause]

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:50.600
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So we're gonna invite
the speakers back up and take questions. We

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:57.580
have a Googler moderator page at 'go wind
water sun'.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:13.470
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi gentlemen. Thank you. Really
interesting talk and congratulations on doing

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.480
really important and amazing work for all
of us.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.730
&gt;&gt;Marco Krapels: Thank you.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:20.740
&gt;&gt;male #1: A little disclaimer, I guess. I
worked in the solar field for a while before

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:27.050
I started at Google. So. [chuckles] I guess
my question is, what work and collaboration

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:33.180
is happening on the finance side in terms
of educating banks and investment partners

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:40.010
and tax equity providers to expect a rate
of return that is maybe not in line with other

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:44.740
investments? Because I, from personal experience,
I found that that was something that would

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:49.050
hold up a lot of projects. And I think it's
a balance because obviously everybody's in

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:54.120
there to make money. And it's a business and
that's ultimately a good thing. But to say

00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:00.591
"here's our standard on, in oil and gas investment
where maybe we're making 20 percent IRR. That's

00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:04.970
not really reasonable on a solar facility.
Or on a CSP." So.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.210
&gt;&gt;Marco: Krapels: That question is for you
Mark. [laughing]

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.500
&gt;&gt;Mark Ruffalo: I got this one.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.500
[laughter]

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.930
&gt;&gt;Mark Ruffalo: It's my strong suit.

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:16.890
&gt;&gt;Marco Krapels: Tax equity all the way.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:17.890
&gt;&gt;Mark Ruffalo: Yeah.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:22.870
&gt;&gt;Marco Krapels: You know, I, it's a good
question. I think that, I mean you know there

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:30.190
are a few big players in the tax equity investment
world. And there were very few a few years

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:34.700
ago. Because in order to be able to use tax
equity you need taxable income. And the banks

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.300
were losing a lot of money. Couple of years
ago. And so there wasn't that much available.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:43.750
It's starting to come back. I think the few
big players that are out there. You know who

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:51.060
they are. They continue to attract good solid
investments. The, I think the emergence of

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:57.810
impact funds, I think could help. Where people
could allocate certain amount of their mutual

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:03.240
funds into impact funds. Those funds maybe
invest in some that may have a benefit for

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:08.070
society. And may still have a healthy 10,
15 percent return. It may not be the 20 percent

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:12.230
return. But at least you can go to sleep and
feel good about what you've done. So I think

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:18.740
there's' a place for that. And I do, you know,
but again, back to, let's use your tax equity

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:24.410
example. If the 1603 cash grant were reinstated,
we wouldn't be worried about tax equity. And

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:29.960
so I think this is really, really important
is that we need to do what we can to let our

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:37.280
leaders know, "Guys, you can't just give it
and then take it away." So, I do hope at some

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:42.830
point it comes back. Probably have to wait
until after November.

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:44.600
&gt;&gt;male #1: yeah.

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:50.440
&gt;&gt;Marco Krapels: But it's, I don't know. Look
at yourself. Would you accept a lower yield

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:56.810
for something that you feel is the right thing
to do? And so I think there's an, if you look

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:00.520
at portfolio occasions, I think there is a
place for that. I think there is. There is.

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.070
And it's easier for private institutions like
ourselves to do that. Than publicly listed

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:09.630
institutions. Although there are a few publicly
listed institutions that are under quite a

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:13.780
bit of pressure right now to do something
right. So this is definitely the right time

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.230
to have that dialogue. Thank you.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:17.250
&gt;&gt;male #1: yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:24.060
&gt;&gt;male #2: For Mark Jacobson. You made several
references to the windmills themselves versus

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:28.290
the land between them. Are there particular
things that's done with the surrounding land.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.830
Like pasture grazing or--

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:36.100
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Yeah. So wind. Well wind
turbines if they're on agricultural land.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:40.840
They can be used for, the land can be used
for dual purposes such as either grazing or

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:48.910
farmland. I mean, in fact in the Great Plains,
there are many farmers. I mean, could be hundreds

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:56.230
at this point that take leases of, put wind
turbines on their land and get paid royalties

00:54:56.230 --> 00:55:02.430
for that. So the multiple, so it even on Altima
Pass, you can see the green, we've preserved

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:07.270
the green foothills. You can see the wind
turbines there but the grass is green and

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:12.510
there's grazing on that land as well. And
so. And over the ocean, there's no land over

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:16.690
the ocean when you put it offshore. So there's
no land use taken up at all.

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:21.500
&gt;&gt;male #2: Also you made a reference to what
was like a seventh. Like all the wind in the

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.960
world overland providing, what, about seven
times the [inaudible]

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.890
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Right. So if you take all
the locations where the wind speed at 100

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:33.710
meters height is seven meters per second or
faster. Which is the speed you need for cost-competitive

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:43.190
wind energy. If you limited the land are for
those speeds, there are around seven times

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:50.570
more wind available over land outside Antarctica,
that we need for all purposes. And that wind

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:55.680
comprises, there's, that whole wind that sever
percent. Sorry that seven times the whole

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.880
wind is about 15 percent of all world land
has that speed.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.080
&gt;&gt;male #2: I was wondering if you do wind
turbines on a larger scale. Is there like

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:08.290
a non linearity where one wind turbine kind
of like slows down the wind that the next

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:09.290
one receives?

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:10.290
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Yeah. Yeah.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.290
&gt;&gt;male #2: And if you scale them up you get
diminishing returns?

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:14.740
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Yeah. In fact we've studied
that in detail. In fact we just finished a

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:20.921
global study that we just, put wind turbines
over the entire world. Every single, over

00:56:20.921 --> 00:56:25.390
land, over water. To see, what's the saturation
wind potential of the world. And it was about,

00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:32.280
it was about 270 terawatts. Which is compared
to 11 and a half terawatts that we need. But

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:39.460
over land it was close to that 75 terawatts
or so. So that's when you, that's totally

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:44.330
putting wind turbines over all the land in
the world. You get 75 terawatts. And we don't

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:45.330
even need nearly that much.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:46.330
&gt;&gt;male #2: Right.

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.780
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: We only need half of 11 and
a half. Five point seven five terawatts.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.030
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thank you.

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:56.170
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hi. One of the key selling points
that you mentioned for these renewable sources

00:56:56.170 --> 00:57:05.690
was basically the economic stability. As opposed
to the price fluctuations in oil and coal.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:11.000
And other fossil fuels. But I'm wondering,
it seems like that stability once everything's

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.280
been built out. So what do you see, kind of
the economic situation of that build out.

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.260
So it looks like for several of these sources
we're going to have to ramp up production

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.800
by several orders of magnitude. And we're
not gonna be the only ones who are trying

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:31.641
to get at these resources. I know a lot of
them are overseas. So what's the risk. Kind

00:57:31.641 --> 00:57:36.520
of, for disruption in prices or fluctuations
in prices during this ramp up and build out

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.520
phase.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.350
&gt;&gt;Marco Krapels: Can I give one answer from
a business perspective? And then you should

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:46.730
probably talk about the larger scale. Is that
OK? Yeah. So just, look at solar. Demand for

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:53.500
solar is increased substantially over the
last few years. And the price of solar per

00:57:53.500 --> 00:58:00.130
watt is dropped through the floor. So the
increase in demand to ramp up is not necessarily

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:07.450
a negative for price. As long as, I mean,
it's supply demand balances, right? And so,

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:13.310
I think as an example, solar from a business
owner perspective who is seeking to acquire

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:22.450
this as a way to mitigate energy volatility,
it's this increasing demand for solar has

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:27.250
caused a significant increase in supply. Which
has actually driven the price down. But that's

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:34.370
just solar on a smaller scale. And on a sort
of distributed basis, has done fairly well.

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.310
In meeting that ramped up demand.

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:40.620
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: I'd say with the right policies
in place that it doesn't have to be an issue.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:45.000
Like in the US right now, the issue is that
the wind energy production tax credit, like

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.330
it's expiring at the end of this year. So
there's a lot of uncertainty in the wind markets

00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:53.000
as a result. And so if there's more, if there
were policies in place that could make these

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.870
more stable, even the solar credit is longer
credit. That it's not an issue because especially

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:05.070
if there's also a mandate to go to large scale.
Then we could plan things. It's critical to

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:10.690
plan these things ahead of time. If we just
do it kind of randomly. Have a wind farm here,

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:15.680
solar farm here. Without any kind of real
planning of this. Then you can run into supply

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:21.360
and demand issues. But if it's, really planned
and everybody is on board and wants to do

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.440
this, then I think it's a lot easier and the
policies can be put in place and they could

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.470
be all facilitated.

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:31.030
&gt;&gt;male #3: Right. I think one of the weak
points I saw, one of the things I was wondering

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:37.490
about was batteries. You mentioned that there's,
that we currently have what 800 million cars

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:38.490
in the world?

00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:39.490
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Yeah.

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:44.220
&gt;&gt;male #3: And based on current battery technology
there's something like three point three billion

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:49.590
cars worth of metals out there. But what happens
when, you mentioned recycling, but what kind

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:56.210
of recycling program would we really need
to have in order to be able to really use

00:59:56.210 --> 01:00:01.580
all of that? And what kind of mining operations
would we need to have in order to get at a

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.580
sufficient chunk?

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:07.210
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Well, a lot of the lithium
is in Bolivian salt flats. So, there are these

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:12.560
huge. Well, I showed a picture of them. You
can see it just goes on forever. These salt

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.420
flats. And they're only like a meter underground.
They're not even under, they're under the

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:20.410
salt. They're just one meter down.

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:25.210
Like anything, well, the prices control the
recycling rates. And so when you get shortages,

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:29.820
the prices go up. And then people start recycling
to take advantage of that, and then hopefully

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:37.250
the prices stabilize. So it can be a market
driven thing. In terms of the how much recycling

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.970
is done. But there are a lot more resources
I'm sure out there as well. These are just

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:45.310
the known resources. And people only started
recently looking. I mean just in the last

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:51.190
two years the USGS doubled their estimate
of the reserve because they started looking.

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:55.142
And 'cause they weren't interested in it before.
And so now, I think there are actually a lot

01:00:55.142 --> 01:00:57.240
more than what I showed there.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.830
&gt;&gt;male #4: You guys have a great story and
American companies like this one are buying

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:09.010
into using wind and water to power our data
centers, for example. I'm wondering what success

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:14.160
have you had in other countries that matter
a lot,like India and China, in getting them

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.600
to adopt these technologies.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:23.670
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Well, my experience. Certainly
Germany is very far ahead in terms of adopting,

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:30.240
putting policies in place. Like the feed-in
tariff. And really pushing for solar and wind.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.440
They've decommissioned most of their nuclear.
Japan just decommissioned 50 nuclear power

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:41.570
plants. China is pushing forward with lots
of wind and solar. But they're also pushing

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:49.440
for lots of coal and they're, so they're kind
of pushing everything forward. So I, you know

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.470
I think we have to set an example here. I
mean we can't really control so much what

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:56.761
other countries are doing. Although there
are a lot of people in other countries that

01:01:56.761 --> 01:02:00.840
are trying to make a big difference, too.
But I think if we set a good example here,

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.590
which we're capable of, I think they'll follow
pretty quickly.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:08.690
&gt;&gt;male #5: Hi guys. I know the focus of the
presentation was on delivering enough energy

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:12.050
to meet our current needs. I was wondering
if you could talk a little about where the

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:16.450
middle ground is between actually making technologies
more efficient, changing the ways cities are

01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:20.470
planned, and like people's habits on being
more efficient.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:25.620
&gt;&gt;Mark Jacobson: Yeah, I can say something
on that. So I talked about one kind of efficiency

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:31.560
which is converting to electricity but there's
the other kind, is energy efficiency in buildings.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:36.100
Better city planning. It's definitely part
of this, as well. I just didn't mention it

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:42.700
and I should have. But conservation. Of course.
But there's also, there's a, we try to be

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:48.170
conservative in the study to assume that people
weren't going to be conserving. That they

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:52.980
wanted to use their current amount of energy.
And just to be conservative about it, 'cause

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:59.360
we don’t want our plan to rely on people
conserving when it turns out they don't. And

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.820
also city planning. But if people do, and
if things become more efficient, technologies

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:08.901
are more efficient,and cities are planned
better, that would make it even easier. We'd

01:03:08.901 --> 01:03:15.130
even hopefully need less energy than the 11
½ terawatts. So that's definitely an important

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:18.870
component and I don't want to underestimate
the benefit of it.

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:25.920
&gt;&gt;Marco Krapels: If I may provide a partial
response as well. We need a wave of massive

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.200
energy awareness. On an individual level.
30 years ago people were told that smoking

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:36.280
was fine. Doctors were used in Marlboro and
Camel advertising saying "I smoke, and so

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:43.450
should you." And so I bet you that most Californians
don't know now that unless this is from your

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:49.780
own renewable source,that 41 percent of that
light power is coming from gas powered fire

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:56.810
plants. Gas powered plants. Who are getting
an increasing portion of that gas from the

01:03:56.810 --> 01:04:03.940
fracking that's happening next to Mark's farm.
And you know, I think you need an awareness.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:09.530
And then you need the solutions. So I think
when people realize that smoking is now bad

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:13.390
for them, is not good for them. They'll put
the cigarettes down. They'll do something

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:20.670
else. I think we do need some,we need some
awareness on an individual level. And engage

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:27.310
a much broader audience than I think the selective
group of people who are taking a real interest

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:28.310
in this.

01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:32.550
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So with that we're gonna
bring it to a close. Thank you so much for

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:46.030
joining us today and we'll be posting this
on YouTube soon. Thank you.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:49.650
