00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.800
For my part I think the most important
thing about hiring early on or

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.060
at any point your startup but
especially early on is the same thing

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.148
that's important wiuth everything you do
as an entrepreneur, and I suspect it.

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:14.260
And that's to sort of to trust your
instincts and trust your judgment.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.630
It's good to think about these things.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.820
It's good to read about
other people's experiences.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.270
It's good to listen to me and
what I went through, but

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.360
the most important thing, when I've
gone wrong hiring, when I've gone wrong

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.330
with product plans and launches,
it's because I didn't trust myself.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.980
I don't listen to myself.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.480
If you feel like it's
a good hire go after it.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.720
If you don't, don't.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.960
But the most important thing is to
trust yourself as an entrepreneur.
