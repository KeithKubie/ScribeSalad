00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.880
The Joe Rogan experience.
Have you had any psychedelic experiences yet?

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.740
I haven't and I was so tempted.
We used to,

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.190
we started the interview talking about my chocolate.
Shamanism.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.630
You haven't said anything I haven't in,
but I was real excited.
Want to?

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.820
I don't think so.
And I'll tell you why.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
So I listened to the Michael Palin interviews and he had his great conversation

7
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.320
with Sam Harris and I really think that this silhouette's Ivan stuff is,

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.140
is real and just got d criminal.
I know in Denver,
I was just there the other day.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.680
Um,
but as I said before,

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
I think that the ultimate drug is us.
And so for me,

11
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.130
I would rather,
and I definitely think that our awareness that does,

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
it doesn't encompass everything that is knowable.
Everything that we,

13
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:51.520
that we could know,
but we have ourselves in and if we want to get out of,

14
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.040
of those limitations,

15
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.870
certainly drugs are ways that people have used for,

16
00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:00.660
for many thousands of years.
But when you take the drug,

17
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.760
you're like taking the drug and then you're not taking the drug.

18
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
Like I would rather,
what does that mean?
It's like if you're taking psilocybin,

19
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.790
you're having this great experience,

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.000
but then tomorrow you're not taking silicide urban and so kind of your

21
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.260
consciousness has narrowed.

22
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.790
My aspiration would be to recognize that the drug is us,

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.750
that if we want to expand our consciousness,
there are all kinds of ways,

24
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:26.130
whether it's meditation or awareness or just you know,
simple appreciation.

25
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:27.780
That's when I do these cacao ceremonies.

26
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:30.900
What I say is like you have this cacau in front of you,

27
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.901
but it's not just this like think of the person in Honduras who planted the

28
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:40.320
seed.
The person who watered that see the person who took the plant,

29
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.950
the person who paved the road to bring the plan.
And I just,

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.720
I just think that we can expand our consciousness through our own means and then

31
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.370
we always have access.
I hear what you're saying,

32
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:53.410
but you're saying this from a person that's never had,
so I know experienced.

33
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.700
It's really preposterous.
You did experience silicide and can do to,
yeah.

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.460
You definitely wouldn't be saying it this way.
You also wouldn't be thinking,

35
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.240
then you take it and then you're not on it anymore because it's profoundly

36
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.650
influential for the,

37
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.010
your perspective in regards to the whole rest of your existence.

38
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.900
There's many people that have had psychedelic experiences to think about it as a

39
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.980
rebirth.
Yeah.
That they've gone through this and changed.
Yeah.
So,
well,

40
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:24.750
why would you have this rigid thought process about drugs and not drugs,

41
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.640
but yet you don't have it about cow,
which is a mild drug.
Yeah.

42
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.970
And so I,
you're right that it may not be entirely consistent.

43
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.670
Some of the people you've described are good friends of mine who've really done

44
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.080
it,
and I've really,
I've talked to them about it and I'm,
I'm endlessly curious,

45
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.610
so why don't you do it?
The reason is so far,

46
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.910
I have been on this journey to see what's possible within my self and I'm still

47
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:51.690
on that journey.
I'm not,

48
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.200
I don't want to close off any possibility for any assume that it would close

49
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.120
things off.
That's what's confusing.
Yeah.

50
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.990
It's just opening you up to a new experience at other people have found to be

51
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.200
profoundly influential.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,

52
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.830
so far you're very resistant to this.
Like you,
you're not talking,
you're like,

53
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.840
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Like you can't wait to come back to your own rationale,

54
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:14.170
your respect.
You know,
it's funny,
I will,

55
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.310
I will come back to this perspective of a person who hasn't experienced
anything.

56
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.910
You're so right.
And just,

57
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.610
I think it's such a great point because I'm very close with actually the,

58
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.600
with the Tibetans.

59
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.440
One of my closest friends is the prime minister of the Tibetan exile
governments.

60
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.090
I've been many times to John Sala in India.
I've met with his holiness,

61
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:36.091
the Dalai Lama many times and the most incredible thing about meeting with these

62
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:37.414
guys.
And they,

63
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.800
they are all people who've found these incredible states of,

64
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.150
of heightened consciousness so much that their brains are changed when they go

65
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:51.040
into the,
the MRI machines.
But when you have a conversation with them,

66
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.770
it's not like we do like,
exactly.
And thank you for calling me out.

67
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.670
Like you say something,

68
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.990
I've already in my head countered what you're saying before you're finished

69
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:01.060
saying,
and I'm like,
why you kept saying,
right,
exactly.
Yeah.
Which probably means,

70
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.850
yeah,
you made me on a little uncomfortable,
which is good.
That's what we,

71
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:05.350
what we want.
And these guys,

72
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:09.490
it's like you talk to them and they would just be so tuned in to what you were

73
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:11.950
saying and they would just kind of think about it.

74
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.340
Then you'd finish and then they'd kind of look up.
And then,

75
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.870
because we're Americans,
we,
we,
we want,
you know,

76
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.850
somebody stops speaking like you have to if you don't speak right away.

77
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.960
And then there was like a minute and then it's like you're kind of looking at

78
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.380
round,
was it me?
Did I say it's,

79
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.380
and then they would come back with this incredibly thoughtful thing.
So I,

80
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.930
you're right.
You know,
I don't want to close off any possibility.

81
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.840
There are many different things that we could,
uh,
could do.

82
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.500
The Path that I have been on and certainly with this Cook County,
right.

83
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:46.080
Cacau is like a,
a mild,
I mean,
not a huge one,
but like a,

84
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:49.770
a mild drug and life is a mild drug.
Um,

85
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.010
so Simon's not very mild.
Yeah,
no.
In my friends who have done it,

86
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.700
have said exactly what you said.
They say,
I have a,
a good friend of mine who,
uh,

87
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.730
who did it.
Um,
and then he said,
it just,

88
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.800
it showed me a path to a different identity,
a different consciousness.

89
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.330
And now he said,
I don't do psilocybin,
but I do daily meditation,

90
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.160
but I can see where I'd like to go,
what's possible.
So I get that.
Yeah.

91
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.540
Yeah.
There's a bunch of different substances out there that have very similar

92
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:21.820
profound effects.
Yeah.
Um.
