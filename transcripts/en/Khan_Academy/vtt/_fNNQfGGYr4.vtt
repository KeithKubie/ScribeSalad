00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:07.600
Let's have the molecule
sodium chloride.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.840
Let's look at the
periodic table.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.870
Sodium, it's in alkali metal.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.770
It has one valence electron.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.190
It's in Group 1.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.800
And so when it only
has one, it really

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.710
wants to give it away.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.350
And chlorine is a halogen,
and it's only one away.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.260
It just needs one electron to
have the full eight valence

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.400
electrons in its outermost
shell.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.159
So it really wants to
take 1 electron.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.900
And we've talked about this
story multiple times,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.220
especially it early in the
chemistry playlist. So what we

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.410
know what's going to happen.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.920
Sodium, since it wants to lose
an electron, is going to lose

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.810
its electron.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.380
And it's going to give
it to chlorine.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.810
And chlorine is going
to gain it.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.020
And so you're going to have a
situation where sodium is

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.950
going to have a plus 1 charge,
because it lost an electron.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.900
And then chlorine will have a
minus 1 charge because it

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.480
gained an electron.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.910
And then they'll be attracted to
each other because this one

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.570
is now a positive atom
and that one is

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.540
now a negative atom.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.730
And just the Coulomb force will
make them want to be with

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.140
each other.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.470
And we call this, of course,
an ionic bond.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.700
I haven't taught you anything
you don't know yet.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.510
And in an ionic bond, you
literally had a loss of

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.190
electron from one compound
to another.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.870
Now.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.880
that's a very cut-and-dry
situation.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.280
But we saw other situations
where wasn't quite as

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.300
cut-and-dry.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.350
For example, H2O.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.520
Where you have a oxygen-- but
you've seen this multiple

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.300
times already, if
you're watching

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.130
this playlist in order.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.790
And it's bonded to
2 hydrogens.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.710
But we know that oxygen is much,
much more-- in fact,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.110
nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine
are the most electronegative

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.880
atoms, which means that they
like to hog electrons the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.900
most. So when you have oxygen
bonded with pretty much

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.130
anything-- but in particular in
this case, hydrogen-- it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.910
going to to pull most of the
electrons in its direction.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.930
So even though these are
covalent bonds, the hydrogen

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.250
is still sharing the
electrons that it

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.660
has bonded with oxygen.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.940
The electrons spend most of
their time on the oxygen side

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220
of this whole affair.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.730
So you have a partial negative
charge on the oxygen end of

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.430
the molecule.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.710
And you have partial positive
charges on the hydrogen.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.920
And we talked about this.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.100
And this is what leads
to hydrogen

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.560
bonding, and all of that.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.990
What we're going to do here is
introduce-- it's almost an

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.010
intellectual tool.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.160
We know that this isn't
an ionic bond.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.880
We know that this is actually
a covalent bond, that this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.630
atom is shared.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.060
But it spends most of
its time at the more

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.170
electronegative atom.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.170
That's why you have this partial
negative charge.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.630
So we create this convention
called oxidation states.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.400
Let me write that down.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.925
And I'll clarify what the
word means in a second.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.830
And this is essentially
assigning-- With an ionic

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.150
compound, you naturally assign
a charge, because each atom

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.510
really does have a charge.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.000
But let's say we want to live in
a world where we don't like

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.560
this partial charge,
partial negative.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.950
We want to say, look, if this
were, hypothetically, an ionic

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740
bond, what would it look like?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.430
Who would gain the
electron and who

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.960
would lose the electron?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.070
So in the case of water, if you
were forced to say OK, who

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.310
gained the electron?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.880
You'd say oxygen gained 2
electrons from the hydrogens,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.840
and the hydrogens lost each
1 electron to the oxygen.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.260
So the hydrogen would have a
plus 1 charge, each of them.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.300
And then the oxygen would
have a minus 2 charge.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.210
Now, I want to be very
clear with this.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.840
This isn't what really
happened.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.790
This is just our little
intellectual game that we're

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.550
playing called an
oxidation state.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.590
It's going to be really useful
later to understand why some

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.700
reactions occur.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.480
But I just want to
be very clear.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.320
This is a hypothetical charge
if these were ionic bonds.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.070
So you're just saying, whoever
is the more electronegative--

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.070
and remember, electronegativity,
it goes

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.340
from the bottom left
to the top right.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.890
So these are the most
electronegative atoms, which

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.269
means they love to hog electrons
the most. These are

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.110
the least. Or you could also
call them the most

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.080
electropositive, which means
they like to give away

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.430
electrons the most.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.800
So what you would do
is you say, OK.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.810
The more electronegative,
let's just say that they

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.710
actually get the electrons.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.070
And that the more
electropositive atoms, they

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.140
give the electrons.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.700
Even though we know that it's
something in between.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.050
It's actually partial.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.030
Now these numbers.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.760
These hypothetical ionization
of these hydrogen molecules.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.580
This is called their
oxidation number.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:04.720
The oxidation number of hydrogen
in H2O is plus 1.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.420
So we could write a plus 1 for
each of the hydrogens there.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.040
And then oxidation number for
the oxygen is minus 2.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.150
And the way we talk about it,
we say that the hydrogen

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.330
molecules here have
been oxidized.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.700
And it's kind of like saying
that you've been-- In this

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.010
case, they were oxidized
by oxygen.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.120
And this is actually a very
confusing point, or at least

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.210
it was to me initially.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.500
Because when I first learned
about oxidation, I was like,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.890
oh, that's what oxygen
does to things.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.180
Because the word has the word,
oxygen, or at least the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.910
beginning part of oxygen.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.255
So I thought, oh, oxidation must
mean what oxygen does to

00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:49.100
other atoms, which
means it takes

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.460
electrons away from them.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.880
Usually it takes 2 electrons
for itself.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.390
Maybe it took 1 from each of the
other atoms. So if you've

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.000
been oxidized, you've had
electrons taken away from you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.530
And so you'll have a
positive charge.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.190
Now, that interpretation
is only partially true.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.550
The reality is it does not have
to be oxygen that's doing

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.840
the oxidation.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.440
So for example, let me
do hydrogen fluoride.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.060
H F.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.250
I've shed my habit of writing
fluorine as Fl.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.060
I've now remembered that its
elemental symbol is just F.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.585
So hydrogen fluoride, if it was
in an aqueous solution,

00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:35.860
it'd be hydrofluoric acid.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.420
That's hydrogen here bonding
with fluorine, one of the most

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.980
electronegative atoms. So what's
going to happen here?

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.960
Once again, the reality is that
hydrogen is sharing--

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.550
it's a covalent bond
with fluorine.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.190
But the electron spends most
of its time here, on the

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.630
fluorine atom.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.130
So you're going to have a
partial negative charge here,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.900
and a partial positive.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.240
But we don't like this partial,
halfway game.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.980
We want to say, look.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.020
If this was, hypothetically, an
ionic bond, if one of these

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.300
people have to gain or
lose an electron, how

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.290
would it play out?

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.350
In that situation, this guy
likes to hog electrons more

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.610
than hydrogen does.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.270
So the fluorine would gain an
electron and have an oxidation

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.000
number of minus 1.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.520
And the hydrogen would lose
an electron, and have an

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.950
oxidation number of plus 1.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.480
In this case, hydrogen
has been oxidized.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.140
And notice, there's no
oxygen to be seen.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.620
So the way I think about it,
fluorine did to hydrogen what

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.890
oxygen would have done.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.640
For example.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.540
If I say that you've been
Bernie Madoff'ed.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.250
Bernie Madoff might not be the
actual individual who's taking

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.870
your money and putting it into
a Ponzi scheme, but it would

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.870
mean that someone else is doing
the same thing that

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.240
Bernie Madoff would
have done to you.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.010
So in the same way, even though
there's no oxygen here,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.232
fluorine has oxidized
the hydrogen.

00:08:00.232 --> 00:08:04.160
Now, I'll introduce another
word, and that's reduction.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.310
Reduction is the opposite
of oxidation.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.560
I'll write it in blue.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.573
And this just means a
reduction of charge.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.970
So in this hydrogen fluorine
molecule, or hydrogen fluoride

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.350
molecule, hydrogen has
been oxidized.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.030
It's been oxidized because
electrons have been

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.000
taken away from it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.809
That's what oxygen would
have done to it.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.950
And so it has, now,
a positive charge.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.280
And its oxidation number
is plus 1.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.900
Because exactly one electron
would have been taken away

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.930
from this in a hypothetical
ionic bond.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.750
Now, fluorine has
been reduced.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:03.040
Its oxidation state
was reduced by 1.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.690
If there was no hydrogen
around, it

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.890
would've been neutral.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.050
But now it has a
minus 1 charge.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.110
Because in our hypothetical
world of there's no partial

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.830
charge, it's more
electronegative.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.400
It took the atom from
the hydrogen.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.900
So it has a minus 1 charge.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.280
Its charge has been reduced.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.880
Its oxidation state
has been reduced.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.380
Your oxidation state is just
that hypothetical charge.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.210
And that's how I think of it.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.990
Reduction means reduction in
your hypothetical charge.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.270
Oxidation means, what would
oxygen have done do you?

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.360
Which means it would've taken
away electrons, which would

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.410
mean you have a positive
charge.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.640
But if you look in some
textbooks, or some teachers,

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.890
they'll give you a mnemonic.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.250
Leo the lion says, GER.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.310
I'll say, says, in small,
because it's really irrelevant

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.560
to the mnemonic.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.370
And this is just a way of
remembering that Leo means

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:11.600
Losing Electrons is equal
to Oxidation.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:22.590
And that Gaining Electrons
is equal to Reduction.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.770
Now, to me, when you first said,
oh wait, I'm gaining

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.360
electrons, but I'm
getting reduced.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.200
What's getting reduced?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.000
What's getting reduced is
your charge, because

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.070
electrons are negative.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.030
You're gaining something
with a negative charge.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.380
So that's where the reduction
comes from.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.550
Oxygen comes from the fact that
oxygen will normally make

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.820
you lose electrons.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.230
It will normally take electrons
away from you, even

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.260
though oxygen might
not have anything

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.830
to do with the reaction.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.560
Now, we can look at the periodic
table, and we can

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.290
guess, in most molecules, what
an oxidation state of a given

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.600
atom will be.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.790
All of these guys are
alkali earth metals.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.450
And this is really a review.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.960
It's kind of taught
as something new.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.710
But we know all of these guys.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.920
They love to give up electrons,
because that makes

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.610
them stable.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.560
Because they have this one
electron in their outer shell.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.310
So they tend to have an
oxidation state of plus 1,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.010
which means that they tend
to give away an electron.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.670
For example, if I write
sodium chloride.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.850
In this case, the oxidation
state is truly reflective of

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.480
their charge.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.230
Its charge is equal to
its oxidation state.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.460
It gave away an electron.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.640
And that's true for all of the
alkali metals right here.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.160
Remember, I don't include
hydrogen there.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.810
Because hydrogen is a little
bit of a special case.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.690
It could have been thrown here
on the periodic table.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.000
Because it has one electron in
its outermost shell, which is

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.160
just its only shell.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.870
But it's also happy to get two,
and have a configuration

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.500
like helium.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.460
So you can almost view it
as it's very close to

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.610
completing its shell.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:59.040
So it sometimes has alkali
metal-type properties.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.930
And sometimes it has halogen
properties, where it wants to

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.400
gain electrons.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.510
So hydrogen-- Let's say hydrogen
is bonding with one

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.740
of these guys, right?

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.450
So let's say you had
lithium hydride.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.630
So in this case, lithium,
is right here.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.720
It loves to lose
its electrons.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.770
So it'll lose its electron.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.780
So it'll have an oxidation
state of plus 1.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.070
And it will lose its electron
to hydrogen.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.060
Because hydrogen is more
electronegative than lithium.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.110
Because hydrogen, you give
it 1 electron then it has

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.510
electron configuration
like helium.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.230
So hydrogen will be minus 1.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.610
In this situation, hydrogen
bonds with people roughly on

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.680
the left-hand side of
the periodic table.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.920
So lithium-- just to review
our terminology.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.270
Lithium was oxidized
by the hydrogen.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.050
Hydrogen was reduced
by the lithium.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.790
Its charge went down.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.300
Their oxidation number?

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.310
Plus 1 for the lithium, minus
1 for the hydrogen.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.860
What is the total sum of
an oxidation state

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.730
for a neutral molecule?

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.600
In this case, you add up the
charges and you get, oh, it's

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.210
equal to 0.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.860
And that's a big takeaway.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.680
Then, in general, if you have
a neutral molecule-- let me

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.930
write that down.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.370
I'll just say neutral
compound.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:42.730
Then the oxidation
states add to 0.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.150
And if you have a non-neutral
compound, if you have a plus 1

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.830
charge, the oxidation states
of all of the molecules in

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.830
your compound are going to
add up to your charge.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.050
Well, let me give
another example.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.960
So in this case, I had hydrogen

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.330
bonding with these guys.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.250
In that case, hydrogen is the
one that took the electron.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.530
Let's say I had OH minus.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.430
So hydrogen, in this case,
when it's dealing with

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.230
something that's not on the
left-hand side, when it's

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.640
dealing with a super
electronegative atom,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.780
hydrogen's oxidation
state is plus 1.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.030
Right?

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.660
Now, oxygen's typical oxidation
state, when it bonds

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.530
with almost everything else--
and I'll give a special case

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.770
in a few moments-- is minus 2.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.190
Because it normally takes two
electrons from other things.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.440
We saw that with the water.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.010
Oxygen's oxidation state, in
most cases, is minus 2.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.600
So even though it hasn't gained
two electrons here, we

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.340
would write its oxidation
number as

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.180
minus 2 for the oxygen.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.420
And then you add up the
two oxidation states,

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.930
minus 2 plus 1.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.400
Well, actually I'll
take that back.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.640
Oxygen has gained an extra
electron because this is

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.840
already an ion.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.500
So in this case, this OH, oxygen
has stolen an electron

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.280
from someone else.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.150
Let me draw that.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:23.260
And then oxygen normally only
has 1, 2, 3, 4-- so oxygen has

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.410
completed its valence shell.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.970
So essentially, it took
an extra electron

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.900
from some place else.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.430
So it definitely does have a
minus 2 charge in this case.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.480
Oxygen has a minus 2 charge.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.110
Hydrogen has a plus 1 charge,
because this electron was

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.000
taken from it by the oxygen.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.605
And so the total charge of this
molecule is minus 2 plus

00:15:43.605 --> 00:15:45.480
1, which is minus 1.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.700
And that's why you have a
minus 1 charge on OH.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.000
So you add up the oxidation
states, and you're going to

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.690
get the charge of the
atom under question.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.280
Now, we already saw that most
of these guys have an

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.310
oxidation state of plus 1.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.350
These guys here, the alkaline
earth metals, have an oxygen

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.370
state of plus 2, because they
like to give away two atoms.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.950
We already saw hydrogen.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.680
If they bond with people here,
they take the electrons.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.100
So they get reduced.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.160
So it has an oxidation
state of minus 1.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.570
But if hydrogen bonds with these
guys on the right-hand

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.310
side, it gives away
the electrons.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.350
So it would have an oxidation
state of plus 1.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.280
We saw that with hydrogen
fluoride.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.110
It would be the case
with hydrogen

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.940
chloride, hydrogen bromide.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.280
You saw the case with water.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.020
All of these cases, hydrogen is
the one that's giving away

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.740
the electrons.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.500
So it gets oxidized.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.390
And these guys get reduced, or
their the oxidizing agent.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.990
Now, what about these
guys over here?

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.680
What about our halogens?

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.320
Well, they all like
to take electrons.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.010
So their typical oxidation
state is minus 1.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.170
Oxygen's typical oxidation
state?

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.410
We just saw it's minus 2.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.580
And I'll show you an example,
which is really one of the few

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.100
cases where oxygen
doesn't have a

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.300
minus 2 oxidation state.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.430
And then there's a lot of
these other elements, in

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:06.910
between, that can have multiple

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.270
different oxidation states.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.599
And we'll see that in
a lot of examples.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.060
But if you know that hydrogen
is plus or minus 1, if

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.020
hydrogen is bonding with these
guys, it's a plus 1. it gives

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.180
away electrons.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.480
If it bonds with these
guys, it's a minus 1.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.990
it takes the electrons.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.960
If you know oxygen tends to take
two electrons, so it has

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.780
a minus 2 oxidation state.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.780
And the halogens take one.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.270
If you know that, you can
normally figure out all of the

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.920
other people in the compound.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.390
So what I'll do is I'll leave
you there for now.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.670
I realize I'm running
over time.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.260
In the next video, we're going
to do some maybe more

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.160
difficult examples.
