00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Some things in life are surprising

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.540
But did you know that most alcohol beverages

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.480
contain all 13 minerals necessary to sustain your life?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.760
or that approximately one percent of the world's population

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.620
is drunk at any given moment?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.440
maybe you're one of them.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.480
Or how about the fact that a single sperm has

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.460
has the equivalent of 37.5 megabytes of DNA information in it?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.460
This  means that a normal ejaculation

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.760
acquaints to a data transfer of over 1500 terabytes.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.740
Tell that to an iguana, koala or Komodo dragon

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.820
which all have two penises.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.740
Or better yet, the kangaroo

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.800
which actually has three vaginas.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
The male octopus, on the other hand

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.380
often tears of its mating arm

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.220
places it inside the female

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.620
and then swims off somewhere to die.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.580
How romantic.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.140
The average person walks the equivalent of three times

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.180
around the world in a lifetime.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.800
Meanwhile, if the population of China walk pass you in a single foul line

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.640
it would take about 30 years

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.380
considering the rate of reproduction.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.800
but after only 2 weeks,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.360
a pair of their pants will have grown 1000 bacteria on the front

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.900
2500 on the back, and 10,000 on the crotch.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.500
And did you know that the Apple iPhone is the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.800
second best-selling product of all time,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.080
after the Rubik's cube?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:21.840
which actually has 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible configurations.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.460
Much like a deck of cards, which, when shuffled

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.260
will result in a configuration that has never existed ever before.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.960
How can this be?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.900
The simple mathematical calculation shows that

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.420
the possible arrangements of a deck of cards

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.460
are monumental

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.680
Or how about the fact that

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.640
oxygen is required for combustion

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.840
and hydrogen is flammable gas, but together,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.220
they make water, which puts fire out.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.360
Before the eraser was invented,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.580
bread was used to remove pencil marks,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.780
while peanut butter, under extremely high pressure,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.520
can be turned into diamonds?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.460
That's...one useful sandwich.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.620
And if you feel like a warm cup of coffee with that,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.920
Try yelling for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
which should produce enough sound energy

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.860
to heat your coffee up.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.300
Strange as it may be, the brain actually named itself

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.860
and finally, a physicist studying atoms,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520
is really just atoms trying to understand themselves.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820
Got a burning question you want to answer?

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.040
