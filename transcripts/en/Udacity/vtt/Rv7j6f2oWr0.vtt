00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.510
The Andrew File System was a bold new experiment in the CS department at CMU.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.090
The intent was to enable students across campus, to be able to walk up to any

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.900
workstation on campus, and start using it. All

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.100
the files stored in a central server on

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.190
the local area network. Will be accessible in

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.310
a safe and secure manner from that workstation.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.220
The assumption is that the network itself is untrusted. In this lesson we will

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.360
use, the Andrews system as a case study to see how Private key

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.840
cryptographic infrastructure can be used for the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.920
security and authentication of such a system.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.730
The focus in this lesson is a distributed file system being made available to

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.750
a user community. And the year is circa 1988, and the state

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.630
of the computing at that time looked as follows. Local area network

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.540
and client workstations connecting the servers and the local disk on the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.560
workstation serve as efficient caches of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.120
files that maybe downloaded from the server.
