00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.530
You're right. Its really hard to keep track of where you are.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.830
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And the replication machinery inside

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.470
your cell has an equally difficult time.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.600
It literally slips on these repeat regions,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.260
which can cause deletions or additions of sequence.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.620
&gt;&gt; You know, I think, you're right, I've heard about this

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.070
before. In psychology, there's a disorder where there's repeats in the CAG?

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's called Huntington's Disease.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210
&gt;&gt; Huntington's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.850
affecting the brain, and eventually causing death. Due

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.400
to an abnormal number of repeat regions in

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.860
a gene within your genome specifically the CAG

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.140
repeats. Now a normal person unaffected by Hungtington's,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.850
would have around 25 or possibly fewer CAG

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.030
repeats. But as repeat errors occur, if you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.740
get up to 40 or more CAG repeats,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.790
then you're going to be someone who's affected by Huntington's.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.480
&gt;&gt; So having repeats causes

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.590
slippage in the first place, then having more repeats, will it just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.700
cause more slippage and more likely to pass it down to your children?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.820
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, that's true. And that's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.540
exactly what happened to an individual

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.686
named Katherine Moser whose story was written about in the New York Times.

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:11.360
At age 23 Miss Moser found out well before the onset of Huntington's

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.730
that she had 45 CAG repeats. More than her grandfather had who

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.580
actually died of Huntington's.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.260
&gt;&gt; It's just a really sad story.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.050
&gt;&gt; It's really unfortunate also because there's currently no cure

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.452
for Huntington's. All we can do is treat the symptoms.

00:01:27.452 --> 00:01:29.307
&gt;&gt; I want to ask, would you want to know how many

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:32.249
CAG repeats you had and if you're going to develop Huntington's.
