how supporting the Arts even for these

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
how supporting the Arts even for these
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.539
how supporting the Arts even for these
very small amounts can lead to

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549
very small amounts can lead to
 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.740

University to create the land chair and
 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.030
University to create the land chair and
the lane center I think that the value

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040
the lane center I think that the value
 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.009
the lane center I think that the value
of a scholarship is incredible for the

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019
of a scholarship is incredible for the
 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.420
of a scholarship is incredible for the
confidence that it gives both the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
confidence that it gives both the
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.819

kind of their heart helping students

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519
kind of their heart helping students
 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.979
kind of their heart helping students
they've never met before the trusting

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989
they've never met before the trusting

seeing you to give these scholarships to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
seeing you to give these scholarships to
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.690
seeing you to give these scholarships to
who they feel best fit for them and just

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700
who they feel best fit for them and just
 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.660
who they feel best fit for them and just
going it just doing it that's so cool

these these years are up but I would
 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.550
these these years are up but I would
just say thank you and shake his or her

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560
just say thank you and shake his or her
 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.250
just say thank you and shake his or her
hand and smile maybe even give him a hug

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260
hand and smile maybe even give him a hug
 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.669
