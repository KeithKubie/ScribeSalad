TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.750
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.200
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.260
Subscribe to stay in the know.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.485
The Android N APIs are final.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:13.860
It's time to get
your apps ready.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.750
So if you haven't already,
download the final SDK

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.210
for Android N through the SDK
Manager in Android Studio.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.040
Also, you can now
publish updates

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.830
compiling with and
optionally targeting API 24

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.210
to Google Play, which
means you can start testing

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.860
your app on the
alpha/beta, or even

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.970
production, channels with the
Google Play Developer console.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.330
Hit up the post
for all the links.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.200
One year ago, we added
Android Security Rewards

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.730
to the longstanding Google
Vulnerability Rewards Program.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.100
Since then, we've paid
over half a million dollars

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.710
to 82 researchers.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.590
And you know what?

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.130
For reports filed after June
1, we're starting to pay more.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.530
The post has all the details.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.290
Have you ever wanted your own
scalable location analysis

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.040
platform?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.440
Well, check out the post for a
full tutorial and docker images

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.690
for one built with the Google
Cloud Platform and Google Maps

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.940
APIs.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.970
The GCloud tool is your
gateway to manage and interact

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.740
with the Google Cloud Platform
from the command line.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.240
Check out the post
for some details,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.430
including a demonstration
of filters, formatting,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.770
and projections.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.220
At Google I/O 2016, we launched
a new Google Sheets API.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.670
The update includes
new features,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.050
including access
to functionality

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.360
found in the Sheets desktop,
and mobile user interfaces.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.880

introduction and some code.

Within one month of implementing
AdMob native ads, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.360
saw its total revenue
increase by 10%.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.650
From just one native ad
slot, they earned over $4,000

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.790
in a single day.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.100
