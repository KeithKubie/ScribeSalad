00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.280
Wow, dude. Did you just eat that for real? You know what?

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.480
What's up guys welcome back. I'm here with another giant of a man, Mr. Logan Paul!

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.900
Logan [oh] that is me. What is up? Yo this guy's crazy, bro! So, today we got the world's largest gummy worm

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.060
We're bringing back liquid nitrogen, and we have a blowtorch what's going on what I mean, this is it. This is literally

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.879
What's going on right now? This is the world's largest gummy worm that's what they say is that a fact let's check it out

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.050
Okay, so it's definitely big

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.260
I don't know if it's the world's largest

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.809
But like it's a commendable side you know considering they tell these things in bulk

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.509
I imagine there's multiple largest yeah, gummy worms

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.590
But this is one of the one of the world's largest gummy worms so to start off

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.569
We're gonna start off small. We got this bag of gummy worms here in the mood for gum where I actually am okay

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.190
I want to eat them. We're going to bust those out

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.489
I got a little container here that we're gonna play around with as well, and then we're going to move up

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.049
We're just going to answer the question what happens if you blow torch the world's largest gummy worm and drip it into liquid nitrogen

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.299
This is going to be sick. We're using a styrofoam container here styrofoam

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.680
Have some pretty good insulating properties, and we don't want to wreck your table however. We did go out

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.680
We took your ramp to your love stacks

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.438
Okay, so we've got  that kind of the base to protect everything. It's true

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.749
And we got this huge 35 layer dewar of liquid nitrogen, and we need to transfer into this this is no joke

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.989
This is no joke bro. Like I'm a big [bot]. [I] work out and this is every

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.720
yeah, you yeah, yeah, [just]

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.439
[rip] this thing open. I'll do it get down to that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.039
Oh [what] [I'm] going to do is smell it for me smell it yeah smell it for me

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.280
[how's] [off-duty] one bite? I do want to my lodge for this dig in savage?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.829
This is built boob strikes around. I I'll see you later and a half always go okay. Now. I'm just kidding

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.788
I wouldn't do that to you bro. Let's go ahead and grab the doer of liquid nitrogen. Let's fill up the styrofoam

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.879
Are you saying doer [I'm] saying doer yes like a sewer?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.090
Bew

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.689
Ar you are to learn more and more every day because it's basically just a glorified thermos which we have one of those [well]

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.670
We're going to load this thing up with liquid nitrogen

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.890
We're going to basically create it with the nitrogen bath

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.330
Okay, fire up the [blowtorch] and figure out where to go from there alright pretty much it alright, Mr.. Logan Paul

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
I'll go do the honors. Yeah, oh

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.569
oh

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.569
There we go. Yeah

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.269
very nice

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.810
Very nice the good work out g on the burn you have a lumpy on the burn. That's good. Yeah, you'd

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.360
That right there my friends is a lot of liquid nitrogen. Yeah, it's like a hundred bucks

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.849
What happens when you put a hundred dollar bill in a hundred dollars worth of Liquid nitrogen?

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.319
It floats for a second and then any things I do a lot of you just what [happen]?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.079
Oh wow cold hard cats literally cold hard cash

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.209
So we just figured [out] the coolest trick. You know how this nitrogen vapor rest on the top

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.209
It will react to sound check it out

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.549
What you trying to [cuz] I don't got it was pretty cool. I would go to admit that was a dumb [thing]

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.009
Okay, so liquid nitrogen has been transferred we have our bag of gummy bears who's going to take this little glass

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.599
We're going to dip it in there grab a little nitrogen in the glass first of all at risk of breaking it Keith. Yeah

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.939
And I think we're gonna start adjusting this first, okay? I'm open up

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.910
Look at the way that it jumped, whoa

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.209
That's sick. It's a fireworks show call me Katie bear

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.589
What is it the fourth of July is the snow amazing you know oh yeah? I'm like a catholic. You know be cool

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.209
Yeah, let's go ahead and drop one in let's just see how quickly it freezes up so first one's been dropped

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.239
Let's give it. [just] like [10] seconds. It doesn't need a lot [of] time, right?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.050
Now if you're brave enough [its] reach in there scoop it out like sorry, babe

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.079
I'm a Maverick not very fit. Nope wow check it out check it out. It's even cracked down the bottom right

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.110
This is this was even crash

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.409
That was a gummy worm and it's frozen solid was that 10 seconds. Yeah, easy. Yeah, that could be your finger

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.299
I was little bit nervous about you. Having your finger in there that long

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.269
[oh] really. Well do did you just eat that for real you know what?

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.819
Okay, cool, right, it's so dense

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.139
I've always been nervous about eating something like that was it like gumming up on your teeth and [layer] on the enamel

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.869
This is good crazy. All right. Let's start. We go open a business [logan's] just brought in our quality control specialist

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.590
Yeah, his name is Colin. He was exactly what it's doing. They're going to see what he thinks of them over here

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.590
Let's [-] Come look at clot we think

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.750
We think [we] can [lovely] [we'll] bring a little more love

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.930
Okay, you can hear them cracking popping

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.820
It's really interesting

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.820
They've actually like self-sabotage and broken themselves in the little pizza since logan's tried one of these I guess you guys I'm obligated

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.799
It's the literature into legitimately hard candy. Yeah, it's go, right

Yeah

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.140
so

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.140
Okay, cool. That's good. Oh

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.719
Look at the way that that [just] flattened down once the air hit the cold it looks really cool

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.569
Are you feeling strong? Yeah? I feel strong, but I think and I [want] to see you take them to snap an apple

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.580
I want to do that. Oh

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.109
a like break down the spine

Hmm

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.509
Whoa and still gummy on the inside yo hard on the outside stuff and squishy on the inside. Yo, this is crazy

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.780
There it is

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:19.069
Buggy [all] right that's for you. Thanks, man. I appreciate that please enjoy responsibly and I'm going to give Mr.. Logan the blowtorch here

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.680
Cool press the yellow button to activate

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.620
And I think we're just going [to] warm this up until it gets syrupy enough to drip straight down there, okay, okay?

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.690
Whoa, you think Maverick? I believe so bro

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.009

Well look at it. Look at [it]. You know like marshmallows when you put them in a fire. Oh

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.270
It's just shit. Oh what our gummy [worm] just shed look at that. Yo the skin just came off look at that

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.770
We called that twice-baked where I grew up because you can bake it once and then you bake it twice

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.970
like

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.890
Bubbles instantly on contact [oh] good night blows Bob. Come [boop] there we go

It's like our prince rupert gummy. Drop. What if we can keep that strand going like can it just be one continuous long gummy stream?

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.710
I

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.829
Got so while we got this stuff cooking up here in the liquid-nitrogen. We're going to throw this in the microwave and melt it down

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:47.270
Here we go

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.780
What would you say How long? Three minutes?

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.690

Yo, this is go. Look good. [oh] wow it's cool. Right? It's multicolored. I thought it was burnt, but that's the blue side yeah

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:14.978
So we're gonna. Do now is hold it up close to the ceiling

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.959
We're going to drop it [down] and maybe even jiggle it. So we want to get this kind of you got this bro

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.079
I'm gonna mess up your youtube video. I don't want to do that like you

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:29.859
What's gonna happen don't miss Gomez come insert a little bit lower, and I'll work my way up because this is a little sketchy

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.610
Okay

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.209
schedule five of the love doing oh

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.409
oh

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.000
oh

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.380
It's like [you're] pooping. It's like poops little poop

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:45.399
whoa

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.919
It's raining melted gummy worms

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.630
Look at the way the colors are splitting you set the red and the blue are still ready together there

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.919
It actually looks really neat you know there's a lot of stuff going down right now

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:04.630
Like here isn't going [down]. This is dripping is landing. I got liquid nitrogen literally running all [over] my apartment

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.539
[what] is happening? How is it happening?

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.670
Where did you come from?

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.670
[we're] never met before

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.689
This is crazy. Thanks for letting me come in destroy your house, bro. I'm into it

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:23.289
You chose the right half to destroy my boy all right. I'm going to call that good things are just settled down here

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.490
You can actually see down into the pool of nitrogen now. What do you see? It looks like it formed like a little volcano

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:34.179
Island this is really cool. Maybe how volcanoes should be formed out of coming so you can actually feels like intermixed

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.160
There's blue red, and it's kind of like really sporadic

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.990
Yeah, I'm thinking we reach down there grab that by the [tip] yep pull that whole [eye] for a greater. Good yep, yep

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:48.099
Second [oh] riddle songs are going to make a difference because actually these pizzas have frozen so quickly

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.180
They're not joined together, so I'm just going [to] reach in there with a scoop you're going to do it

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.180
I think we're just out of it. Yeah here we go

00:09:54.949 --> 00:10:00.459
My whole life is built up to this moment. This is a moment. This is why you were born [oh], yeah

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:08.259
Look at that what oh wow looks like rocks dude like granite almost. They're popping like Pop rocks look at that

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.269
Look at that. Look like [nerds]. You know that were there. Yeah

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.040
I'm popping you know what they look like. It's like dippin dots, bro

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:24.879
Yeah, like a little those little ice cream balls nitrogen discs gummy dots. Which are one yeah, all right bon appetit

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.790
I

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:31.839
Got the nose, okay?

00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:40.329
Grand Finale Logan is Gonna take the whole bag of gummy worms and dump all at once. It's true. I'm gonna do that

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.500
[any] good everywhere. [oh] [never] what yeah?

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.519
Bonus experiment someone asked what a blowtorch would do to liquid nitrogen

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.870
Doesn't do anything

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.500
absolutely nothing yeah, oh

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:05.549
That's pretty yeah

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.529
All these are just so brittle as crap

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.359
You can literally like rub them between your fingers and [fur] number powder you ever had powdered gummy [worms]

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:21.989
So there you have a guys that's what happens when you take a [blowtorch] to the world's largest gummy worm in a vat of liquid

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.259
Nitrogen huge thanks to Logan Paul for helped me out this experiment

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:30.839
You can check him out the link in the description below he posts daily vlogs they easily row with Kong Maverick

00:11:30.939 --> 00:11:32.939
